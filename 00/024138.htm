<h2>            Fillable pdfs from Access database</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I am very new to databases but need quick results. I have created a report that provides the information I have for each client and leaves blank fields I need them to fill out. I have two problems:</p>
<p>1. although I see no page break in my form, the records are split on two pages.</p>
<p>2. I do not know if it is possible to create fillable pdfs I can send to my clients to get the additional information I need.</p>
<p>Can anyone help with this or suggest a better way to get my data?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>Switchboard problems&#58; Works when open from the Navigation Pane, - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Switchboard problems&#58; Works when open from the Navigation Pane, but won&#39;t when open at DB open</h2>
                    <p>I am using Access 2007, on Vista Enterprise.&nbsp; I have a switchboard created that runs fine when i open the form directly by clicking on it from the navigation pane.&nbsp; It shows all the menu items as intended, and the menu options also work as planned.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
 switchboard is&nbsp;heavily customized from the default solution provided using&nbsp;the Switchboard Manager.&nbsp; The form and table name that were&nbsp;automatically created by Access were left alone, but&nbsp;the form's design&nbsp;has been heavily customized and the table's contents
 have had a signficant (?) number of entries manually added.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have the database set to open the switchboard form by default (Office button, Access Options, Current Database, select "Switchboard" from Display Form drop-down).&nbsp; However, when I open the database, my switchboard form is empty with no menu options available.&nbsp;
 But if I close the switchboard form and open the form by clicking it from the navigation pane, the switchboard functions as designed/intended.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the switchboard first opens (empty, as described) and right click the form and select Design view, and then select the Form view (without utilizing the Navigation pane), the switchboard does not work.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas what might be happening and how to remedy?&nbsp; This is expected to be a multi-user, deployed solution to several users, so ultimately I need to set the thing up so that everything happens from within the switchboard.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Chris</p>

            <p>It sounds like the form might be corrupt. When you say 'form's design&nbsp;has been heavily customized' there is a good chance it is badly fragmented.</p>
<p>A quick way to find out would be to import everything&nbsp;into a new database and see if it works.

<h2>            IP address blocked by Outlook</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Our ip used for sending mail has been blocked by Outlook.com and I have been following the advice given on the postmaster.live.com to get this unblocked with no success.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>http://support.msn.com/eform.aspx?productKey=edfsmsbl&amp;page=support_home_options_form_bye-mail&amp;ct=eformts</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have filled out the form above around 4 times now. &nbsp;Each time with more info added to the form and having signed up to more of the anti spam initiatives. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have identified in my SMTP logs the messages that I believe got us flagged as namespace mining and attached them to the form. &nbsp;I don't know what else to do now. &nbsp;I am out of ideas. &nbsp;I am standing by ready to change our external ip to a different one to get
 round this but I'd much rather just get this one unblocked. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there anything else I can do to speed this process along. &nbsp;Could I speak to a human being on the phone so that they can guide me through giving them the best information to expedite this matter?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Regards,</div>
<div>Haydn</div>

<h3> rmichaelmaguire  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook duplicates emails AND auto-categorizes dupes&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I know there have been a lot of posts about the issue of duplicating emails from POP3 accts, but mine seems to have a slight twist to it:</p>
<p>In addition to getting duplicate emails from my old POP3 acct, Outlook is automatically adding a category to them with the label name of the email address.</p>
<p>Background: Like everyone else, I started getting dupe emails some weeks back after an 'upgrade'. Back then, I had two email accounts loaded in Outlook - one was my Outlook.com acct running off the Exchange Server and the other was an old POP3 acct, now
 run my Yahoo. In researching online, I thought perhaps a simpler solution to the things that have so far been suggested in other threads (especially since my prob wasn't exactly the same) would be to just delete the POP3 acct from Outlook altogether and instead
 use the auto-forward function in Yahoo to just send those emails to my Gmail acct which also just forwards everything now to my Outlook.com acct. Whelp...it was nice try!</p>
<p>What I end up with now, is that the initial copy of an email is correctly processed by any applicable rules, but then a dupe copy also appears, auto-categorized by Outlook (I didn't create that category), marked as read, but these do not get processed by
 any rules; they just sit in the Inbox. Yes, I can manually run rules, but of course all I really want is to not have them in the first place!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Screenshot follows with some more details below:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e15d3009-5694-4572-bf52-8bbdf980bc13" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e15d3009-5694-4572-bf52-8bbdf980bc13" /></a></p>
<p>NB: This doesn't affect the Gmail emails, which is why I thought routing the POP3 stuff through there would fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Outlook (Office365, Home) in only Exchange mode off my outlook.com acct. On my Surface Pro3 I have Win10 and on this desktop Win7 Pro</p>

            For anyone else - the answer came from Tech Support. Even though I had deleted the old POP3 acct from Outlook, it was still connected in Outlook.com. Deleting/removing it there was the fix. Look under Settings (the cog icon on top-right) and click on connected
 accounts. Remember though, that you'll still have to auto-forward that account's emails to whatever email account remains active in Outlook if you still want to receive those emails in Outlook.

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I am trying to transpose a large amount of rows into columns. There are about 650 rows. &nbsp;Working with Office 2003, I know that excel has a limit of 256 columns, but do the newer versions have a larger limit? Or is there some other way to do this?</p>

#1 WE don't know what futile attempts you have made. You have to TELL US what you have done, what the FULL and EXACT error messages are if any<br />
<br />
#2 "<i>It's broke ... </i>", MS hasn't told us what is broke, sorry.<br />

#3 "Why?" .. "BECAUSE".&nbsp; Because it is a MS product and they say so! (sounds like a conversation with a 2 year old &lt;sigh&gt;)<br />

            Oh, I am definitely mocking and baiting MS!&nbsp; (not you, sorry you took it that way).<br />
<br />
The problems are the reason I am mocking MS.&nbsp; This has been going on since the day 365 was released. Personally I have great sympathy for your problems. I am frustrated seeing all of these questions I should be able to help with, but can't because they are
 "unsolvable". <br />
<br />
For months now I have been advising people with this sort of installation problem to return it and DEMAND a FULL refund. Make it clear why.&nbsp; It seems the only thing MS reacts to is drops in profits.&nbsp; Buy a copy of 2010 or use one of the freeware alternatives
 until MS fixes 365 and publicly acknowledges the problem.

            Thanks. Eventually I took it back to the retailer (Argos) for a refund and they called MS who provided a number to call. Several calls later lasting a very long time the software was eventually downloaded by an MS technician in India installing it on my
 laptop using discs and via log me in. All attempts to download over the internet directly failed, even MS tech support couldn't get it to work! &nbsp;Have requested MS reimburse me for my wasted time.......

            Hi Chris,<br />
<br />
<br />
The answer is No, and that does not mean Office 365 is your Domain Registrar.&nbsp; The one you have already signed up and registered with is your Domain Registrar. And you need to monitor your domain with the Domain Registrar.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<h2>            Moving Office for Mac 2008 to a new computer</h2>
                    I recently purchased a new MacBook Pro. I had Office for Mac 2008 installed on my previous machine. All of the files were copied to the new computer, but I am unable to run the software. I purchased on-lin so I don't have a CD-ROM to use for a fresh install.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I try to start any of the elements of Office (Word, Excel, etc.) I get to an updates screen that tells me that Office 2008 12.3.6 update is available. I have downloaded the update, but it won't install, saying that a version of the software required
 to install the update was not found on the computer.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How can I get past this impasse?</div>

You can order replacement media from Microsoft.<br />

<p>The N79 should, by default, use the internal memory to store messages. Is it possible that you have messages on your SIM card and that the SIM card memory for messages is full?</p>

<h2>            Unable to stop Outlook sorting email into folders</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some time ago I set up rules to send emails from some senders into folders automatically, and I now want to stop doing this as they don't show up on&nbsp;my blackberry, which just shows inbox items.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have deleted all the rules from outlook on both my computers</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have opened outlook using the command line switches /cleanclientrules&nbsp; /cleanrules&nbsp; /cleanserverrules</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite these actions the emails still get automatically sorted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any further suggestions would be most appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Class Notebook Student Sections</h2>
                    <p>Today when a teacher used the Class Notebook add in within OneNote 2016 to add a new student, all the other students disappeared from the OneNote. Only the new one remains. Now, in trying to "undo" the situation, even when removing the new student, she still
 remains.</p>
<p>When checking permissions to this OneNote, all the original students are listed. How can I help get those student private sections back?</p>

<p>Hi Maureen,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An outdated Office program can sometimes cause features or add-ins to stop working properly. To address your concern, we suggest that you install an Office update for isolation purposes. Once the program is updated, check if the add-in is now working. Follow
 the procedures found on this <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Install-Office-updates-2ab296f3-7f03-43a2-8e50-46de917611c5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> on how to install Office Updates. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the event that the issue still persists, we recommend checking this <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Troubleshoot-Class-Notebook-a9b5f75a-08a6-466f-aaf3-4ce2fc9d61af?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a>. It discusses most of the common issues and suggests fixes with Class Notebook concern. If itâ€™s still doesnâ€™t work, then we suggest that you perform an online repair for your Office program by right-clicking the
<strong>Start</strong> menu &gt; select <strong>Apps and Features</strong> or <strong>
Programs and Features</strong> &gt; right-click <strong>Microsoft Office 2016</strong> &gt;
<strong>Change</strong> &gt; <strong>Online Repair</strong> &gt; <strong>Repair</strong>. Follow the instructions that will be prompted on your screen to complete the repair. Once itâ€™s done, check if the issue was resolved.

 errors and programs were still not working s,o I downloaded the iso image and reinstalled windows from a jump drive that I loaded the image on.&nbsp; After a fresh install of windows 10 sfc/scannow returns "windows resource protection could not perform the requested

<h3> mattreed_pa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Access 2010 linked SharePoint 2010 list - Lookup column throwing &#34;Cannot update. Database or object is read-only.&#34;</h2>
                    I'm at a total loss here...
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a SharePoint contact list linked in Access. The list contains a Site Column, which is based on a lookup from a list at an upper-level site in the Site Collection hierarchy. Permissions are set properly across the board - regardless, I'm Owner on
 everything, and I'm having the problem.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If I remove the Site Column from the list, i have no problem updating records.</div>
<div>If I add the site column back in with no values, I can edit any column in the list, except the Site Column (which throws the error).</div>
<div>If I add the site column and add values into it via SharePoint site, I cannot make any changes to any columns in the record, or else it throws the error - unless the change that I make is to remove the value from the site column field; it will accept that
 change.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have no problems making changes in the browser (SharePoint GUI).</div>
<div>I can make changes (in Access) to the list that is the source of the site column.</div>
<div>I can make changes to other lists on the same site that do not use the site column.</div>
<div>I have the same problem with other lists on the site that DO use the site column.</div>
<div>The site column is not based on a required field.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am using Office 2010 SP1 and SharePoint 2010. I am a Site Collection Admin, but not a Farm Admin.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I swear this used to work, but now it doesn't. There must be some switch somewhere, or something, because I can't find too many people with the same problem by searching the web. When I do find someone with the same problem, it either turns out to be something
 slightly different, or it isn't answered. I actually even found one reply showing everything working properly (although I'm not sure that his lookup was a site column based on lookup).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Regardless, i don't think what I'm trying to do is unique; I'm trying to use these site columns and lookups, etc. I thought that's what they were for.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I could really use some help to figure out what I'm missing...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>
<div><br />

 problem. I was not able to update an "Attachment" field of a linked SharePoint List via MS Access Form, but all other fields, I could update/change just fine. It took me two weeks to figure out what the problem was. In File =&gt; Options =&gt; Current Database =&gt;
 Caching Web Service and SharePoint tables, I had to uncheck "Use the cache format that is compatible with Microsoft Access 2010 and later." This solved my problem. Hope this helps you out as well.</span><br />

            Hi mate,<br />
<br />
have you tried re-installing the current firmware through Nokia Suite? if that doesn't work, then try to Restore the phone to factory settings. Failing that, you will need to take your phone to your local Nokia Care for them to inspect:

<h2>            IE 11 &#40;win10&#41; crashes when closing after viewing visio file</h2>
                    <p>Hi Folks</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Windows 10 (1607) with IE 11.187.14393.0, both 64-bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I open a Visio file created with&nbsp;Visio 2016 (16.0.4366.1000) 64-bit, also on Windows 10 (1511), and allow blocked content, then IE11 shows the file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, upon <em>closing</em> IE I see the error message: "Internet Explorer has stopped working, windows is checking for a solution to the problem"</p>
<p>
</p><p>This does not happen if I open IE and do not open the Visio file.</p>
<p>It does happen both when either opening IE by clicking on the Visio file, or by clicking on the Visio file when IE is already open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a solution or update to apply to resolve this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks, T</p>

<h3> jcw2  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Send&#47;Receive all Folders &#40;F9&#41;&#34; Function Appears Broken in Outlook 2013 -- Moved from Earlier &#34;Discussion&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Background:&nbsp; I'm using only four POP3 Internet mail accounts -- no IMAP or Exchange server -- in Outlook 2013 under 64-bit Windows 7 SP1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've set up two send/receive groups (in addition to the unwanted but apparently obligatory "All Accounts" group -- call it Group A).&nbsp; Group B sends and receives Accounts 1, 2, and 3 and is the **only** group of the three that is checked to "Include this
 group in send/receive (F9)," both on and off line.&nbsp; Group C only sends Account 4.&nbsp; ("Schedule an automatic send/receive every xx minutes" is unchecked in all three cases and "Disable Scheduled Send/Receive" under Send/Receive&gt;Send/Receive Groups is checked.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem:&nbsp; When I click the "Send/Receive All Folders (F9)" button on the ribbon, mail from Account 4 gets sent along with send/receive the others.&nbsp; Things were even worse before I unchecked all four accounts in Group A (which should not have been invoked
 at all), since then I also received mail from Account 4 (unchecked in Group C) with every F9.&nbsp; This is annoying, since it means I often have to go into Send/Receive&gt;Send/Receive Groups and select only Group B when I just want to check for incoming mail on
 my main three accounts.&nbsp; I've found some work-arounds, but none is satisfying.&nbsp; Doesn't this annoy anyone else?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears (1) that there is no way to turn off the hated "All Accounts" Group **and** (2) that there is no way to control the "Send/Receive All Folders (F9)" function (in spite of appearances).&nbsp; Is this a bug we just have to live with, or is there something
 I'm missing? -- JCW2</p>

</p><p>Dear Mr. Jackson -- This is the second time you have "answered" one of my questions with another question, requesting significant effort on my part without giving me any clue as to what your test might reveal that is not already stated in my OP.&nbsp; So let
 me ask you a question (assuming you are running Outlook 2013 on your machine):<br />
<br />
Does "Send/Receive all Folders (F9)" work the way it is advertised with respect to "Include this group in send/receive (F9)," or do you have the same problems I have described in my OP?</p>
<p>

I use Outlook 2007. &nbsp;I have used f9 to send-receive email but it stopped working. &nbsp;I have a Logitech keyboard and found a "F Mode key" &nbsp;It cycles between "enhanced F keys" and "standard F keys:" &nbsp;You need to select "standard" . This solved my problem. &nbsp;Maybe
 you have had similar replies.

<p>When it comes to your themes: Where did you get the from? I did not get that, yet.</p>
<p>When it comes 3rd party apps, to double-check the cause, we need one example app and the error message word for word. The answer is not that simple without more information because your phones supports J2ME (MIDP/CLDC) applications. However, for best performance
 they should have been tested for the operating system Nokia Series 40 and offer 320â€¯Ã—â€¯240 pixel screen support.</p>

            Hi,am from Kenya and my service provider is Safaricom.The themes i got them from the nokia store app,an example is obuntu pink,when you try to appy it it says copyright protected,when it comes to apps and games,for example i remember downloading asphalt
 6 from apps.opera.com,the installation is successiful,when you open the app it closes immeaditily...opening app then you see closing app,i also tried uc browser 9.5 from ucweb.com,since the one in the nokia store is version 9.4,the same errors were observed,there
 is one social app i downloaded from the nokia store app but it required to get updated from its homepage,once i updated it couldnt open anymore.The thing is only apps from the nokia store will work,come on nokia,there are apps i want to use but cant find them
 on nokia store,like from opera store games like asphalt are completely free while at your store you have like 1 min trial for games like asphalt,need for speed,fifa etc while i can get them for free from elsewhere.<br />
And as a matter of fact most sites where i download the apps and games auto-detect my device meaning they are supported.<br />
As for the mail app am not very sure coz my friend using asha 200 uses the servive,though i didnt try communities.<br />
Am concerned a lot with sownloading third party apps and games.<br />
Hope am understood,thanks

<p>The Mail app got updated on Nokia Series 40 based phones introduced 2012 or later, or to be more precise: The Mail app does not use a proxy based anymore, if there was an update in mid 2013. I am not aware of any such update for the Nokia C3-00. However,
 I am surprised the Nokia 200 got <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/Thread/7A68B245-F7A5-4A4C-AD95-E8E52FCA2988">
that update</a>. Could you please double-check with your friend? Anyway, please, post your E-mail service provider(s) and we look into alternatives for you.</p>

<p>I am an end-user like you. However, the Java engine in Nokia Series 40 phones was buggy to an extend which lead to the extinction of the Nokia Series 40 platform as a whole. Furthermore, because the Nokia C3-00 has a screen-orientation for which Nokia did
 not offer an emulator, and because that screen-oriantation came rather late, a lot of apps
<em>could</em> be compatible but are not in reality. And many of that auto-detection webpages did not test but made a guess.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, the described symptoms do not sound normal. As I am an end-user, and because I do not have a Nokia C3-00 handy right now, I cannot test that theme. Did you go for the
<a href="http://download-fds.webapps.microsoft.com/supportFiles/phones/files/recovery/LumiaSoftwareRecoveryToolInstaller.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Software Recovery Tool</a> via a Windows computer and a Micro-USB cable already? Any issues with that tool? Although the name suggest different, it has to work with a Nokia C3-00 as well. When you dial *#0010#, please, we need the first two rows.</p>

            <p>Microsoft made major changes to Hotmail affecting millions of users but has provided little documentation on how the new Outlook.com works and provided even less online support for questions. I have been waiting days for replies/answers to my questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe the following suggestions will help you:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had a similar problem with a contact being blocked in the outlook.com web chat interface.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have access to Windows Live Messenger 2012 on your computer first logoff from outlook.com. Then logon to WLM 2012 and right-click on the contract that is blocked. If the contact is marked as invisible (meaning you are invisible to them) then make
 yourself available to them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Logon to outlook.com.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the contact is still blocked then click on your name in the upper right and click "Edit profiles" to display your profile page. Then click on the gear in the upper right corner and click on "Manage access". If the contact is in the limited access list
 (on the right) then remove them. This will cause the contact to be blocked. Save the change and logoff from outlook.com. Wait a short while and logon to outlook.com. Hopefully the contact will no longer be blocked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If none of the above work or don't apply, I had success doing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add the contact to the Limited access list using the steps above to acces the Limited access list.
</li><li>Sign-off outlook.com and wait a short while. </li><li>Logon to outlook.com and remove the contact from the Limited access list. </li><li>Sign-off outlook.com and wait a short while. </li><li>Logon to outlook.com and hopefully the contact will be unblocked.</li></ul>

<p>I created a post in this forun with the following excerpt:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>There seems to be an incompatibility with WLM 2012 client and outlook.com web messenger. If you use WLM 2012 and mark a contact as "invisible" (which means block them) it does not add the contact to the limited access list. When you logon to the web
 and use outlook.com web messenger then the contact is blocked but there is no obvious way to remove the block since the contact is NOT in the limited access list.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>I found the only way to resolve this via the outlook.com web interface is to add the contact to the limited access list, sign-off, sign-on, and then remove the contact from the limited access list. Then sign-off and sign-on and the block is removed.
 Obviously WLM 2012 is using the older method of marking a contact blocked which is not totally compatible with the new outlook.com web interface.</em></p>
