<h2>            Word numbering format. Once max number is reached, start over.</h2>
                    <p>IS there a way to take a large number list, say that goes from 1 to 10,000. and have it converted from 1 to 3, once it hits #4, start over at 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Would be nice if I didn't have to manually do it or set the number value over every few lines.</p>

<div><br />
<div>Thank you for posting. May I know whether you have checked your 3rd party application supports TLS version?</div>
<div><br />
<div>SMTP client submission require your application/device to support TLS. You may contact your application provider to confirm that it supports TLS version 1.0 or above.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Moreover, please refer to article to check whether any other relay option can meet and support your 3rd party application. See

<h2>            How to install Skype for Desktop on Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm trying to install Skype for Desktop on Windows 10, but it keeps telling me to use Store version instead. Windows Store version of Skype is absolute rubbish and my family members have asked me (separately!) to install classic Skype.</p>
<p>How do I go around this?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>That's exactly what I was trying to avoid. But I figured it out! For the people wondering, you just have to run installer in compatibility mode with Windows 8 and it installs and works flawlessly.</p>
<p>To run the installer in compatibility mode you have to right click on it, select Properties, Compatibility and select Windows 8 from the drop-down.</p>

    <title>Windows Live sign-in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> karkaran117  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Live sign-in</h2>
                    <p>The most annoying aspect of Windows 8.1 was the forcing of a Microsoft Account down our throats. The issue is still present in Windows 10, and still extremely frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the problems with this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. It is specifically designed to make users think they have to have a Microsoft Account</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is just shady. On the installation screen you are given two options: Login, and sign up. How are people supposed to know that clicking on 'sign up' will create a tiny link at the bottom with the option to use a normal account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. You can't just say 'no' and be left alone</p>
<p>
</p><p>Opening certain metro apps causes our computer to 'upgrade' to a Live Account, and you need a Live account in order to open a lot of metro apps. This is Windows, and of it's competitors (MACOS and Linux distros) no other OS makes you create an account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. It makes users use other computers to finish their setup</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is an inconvenience. We can't install the proper WiFi drivers until setup is complete, and if you have an existing account you have to try and find it. Let's face it, most people don't use that account for anything, and they don't use LastPass either,
 so finding the account and resetting the password becomes part of the installation, especially for older users. Windows setup is usually quite easily. A monkey could install Windows 7, now the installation is a pain in the butt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. There are no real benefits to making a live account</p>
<p>
</p><p>Desktop and Laptop users have no reason to install metro apps. The windows don't behave the way you would expect, the UI is typically garbage (i.e.: the video app. It doesn't have a seperate volume control, the fullscreen button is not in an intuitive location,
 and the fullscreen mode very often doesn't cover the taskbar). I cannot think of any demographic that would actually use metro apps on a laptop or desktop, even people on the Surface Pro only seem to use proper programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And there. That's my gripe for the day. Microsoft will never get users to stop using old versions (like Win7 and even WinXP) if they add features that annoy and inconvenience people. Between that and the ludicrous price for upgrading, many shops and users
 are still going to use Windows 7.<br />

            <p>Its a give an take situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Curated app stores whether its Google Play Store, Apple App Store (iOS/OS X), Windows Store all require credentials to download applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if its outside of a Store and you are purchasing online from amazon.com, some form of credentials are provided.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do agree that it could be more prominent during the Out of Box Experience to choose a Local Account. I personally use a Local Account because of my metered Internet. I also use services like OneDrive, which I prefer to access through the Web browser and
 sync files on my own terms. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if you don't have an active Internet Connection, its not required to log into Windows or use the operating system, but makes it more seamless for what todays modern operating environments require. Chrome OS requires, OS X requires, whether it is to
 sync with their own Cloud Services, Google Drive or iCloud respectively. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not a unique thing to Windows, you are not gonna escape it on OS or Chrome OS or even popular distributions like Ubuntu Linux. Going even into their direction will simply be going into isolation, since you are not achieving the benefit of it not
 being 'Windows'. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I honestly can't provide an answer that is the best common ground. Since you know the Local Account option is slightly hidden during OOBE, just remember it when setting up Windows 10/8.1 on a PC or switch to a Local account after installation is complete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally, there are benefits. A few months ago, I was abroad came back home, started my PC and the next day it wouldn't start again. This was a Windows 7 PC with all my personalized settings setup the way I like. Of course, I was devastated when I found
 out the SSD had died. Lucky thing before I left, I had at backed up the User folders.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My previous job, I had used Windows 8.1 with Update 1 and had PC Syncing enabled with all my bookmarks and personalized settings. So you know what I did when I installed Windows 10? I just logged in with my Hotmail account and synced all my personalized
 settings from that Windows 8.1 with Update PC since I pretty much had pretty much personalized the same way as my Windows 7 home PC.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was such a breeze, wallpaper, Favorites bar in IE, my OneDrive synced with all my files, my apps were waiting for me to be reinstalled or I could just reinstall on a case by case basis.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Honestly, it took the chore out of setting up Windows. I remember the days of Windows XP; an all day affair with driver hunting, configuring, restarting, updating, restarting, restarting.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Certainly with Windows 7, a post SP1 update is nearly 1000 MBs of updates to download since its 3 years ago. Windows 10, not much really, Windows 8.1 with Update 1, about 50 updates to download, So, I think, instead of closing our minds to the technology,
 maybe we understand and realize the benefits of it.</p>
<p>

            <p>So in my personal and business situation, I don't use any "Cloud" services, Windows Store or any other "Metro 'app'".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use a partitioning scheme, as follows (at home as well as all business computers):</p>
<p>
</p><p>System Reserved (350MB for Windows 10)</p>
<p>C:\ %windows% (50GB)</p>
<p>D:\ "My Documents" (Remaining drive space)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have literally 1000's of DVDs &amp; CDs that I could fill multiple cloud accounts with, most of which contain sensitive business related materials, not to mention software that is in disc format.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my "My Documents" partition are all the same things that you have, wallpaper, program installation files, bookmarks (the only thing that have to be regularly backed up), etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All that and the added security of them not being "in the cloud" (one of which has been recently hacked), and not having to wait for them to download in case of a system crash. I luckily have not had the joy of a HDD failure. Windows crashes, yes and the
 recovery time (not feature) is very fast since all I have to do is restore/reinstall Windows. I also have not yet accepted the SSD technology because flash chips have a limited number of writes that can be performed, so while a HDD failure is still possible,
 it is less likely than a SSD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now on my Debian Linux machines, that are set up in an almost identical manner as my Windows machines, I have never had to have a "Debian Account", for
 the option to be able to remove them from the machines that I <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
may</span> be deploying Windows 10 on. Including; Windows Store, Camera, and any others that MS deems necessary and will not allow the un-installation of, and the option to not link any computer to any specific account because multiple users use the same computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So can you tell me where I would benefit from a Windows Live account?</p>

            <p>I didn't say it was the rule and I never said anything about having 1000 desktop applications synced to the cloud. I referred to there being benefits to it. Karkarans desire is not to not have PC Syncing and Cloud Services in the OS at all and that is just
 an unrealistic expectation. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 still provides all of the local benefits of a classic Windows desktop environment from Windows 7 and prior versions. Also, if you have plans to deploy Windows 10, you also have the option of controlling the experience using Group Policy just like
 you did with any previous client. You are not required to use modern applications either.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steve Sinofsky said it during the development of Windows 8, developing Windows is like making a pizza for a billion users. You are not gonna be able to please everyone, but there needs to be a common ground.
</p>
<p>- Windows still allows you to use a local account - albeit, the option can be more prominent during setup. You claim you will be deploying Windows in a business, this should even be of a concern to you.

            <p>Fair points, and I suppose for some users there can be benefits. I can especially see how the backup feature would be convenient for almost all home users, and while the Windows Store functionality isn't exactly something I think is good, that's a discussion
 for another thread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Admittedly, I never used OneDrive. Between my Google drive, home server, thumb drive, and phone (64GB ext. SD card), I was never really interested in more backups. I can't knock until I try it, but those are just two features, and for those who are uninterested
 or for other reasons (work PCs, for example) don't want to sign in with their own personal emails. The current system makes many users think they don't have an option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to that, probably the main reason why I personally don't want to sign in with a live account, is security. I don't particularly cherish the idea of the master password for my PC being saved online. On the flip side of that, that's an irrational
 fear and most users don't really care about it that much.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Okay, I'm blabbering on nonsensically. Sorry, I'm just getting over a fever and I'm not at 100%. Basically, I would have no complaints with the sign in thing as long as it didn't bother you about it, and during the installation it was made clear that you
 had the option to use a local account.</p>

            <p>The benefits of using a Microsoft Account is to really harness the Cloud services: PC Syncing, OneDrive. Even if there is&nbsp;no active Internet Connection, you can still authenticate locally without any problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Store will have to require credentials, preferably a Microsoft Account because:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1: Modern Apps utilize it as part of the PC Syncing experience and roaming settings. So, when want to move from an old to a new PC or switch computers, its seam less.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2: Makes updating modern applications easier, you also can share apps with all the Windows devices you own. So if you download an app you like using, you can use it on up 5 additional devices you own. Classic desktop applications don't normally permit that
 kind of benefit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3: Security, benefits include two factor authentication, so its harder to steal your identity. A person can't log into your account in Asia if you live in North America, because Windows knows that's not where you live.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the same time, if you don't want any of this, you don't have to use it. Of course, I don't know the future of authenticating on Windows. My belief is, as long as there is Enterprise computing, Microsoft will not make using a Microsoft Account mandatory.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then again, Active Directory, which handles on premises authentication in a business is now available in the Cloud.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As with all changes in the technology industry, these things will take time to adjust to.

            Hi BCM_73,<br />
<br />
Did you encounter the issue when you click Sync Now in Microsoft SharePoint libraries or in OneDrive for Business?
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d4484b9f-3b69-4c4a-a2d4-c46e5c4a6b3f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d4484b9f-3b69-4c4a-a2d4-c46e5c4a6b3f" /></a>&nbsp;<br />

b.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In Registry Editor, locate and then click the following subkey:<br />
<strong>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Common\SignIn</strong><br />
c.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Locate and then double-click the following value: <strong>SignInOptions</strong>.<br />
d.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In the Value Data box, type 0, and then click OK.<br />

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>I think theres a problem with different Onedrive sync programs.</span></p>
<p><span>I have personal onedriv sync folder, and a business sync folder. </span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>On the right corne on&nbsp; the screen I have now closed all onedrive sync icons.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>When I now click on one sharepoint folder, the following message comes up :</span></p>
<p />
<p>
</p><p><span>I type : <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">b***@***.no</span></span></p>
<p><span>After this I chose between peronal accout and work account. I choose work account and enter password, then the following window display :</span></p>
<p>
</p><p />
<p>
</p><p><span>Since this is on the BMI domene, I type the local network ID and password.</span></p>
<p><span>The same window display again, I type the same. The window disappear, and nothing happens.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In the last window I also tried too type the office365 ID and password (
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Maybe the problem that it cant connect too sharepoint / Onedrive, and therefore we have too find out that first.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I I reboot the computer it works for a short time, then I cant connect too sharepoint / Onedrive. Tried explorer, edge, chrome, same result.</span></p>

            <p>Hi CM1975, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to reproduce this issue, and it looks like we have a known bug on it. Importing from favorites when the Favorites known folder&nbsp;has been moved doesn't work.&nbsp;I'm afraid I don't have a good workaround to share. You're correct that moving the folder
 back doesn't work. We'll work on a fix, but in the meantime you'll probably have to recreate your favorites manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry and thanks for being an Insider!</p>

<p><span>Workaround.</span></p>
<p><span>=========</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After clean install (build 10176, 10240) copy your favorites from D to C (original location). At this step you can import them. If you redirect your "user" folders to D:\%userprofile%/Favorites
 no more work. You must really after Windows 10 clean install after chipset driver, graphic, network and so on copy your favorites to original location on C, and import them (Settings... Import favorites from another browser). After import you can redirect
 things to drive D. </span></p>
<p><span>-</span></p>
<p><span>Criticism.</span></p>
<p><span>=======</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Other thing - using Edge is very, very complicated. Nothing intuitive. Create folder in favorites, searching between the folders, looking for one favorites&nbsp;(if you have cup of thousands favorites)
 "lot of fun" ;-) Because all favorites inside of folders are at once all together. Disaster!
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you have 100 favorites - no problem.</span></p>
<p><span>But what if you have more than 5,000?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>People that develop this have really no feeling.
</span></p>
<p><span>"As is" Edge is created for smartphone.</span></p>

            Just replying with the same issue, except in following troubleshooting steps for a different problem I copied my user profile to a new user, not a new drive. Like copying to another drive, putting the files back in their original location doesn't help.
 Hoping to see an answer to this soon!

<li>Manually copy the IE favorites (Internet Shortcut) from the IE favorites folder (%userprofile%\favorites) to the Microsoft Edge favorites folder (%localappdata%\Packages\Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge_8wekyb3d8bbwe\AC\MicrosoftEdge\User\Default\Favorites).

            <p>Possibly, but in general you'll have troubles with references. The Access/Office references won't "downgrade" from 2016 to 2010. You can generally go the other way (2010 &gt;&gt; 2016), since Access can upgrade references (for the most part).</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said - it could be done, but you'd have to (a) be sure to not use any features introduced after 2010 and (b) re-create the references on the 2010 machine after installing the database. This would mean you couldn't deploy a compiled file, since you can't
 change references in a compiled file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a general rule of thumb, you should develop in an environment that matches the "lowest common denominator" for all the machines you must support. In your case, that would be a machine running Access/Office 2010, and no higher.</p>

<p><strong><span>Hi MnMPNut,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>1. Which operating system and internet explorer version are you using?<br />
2. Since when are you facing the issue?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>3. Are you facing the issue only with a particular website?<br />
4. Have you tried to download pictures from different websites?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>5. Are you able to download other files except picture files?<br />
6. What is the file type you are trying to copy?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method 1:<br />
</span></strong><strong><span>I would suggest you to first try deleting the temporary internet files and check if this assists you resolve the issue -</span></strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/Windows7/View-temporary-Internet-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/Windows7/View-temporary-Internet-files</span></span></a></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 2:<br />
</span></span></strong><span><span>Try to add the website in trusted sites and then check. Use the below mentioned link for guidance -<br />
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Why-cant-I-open-or-copy-files-from-the-web" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Why-cant-I-open-or-copy-files-from-the-web</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 3:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>You may even right click internet explorer and select the option to<strong>run as administrator
</strong>then check.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<h2>            I have been hacked, my bank got hit for &#36;1350 and I need something to clean up whatever the hackers left on my PC</h2>
                    <p>Greetings,<br />
<br />
My laptop was hacked. It was connected to internet wirelessly. Since I was hacked, I've installed Norton Security Suite on both the laptop and my desktop. They got to me through the Internet. My network access is pretty tight. It's even tighter now. I've changed
 my SSID on network, I'm not broadcasting the SSID anymore, changed the password. But I have lots of issues with both my desktop and laptop now. Even though they hit the laptop first, I guess once they got on my network, they were easily able to see my desktop
 and go after it. My printer stopped working, said the spooler service isn't running. Tried to start it and got message " Not enough resources to start service" That was on my desktop and it has plenty of resources. I built it and it has pretty high end stuff
 inside it. I've had programs disappear from my start menu, viruses in programs that I've had forever.<br />
<br />
<br />
Any of you know of a program that will scan for known 'hacker' programs? I've done virus scans with 5 different programs and all of them have found a few things, but I have about 10-15 files that show up every day, twice or three times a day. One of those files
 is my 'hosts' file. That's very bothersome. I've scanned with ESET Anti virus, ESET Smart Security, Norton Security Suite, Windows Defender, AVG free, Malwarebytes, Exterminate it, Reason Core and I've run a/v and Malwarebytes scans every day, at least twice
 a day since I was hacked. That was on July 7. For the most part I've just kept my PCs turned off to prevent nasty things from running. I have several things happening on my PC, something new almost daily. I've had things in my start menu stop working. The
 shortcut has been deleted. I have been getting some of the same files show up every day when I do a scan, and one of those files is my hosts file. My taskbar has gone away, Firefox lost all it's configurations, FF and Chrome both got hit with a virus that
 hijacks the search page, all of my permissions have changed so I can't do much of anything, my UAC got changed, and then there is the $1350 they got from my debit card and bank. The latest problem is my Office 2013 has become uninstalled, and I used Word to
 save a lot of my info about what the hackers have done. When I ran Word it started the install, then in a few seconds it said 'Fatal Error'. Norton couldn't find anything to stop this, ESET Smart Security couldn't find anything to stop this. I could go on
 and on...<br />
<br />
<br />
I did get my IP Address changed - not my PC IP address, the main address from Comcast. I feel a little safer since I know they came in through the internet. But the laptop is the one they hacked into originally. While I was waiting, trying to find a way to
 change my Comcast IP address, they got in at least two more times and they hit my desktop. I saw them because on the laptop my ESET a/v blocked them from going to a bad website. ESET does a pop up with the site trying to be accessed, and gives the IP address
 of the one trying to access the site. That IP address was definitely not one of mine.<br />
<br />
<br />
The laptop was nonfunctional for the most part. My desktop is getting worse every day. Also, I tried to join a forum before I got a new IP address, and I got email from the Moderator/admin&nbsp; telling me that my IP was on the Spammer site the forum checks before
 they let a user join the forum. So the hackers did a number on me there.<br />
<br />
I was able to restore my laptop back to 6-23-16. But the oldest restore point on my desktop was 7-17-16. I had 3 different restore points on that date - all three of them bombed.<br />
<br />
The main thing I need is a program to go through my data files and look for anything left by the hackers. I can search my other partition where the OS is, but I've already decided I'm going to format my drive and reinstall Windows. But if I don't scan my data
 partition before I do a backup, there's a good chance I'll restore part of the hackers work.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd appreciate any suggestions on a program/utility to look for Hacker nasty stuff. I've scanned with Norton, ESET Smart Security, Windows Defender,&nbsp; AVG Free -&nbsp; and all of them have found a few viruses and malware, but they can't find what the hackers put
 on my computer. I say that because every day something new is wrong with my desktop.<br />
<br />
I've gotten and followed tons of advice on PREVENTION. I need something to clean up my PC. I know the hackers left some very nasty stuff behind. But obviously a normal Anti Virus program isn't going to find what they've put on my PC's.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help</p>

</p><p>PA Bear,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realize I didn't put the date of the hack in my post. It was hacked on 7-6-16. I'm pretty sure of the date because I saw some unrecognized programs installed on 7-6-16 and on 7-7-16 I noticed my bank had the 5 transactions totaling $1350.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was just giving you a message with details so you would know this was a hacker, not just an ordinary virus. I am an Insider on the laptop, but I got in a car accident right after I signed up so I haven't done anything on Insider yet. The accident caused
 more injury to an already messed up back and neck. Being on the PC is painful so I've been on here just a few hours a day. And I would prefer to work on the desktop since I use it the most. In my mind whatever solution work for one witll work for the other
 computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes Comcast/Xfinity is my ISP it that's what you mean by subscriber. I am also a member of their forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run the Norton Removal tool, but not McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your last question - PA Bear!!! tells me you didn't read my entire post. In fact I'd say you didn't even read half of it. Was it that boring?? It sure isn't boring to me.
</p>
<p>"How have you determined that the&nbsp;Desktop PC&nbsp;<em>and the Notebook PC</em>&nbsp;are&nbsp;no longer infected?"</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I Never said either computer was no longer infected. I posted here looking for a program that would scan for and remove 'known hacker programs/bugs/viruses/malware' on a known infected computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read your first link, and I've already done that process but I couldn't get the logs to post to the forum. The logs are huges. I tried three different times and each time I get an error. The guy on the forum that reviews those logs said "That's a forum
 error. Just keep trying."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe if I send the logs to Malware bytes I'll have better luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I forgot to mention in my post, I had already decided the only thing I can do is format my drives and reinstall Windows. But since I will be restoring the data from my second partition, I'm afraid I will re-install some stuff the hackers left behind. If
 I didn't have to be concerned about my data, I'd already be done with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the links. I'm going to do the Malwarebytes first link and send them the logs since the other ones are so old. I have a feeling the logs I run today will be even longer than the ones I ran on 7-20-16 since the hackers programs seem to be adding
 another 'feature' daily'. Some are recurrent, some are new.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the links. I hope you don't think I'm looking for someone to do all the work for me. I've been googling so much looking for forums that deal with network security, internet security, and hacking. I just haven't found many. And most of them are
 just giving me replies telling me how to prevent it in the future. I appreciate that, but I'm not there yet - not even close.</p>
<p>
</p><p>TTYL</p>

            <p>Well, I ran Spyhunter Free version, and like you - it found tons more items than Malwarebyes and several other programs I ran.</p>
<p>It made me suspicious. I looked at a lot on the internet about SpyHunter. About 50% or more comments said it was fake and it displayed a bunch of fake results to get you to buy the real version. And there are so many FREE real programs out there, I tended
 to believe the reviews that said it was fake.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't get me wrong, but are you sure you were HACKED?? And that it wasn't just some nasty viruses?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been asked that on every forum that I've posted on - so don't be offended. I always get most of them to be believers when I tell them they got $1350 from my bank/debit card account. I don't think any regular virus is that good - YET!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I know a human was ON MY COMPUTER.</p>
<p>How do you feel certain you were actually hacked? What symptoms did you have?</p>

<h2>            Cannot connect to latest version</h2>
                    I have been using an old version of Skype completely satisfactorily, but the last time I used it, it said it could not recognise my external camera. The advice was to download the latest version which I did. However although I see my name and my contacts,
 I cannot even connect to Echo test and once again camera is not recognised. Any simple help for an octogenarian please.

<p>Lets see if Windows recognizes your camera so we know if the issue is Skype or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click Start and type the word camera. This should find the Windows 10 Camera app. If Windows recognizes your camera is connected and functional, the camera app should ask you if you want to let it use your exact location and then you should see yourself

<p>What I wanted you to do is launch the Windows Camera app. Here is a screenshot on how to find it and just double click what I circled to launch it. Lets see if the Camera App can see your camera and use it.</p>

<p>Thanks. I understand now. I did not know the error you listed was from the Camera app. Good work on providing the screen shot by the way! :D</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is not with Skype then. The camera, when properly connected and drivers are installed, will show a picture even in the Windows Camera app. Getting support for the camera is going to be the solution to the issue. I'm not sure if you'll find that
 here in the Skype Support forums. </p>
<p>What is the make and model of your camera?</p>
<p>You can look at your Device Manager and see if Windows shows any hardware that has issues. Device Manager is available by searching for it in the Windows Search.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did your camera come with any software disk?</p>

            Thanks again, I do not have the imaging devices/ video camera listed, so it must be something is missing. The camera is a Logitech HD Webcam C270, my son installed it sometime ago, but I cannot find a disc at the moment. I will pester him the next time
 he comes around !!&nbsp; Thanks for trying to help.<br />

<p>This might help the two of you get started.</p>

<p>I didn't look in their support page to see if this cam has issues with Windows 10.</p>
<p>If the device manager has a connected device that needs fixing such as drivers or if the device is damaged and not recognized, there is probably an Unknown Hardware down close to the bottom.</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE: I just looked at&nbsp;http://support.logitech.com/en_us/article/32436 and your model is listed as native Windows 10 hardware. I would unplug the camera and reconnect it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best of success to you all.&nbsp;</p>

<div>
<p>With regard to modem issue, can you tell us more what's the exact concern? Do you encounter any error message? Are you using Nokia Suite or Nokia PC Suite to do this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you send messages or connect to the internet, Nokia Suite uses the SIM&nbsp;card that is in the internal SIM&nbsp;card holder of the phone. This card goes by the name of SIM1, unless you have renamed it.&nbsp;<span>To send a message or create an internet connection
 with the other SIM card, swap the SIM cards in your phone.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps.&nbsp;:smileyhappy:</span></p>

                    <p>Hi all, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently returned from abroad, whilst abroad I received a SPAM email but as I was on my phone I didn't realise and opened it. Consequently a message was sent to everyone on my account (Account was hacked).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since then I have changed my password and see no signs of any hacking, unusual behaviour happening on my account but I can't receive any emails.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried all the suggestions I could find but none have worked. </p>
<p>-inbox and sweep rules</p>
<p>-clutter inbox </p>
<p>-blocked senders</p>
<p>-safe mailing lists </p>
<p>-using a different web browser </p>
<p>-using a different devise ( I have tried Laptop, Ipad and my phone) </p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be hugely appreciated as I really am not&nbsp;a happy bunny right now :(.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance, </p>

    <title>Visio 365 Bug, &#40;semi&#41; transparent images are not showing up in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ted bertele  say:</h3>
<h2>            Visio 365 Bug, &#40;semi&#41; transparent images are not showing up in printed documents</h2>
                    <p>Visio is great for creating schematics, diagrams, and so forth. &nbsp;You can add pictures (like outline of your building for instance) into the background and then add details items (like distributed computer networks) which show not only the connectivity of
 items, but their physical location. &nbsp;OK Great.</p>
<p>So I have diagram that does essentially that, but suddenly the background picture refuses to show up on any printed view.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Print preview - its not there</li><li>Save as a PDF - its not there</li><li>Print to a printer - its not there</li><li>View in visio - its there</li></ul>
<p>OK, so I search the forums and I find references to visio 2003 and other useless tidbits about 'make it printable'. &nbsp;These are neither applicable in 2016 nor correct. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I take the time to call MS and we spend 90 minutes doing all the basic stuff. &nbsp;Fill options, picture properties... whatever. &nbsp;I have 16 different versions of this file (revisions), 15 of them had worked, # 16 does not now. &nbsp;Even opening the older version,
 I has the same problem. &nbsp;This tells me that its not a file issue, but a visio issue. &nbsp;I installed another seat of visio on my laptop and it behaves the same way, it refuses to print.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While on line with tech support, I manage to find the button that controls transparency (thanks visio for hiding under three layers of menu option now...) and I change it to 0% transparency. &nbsp;The image is now showing up in printed documents.... &nbsp;Any change
 from 0% transparency, and the image is no longer on any printed document. &nbsp;Now let me remind you all (MS people), that Visio has been working just fine for the last year. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further, we opened the same document in 2010 and it prints and works just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />

    <title>OneNote won&#39;t sync to desktop app - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sarahlundy1  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote won&#39;t sync to desktop app</h2>
                    <p>A client shared a OnNote notebook with me, which I synced to my Office 2016 desktop app. At first everything worked fine, and my client could see the changes I made. Then, last week my changes stopped syncing. I tried everything: updates, re-syncing from
 the online version from&nbsp;different browsers, etc. but nothing worked. I ended up having to copy and paste all my changes into the web version.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the desktop app I receive this error: "We need the password to sync this notebook. (Error code: 0xE0000024)" even thought I have entered the password many times, and the password works fine when accessing the web version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I am in the web version and try to "open in Onenote" I get the message "We couldn't open that location. IT might not exist or you might now have permission to open it."</p>
<p>
</p><p>My colleague upgraded&nbsp;to Office 2016 today, and&nbsp;now she is having the same problem with her own OneNote notebooks. She can view them online, but they won't sync. When she tries to sync using "view in OneNote" it tells here that she doesn't have permission
 or the notebook doesn't exist, both of which are not true, because she is already viewing the online version. This is the same behavior that I am seeing in my client's notebook.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>The first link looked promising, but so far the instructions haven't helped... the OneNote notebooks I am trying to sync are hosted on OneDrive, not live... so what would the credential name that I should delete&nbsp;look like in that case?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I've closed and opened Onenote... and restarted my computer, and done my updates, etc. etc. many times over the last few days while troubleshooting this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second link above is just the basic help info for OneNote syncing... it was the first place I looked for help, but it is very basic.</p>

<h2>            Frozen skype at start</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have got my HP Z840 workstation here, and the Skype came with pre-installed Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time when I started Skype app, it froze with the spinning thing at the very beginning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to uninstall and re-install the software, including both free and professional versions, but the same problem happens every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any solution to it? I haven't been able to use Skype at all so far... Desperate...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks,</p>

<p><span>What is the exact Skype version that you’re using? Skype has 3 versions on Windows 10 and each of them has a different user interface.

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Thank you very much for the detailed instruction.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed the steps, and upon the start of Skype, it shows a progress bar of "Configuring Skype"ish and flashed for twice before disappearing... (it was too quick and I couldn't read the whole message T_T)</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the dots spinning on the start-up screen of Skype, it turned for two extra rounds before being frozen. Besides that, I am sorry that I haven't noticed any other changes...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other suggestions?&nbsp;</p>
