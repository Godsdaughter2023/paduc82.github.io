                    <p>добрый день</p>
<p>
</p><p>есть элит контроллер 1698 и ноутбук элиенвар 17 р3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>через юзб геймпад прекрасно работает без каких-либо дополнительных программ. но через блютуз не подключить.</p>
<p>
</p><p>переустановил виндоус 10 домашняя и обновил.</p>
<p>установил икс бокс лив и иксбокс аксессуары, обновил прошивку геймпада.</p>
<p>
</p><p>при попытке подключения ноутбук просто не видит геймпад, идет бесконечный поиск. я не покупал блютуз адаптер, ведь у меня он есть в ноутбуке, я так предполагаю с ним то он заработает, но какой в этом смысл.</p>
<p>
</p><p>делаю все точно по интсрукции, держку каждую кнопочку столько секунд, сколько написано. перегружал и бук и геймпад, не видит и все.</p>
<p>
</p><p>что я делаю не так и что нужно исправить, что бы ноут его увидел ? помогите, спасибо.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>(Mod Translation)</strong></p>
<p>Good afternoon</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is an elite controller 1698 and a laptop Elienvar 17r3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Through the YUZB controller works perfectly without any additional programs. But through the Bluetooth do not connect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reinstalled the 10-home vindous and updated.</p>
<p>Installed the X-box liv and Ikbox accessories, updated the firmware of the controller.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When trying to connect the laptop just does not see the controller, goes an endless search. I did not buy a Bluetooth adapter, because I have it in a laptop, I guess with it then it will work, but what is the point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do everything exactly according to the intonation, holding every button for as many seconds as it is written. Overloaded both the beech and the gamepad, does not see anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I do wrong and what needs to be fixed, what would the jester see him? Help, thank you.</p>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>Thanks for reaching out to us here on the forums with this situation. If you're laptop has Bluetooth you will be able to sync the controller to it by pressing the sync button at the top of the controller. If there is no Bluetooth you may have to use a USB
 cable to connect the controller to the laptop. You can also purchase an Xbox One Wireless Controller Adapter to sync the controller. Hope this helps!</p>

<p><span>For the full screen issue with all the games I would suggest that you manually download and install the updated graphics adapter drivers
 by visiting the adapter manufacturer or the computer manufacturer and check if it helps.</span></p>

<h2>            compatibility problems windows 10 and Tom Tom my drive connect</h2>
                    <p>Recent upgrade to windows 10 from 7. New maps version v9.55 available from Tom Tom. the download appeared to run successfuly but on the device I now have corrupt maps.Windows on devices and printers states " problem with Texas Instruments USB 3.0 x HCI host
 controller,windows has stopped device because it has reported a problem (code 43)</p>
<p>This has stopped me using the usb and therefore does not show connection with satnav.</p>
<p>Tom Tom disscussions show there are compatibility problems with windows 10 and &nbsp;My drive connect which have not been resolved.</p>
<p>I have spent from just after 10 am this morning till 4 pm allowing Microsoft remote access to my computer hoping to resolve the problems without success with un-usable usb connections and a satnav not fit for purpose.</p>
<p>any help would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>I tried the trouble shooting and still got the same response-problems with texas inst etc;-windows stopped this device because it has reported a problem (code 43)-location PCI Bus 2 device 0 function 0.</p>
<p>Trouble shooting has completed,problems found Texas inst not working properly,hardware chane might not have been detected,try what you are doing again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From recent hardware changes fixed-completed potential issues that were checked,windows update configured to never install driver issues not present.</p>
<p>Device manager- the best driver for your device is already installed (up to date)</p>
<p>
</p><p>the USB ports are still not functioning,would I be safe in using one of those at rear of desktop ?.</p>
<p>I un-installed TomTom my drive connect and re-installed,have formatted the sd card and my drive connect now shows sd card empy (except for 53 mb but internal memory full but whilst saying device is up to date also states &nbsp;map version v9.55 has not been installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>sorry for being long winded,of course the main consideration with you is how to have the affected USB ports working.</p>

            <p>Hi Abdul</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just finished a session with Tom Tom customer care where I allowed them to have remote control of my computer.</p>
<p>The Go 6000 is now loaded with up to date maps etc,but on the internal memory (down loading summer maps required use of sd card because internal memory of device was not sufficient)</p>
<p>I still do not know why the USB's were affected and why I still can't use them,apart from charging up phone's etc; I used a rear USB to connect the satnav to the computer while they had remote access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way the two affected USB's can be brought back into use ?.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you,</p>
<p>Jack</p>

            <p>I received email 11/9/15 from Microsoft Community Team because my question hasn't been marked as answered but as I had already replied above .Whilst the issue of updating my Tom Tom device &nbsp;had at that point been resolved the problems with the Texas Instrument
 3.0 USB was not and no further help has been received,bearing in mind &nbsp;that i had also previously allowed Microsoft to have remote access of my computer for over six hours ,and while i am sure efforts were being made to resolve matters the session was ended
 by them without conclusion.</p>
<p>The current situation is that my Grandson followed the various sequences suggested and enabled &nbsp;the Texas Instrument and had them working ( error code 43 deleted) but on updating further Tom Tom software the updating was not concluded and error coded 43
 reappeared.the following day i connected my device to the rear USB connections and somehow completed the updating and the code 43 has again disappeared.</p>
<p>I will not use the Texas Instrument USB until i am satisfied windows 10 can be operated successfully and the operating system is compatible with other devices.</p>

<p>I really want this for Xbox 1 too. EA make their Sims games for a WIDE variety of platforms. I would really be a happy bunny if they released that, The Sims 3, and The Sims 4 on X1. Sims 4 was due to be released early this year but the game devs has postponed
 it for later this year. I don't know what the PC version of it is like I've played The Sims 3 on PC it's awesome. Have given up on PC gaming since I joined Xbox late 2010 mainly due to this thing called PC requirements. You don't have to worry about such requirements
 on consoles. My current laptop with Intel Core i5, Windows 7 and AMD HD 6490 can't play Sims 3 but my old laptop which I no longer have could until the display stopped working ;)</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Check with the Seller and the System Maker's Support. As OEM the System Maker is responsible for the proper operation of both the hardware and Windows. So regardless of the cause it is theirs to resolve.&nbsp;Especially since it sounds like hardware the unit is
 under full warranty and may be in need of repairs or replacement. Remember the more you do the more they are likely to say it is something you have done.<br />
<br />

<h2>            PROBLEM SIGNING IN TO FORZA HORIZON 3</h2>
                    <p>I am getting some serious issues. When I try to log in I get this error on Windows 10:</p>
<p>"Sign In Needed"</p>
<p>"You may not proceed without being signed in to a profile."</p>
<p>If I try to re-sign in it just pops up with the Xbox grey box and closes and returns with the same error</p>
<p>I really hope that there is a solution to this problem, i have been unable to play this game for almost 2 months now.</p>

<h2>            Bitlocker enabled itself after VeraCrypt reboot</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I installed veracrypt on my desktop this morning running windows 10.&nbsp; Everything went perfectly.&nbsp; I then tried installing VeraCrypt on a microsoft surface pro 3 running windows 8.1.&nbsp; After the initial VeraCrypt reboot, I entered my VeraCrypt password
 (which was successful) and then it took me to a bitlocker recovery screen.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've never touched bitlocker, specifically because I don't trust it.&nbsp; This was the whole reason I installed VeraCrypt. Since I didn't enable it I obviously don't have the recovery key, and after checking my microsoft account, I don't have any recovery keys
 listed there either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to remove the VeraCrypt Prompt (after booting the USB that cointained the EFI folder) because VeraCrypt hadn't actually encrypted the drive yet, it was a simple restart to test the password prompt.&nbsp; For whatever reason, this enabled BitLocker
 and I'm pretty sure I'm completely screwed.&nbsp; No system restore points visible, can't boot into safe mode, no advanced recovery options working.</p>

            That's good information. I'm glad I never tried VeraCrypt and stuck with BitLocker as it appears VeraCrypt can't be trusted.

<h3> gohanman  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I make Cortana stop randomly bugging me forever&#63;</h2>
                    <p>In every version of Windows 10, from 1803 back through every previous version, the start menu pops open seemingly at random with a Cortana dialog asking about understanding me better. The 1803 version says "I can learn to understand you better if I get familiar
 with the way you talk. I need your permission to help". It has buttons for "Sure" and "Maybe Later".</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens on every single Windows 10 computer I've used. It happens utterly at random. I've seen it happen with no one anywhere near the PC's keyboard or mouse let alone touching them. I have probably without exaggeration clicked "Maybe Later" well over
 a hundred times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a "Stop asking me this forever" setting buried somewhere? The literal years of nagging at this point is getting annoying.</p>

<div>XP's recovery console is very restricted in what it's allowed to access - </div>
<div>and user data isn't part of it.</div>
<div>It's there purely to allow a manual repair of the system files.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you can get hold of, or build on another PC, either Bart P|E, or UBCD, </div>
<div>you'll be able to see what's on the drive in a familiar interface (i.e. </div>
<div>Windows), and access a USB to save files.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>WRT your actual problem.... this appears to be a device driver problem - </div>
<div>bear in mind here that software can also be seen by the OS as a device </div>
<div>(Anti-Viruses are often classed as devices for some of their files!)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>What hardware/software updates were done in the day or two before the </div>
<div>failure? If it's hardware - then remove the hardware - if it's software, try</div>
<div>booting in Safe Mode - allow at least 15 minutes before killing a Safe Mode </div>
<div>boot!! (I have personally seen the last file name of a boot be on screen for</div>
<div>10 minutes! - followed by a 'normal' boot)</div>

<p>The Command Prompt syntax you are probably used to and the syntax of commands in the Recovery Console are not exactly the same so it is easy to get frustrated with things like - "Why doesn't this work!" when using RC. &nbsp;The problem of course has nothing to
 do with RC - it is cockpit error on the part of the user and not understanding that the two interfaces are not the same.</p>
<p>Anywho, like Noel says - RC is not a file copying tool - it is a troubleshooting/diagnostic&nbsp;tool and you are attempting to use it in ways it is not designed to work.</p>
<p>It is very good that you can get into RC though.</p>
<p>I would work on fixing your afflicted system first, but you can use alternatives to try and salvage files. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Requirements to create a Bart PE or UBCD that many people do not seem to be able to get their hands on:</p>
<p>A genuine bootable XP installation CD</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What happens when you choose Last Known Good Configuration from the F8 boot option menu? &nbsp;</p>
<p>LKGC is the snapshot XP has of the last time the system booted&nbsp;successfully&nbsp;- good for when some driver update breaks your system and it won't boot anymore, but that is not what your problem looks like to me, but it is quick to give it a whirl.</p>
<p>Your problem reeks of a missing file in c:\windows\system32 and those can be replaced easily from RC, but I am not sure of which one for that particular error.</p>
<p>I have three or four suspects in mind, but see what LKGC does for you first and if that works, you can undo whatever got you into this in the first place.</p>
<p>Is that absolutely all the message says or is there more to it? &nbsp;An X in a red circle perhaps? &nbsp;Tell us everything it says (usually these SESSION things have more to say).</p>
<p>Too bad it is not SESSION1, SESSION2 or SESSION3, but we will know how to fix SESSION5 when we are done. &nbsp;I will try to break mine in a similar fashion.</p>
<p>I know you can copy files to a floppy from RC if you follow these directions. &nbsp;I can't see if it works on a USB drive at the moment:</p>

<h2>            Xbox Live Over Night Disconnections</h2>
                    
<p>Recently i've been having a problem where I leave my xbox on overnight to finish a zombies game the next day and I wake up in the morning to "The black ops 2 servers are not available at this time". This has happened to me 3 times on round 60 on farm and
 it's getting very irritating. A few weeks ago I left my xbox on for 3 days straight in 1 zombies game without disconnecting so I have no clue what the problem is. I have a wired connection, xbox 360 slim and NAT type moderate. Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>You could have an occasional choking of the port 3074 traffic on your internet connection (including the modem and especially the router), as the BlackOps servers will drop you if the Xbox doesn't reply on that port. So, following the general NAT solution
 track is most likely to help. Some NAT problems are subtle and don't appear in the Test Xbox Live Connection test. Most likely there's a port blocked or misdirected away from your Xbox, in your router, modem, or at your ISP. For more background on Ports, see
<a href="http://whatismyipaddress.com/port" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">whatismyipaddress.com/port</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the Xbox 360 uses different ports than PCs &amp; Macs ordinarily use, you can't see the effect of a port blockage except on the Xbox, for the NAT problem is really the blockage or misdirection of ports.&nbsp;&nbsp;A sequential power cycle is the first step in clearing
 connection problems, and <strong>the order and timing of the steps is important to success</strong>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">1) turn off the Xbox and unplug the power supply cord from the back of the Xbox then</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">2) unplug power from the router (Some folks have a combination modem-router AKA 'gateway' or only use a modem with no router. If either, skip steps 3 &amp; 6).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">3) unplug power from the modem.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">4) Wait
<em>at least <span><strong>5</strong></span> minutes</em> then replug the modem/gateway power.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">5) Wait 'til the light on the front of the modem/gateway which says BROADBAND, ONLINE, READY, CABLE or DSL is on solid (not flashing), then plug in the router. If you have
 a gateway instead of a modem and router or a modem with no router, then when that light says it's ready, skip to step 7.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">6) Wait until the WiFi light on the router is on; you may not use WiFi, but it's still a good indicator your router is finished booting up.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">7) Plug in and turn on the Xbox.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>I just performed a clean install of Windows 10 Pro Version 1803.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was installing Snip and Sketch from the Microsoft Apps Store, it completed the download and began the install, however, did not complete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1/ I have and HP Desktop with a high speed internet connection.</p>
<p>2/ I tried running wsreset.exe as administrator with no positive result.</p>
<p>3/ I tried logging out of the Microsoft App Store and logging back in with no positive result.</p>
<p>4/ I ran the Microsoft Store App troubleshooter and got no errors.</p>
<p>5/ I can install other apps with no problem.</p>
<p>6/ I have restated my computer several times with no positive result.</p>
<p>7/ I cannot cancel the app because it never installed.</p>
<p>8/ I cannot un-install the app because it never installed.</p>
<p>9/ The app does not show in the&nbsp; Apps &amp; Features section of Windows Settings</p>
<p>10/ If I click on the ... in the Snip and Sketch App Page it displays the "Install on my devices" Option, select my device it says it is attempting to install, it never does.</p>
<p>11/ I am using Windows Firewall so hope that should not be an issue.</p>
<p>12/ I stopped Widows defender from using SmartScreen for Microsoft StoreApps with no positive result.</p>
<p>13/ I downloaded and it successfully installed on my laptop.</p>
<p>14/ If I look in the Microsoft App Store "My Library" in the All Owned section it shows the application with a ! saying that the application does not work on the device, however, it worked prior to my new Windows 10 Pro clean install. If I look in the "Ready
 to Install" section it does not show the app. If I look in the "Downloads" section it does not show the app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated. I would rather not re-install Windows to resolve if possible as I have spent considerable time getting everything back up and running.</p>

            I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

    <title>Why does Windows Update download take so long on Windows 8.1&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> daveishere  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does Windows Update download take so long on Windows 8.1&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've been updating Windows 8.1 machines for a few days now and a question that I keep trying to find the answer to is why the update takes as long as it does. &nbsp;Specifically the download portion of the update. &nbsp;I've seen computers sit at 0% for 20+ minutes
 with little to no network activity, little CPU activity... What is going on during this time? &nbsp;It seems that the updates eventually complete but what is the bottlekneck?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a queue for downloading the updates that I might be waiting in? &nbsp;It begins to feel very frustrating to see no data transmitted (per task manager) and yet I'm still waiting for the update, and then later the update jumps to 91% out of nowhere, with
 100 MB downloaded (not that 100 MB should take long to download in the first place). &nbsp;My internet connection regularly checks over 50 Mbps w/ speedtest and download speeds are not usually a problem for me so, I'm just hoping someone can shed some light on
 the situation to make it a bit easier for me to understand what is going on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've noticed that even if I only select two or three small updates to install, Windows Update appears to download everything — when I reboot and try to install more updates, they download very quickly. &nbsp;Does the Wi-Fi portion of Task Manager not reflect
 all the activity that Windows Update has?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd love to be able to see the network activity at a lower level without installing a custom router or additional software on Windows but I have no idea how to do something like that. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any info.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't sat for sure about your problem, but it seems there have been off and on issues with some of the update servers...</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago I couldn't even check for updates... just an error code and RETRY...</p>
<p>
</p><p>After 2-3 days everything seemed to be back to normal. </p>
<p>Since then, there have been other posts in the forum concerning this, but mine is still working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW... I have a program that monitors my internet activity. Like you, I have noticed that the updates will suddenly go from 30 to 75% or something... During this time my Internet tool shows no activity...</p>
<p>I'm not sure how that is happening... with a WIRED connection even.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think that these are two separate issues...</p>

<h2>            No sound from Bluetooth speaker &#40;paired, set output device from Win7, works with other devices.&#41; Help.</h2>
                    <p>Before you ask, I've already read through a half dozen similar posts about Bluetooth speakers and Windows. None of them apply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I received one of those tiny "MicroBoom" portable Bluetooth speakers as a gift.
<em>I've paired it with my phone and it works fine.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>My USB BT adapter detects the speaker when I switch it on (reporting it as a "MicroBoom bluetooth headset").</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I right-clicked the Volume Control icon in the Win7 tray and set the bluetooth speaker as the output device.</strong> The sound-bars indicator bounce around but the speaker produces no sound (yes, I checked the volume on the device. Turned the wheel
 to Max. Nothing.)</p>
<p>
The "MicroBoom" is listed as "Bluetooth 2.1+EDR". I've tried two different BT adapters. As noted, they both detect the speaker just fine.<br />
</p><p>
</p><p>No idea what's wrong. Can anyone help?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I solved my issue with an Inspiron laptop running 8.1 updated over 8.0; this is how I got my HMDX Jam Party to work via Bluetooth:</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not hard to pair the units;&nbsp; just click on the Bluetooth icon and Add a Bluetooth Device. That should get you paired.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now comes the weird part.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to Control Panel - Devices and Printers.&nbsp; <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9896efc4-43c2-4302-9c67-7b8d75c27dcd" /></p>
<p>Right click on "Jam Party", select Control.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The dialog opens....</p>
<p>And the dialog closes after a second or two....</p>
<p>
</p><p>And this is what you almost saw:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8a758e44-a22a-40fc-801e-3b01a3e1f1cc" /></p>
<p>You NOW&nbsp; see the "Connect" button, right? Memorize where it is, cause you have that 1-2 seconds to click on it, before the dialog closes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea why the dialog refuses to stay open, but IF you can click on the Connect button, you can get your Jam Party to work.</p>

<h2>            Assassins Creed Origins - Lost half my gear &#40;possible bug&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello. First of all sorry for not posting this in the Assasins Creed category but the place is dead.</p><p><br /></p><p>I've just booted up this game to continue playing and I've lost half my stuff. I'm about half way through the quest "The Final Weighing". Once Hepzefa was burried and I was told to approach the farm in Green Mountain, I noticed the default outfit was equipped and I was unable to call my horse. I went into my gear menu only to find ALL&nbsp;of my mounts have gone, one of my outfits has gone, most of my shields, and a handful of bows... all GONE!</p><p><br /></p><p>I googled "lost gear" and it came up with bugs related to "Ambush at Sea" which I have not encountered yet anyway. Does anyone have any idea whats going on? I've tried all the obvious things like rebooting the game and it hasn't done anything.</p><p><br /></p><p>Please help!</p>

            <p>I appreciate the information regarding blocking as I hear many folks bring that up.</p><p><br /></p><p>Otherwise your response was about what I expected and shows your process is broken. &nbsp;You are unable to provide a safe gaming environment. And when someone is bullied by being harassed, team killed, flashed repeatedly, messaged inappropriately, and you don't respond so they stand up for themselves, the victim is considered just as guilty as the bully or instigator. &nbsp;That is broken.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>The lack of feedback is also concerning, &nbsp;generally in any other forum (ie real life) , you are given the time the violation took place and some background so you can a. Understand the violation and b. &nbsp;Explain/defend yourself. &nbsp;In a paid service, you would expect to be able to at least speak to a human and get these details. &nbsp;Hiding behind a computer does not give any accountability to the staff enforcing the rules.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>I mentioned PSN for s

<h2>            How do I save somthing that opens in the Reader app&#63; I also need to be able to create a folder to save it in.</h2>
                    <div>When I open and attachment from an Outlook 2007 email, it opens in the Reader app.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I have an option to save it in the Documents Folder, but I also need to be able to create a folder within the Documents Folder to save it there.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I need to open it first to be able to see what it is, so that I know where to save it, of course.&nbsp;</div>
<div>This is also the case with something I open from on a disk drive.&nbsp;</div>
<div>In these cases, the items are pdfs.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Also, what is the fastest way to print from the Reader app? Is it by pressing ctrl +p?&nbsp;</div>
<div>How is anyone supposed to just "know" that??</div>
<div>Please go ahead an include ways to handle jpgs.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please dont tell me that I have to work around this by going to an online version of the program or use the Mail app. I am using Microsoft 2007 Outlook email.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Also, please dont tell me that it is for my protection from something that could be potentially malicious.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you.</div>

<p>I ordered on June 11th My receipt says back ordered too. I think they have only just started manufacturing, So probably because it doesn't exist yet,. Just their way of saying they have no stock. Probably just the way the system works when it checks stock
 of item you order.</p>
<p>I wouldn't worry receipt says "day one console delivered on day of release".</p>

<p>I am pretty sure since they cant ship it yet...as they do not have enough (meaning they have none as it is not released yet), the status will say back ordered until their quantity matches the order total.</p>

<p>Not trying to necro the post here but I had an unrelated issue with MS Store and called today (9/24/13). Before I finished the call regarding my other issue I asked about what we are talking about here. What he told me is that while it reserves me a "Day
 One" edition console, it would not be one that makes it on Nov 22. I asked why and how this could be seeing I had reserved mine on 6/14/13, about the time adverts popped up on the dashboard. All he could tell me was there were a lot of preorders at the time
 and I just didn't get mine in in time. He continued saying mine "could" be here sometime after Dec 2013. So.... either he was unclear on details or there will be plenty more irritated members out here with this "backordered" status.</p>

<p>I don't understand this day one edition stuff. I mean really? Shouldn't you all be more happy if you even get your xbox on the day it releases, over whether its a special day one edition or not? Theres nothing special about it other than it saying "day one
 edition" on it. Not to rain on anyones parade, but I wouldn't care whether its a special edition or not, as long as I get it on the day it releases, and as long as I even got one.</p>
