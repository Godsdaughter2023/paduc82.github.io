<h2>            Unable to change System Locale </h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I'm currently running Windows 7 Professional x64 and I've been trying to install a Japanese program that has always worked with my computer running XP.</p>
<p>I've tried changing the system locale, but every time windows resets, the system repair thing starts and I have to choose (or it picks for me) a system restore point and reboots again from there.</p>
<p>It is really odd. I'm able to type Japanese and read Japanese text on websites, files etc etc but I just cant change the system locale so I can run my program.......</p>

I think the non Unicode is the issue here. I have never run a jpn program so still is only speculation.&nbsp; Wait for a response of a MS support member.<br />

<h2>            Windows 7 BSOD with Netw5v32.sys</h2>
                    
<p>I have a Dell vostro 1720, came with Windows XP installed and recently upgraded to Windows 7 Ultimate. I have been seeing the BSOD very frequently, 7-15 times a day! I have ran every security test I know of, including the RAM integrity test as well as uninstalling
 all programs I had installed within 30 days of the BSOD.</p>
<p>The only commonalities of this error are the Driver:IRQL_not_less_or_equal_to.</p>
<p>It also cites netw5v32.sys as a culprit as well. I believe it has to do with my Wifi5300AGN wireless adapter that I have on my laptop which worked fine with XP and windows 7 until recently.</p>
<p>If anyone has any suggestions on how to correct this it would be greatly appreciated. This error makes the work day THAT much longer :/</p>
<p>Thanks, PM11009</p>

<p>I think I may have solved it...knock on wood. I went onto the Intel website where my WIFI5300 network adapter update was and ran the system update test and it displayed the update to the driver that I needed. I ran the update and I have been BSOD free all
 afternoon while running my laptop on the wireless network. I will upload the minidump files shortly.</p>

            <p>Hi Gabrielyan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. We appreciate your interest in Windows 10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are sorry for the inconvenience caused to you. We will help you in resolving your issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From your description I understand that you are not able to locate Armenia using Map apps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before assisting further, I would like to ask you few questions related to the query.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you set the Region &amp; language settings to your exact location?</p>
<p>What happens when you search for Armenia using Map app?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: </span></strong><span>Run the <strong>apps troubleshooter</strong> included within Windows OS manually by following the steps below</span><span> and check if the issue persist.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>In many cases, the Windows Store will automatically notify you if there’s a problem with an app and try to fix the problem. If you continue experiencing problems with an app, this tool can automatically identify and fix some problems with apps and the Store.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: </span></strong>If the issue persist, set the <strong>
Region &amp; Language</strong> settings to your location by following the steps below and check if the issue is resolved.</p>

    <title>Original Sims will NOT work on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Original Sims will NOT work on Windows 10</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I am going crazy over this- I've been trying to get my Sims 1 games to work on my windows 10 laptop for 7 days straight now.&nbsp;<br />
I've installed and uninstalled the games countless times; tried running the games in compatibility mode for all previous OS and I've tried running the games as administrator. None of these methods have worked.<br />
<br />
I've also downloaded a virtual machine in Windows 8.1 and still, there's been no luck.<br />
<br />
I'm frustrated and disappointed that the games do not work. I'd expect Microsoft to develop Windows 10 with old games in mind. I've read somewhere that the Sims has safedisk on it and Windows 10 does not support that due to its potential of harming computers
 through hacking or something. I've also read that you may have to have a no-CD crack (which I do not trust) in order to get the game to work.<br />
<br />
Has anyone discovered a way to get them working on Windows 10?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated!<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
I've tried the suggestions as mentioned above and they didn't work.<br />
<br />
Is there anything else that you can suggest?<br />
<br />
Most of the time when I restart or turn my computer off, I have to reinstall certain expansions as well as the base game.<br />
<br />
Do you know why this keeps happening?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

            Hi JimWynne,<br />
<br />
From a lot of the digging around I've done on researching this, I found that a lot of people said it is incompatible with Windows 10. I was hoping that compatibility mode would solve it, but it doesn't work. I was hoping that on the off chance that someone
 had come up with a solution.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hardcore Games- I'll give that a try, thanks!<br />

<h2>            How to combine 2 videos into 1</h2>
                    <b>Question Summary</b><br />
I have questions about supported file types in Windows Live Movie Maker

<div><b>Which version of Windows Live Movie Maker are you using ? </b></div>
<div>Version 2011 (15.4.3502.922)</div>
<div><b>Choose your Operating System version : </b></div>
<div>Windows 7</div>
<p><b>Additional Details</b><br />
I've imported 2 videos into Movie Maker and I want to combine them into one.&nbsp; How do I "attach" the end of the first video to the beginning of the second one so they run seamlessly together?<br />
<br />
I'm actually not sure of the version of Movie Maker I'm using - how do I determine that?<br />

            If you are using Windows Live Movie Maker, press Alt+F (or open the first menu) and then choose 'About Movie Maker'.&nbsp; If you are on an older version of Windows Movie Maker, open the Help menu and you'll find 'About Movie Maker' there.&nbsp; Read the last line
 to find the version of Windows Movie Maker.<br />
<br />
In either case, the steps are very straightforward.<br />
1) Put both of videos on your timeline/storyboard/filmstrip area, one after the other.<br />
2) Now save your movie (not just the project, but the movie).&nbsp; It's under the first menu (Alt+F) and choose 'Save Movie' (or 'Publish Movie' in some versions).

            A lot of folks agree with you. There is no explanation as to why, but its possibly has something to do with moving away from win32 software development.
<br />
<br />When Microsoft starts preparing for a new release, it goes through a process called refactoring. It seems this is introducing some significant code changes that breaks certain protocols and API's required by older apps and drivers. Considering the Windows Driver Model has not changed much in its near 30 year history not mention the application programming interfaces such as Win32, this might be culprit. 
<br />
<br />Microsoft might be making plans to leave behind WIN32 soon, as evidenced by the edition called Windows 10 S which only uses Store apps.  
<br />
<br />I think the closest to Windows Live Mail you can get that is still supported is Mozilla Thunderbird which many are switching to.

            Thanks Andre ---- I wonder how much of a job it would be to convert WIndows Live Mail to the 64 based system or if it can even be done.&nbsp; I would think those geniuses could handle it.&nbsp; I lost everything is my e-mail when I upgraded to Windows 10 Pro.&nbsp; Lost
 all contacts, files and folders used with the live program and a lot of it was important.&nbsp; Live and learn I guess.&nbsp; Back to paper and pencil.

            You should still be able to run it, but I think as far compatibility, it might might get worst on future versions of Windows 10.

            If you like Windows Live Mail, you can still use it. However, it isn't as capable as newer mail clients. I's like to suggest you take a look at <a href="http://emclient.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://emclient.com/</a>. This mail client is a lot like WLM, in my opinion, and there's a free option for home use.

            <p>For some reason that escapes me, Windows 10 automatically marks the last printer you used as the default printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If <em>you</em> want to choose the default printer for yourself, Windows will stop automatically choosing the default printer as above. That's what the message means.</p>

    <title>An Open Letter To Xbox - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lord0fchaos86  say:</h3>
<h2>            An Open Letter To Xbox</h2>
                    
<p>First let me apologize if this is in the wrong section, however, with the clunker of a set up I've had to deal with tonight you may understand why I'm confused on where to post.</p>
<p>I've been playing and using Microsoft products since 2004. I've been an XBOX live GOLD member for 6 years with little to no interruptions. I suffered through the red ring of death and went through 3 consoles in 2 months before I finally got one which was
 properly repaired. The 360 I have now disc drive just died. This led me to finally break down and purchase a Xbox One. So I splurged. I went out got the console with Kinnect (which I'll never use) two remotes, two games, all the fixings and I was ready to
 finally see what all the hype was about. I was going to finally see games in a whole new way and not be the guy that was behind the times anymore. I was pumped. I got home, hooked everything up (the wife could not understand my excitement at this point), and
 turned on the console for the first time. I immediately downloaded the OS update, loaded the apps I needed (blu ray, netflix) and popped a game disc in. And then... nothing. An error code? An error code that says “Make sure I'm using an Xbox One game?” Wait
 did the guy at the store give me the wrong game and I just didn't pay attention during my hysteria of excitement. It's possible, I've done it before. Ok, eject the game, wait it says Xbox One on the label. Hmmm..... Pop the disc back in, oh wait I hear something
 spinning, a fluke, yea that was a fluke. I'm sitting back ready to game my face off on this new console. Wait, error message again? Make sure I'm using a..... NOOOO, what the hell. Ok, ok, maybe it's a bad disc, it's happened before right. Try the next disc.
 Ok, here we go, I'll just take that bad game disc back tomorrow. Good thing I still have.... wait.... make sure I'm using an Xbox one game disc. Ok, this is a joke right?</p>
<p>So what is my next logical step. Do I just begin cursing like a child in front of my wife (who by the way is heated because of the money I just spent on a defective machine) or do I take a deep breath, stay calm, and as they say carry on. I'll try the latter.
 So I go online to xbox.com, surely I'll find some solution. Hmm... here it is.. try powering down the system by holding the power button for ten seconds, then unplug the power chord in the back for three minutes, and then try again. Not sure how doing a restart
 will help but let's give it a shot. Alright powering up, disc inserted, I hear a spin, here we go, controller in hand, legs up in recliner, wife still looking at me in utter disgust and confusion, and... make sure I'm using an Xbox One game. You've got to
 be kidding me. In what world am I'm living in. Two game discs, neither are working, and there seems to be no resolution.</p>
<p>Ok, so, I'll try online support. But first let me register my console to check warranty status. Finally find the repair and warranty section after ten minutes of searching the website, input serial number, warrant expired November 2014. Now to be fair I
 did buy my Xbox one from a small mom and pop game shop. The seal on the back was not broken and I made sure to test it out at the shop before purchasing. Everything worked fine (it played every game disc I tried) there and I was happy to part with the money
 I had just spent. And in no way did they try to sell as new or refurbished. It was clearly marked as used and that was fine with me. I love supporting small businesses. So back to the matter at hand of the warranty, Son of a..... Oh, but for the low price
 of $125 I can send it off myself and they will attempt to fix it. Let me try online tech support. So I get Arlon on tech support. Nice enough guy. He's walking me through everything, we're having a grand time. Arlon then says “yea you may need to send it in.”
 As I'm typing the words, “is this under an extended warranty or do I have to pay,” the chat room crashes, kicks me out and says error page not found. Guess what never got an email from Arlon providing a link to the chat room or a help ticket I could reference
 for the next guy. I try accessing the chat again, maybe I can get someone else on and start over. Oh wait xbox.com is now saying sorry page not found we're moving things around. So now I say let's go to a message board oh wait, those have moved, lets spend
 ten minutes trying to find where to post then. So here I am, posting in a feedback forum which may not even be the right place because Microsoft has not provided a section for situations like this.</p>
<p>To state I'm frustrated is an understatement. I have spent countless dollars to play and maintain an Xbox live gold account. I have spent numerous dollars downloading content, and supporting Microsoft. Even when everyone said, “Oh go with the competitor,
 their network is free.” I would say no I'm an Xbox fan boy, I love the controller and the support I get from them if something goes wrong. I defended Microsoft when they announced they would no longer allow you to buy used games as each would come with a certificate
 imbedded and only allow the game to be registered once. I defended Microsoft on the price of the Xbox One, saying, “It's more expensive but overall the machine is better.” But this, this I can not defend. I've got an Xbox that won't do the one thing it was
 intended to do, play game discs. What's worse is if I want it fixed I now I have to pay for an error and manufacturing defect which I could not for see or cause. Now some would say go back to the Mom and Pop shop you bought it from get a refund. As I stated
 before it worked just fine there. Plus I see no difference in purchasing a clearly working, albeit used, machine at a mom and pop shop as opposed to a big box store. At the end of the day the *** thing should do what it's intended to do, read game discs. If
 the seal on the back was broken I'd give ya that. I'd say my fault I got hosed. I'll learn from it. But the security seal is still there. This machine has not been tampered with.</p>
<p>This open letter is designed so that hopefully someone somewhere will read it and realize that sending out machines that are already defective hoping they make it past their warranty date, so you can turn around and take another $125 from the consumer is
 cruel, deceitful and worst of all immoral. I understand big business, I understand a profit must be made, but when you're asking a consumer to shell out $400 plus dollars on a machine that doesn't even make it 6 months. Come on now. The fact that I have to
 sit here and type this rather than enjoy the video games I've purchased is ludicrous. Microsoft you should be ashamed you've allowed this type of service and product to be sold and representative of your company. I hope someone somewhere reads this and contacts
 me. I do want to resolve this. I love the Xbox I always have. It's not the machines fault, its just a machine. I want to make this right and don't want to go with the competitor. But, sadly, the time may have come where I finally break down and give the other
 guy a try, discontinue my 6 year plus membership, and say see ya later old friend it was fun while it lasted. If I get no response then it is what it is, I tried, I gave my best effort to make the first step in attempting to come to a resolution. I'll have
 no regrets. And I'm sure losing one customer is not going to kill Microsoft, after all another young man is coming into the video game years and will say, “Mommy I want an Xbox,” and some poor mother will go out and by Johnny that $400 machine for the first
 time and I'll be replaced. A fart in the wind. As fast I came I disappeared, poof. Sorry for the long winded message but my frustration level has hit an all time high. Thank you for those that read this and thank you to those who may find some sort of enjoyment
 or entertainment from it. Thank you.</p>
<p>Sincerely,&nbsp;<br />
A disgruntled gamer.</p>

<p>Hey you can always try going digital. That's how I buy my games. All digital from XBOX LIVE STORE. That why I don't have to worry about the disk getting scratched/damaged or Xbox not recognizing my games. Currently I've bought about 4 games all digitally.
 And they all run fine all the time. </p>

<p><span>With Autoruns you can uncheck an item, which disables it from starting, or you can right click an item and then delete it. If you uncheck you can recheck to re-enable the item. It is a much safer approach than editing the Registry and better than using

<h2>            XBOX does not recognize my ethernet cable</h2>
                    
<p>When I turn on my xbox it usually connects automatically, however, it does not. I try to test the xbox live connection but when I get to the screen that asks me if I'm using a "wired" or "wireless" connection, I select "wired" and a message pops up telling
 me to make sure that my ethernet cable is connected to the xbox and a router or modem(which it is).&nbsp; I powered everything down and then back up and the same result. Then I tried a new ethernet cable and nothing changed. I'm beginning to think there is a problem
 with the ethernet port on my xbox elite. </p>
<p>What should I do?</p>
<p>I've never had a problem for over a year with xbox live until I went on vacation for a week and came back and I couldn't connect.</p>
<p>I use a wired connection straight to my Motorola modem. I unplug my connection occationally to get other devises internet. So my xbox ethernet cable was not pluged into the modem for about a week.</p>

<p>The Motorola modem is most likely for cable internet yes? So it only has one port. If that port works on other devices like the computer you used to post here then like I said try it at a friends house or get a brand new ethernet cord from a store.</p>

<p>I've encountered almost the same issue today (07/14). &nbsp; We disconnected the XBOX from power (after using it for 2hours with no issues) to prevent damage during lightening storm. &nbsp;When we plug back in, XBOX not recognizing the Ethernet cable. &nbsp; Internet works
 fine. &nbsp;Changed ports on the router with no luck. &nbsp;Did MS download an 'update' recently that only took effect upon a reboot ? &nbsp; The cable works (tested it on a laptop). &nbsp;Desktop is wired and is what I'm using to type this. &nbsp; Did XBox's NIC go bad ? &nbsp; (Note:
 this is an Xbox we got from MS in their 'advanced exchange program" when our original got the 3RRoD)</p>

            Hi Surfertm 
<br />
<br />This 'blurry' screen is a new 'Feature' in version 1903 called Acrylic and it is certainly dividing opinion
<br />
<br />There is no actual setting to disable that at the moment, however judging by the number of users asking to remove the blur, most likely Microsoft will add the ability to remove the new Acrylic in a future update
<br />
<br />
<br />There is a registry fix to remove that, click the link below, on that page scroll down to 'Option 2'
<br />
<br />Download 'Disable_acrylic_blur_effect_on_Sign-in_sceen_background.reg'
<br />
<br />When that downloads, right click that file and choose 'Merge' then confirm the merge
<br />
<br />That will safely remove the blur for you . . .

She wants to buy my son an Xbox gift voucher for his birthday.<br /><br />I have just red on here from an old thread that any gift voucher has to be bought in the currency in is going to be spent in, but she says the website doesn't give her the option to change the currency from British pounds to Swedish Kronor.<br /><br />How is she supposed to purchase a gift card for him so it can be used in the right currency?<br /></p>

                    <p>I&nbsp;recieved my Surface pro today. After I recharged and turned it on, I realized that I was&nbsp;not able to use the touch input. I though it was a software problem&nbsp;so I installed the newest firmware and all Updates. But nothing happend. The Stylus works though.</p>
<p>The hardware manager does not show any faulty device nor faulty drivers. The system window shows that only the Pen is available. It is like if someone completely forgot to add the touch sensors.</p>
<p>How can I fix this issue? It is hopefully just a software failure.</p>

            <p>It does have the conflict with the drivers from the windows update ad the driver directly from intel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The graphics driver might have a bug or the touch driver.</p>
<p>The touch is also activated if I deactivate the graphics driver then logoff... After I log on again, I can activate the graphics driver again. Both graphics and touch will work normally after that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I'm ok for now... But MS or Intel should fix this bug... Could be something that happens more in the future.</p>

    <title>Upgrading from Windows 2000 to Vista - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Upgrading from Windows 2000 to Vista</h2>
                    Yes, I am trying to determine if I should install windows vista after using Windows 2000 for the past eight years.&nbsp; When XP came out I could see no reason to change because XP could not do anything more than Windows 2000.&nbsp; Now vista is out and from everything
 ever written about it, it cannot do anything more than Windows 2000.&nbsp; Even though voice activation has been fully successful since 1995, I heard vista does not come with it.&nbsp; Even though DVD video software has been free for many many years, vista does not
 come with it.&nbsp; Even though windows 2000 has the easiest menu system ever created, vista does not support the windows 2000 menu system.&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows 2000 starts, opens all programs instantly, works with the internet, and runs all programs perfectly right now, in
 2008, they have made another OS.&nbsp; Why did they make XP and vista?<br />
<br />
So, why would anyone load another version of a OS after the first one works perfectly?&nbsp; I have never understood this.&nbsp; Please help.

<p>Greetings. I have an issue that I encountered while installing selenium locally and when I try to run PHP.&nbsp; I started installing the Selenium locally. While doing so, I am getting the access denial messages, and&nbsp; I do not have access permissions to change
 anything that I installed under Program Files though I have administartot prevlieges. The work around&nbsp; found is to install all the software in the Local drive under C in any folder other than the folder " Program files". I have turned off the UAC and restarted
 the system then the selenium server is up and running. But, when I run the PHP batch file&nbsp; in the command prompt, I am getting the "CLI is not working message". Still&nbsp; I am not able to figure out why it is happening.&nbsp;Can some one help??</p>
<p>1. USing windows 7 OS.</p>
<p>2. Problem encountered while running the PHP script in the command prompt.</p>
<p>3. Error message: CLI has stopped working.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            You might want to contact Selenium support about this find about compatibility with Windows 7, updates, patches or a new version that works with the operating system.

<p>Hi Thomas,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please re-confirm if that user was off-line when the group message came at that time. If so, the next time when the user signs in, he will be notified with the missed message. Actually, the user can try seeing the missed message via the Skype for Business
 client's Conversations (Missed) option. </p>
