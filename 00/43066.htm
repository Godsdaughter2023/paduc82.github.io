<h2>            Windows 10 not functioning, start menu won&#39;t work, no programs opening.</h2>
                    <p>Just wanted to start off by saying I have no clue if this is the right place for me to post this, and if it isn't, my bad.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So I've had this computer for about 2 years now with no issues like&nbsp;the one I'm experiencing now. I had issues with my cpu cooler, had to rma it and wait three months to get the cooler. I instantly started to install it and get the system up and running.</p>
<p>Everything looked fine, the computer booted up, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But once I got into Windows, all the programs I had were missing from the background (Idk if that's the correct terminology). On top of that, whenever I try to use the taskbar, a loading symbol appears on my pointer. I can't access the start menu. I tried
 to restart windows and see if that would fix the issue, but task manager won't open. (No program will, actually)</p>
<p>I've seen some people having similar issues to mine, but they could still access the start menu/open programs up, and in order to use their fixes, I would need to be able to access that stuff.</p>

<p>1. It's a desktop.</p>
<p>2. I made it about 2 years ago. It has a 2 tb sshd. The motherboard is an msi z97 gaming 5, and I'm using an Intel i7 4790k.</p>
<p>3. I think it's Pro.</p>
<p>4. Can't check because I can't open up my settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot open file explorer. When i click on it, something comes across my screen for a split second, then disappears. Not exactly sure what it is.</p>

            Sometimes The Start Menu, Cortana or the Taskbar may behave in unexpected ways. To resolve you may use the following troubleshooter<br /><br /><a href="http://aka.ms/diag_StartMenu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://aka.ms/diag_StartMenu</a><br /><br />If that fails you can try re-registering your Start Menu/Cortana<br /><br />1. On the search bar, type powershell.<br />2. From the list, right-click on Windows PowerShell and select Run as administrator.<br />3. On the new window that will appear, type the following command: Get-appxpackage -all *shellexperience* -packagetype bundle |% {add-appxpackage -register -disabledevelopmentmode ($_.installlocation + “\appxmetadata\appxbundlemanifest.xml”)}<br />4. Reboot your computer and see if the Start menu will work again.<br /><br /><br />If this does not work you can reinstall by entering the following into the Admin Command Prompt<br /><br />$manifest = (Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.Windows.Cortana).InstallLocation + '\AppxManifest.xm

<h2>            Skype is worse.</h2>
                    <p>Hello. This new version of Skype is the worst i ever&nbsp; use it. Calls are drops automatically, the other person did not hear me well is like a robotic voice and of course hear every sound of my PC, everything. Bring back the old Skype with those settings.
 My problem is not my PC and of course not my broadband. What can i do? I reinstalled i even formated my PC and still does that. Bring back those old settings from old Skype or i stop using this software and move on other platform. Thanks!</p>

            <p><span>Hi Rovin,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. When you say “</span><span>system automatically disables the master volume..” and “no audio devices”, are you unable to get sound from headset also?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Are you facing the issue only after connecting the headset?</span></p>
<p><span>3. Where are you checking for the audio devices? </span></p>
<p><span>5. What is the complete message you are receiving?</span></p>
<p><span>6. What is the make and model of the computer?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When you plug in a headset, you won’t be able to get sound simultaneously from the system and headset.
</span></p>
<p><span>When you connect the headset, the headset becomes the default audio device and will be able to get sound from the headset.</span></p>
<p><span>If you are facing issues to get sound from the computer inbuilt speakers and headset, then you may try the following steps and check.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You may try running the audio troubleshooter and check.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows/no-sound-help#no-sound=windows-8&amp;v1h=win8tab3&amp;v2h=win7tab1&amp;v3h=winvistatab1&amp;v4h=winxptab1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">No sound in Windows
</a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p>Show Disabled devices and Set speaker as default audio device and check.</p>
<p>If you want to get sound from the headset, then you try the following steps and need to select headset as the default audio device.</p>
<p><span>a. </span><span>a. Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong> on the desktop screen of the computer. Select
<strong>Control panel.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>b. Click in <strong>Sound</strong>, then a new window will open up.</span></p>
<p><span>c. In the new windows click on the tab “<strong>Playback</strong>" and right click on the empty space and click on
<strong>Show Disabled devices</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Now check if Speaker is listed there and right click on it and choose
<strong>Enable</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>e. Highlight speaker and click on "<strong>Set as Default</strong>".</span></p>

    <title>Microphone volume keeps being set to 40&#37; when user makes a Skype - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bawta  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microphone volume keeps being set to 40&#37; when user makes a Skype call</h2>
                    This issue happens to any users who have&nbsp; Logitech G430 headphones. The box to allow applications to alter your settings has been un-ticked and the button to lower all other sounds when a call is made is set to 'do nothing'. Logitech have said to try and
 find a solution as they don't think it's their issue. I disagree and think it IS their issue but am looking for other opinions/suggestions. I should also point out that this only happens in Skype and Skype for Business, no other conference apps are affected.
 This is also not in Office 365 but that is the only option I am allowed to select.

<p>Hello Bawta,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For your situation, I suggest you first try the following methods and see if it can be helpful:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: Manually turn up the mic gain</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Type in “Sound” in the Search box and select <strong>Sound</strong> (<strong>Control</strong>
<strong>Panel</strong>) from the list.</li><li>Select the <strong>Recording</strong> tab.</li><li>Right-click (or tap and hold) on the active microphone input device and select
<strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Select the Levels tab.</li><li>Manually drag the <strong>Microphone</strong> gain to a higher level and click
<strong>Apply</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:Check your microphone’s drivers</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Type in “<strong>Device</strong> <strong>Manager</strong>” in the Search box and select it from the list.</li><li>Expand <strong>Sound, video and game controllers</strong></li><li>Right-click (or tap and hold) your microphone device and select <strong>Update Driver Software</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Search automatically for updated driver software</strong>.&nbsp; This option will scan the Internet for the correct version of the driver or determine if you already have the most recent driver installed.&nbsp; You may be prompted to restart your computer
 to install the driver.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, I’d like to confirm whether this issue only occurs to the Logitech G430 headphones. I suggest you try using the certified devices for Skype for business and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
I turn the volume up manually anyway but it always drops back down to 40% as soon as a user makes a Skype call.<br />
<br />
All drivers are up to date and have been uninstalled and re-installed to be sure.<br />
<br />
The issue only seems to be with Skype or Skype for business users who have these headphones. As I said, Logitech said it wasn't their fault but I'm not convinced. The problem is we have at least 40 of these headphones deployed in our business so replacing them
 isn't really an option as they were £50 each.

            Hi Bawta,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your updates. According to your updated information, we are unable to confirm if this issue is related to this specific type of Logitech headphones. In this case, we suggest you try to use other headphones to test if this issue will occur as well.
 This will help to confirm if this issue is related to the headphones device or the Skype for Business client.<br />
<br />
Besides, we suggest you make sure the headphones you want to use for audio input and output in Skype for Business is selected in Audio Device Settings options page and adjust the Audio Device setting of Skype for Business (Click the triangle icon next to the
 gear icon &gt; select <strong>Tools</strong> &gt; <strong>Audio Device Settings</strong>).<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Jay

            Hi,<br />
<br />
The setting sare all correct for the headphones to be used. Audio plays through them and the mic does work but it gets set back to 40% so it's REALLY quiet until manually turned up again. Other headphones don't get this issue BUT the Logitech headphones don't
 get the issue with any other application. We use Starleaf and BlueJeans as well as Skype and they both work fine with the Logitech headphones so I'm not sure if it's an issue with the headphones themselves, possibly just between them and Skype?

            Hi Bawta,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your updates and effort. Based on the troubleshooting of this issue, as other headphones work well, this specific Logitech headphones work well in other applications, except Skype for Business, and this type headphones is not included in the Skype
 for Business qualified &amp; Certified devices list, it might be related to the compatibility between the Skype for Business client and this Logitech type headphones.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
As I quite understand how you feel when you meet such a specific problem, I suggest you try to seek help by contacting the Logitech related support again and it’s recommended for you to
<a href="https://www.skypefeedback.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">submit a feedback</a> about it in the Skype for Business related page. Your time and understanding are highly appreciated.<br />
<br />

<h3> judge  say:</h3>
<h2>            Compatible HTML5 games on Xbox One</h2>
                    
<p>So there's a new site that is compiling HTML5 games that work on the internet browser with Xbox controller. New games will be added regularly as people find them, so help out by submitting any games that work well on the console.
<br />
<br />
Basically, go to the site below, pin this site to your dash, and then click on any game and there's no need to type in the web address via this method of using the site :).<br />
<br />
<a href="http://xboxie.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://xboxie.com/</a><br />
<br />
<br />
I submitted a game, Lava Blade which works great with the controller, so I've contributed already :P.</p>

<h2>            Crossfade on WMP12 doesn&#39;t work properly</h2>
                    Crossfade on WMP12 doesn't work properly.&nbsp; All songs are mp3s not copy protected.&nbsp; Try it on one of your machines.&nbsp; Set the crossfade to 10 seconds and play a few songs and watch the counter count up.&nbsp; As it crossfades to the second song, when the counter
 starts on the second song it should already be at 0:10 due to the crossfading, but it starts at 0:00 and then will play 0:10 of silence at the end of the second song before fading into the next song, as the counter was off from the beginning of the track.&nbsp;
 I have experienced this problem on 5 different computers running windows 7 with wmp12.&nbsp; Didn't have this problem on Vista with WMP11.&nbsp; I have also been able to recreate this problem on windows 7 machines at Best Buy, so it isn't my hardware that is causing
 the issue.&nbsp; I cannot get the crossfading to work properly on any windows 7 with WMP12 machine I have tried.

    <title>vgaoem.fon recovery problems using USB boot drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> derekjc  say:</h3>
<h2>            vgaoem.fon recovery problems using USB boot drive</h2>
                    <p>An error appeared during startup stating ' \windows\system\vgaoem.fon' was missing or corrupt. After researching the cause of this I found the thread detailing using the recovery console to restore this file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunatley my CD drive doesn't work so I created a bootable USB using my windows installation CD. I successfully opened recovery console however when I used the 'map' command I could not locate the USB device, only the CD and floppy drives were found?
 Is there a seperate procedure for allowing access to a USB device within&nbsp;recovery console?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also because this failed I tried copying a vgaoem.fon file from a different computer onto floppy and attempted to copy it directly using 'copy a:\vgaoem.fon c:windows\system' within recovery console however it generated a 'the system cannot find the file
 specified' error?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be much appreciated!</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>If you mean you are seeing a message like this:<br />
<br />
<em>Windows could not start because the following file is missing or corrupt:</em><br />
<em>\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\vgaoem.fon</em><br />
<br />
<em>You can attempt to repair this file by starting Windows Setup using the original Setup CD-ROM.</em><br />
<em>Select 'r' at the first screen to start.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can't access the floppy (or many other folders on your HDD) from the XP Recovery Console</p>
<p>unless your system has been set up in advance through a local security policy or in the registry to allow such things (and most&nbsp; systems are not).<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>To do so, you would have to enter this command:<br />
</p>
<p>To access files on a floppy or USB you would need to enter this command:<br />
<br />
<strong>set&nbsp; AllowRemovableMedia&nbsp; =&nbsp; TRUE</strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; (it is NOT removEablemedia, there is no
<strong>E</strong>).<br />
<br />
To allow access to other folders you would need to enter this command:<br />
<br />
<strong>set &nbsp; allowallpaths&nbsp; =&nbsp; TRUE</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not have the security policy set up in advance (most people don't), you will see a message like this when entering the SET commands:<br />
<br />
<em>The SET command is currently disabled. The SET command is only an option Recovery Console command that can only be enabled by using the the Security Configuration and Analysis snap-in...</em><br />
<br />
From the security policy, you can also tell XP not to require a password for the RC.&nbsp; This is good if somebody can't get past the prompt for Administrator password or just to save time.<br />
<br />
Here is a link that tells you more about these variables and the SET command:<br />
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_xp-system/vgaoemfon-recovery-problems-using-usb-boot-drive/See%20here:%20%20http://support.microsoft.com/kb/235364">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/235364</a><br />
<a href="http://winhlp.com/node/78" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://winhlp.com/node/78</a><br />
<br />
If you are going to use any SET commands in the Recovery Console (and want them to work), you need to have previously set up the security options to allow the use of the SET command in the Recovery Console.&nbsp; You can do this in a variety of ways, but GPEdit
 is what I use (won't work on XP Home of course - so you will have to do it in the Registry by hand).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what you should do is make a Hiren's boot USB since it does not have these limitations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am going to recommend you use Hiren's boot CD (it will also go on a USB flash/thumb stick/drive).<br />
<br />
This is good for you because it has many more tools on it that on the XP Recovery Console CD, does not care about your Administrator passwords and you will not have to futz around in your BIOS if any afflicted system has SATA drives - Hiren's can deal with
 that.<br />
<br />
You will have a whole bunch of cool tools that you don't have in the XP Recovery Console...&nbsp; a registry editor, password resetter, and a desktop that looks like Windows XP so you will feel comfortable maneuvering.<br />
<br />
You can also easily copy your personal data (documents, images, music) to an external drive.<br />
<br />
From a working system, first download the latest version on Hiren's Boot CD from here (it is a substantial download but worth it):<br />
<a href="http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (look near the bottom of the page).<br />
<br />
Unzip the Hiren's to some folder where you can find it.&nbsp; There is a Hiren's.BootCD.15.x.iso in there that you are going to need next.<br />
<br />
Hiren's has instructions to make a bootable USB that you can use, but it requires you to first burn the .iso to a CD and some other steps, so I suggest another way and here's how:<br />
<br />
Download RUFUS 1.4.x or whatever the latest version is from here (read some stuff on the page so you can know more about it):<br />
<br />
<a href="http://rufus.akeo.ie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://rufus.akeo.ie/</a><br />
<br />
I will caution you to be careful that you don't accidentally format any of your hard drives - be sure your USB stick is in and know what the drive letter is!&nbsp; This part always makes me a little nervous, so be careful.<br />
<br />
Launch RUFUS and all the defaults should be okay, for the Device, choose your USB drive letter, Quick format, FAT32, label it if you want to and in the Format options box, click the little icon that looks like a CD and a window will open.&nbsp; Navigate that dialogue
 to point to the folder that contains the Hiren's.BootCD.15.x.iso that you unzipped earlier and the box should change to say ISO image (RUFUS understands the Hiren's ISO file).<br />
<br />
Double check you have the right Device selected in the top (NOT you HDD) Click Start, acknowledge the warning and let it finish (it will take a little while) as it copies the files.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Hiren's ISO is also good size.<br />
<br />
When RUFUS is done, it will say 'DONE' in the bottom.<br />
<br />
Put the USB stick in the afflicted machine and reset/reboot and press whatever key you need to press to get to a boot menu where you can select the USB as the first boot device (that is F11 for me).&nbsp; If you don't see a boot menu choice, you will have to adjust
 your BIOS to boot from the USB first instead of the HDD.<br />
<br />
When the Hiren's menu comes up, choose the Mini XP Mode and it will start loading (slowly from a USB drive) and eventually you should see a Windowsy looking desktop.&nbsp; You should recognize that part and feel comfortable, but it is not your desktop - it is the
 Hiren's desktop!<br />
<br />
Remember:&nbsp; You did not boot on your hard disk - you booted into the Hiren's desktop.</p>

                    <p>The following method (seen on web pages within Microsoft Community) does not work:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p><strong>To install a font, follow these steps:</strong></p>

<li>
<p>Press Windows +R</p>

<p>Type the following command, and then click OK: %windir%\fonts</p>
</li><li>
<p>On the File menu, click Install New Font.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>The reason for this is that in Control Panel - All Control Panel Items - Fonts, the only options available on the File menu are Create Shortcut (greyed out), Delete, Rename, Properties and Close.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Mail Password Update Issue</h2>
                    <p>To Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I logged into my Hotmail account via a web browser, I was asked to change it, I did change it.&nbsp; I then went to change the password on my Windows 10 Surface and my Windows 10 Phone but I cannot find anywhere on each where I can just type in the new password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any one have any ideas how this is done on Windows 10 pro and Win10 Mobile???</p>

<h2>            msvcr71.dll&#34; file is missing</h2>
                    <p>I've recently updated Microsoft Essentials Movie Maker &amp; Photogallery 12 and am now getting a "msvcr71.dll" file is missing from my computer.</p>
<p>I am running Windows 7 and I Norton Internet Security.&nbsp; I update both on a very regular basis.</p>
<p>I have never had a problem with this machine prior to updating the MovieMaker.&nbsp; When I got the error I uninstalled and reinstalled from scratch but continue to get the same error.&nbsp; I've used the command prompt to do the scannow and it didn't find any problems.&nbsp;
 I've given my computer a complete scan with my updated antivirus and no problems.&nbsp; I've run the Microsoft Windows update and all is up to date.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other than Movie Maker &amp; Photogallery 12, I am having no problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;What next?</p>

            download advanced system care, switch it to advanced mode, and scan. That will fix all your registry issues, thus probably fixing that dll issue.

<p>Modem with Wifi I believe. though the adapter I got counts itself as wired, when it's really a wire that leads to a wireless adapter, I've looked through both Wired and Wireless connection issue fixes. and nothing has worked</p>

<p>Hello, me again,</p>
<p>You could try to Reset Network Settings to Factory defaults. To do this:</p>
<p>On the Xbox Home Screen, Navigate to Settings, go to System, Select Network Settings, Click on your Network setup. Now go to Configure network, Scroll right and click on Reset Network Settings to Factory defaults. Now try to connect to Xbox Live.</p>
<p>If the above solution doesn't work, you could try the solutions here as this might contain useful fixes.</p>

            Hi Clinkre, this may be worth a try . . .
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset       
        </p>

            A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />
<br />Once you are able to boot into safe mode, check the integrity of the system
<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be to Go back to the previous Build - 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Go back to the previous Build
<br />
<br />E. Otherwise, you can resort to below

    <title>Issues Connecting to Older Monitor - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tlamberton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issues Connecting to Older Monitor</h2>
                    I was given an older monitor from my dad to pair with my laptop to help make my workflow go smoother while I work at my desk from home. The monitor is a ViewSonic VE710s with a VGA cord. My laptop is a 2014 Dell Latitude E6440 and I'm running Windows 10
 Pro 64 bit. I'm not getting a "No Signal" message on the monitor when I plug the VGA cord into my laptop but I'm not able to see my display on the monitor, even when switching between "Duplicate Display" and "Extend Display" on Settings on my laptop. I've
 tried updating, unistalling/reinstalling, and rolling back my display driver. When I try to detect the monitor, it says "Didn't detect another display". I've tried searching for a driver for the monitor but no such luck. Could it just be that the monitor is
 too old to be able to be used with my laptop? Any suggestions would be appreciated!

I'm so fed up it's become part of my daily Microsoft Life, Almost like a Vicious foreign pathogen. And It's comes In&nbsp;<br />
The earth shattering form of Windows 10... What a Useless and Pointless system you not only create new bugs just by a single&nbsp;<br />
Update yet fail to upload any video's on the topics and simply send out the same keystroked auto message to your users&nbsp;<br />
I have no need to do what any of these comments say (In General) As I'm not a tech guy nor do I want to be.. I can't&nbsp;<br />
Stress that enough.. I do very little on my Laptop and Never reach my full C:Drive Limit, As I type now I have 910GB..&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
#Current_Operating_System:&nbsp;<br />

Little Old Faithful I like to call It.. Collecting Dust Like a Dinosaur&nbsp;<br />
Good Job I kept It As Well Because.. What a daily/weekly/Monthly/Minutely\ Hurricane you Microsoft Create&nbsp;<br />
For all your User's with your sneaky auto updates, Ass, Tracking, Spyware &amp; More However.. We are here to talk about&nbsp;<br />
WINDOWS-UPDATES!&nbsp;<br />
--------------------------------------------&nbsp;<br />
You are literally killing my baby.. You are legit killing my Laptop with your updates... What a complete joke&nbsp;<br />
I have to reset laptop all the time due to your Anniversary Upate, and what ever else you force upon us, to the&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Intel(R) Management Engine Interface 11.0.0.1181 WHAT Should not be Installed as User's need 9.5.24.1790&nbsp;<br />
The List Really Is Endless The Amount Of Videos/Topics\Help Request to people buying new laptops and 2 days&nbsp;<br />
Later Windows 10 Failing them I mean Its annoying.. I'm at my end with you now at my limit All I want to DO&nbsp;<br />
Is enjoy my time when I use MYLAPTOP and not have to worry about what the next update will do .. I can't stress&nbsp;<br />
this enough IT'S NOT US! IT'S YOU! Leave Us Alone.. Stop this madness and above all else have a team test the&nbsp;<br />
updates for a month before you ever publish them, It's time for you to get a endless bootloop, System Crashing&nbsp;<br />
Blue Screen's and general Lagg/Sickness\ Ok? We want to have fun and enjoy this 2018 #STEPITUP&nbsp;<br />
<br />
And Before your Generic Reply, I took my Laptop to the shop Already He said it's perfect It's beyond fast and there is 0.00 Tech Issues with it,<br />
AND GIVE ME A NEW HARDRIVE because he felt so bad for me finally getting a new laptop 11 Years Later and Having Issues each Widows Update! So for once<br />
Microsoft Listen.. And leave us alone. I mean it.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thank you,&nbsp;<br />

<p>You sound just like me not so long ago. I seemed to mess up my computer on a weekly basis. When I tried to fix my mess, that only made it worse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally I got fed up with my own ineptitude and resolved to learn how to use a computer the right way. It was not easy, at least not for me. But I worked hard at it, and now I don't have any trouble with Windows 10 or updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not accusing you of being inept, I'm only saying that when you know how to run a computer the right way, and you understand how technology works, the problems are few and far between.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even after you become the family computer expert, there's still plenty not to like about Windows 10, and the software industry in general. But at least your computer will work well.</p>

<p>I apologize for I do not remember how I did it. I got pissed off because their win 10 kept auto updating on me and putting incorrect drivers on me needless to say it is a real pain to go through everything and manually reset. But there is a way to stop auto-update.
 it was long time ago when I did it, I have mine at version1511 (OS build 10586.545) maybe somebody knows how to do it just for the life of me I cant remember.

<p>How would you like to never need to do a clean install of Windows 10 ever again - unless you want to? It's easy when you know how to backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You'll need image backup software to do this, and you'll need to spend some time learning how to use it. Once you're up to speed, do this:</p>

<p>2- After the installation has completed, run Windows Update until the computer is completely up to date. Make a note of the most recent installed update.</p>
<p>3-&nbsp;<em>Make an image backup of your C: drive.</em> The image backup is an exact copy of your hard drive at that point in time. It will take about 15 minutes for the software to make the image. Store the image on an external hard drive.</p>
<p>4- The next time you feel the need to re-install Windows 10, <em>don't do it</em>. Instead, restore the backup image that you made, which will also take about 15 minutes. When you restore the image, the computer literally goes back in time to when the image
 was made.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Isn't that so much better than spending a day re-installing everything?</p>
<p>
</p><p>After some time goes by, you might want to revise the original backup so it includes the updates to Windows that were released since you made the original backup. Watch how easy it is to do that:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1- Make a backup image of your computer as it is now.</p>
<p>2- Restore the backup of the original clean install.</p>
<p>3- Run Windows Update until the computer is completely up to date, again taking note&nbsp;of the most recent installed update.</p>
<p>4- Make an image of your newly updated computer, and store the image on an external hard drive.</p>
<p>5- Restore the image you made in step 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's it! Why would anyone want to waste time on recovery disks and reinstalling when backup image software makes it so easy to recover your computer from trouble?</p>

<h3> paint horses  say:</h3>
<h2>            want to work quickbooks on a flash drive </h2>
                    as it is right now, we have quickbooks downloaded onto our desktop and are using a flash drive to back up our work; what we want to do, it put quickbooks on the flash drive so save hard drive space and remove it from desktop; just have the entire quickbooks
 program on the flash drive; plug the flash drive in, do our quickbooks work, then, save, then keep all the information on the flash drive; what would be the best way to accomplish this?

<p><span>Hi Paint horses,</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers community.</span></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately you cannot do this with the QuickBooks application.
<span>&nbsp;</span>When the program is installed it will be associated with certain registries on windows. These are the entries that are created by the program and many of these registries get associated with Windows registries for their proper operation. There
 are certain portable applications that can be installed on the flash drive; unfortunately QuickBooks is not one of them. I would also recommend you to contact QuickBooks publishers for more information.</span></p>
<p><br />
<span>Let us know if this helps.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
Sreekanth.</span></p>

    <title>Microsoft Sculpt Comfort Desktop Wireless USB Keyboard and Mouse - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microsoft Sculpt Comfort Desktop Wireless USB Keyboard and Mouse Warranty</h2>
                    <p>The problem is the left mouse button doesn't always work correctly.&nbsp; Sometimes the click is not registered and sometimes is double clicks when I single left click.&nbsp; Sometimes when I drag a window, the window is dropped by the mouse and the arrow continues
 on.&nbsp; I even have trouble highlighting text that I'm wanting to copy.&nbsp; Have found if I click the very tip of the left mouse button, I can get the click to be registered more often.&nbsp; I feel this is a hardware issue with the left click button.&nbsp; I don't think
 there is a way to take this mouse apart without breaking it open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm looking to get my wireless mouse fixed or replaced under the warranty for Model: L3V-00001, which is three years.</p>
<p>I called into support already and he checked the drivers and software for this set, which I already did, and even had me reboot the PC.&nbsp; This didn't help as I though it wouldn't.&nbsp; I have had a wired mouse on my PC for the last 24 hours and have not had a
 problem.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Support told me to call Best Buy where I purchased it from.&nbsp; I bought this in December of 2016 I told him.&nbsp; He didn't seem to understand the warranty process.&nbsp; He then said he would transfer me to some other group, but then the call was disconnected.&nbsp; How
 do I get to warranty without having to go through this whole process again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Nathan</p>

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />This page shows how to register and contact Support for the Sculpt Mouse hardware.  I'd pursue the Support number since it pins it down for that device which isn't always easy to do.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Thanks for your help Greg.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The link you sent me takes me to a MS webpage that has two options.</p>
<p>Option 1 is to register your product by going to another link.&nbsp; This link comes back with "Oops, this page isn't here"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Option 2 has me call the same place I called last time.&nbsp; This time I got someone that didn't insist on checking the drivers and software.&nbsp; She Checked with someone else and came back after a while and said I need to be transferred to another part of MS.&nbsp;
 She then told me she was going to transfer me and not to hang up.&nbsp; I said okay and thank you.&nbsp; I was then transferred into nothingness where I got disconnected again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If MS doesn't honor their warranty of there wireless mouse and keyboard sets, why do they say that there is a three year warranty?&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Unable to send VideoMessage in Skype with WebcamMax installed - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to send VideoMessage in Skype with WebcamMax installed</h2>
                    I have WebcamMax installed and set as my Video Settings for Skype. I can make and receive video calls with no problem. However, when I try to record a video message, I get the error Oops, something went wrong. Please try again, or get in touch if you need
 help. I have tried different cameras with the same message. I have updated the camera and Skype software and still receive the same message. I have even uninstalled everything, re-installed and still get same issue. I can switch back from WebcamMax and record
 a video. I have also tried several other video effects programs and had the same problem.

<p>Does this also happen on a fully updated system (drivers/OS) when the WebcamMax suite is not installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype isn't fond of Virtual cameras (or uesd to be anyway), nor old drivers. In most cases one of the two are the cuplrit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Latest Skype: http://www.skype.com/go/getskype-full</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, the exact error Message would be helpfull.</p>
<p>
</p><p>winkey+r &gt; dxdiag &gt; save information (32bit) &gt; attach the file here</p>
<p>(<strong>please update operating system and drivers manually before doing this</strong>).</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may not be able to post the result, but the output should give you a fair list of installed drivers and their dates and Devices. At the bottom of the output there is a error Message section, which may point you in the right direction.</p>
