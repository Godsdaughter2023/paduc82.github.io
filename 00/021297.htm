<h2>            Cannot Open Office documents locally from Sharepoint</h2>
                    
<p>I have Office 16 installed on my PC.&nbsp; When trying to open documents in Sharepoint, I get the following message: "Sorry, we couldn't open 'ms-word:ofv|u|<a href="https://file" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://file</a> path/file name.docx"</p>
<p><br />
I can open the document in the on line version of Office 365, but when selecting to open the document locally from Office 365, I get the same error message as above.</p>

<p>Hi DickMiller,</p>
<p>Thanks for your updates in the private message.</p>
<p>It seems that the issue you encountered now is different from the previous one. Could you capture a screenshot of the error message for us?</p>
<p>Also, please try to use different browsers to see if the issue persists.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

<h2>            Pictures, Figures, Images move when I print the document.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everytime I create a Word document that contains images or figures, this figures move from where I placed them. The print preview doesn't show this displacement. The images also move when I print the document in PDF format (printing or exporting to PDF).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1feb51e8-691c-424f-9609-718bb7408b70" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1feb51e8-691c-424f-9609-718bb7408b70" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The document is supposed to look like this (capture from print preview). But when I print it or export it to PDF it looks like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1efc4c54-fb62-4f51-9ee3-a8cfcc06278b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1efc4c54-fb62-4f51-9ee3-a8cfcc06278b" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried changing every setting I can and nothing seems to work. Any suggestions?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help,</p>
<p>M.G ~&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.D: Might be important to mention that I'm using XITS Math font for equation editor and Gentium Basic font for normal text (both of them downloaded from the web).</p>

<h2>            Nokia 6680 will not start &#47; power after long period of disuse</h2>
                    
<p>I have not used my Nokia 6680 for a couple of years. It was working perfectly when I put in the box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I needed the phone again and the phone will not start at all. I have tried holding the on button but it will not work and I see nothing on the screen - just blank.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also connect a USB cable and tried to see if it can pick up power from that (just in case my charger is faulty).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, read something about holding the 3 * and green phone button and pressing the on button, but that did not work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could it be that I need a brand new battery? Should I be able to turn the phone on, even though the mains charger?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any tips welcome....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            since 6680 is an old phone it would not support USB charging, therefore drawing power from the USB port would be impossible. in your case, it is most definite that the battery is indeed dead and does not muster even enough charge to power on, even with
 the mains charger plugged in. you most likely need to get a new battery yes, as all those years that you did not use the phone, the charge in the battery has decreased until there is nothing left.<br />

<p>Before you ditch the battery, try to keep the phone on the charger for&nbsp; a while (an hour or two) to see if it wakes up and starts charging.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            If the battery was kept <u>in</u> the phone while it was stored and not in use then it almost certainly needs replacing. The 6680 uses a BL-5C Li-Ion battery, and batteries using this chemistry should be stored half-charged
<u>out of the phone</u>. By leaving it in the phone you will have depleted it below its "comfort zone" and it now needs specialist equiment to recharge it, if it is at all possible.

<p>1. I tried leaving it to charge for a couple of hours. I could not even see the battery charge progress bar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Yes, I did leave the battery inside the phone when not used. Did not reliase it was a bad thing to do....</p>

<p>Will go down the shops and check out if someone a replacement battery.....&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            copying text styles from one Word doc to another</h2>
                    <p>How is this done? As usual with Word, I review several independent and Microsoft help pages and they tell me to use menus and/or ribbon items that don't appear on my screen. Is this because I am using Word on the Mac?
</p>

</p><p>FWIW I have an Office 365 subscription. Is it business or home? I haven't a clue. I think I have 5 licenses...which would make me think it is business. I work out of a home office.</p>

<p>One thing that isn't explicitly stated in the article is that when you click the

<p>
</p><p>If the Styles you want to copy are in Word <em>documents</em>, open the <strong>

            <p>Hi Sandrineeee,</p>
<p>Are you told that the login was successful on that particular address? </p>
<p>If you have Two-step Verification enabled, the&nbsp;attempts won't have a good chance, since&nbsp;even if the hacker was able to guess your password, they&nbsp;still cannot sign in as&nbsp;they'll be prompted for a security code which only you can get. There's not much else
 that you need to do at this point as the security feature is still protecting your account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone can attempt to login an account&nbsp;as long as they know the email address. Since the hacker knows yours,&nbsp;you can just change your email address so that the hacker won't be able to login again. But that would mean that when others send you an email,&nbsp;you
 won't get it as you've already renamed your account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So instead of changing your address, you can add in another email address and&nbsp;use that as a login. Microsoft allows you to have
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=263668" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
'aliases'</a>, meaning you can have more than one email address as your login, but still uses a single account. This also works for emails - you can have your contacts send you an email through different email addresses, but still goes to a single inbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What this means is that when you have another login, you can disable your old one so that the hacker can't login anymore. They'll be told that your account does not exist, even though it does, as you just disabled the login for it. You won't&nbsp;lose any contacts
 and emails, you won't need to tell them&nbsp;that you're renaming your address, everything will be the same except for one thing - you login using a different email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To do this:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Login your account at "https://account.live.com"</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;Click "Your Info" on top of the page.</p>
<p>3. Then, click on "Manage your sign-in email or phone number"</p>
<p>4. You may be asked for a code for further verification, please provide one to proceed.</p>
<p>5. Once you're at the&nbsp;aliases page, click on "Add email alias/Add phone number" (Yes, you can sign in using your phone number)</p>
<p>6. Type in the new email address or phone number that you want as the login for your account.
</p>
<p>7. Once you have it added, click on "Make Primary" next to it. This is necessary.</p>
<p>8. The old address won't be the Primary Alias anymore. Click on "Change sign-in preferences"&nbsp;</p>
<p>9. You will see that the new&nbsp;email/phone that you added cannot be unchecked, as it's your Primary Alias. You can&nbsp;uncheck&nbsp;the old&nbsp;email address that you have then click on "Save".</p>
<p>
</p><p>And there you have it, you disabled the login for your old address. You will now be using the new one as&nbsp;your login.&nbsp;</p>
        </p>

            Thank you so much Harry. I had a few email accounts I wanted to join and wasnt aware of how to do the aliases thing it's going to make my life so much easier. I don't think they can log in with the verification thing I have on my phone so i'm not so worried
 about it now. Also the attemps were unsuccessful however it's just that this person made the attempt several times.

    <title>Scripts needed for Outlook for Mac 2011 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mary schmetterling  say:</h3>
<h2>            Scripts needed for Outlook for Mac 2011</h2>
                    I'm now migrating from Entourage 2008 to Outlook for Mac 2011. &nbsp;I frequently use scripts on Entourage to accomplish the following:
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1) Change the name of the sender of a message I've received. &nbsp;I use this, for example, if the sender of the mail shows their name in a non-Roman alphabet (Chinese, etc) and I want their sender name to appear in my inbox in Roman letters. Or if I know the
 person by their nickname rather than their formal name. &nbsp;In both cases I want their sender name in my Outlook inbox to match the name I know them by.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>2) Change date and time sent of a received mail. &nbsp;Occasionally I use this script in Entourage if the clock on the sender's computer is set incorrectly and the message therefore appears in the wrong place in my inbox.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>3) Delay sending time. &nbsp;This script allows me to set the sending date and time of a mail to, say, the end of the week, or even sometime next year.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've searched everywhere online and haven't found these three scripts for Outlook yet. &nbsp;Can anyone help me find them? &nbsp;Or are there other non-script, time-efficient workabout solutions? &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you for any advice you can provide!</div>
<div><br />

                    <p>Hi, I'd like to use outlook.com as my primary email but still struggling through some setup stuff. &nbsp;Most are learned/resolved less this last one:</p>
<p>The sent box on my phone only shows emails sent from my phone. &nbsp;But online it shows all sent emails. &nbsp;How do I resolve this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried searching and found nothing except a thread about how the phones see sent or outboxes or vice versa but nobody had resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My setup </p>
<p>Android v4.4.2</p>
<p>Samsung Galaxy S4</p>
<p>Native email software via outlook exchange and ensure I have my dates setup properly so I should be getting these emails. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>I think I found the workaround... &nbsp;System date problems somewhere (yes, I'm an developer/IT guy so have to have a hypothesis)</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my phones sent box settings for dates to display:</p>
<p>- one month shows nothing sent from web</p>
<p>- automatic shows nothing sent from web</p>
<p>- all did pull up all emails!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, we know how to get it to workaround. &nbsp;I think next steps is for a partnership with Android and MS to figure out which date fields are being both interrogated (by Android) and populated (by MS) and this should drive this success and closure.</p>

                    After the recent Microsoft updates, I have several contacts (i.e. Rachael Ray, etc...) who's emails used to come in as html messages, but now they come in as 2 attachments (one is called attachment.pls and the other one is called attachment.html). Not
 sure how to get these back to html format. This is happening on all 3 of my pc's.

            So, an HTML email is resolved to an audio playlist (.PLS) attachment and an HTML attachment. I can't find any other complaints to support it, but I'd be willing to bet Bitdefender is the culprit.&nbsp; I don't know if the Bitdefender email scanner can be turned
 off/disabled or not, but, if it can be, turn it off and see if the problem persists.&nbsp; Email scanners are a HUGE waste of time, they offer ZERO added protection over the regular file system scanner that any/all A/V programs provide, and they are highly prone
 to making mistakes.&nbsp; You might also consider adding these addresses to Bitdefender's Whitelist and see if that helps. &nbsp; If AT&amp;T offers webmail, check these messages there, I suspect they'll be normal.

<p>Hi Thom2013,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Hal mentioned above, the issue you encountered may be caused by the virus scanner. If possible, you can disable it and see if it helps</p>

    <title>Office 2016 and keychain - another problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 2016 and keychain - another problem</h2>
                    <p>I have been running Office 2016 for some time but it kept crashing all the time, especially when I returned to either Word, Excel or Outlook after some time. I had to force quit all 3 in order to get things back on track. For about an hour ... And then it
 started all over again. I decided to fully remove Office and reinstall it, but now I have another and even bigger problem: I can only sign in in one of them, and if I then open another Office program the keychain windows pops up, asking me to Always Allow,
 Deny or Allow. However, I cannot click either of these, nothing happens! I can only work without problems if I don't sign in to Office 365. This also means I cannot use OneNote anymore, because OneNote HAS to sign in to work, and once I have done that the
 other three start coming with this keychain popup again, which I can't get rid of because I can't click anywhere ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

            <p>Thank you Joe for your quick reply! Unfortunately a new user account did not help. At first it seemed it did. I opened Word and signed in. Then I opened Excel, they keychain window appeared and I could click on Always Allow. Then I opened Outlook, the keychain
 window appeared again but this time it was not possible anymore to click on any of the options there. And in most cases the only way to come around that problem is to force a restart. As long as I am NOT signed in the keychain windows stays away (which doesn't
 say Office does not crash every hour or so, it still does). But this also mean I cannot use OneNote because I cannot sign in there either meaning that it doesn't sync across my devices. Once I sign in there the keychain window pops up again and I can't click
 anywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE: one hour later: somehow it works, all of a sudden ... I am signed in in Excel, Word and OneNote and Outlook is working fine. I'll report back here if it keeps working or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE 2: keychain problem still gone, regular crashes still there.</p>

            The problem is still there, though less often. It seems to happen when I have more than 2 Office programs open and try to open another one. Crashes are also still there :-(

<p>Hello, Alshaya.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting and welcome to the Nokia Support Discussions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We appreciate your effort posting in this forum. Is it only happening to a phone call? How about text message? Were you able to make a phone call and send SMS? Where and when did you purchase your phone? Where are you currently located? What error message
 are you getting? Do you have a stable signal?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having said that you have tried using multiple SIM cards, are those SIM card works on a different phone? Try to reboot your phone by going to
<strong>Menu</strong> &gt; <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Restore factory settings</strong> &gt;
<strong>Restore</strong>. Then, enter your security code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know the outcome.</p>

<p>Your phone does not support the frequencies in the USA because you have a <a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_105-5324.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<u>Dual-Band phone</u></a> on 900/1800â€¯MHz. You would need a phone which supports 1900â€¯MHz, and even better 850â€¯MHz as well.</p>

<p>I bought the fone in singapore and am using it in singapore.</p>
<p>I cant even create or add a contact.</p>
<p>Each time I try to call I get a message saying call is not allowed.</p>
<p>When I try to add a contact, I get a sim card memory not available message.</p>
<p>When I tried to restore factory settings, I am asked for a safety code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I put in my safety code, it won't accept it.</p>
<p>Is there another safety code that I should look for since it wont take my own code?</p>

<h2>            Office 365 University availability&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I wonder, is Office 365 University still available? When I visited the English website it says that it's not available but when I checked the Thai site, it's still available and I can still go to the checkout page to make the purchase.</p>
<p>I was asking because I do plan to upgrade my desktop to Windows 10 and I want to install Office 365, but don't feel like purchasing the Home subscription (I currently have a Personal subscription that I got with my Surface 3).</p>

    <title>Hey Microsoft - can we Insiders get some feedback about themes&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> erictorbenson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hey Microsoft - can we Insiders get some feedback about themes&#63;</h2>
                    <p>First, I would like to say that I am very happy with the quality of Windows 10 so far; even the preview builds have been relatively stable and it looks like it will be a solid Windows 7 replacement when it comes out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, there is something that I think a lot of Insiders would like some reverse feedback on from Microsoft. If you look through Windows Feedback, you will see hundreds of posts referring to the lack of a Windows 7-style theme and a strong dislike for
 the current "flat" look, especially with the overly simplistic icons. Each of these posts has tons of "Me toos" attached as well. So Microsoft, rather than keep us guessing, can you comment on whether there will be theming capability in Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems like you listened to user feedback on Office 2013's color scheme and will be bringing back at least some color to the user interface in Office 2016. Visual Studio now also has a Dark theme. However. I think Windows users should have choices as well.
 Remember, the plan is to replace all Windows 7 users' OS with Windows 10 as well -- for those who are upgrading, and for those of us who prefer the Windows 7 look, why not let us have it or at least give us the ability to change it ourselves? You can keep
 the default of the new theme, but please give people the opportunity to change it if they desire.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be really refreshing to hear back about this. Even if the answer was, "No, we're not giving you choices, take it or leave it." it would stop the speculation about what the final build of Windows 10 will look like. (By the way, I'd rather not take
 it or leave it -- people still using desktop Windows want more choice and flexibility. This was a key problem with Windows 8.x...please don't repeat the same mistake on Windows 10!)</p>

            <p>Hi Eric,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for being a part of Windows 10 Technical Preview. We are glad to hear that you liked the new build features in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer&nbsp;your questions, it is too early to say as&nbsp;this is beta&nbsp;program and is still in the development stage. We appreciate you to use the Feedback app, situated in the Start Menu to post your queries and feedbacks on the new build.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We will continue to bring refreshing features as and when new builds are introduced. Please reply&nbsp;for any further clarifications and we will be glad to help.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Crash on igdkmd64.sys</h2>
                    <p>Installing Intel HD 4600 drivers, results in a BSOD. With the fault going to&nbsp;igdkmd64.sys.</p>
<p>Tried all drivers, starting with the ones supplied by windows update, the ones from ASRock and the lastest from intel. The result was always the same, to the point that now it errors out installing drivers with this message:
</p>
<p>"</p>
The drivers for this device are not installed. (Code 28)<br />
<br />
There is no driver selected for the device information set or element."
<p><br />
</p>
<p>My system is a ASRock Z77 Pro4 i7 4770K with a Geforce 760Gtx, 16 Gb of Ram.</p>
<p>I was using the HD 4600 for dual monitor, since both my displays are analog and my 760 GTX only has one DVI-I all the others are digital (HDMI and DVI-D), and it worked great in Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>Ran all tests for faulty hardware and none found, no memory problems also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>

<br />
Error code 28 states that the drivers for the device is not available. Hence I would suggest you to contact your Video card manufacturer and check if there are any driverâ€™s available. If drivers are not available for Windows 10, then you can also try installing
 the drivers in compatibility mode.</span>

<h2>            Windows Phone Store error code 805a0194</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This is a mystery. My son is using an HTC 8X with GDR3 and is frequently getting the error code&nbsp;805a0194 when trying to download apps from the Store. Also common apps and games are not visible or searchable in the Store.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When resetting the phone and setting it up with my own account it all works fine again. Reset again and set up with my sons MS account and the exact same error occurs, ie apps not being available or not being downloadable.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>My conclusion is that this needs to be related to my sons account somehow, all things being equal. But how?? How can this be resolved?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Please help!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>thank you</p>
<p><br />

            <p>MS recommends 32bit for most users because of compatibility issues with 64bit and various add-ins</p>
<p>64bit is only required in limited circumstances, e.g. you use excel workbooks of +2gb</p>
<p>If a standard home user I would recommend uninstalling 64bit and installing 32bit - there is no performance advantage with 64bit</p>

<h2>            apps disappeared from app list</h2>
                    <p>For the second time an app has disappeared from app list.</p>
<p>I've installed two games: Age of Empires and Asphalt 8. My phone froze during an update of both of them, and after I rebooted it, both apps had disappeared from my app list (they are also not in games app). However their shortcuts still appears on my start
 screen.</p>
<p>Asphalt 8 stoped working some weeks ago, Age of Empires is still working.</p>
<p>I cannot uninstall them, as I cannot find them in my phone, sometimes the phone cannot update them as well, as it cannot find them. At store, both apps are listed as installed and there is no option to reinstall or uninstall, only to locate, which sends
 me to my app list, without showing me those apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By mistake, I deleted Asphalt's shortcut, due to that, I cannot play it anymore. I still can play Age of Empires.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My phone is a Lumia 820.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I have two missing apps in my phone, does anyone know how to get them back?<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/96971a0b-9282-442a-b86d-01f15dbe50e0" /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/00e33c83-325e-4d92-9d27-270afc549ccb" /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3b2217ea-055a-44b8-960d-20d7fc83179a" /></p>

            <p>Hi andremap, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on the Forum. </p>
<p>
</p><p><span>According to your post, the app has disappeared and you are unable to reinstall it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you delete temporary files and browser history (in&nbsp;Storage Sense&nbsp;&gt; Phone &gt; Temporary files&nbsp;&gt; Delete and in Internet Explorer &gt; More &gt; Settings &gt; Delete history).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Then , please do a soft reset by pressing and holding volume down + power buttons until the phone restarts.
</span><span>Make sure the date and time are correct: in Settings &gt; Date + Time &gt; turn Automatically to Off &gt; set up current date, time and<br />
zone manually.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I</span><span>f you use SD card, try changing the location for the new apps to the phone.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can also enable Push notifications (in Settings &gt; Find my phone) and try installing the app through web browser

<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue still persists, you may need to back up all the data on the phone and perform a hard reset:</span></p>

<h3> zac growz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Defender Error Code 0x80080017 &#34;The Class is not Configured to Support Elevated Action&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Help, I tried to copy a .dll file but Windows Defender keeps interrupting me, so when i try to turn it off (Administrator&gt;Turn on this app) it displays the error code 0x80080017 "The Class is not Configured to Support Elevated Action". I have read other
 articles about this but none really matches the scenario. Can someone please give me a solution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>P.S Yes, I am the Administrator</p>
