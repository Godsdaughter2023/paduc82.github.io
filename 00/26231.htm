            The cancellation of the My Phone service really has nothing to do with your issue.<br />
<br />
Have you uninstalled the My Phone app from your phone?<br />
<br />
Have you tried the usual things:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Delete your WMDC partnership and then set it up again?</li><li>Hard reset your phone and then set it all up again?</li></ul>
<br />
Those are the two things you should try first and then if you are still having a problem, post back (using lower case - no reason to shout here) and describe exactly what happens when you try to sync your phone to your computer.&nbsp; Provide any error messages
 you see when you try to sync and we'll try to help you out.&nbsp; <br />

            Thank you for your reply.<br />
<br />
I did not mean to "yell" I had only cut and pasted my most recent interaction with Microsoft who, by the way, have completely abandoned me and any attempt to support this issue that presented itself only after Microsoft terminated the Myphone service.&nbsp; As I
 stated earlier, I had been syncing my contacts and my calendar to my computer flawlessly prior to converting to the Myphone service.<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>I am using a new WMDC partnership and the calendar is not syncing (the contacts are syncing perfectly)<br />
</li><li>If I hard reset my phone, as you recommend, I will lose the only calendar with my appointments. (both historical and future)</li></ul>
<p>There are no error messages...the calendar will just reflect birthdays and holidays that were not manually entered appointments.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any manually entered appointments are not synchronized from the phone to outlook.&nbsp; I have the sync set to overwrite the outlook
 calendar for any conflicts.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I hope this gives you a better vantage point to provide assistance.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks again.<br />

            ps.&nbsp; the microsoft Myphone app is not removable.&nbsp; It is imbedded in the phone just like the other windows mobile 6.5 programs.&nbsp;&nbsp; As the user of the phone you were able to decide if you wanted to use it or not -- until the recent termination of the service.<br />

            On some of my devices - I actually installed My Phone to them, but on other (probably newer wm6.x devices), the My Phone app was preinstalled - so I can't delete the app on those devices either).<br />
<br />
I wouldn't expect Microsoft to provide any support for your issue since windows mobile is at the end of its life as well as ActiveSync, WMDC and any other Microsoft services that were set up to support windows mobile....<br />
<br />
I'd suggest you use the<a href="http://www.dotfred.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> PIM backup software to backup</a> your appointments to your storage card (since these things are only stored on your phone at the present time).&nbsp; Then if you have to hard reset your phone, you'll be
 able to restore your appointments to the phone from that file.<br />
<br />
If you enter an appointment in Outlook on your computer does that appointment sync over to your phone?<br />
<br />
On your phone, please go to Settings &gt; Connections &gt; USB to PC &gt; remove the checkmark in the box next to "enable faster data synchronization"<br />
<br />
Then open up ActiveSync on your phone, tap Menu &gt; Options &gt; please tell me what is shown on this screen... Do it show multiple kinds on connections there? or do you just see "Windows PC"?<br />

            If you've got the Exchange Server account set up to sync any contact or appointment data to yoru phone, there won't be a way to sync this data from any other source.&nbsp; Windows Mobile only allows one source for syncing of these items.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Delete the Microsoft Exchange Server account, but <span style="font-weight: bold">
BEFORE YOU DO THAT PLEASE BACKUP YOUR CALENDAR DATA.</span><br />
<br />
Deleting the Exchange Server account could very well delete the contacts and calendar data from your phone, so please go download the PIM backup application I provided a link to in my earlier reply and use it at least to backup your calendar data to your storage
 card.<br />
<br />
Also, WMDC is only able to sync data from one computer to a windows mobile phone, so what computer connection are you currently using?&nbsp; the original PC or the Windows 7 PC? Delete the connection you are not using.<br />

The contacts that I add to my phone, do in fact, get updated to my Outlook contacts on my PC2 sync connection.&nbsp; If the Microsoft exchange server account would not normally allow this, how is it getting updated?<br />
<br />
As a matter of fact, when I invoke Active-sync from my phone, the Microsoft Exchange server connection is able to sync the contacts with Google, however, as it processes the Calendar it fails mid-stream and just stops, without any error messages.

            It's been a while since I messed around with syncing my phone via ActiveSync or WMDC, but I think I remember that you can sync a windows mobile device to two computers, but if you also have an exchange server set up that syncs contacts, and appointments,
 you won't be jable to sync that data with a computer.&nbsp; And I think an exchange server takes the place of one of the computers, so the most working connections you can have on a windows mobile phone (withouth doing some hacks) is 2.<br />
<br />
Your connection settings are messed up...I don't know what messed them up and I don't know how you got three connections set up on your phone.&nbsp; At this point, you need to 1) backup your data; 2) delete the Exchange Server connection; and 3) I'd also recommend
 you delete the other two connections settings - since you don't want to perform a hard reset deleting these connection settings might fix the problem, but I won't know until you do it.<br />

Also, WMDC is only able to sync data from one computer to a windows mobile phone, so what computer connection are you currently using?&nbsp; the original PC or the Windows 7 PC? Delete the connection you are not using.<br />

<h2>            trouble sending email to a contact group</h2>
                    &nbsp;I have 3 separate contact groups in my address list&nbsp;and don't have any trouble sending email to 2 of the groups but one of the groups I get a message pop up on the toolbar that says "Sorry, something went wrong. You may have to try again". How can I fix
 this?

<p>I noticed this when trying to send my monthly emails to this contact group, as I usually do each month.
</p>
<p>No changes have been made to my account</p>
<p>I have only used this web browser or device as it's the only one which I have access</p>
<p>I have not attempted to recreate it, but will do so now</p>

<p>We appreciate the information that you've provided to us, Stephanie We need to isolate the issue by using other web browsers (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Internet Explorer) for us to know if the issue is only opening in the current browser that you're
 using. Also, you can further isolate the issue by using a different device to verify if the error is specific to your current device or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, there may be an error with the contact group itself. Kindly check if you can send to a specific contact group if you will re-create it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

<p>
</p><p>We would appreciate if you could provide more details about your concern. Kindly provide us the following answers so we can isolate your concern:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Did you receive any error messages when replying to emails?</li><li>Can you send us a screenshot of the error?</li><li>Which browser are you using in accessing your email?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we suggest using another browser and check if you'll be able to send replies to it. This will help us isolate if the issue is happening due to browser or account issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll wait for your response.</p>

<br />
Thanks for reply in the private message. As you described that you had opened support ticket which has been closed. However, the support engineer mentioned that this is known issue. This error is generated only for trial tenants when sending from a client IP
 address which is listed in Spamhaus.<br />
<br />
The only solution you need to request delisting through Spamhaus or subscribe to Office 365.<br />
<br />
Your time and understanding will be highly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />

            First for the sake of accuracy, what you are referring to as "books" are in fact "contact folders" visible in the Outlook Navigation Pane.
<br />
<br />To merge the data from the 2 contact folders, set the Outlook Nav Pane to show only contact folders by pressing either CTRL+3 or clicking on the People icon (or the word People depending on how things are set).
<br />
<br />Select the contact folder you want to copy FROM and press CTRL+A to select all the contacts. The right-click on the highlighted contacts --&gt; select &lt;Move&gt; --&gt; the select &lt;Other Folder&gt; --&gt; select the contact folder you want to copy TO.
<br />
<br />If you are going to move a large number of contacts, would suggest that instead of selecting &lt;Other Folder&gt; in the process above select &lt;Copy to Folder&gt;. The reason for this is that in the event that something goes south during the process, Outlook won't delete anything from the source folder which occurs during the &lt;Move&gt; (i.e. &lt;Other Folder&gt;)  process

<p>Thank you for the help. I've now got all my contacts in one folder, but I still seem to have two contact folders:</p>

<p>
</p><p>The first one ("Contacts (This computer only)") has no entries, so I'd like to get rid of it, but when I right-click on it, "Delete folder" is greyed out. How can I remove it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>More troublesome is that when I use ctrl-N to create a new message, then click on "Address Book", the folder that's displayed is the empty one:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/09c4b224-f0ce-41ee-b9d0-cbc34a01584d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/09c4b224-f0ce-41ee-b9d0-cbc34a01584d?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens even though I've moved the non-empty folder to be first in the list of contact folders:</p>

<p>The question you linked to has nothing to do with my question. My goal isn't to eliminate duplicate contact entries, it's to eliminate duplicate contact folders. In my case, one of the contact folders is empty.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The reason you have a folder with the label "This Computer Only" is because you configured an email account using IMAP (the default if you just entered your email address/password) AND it was the first email account configured for the profile. So the question
 becomes - where does the other Contact folder come from</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you go into Outlook account settings</p>
<p>
</p><p>#1 - How many email accounts are configured and what type are these (Imap, Exchange etc)</p>
<p>#2 - How data files are configured in this profile (under Data Files tab in Account Settings) are what type are these files (ost or pst). You will definitely have at least one ost file since that's the type of file used by an IMAP Account</p>
<p>#3 - Which data file is set as the "default data file" for the profile - this is the data file that contains the default contact/calendar folders for the profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fact that you have a "Suggested Contacts" folder indicates that this profile has a PST file from Outlook '2010 - that correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also you have a screenshot that shows 2 contact folders under Tigertech so that itself is confusing and makes no sense.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In reference as to why you cannot delete the contact folder marked as "This Computer Only" is because it is a standard Outlook folder which cannot be deleted.</p>

</p><p>I used to use Outlook 2010, so I assume the two .pst files came from that. For a long time, I used POP and Outlook 2010 for my email. Then I changed my account to use IMAP.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Re: your data files</p>
<p>
</p><p>#1 - If your contact folder marked as "This Computer Only" is empty as previously stated AND the contact folder in the pst file DOES contain your contacts, then you should definitely change the "default data file" to be the pst file. This would be highly
 recommended in any case since maintaining contacts in a folder labeled as "This Computer Only" folder is ill-advised</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2 - The fact that you cannot delete the contact folders is because they were at some point designated as the default contact folder for the Outlook profile. That definitely is the case currently for the OST file and likely to be the case for the PST file</p>
<p>
</p><p>#3 - Based on the description, you manually added the pst files to this profile - is that correct? The only reason you would have "This Computer Only" folders for the IMAP account would be because it was the first email account configured in the profile
 with no other data file set as the "default data file" for the profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#4 - There is no way within Outlook directly to delete your current contact folders. You would have to use MFCMapi to delete those folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#5 - You already have a single contact folder containing your contact data so this part of the question is moot. The issue appears to be the AddressBook. As identified in the previous reply, your screenshot from the AddressBook shows 2 "Contact" folders
 - when you select the "other" one from the drop down list - do your contacts appear?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to confirm, when you right-click on the contact folder containing your contact data --&gt; Properties --&gt; Outlook AddressBook tab --&gt; the "Show this email folder as an email addressbook" box is checked - correct? (IF not, it needs to be)</p>

</p><p>#1 - From within Outlook, press CTRL+6 to see the full folder view. There will be one folder tree for each data file configured in Outlook. From your description, you have a contact folder in the OST data file (labeled) as "This Computer Only" and one in
 the PST data file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2 - Outlook will save your contacts to the "default contact folder" which is located in the "default data file" as assigned in Account Settings --&gt; Data Files tab as per previous response</p>
<p>
</p><p>#3 - The files you need to be concerned about are the ones that are currently defined in the profile (Account Settings --&gt; Data FIles tab). If you have a plethora of PST files that are not defined in Outlook, then only you know what has been removed from
 Outlook and what you no longer require. You manage your files via the Outlook profile - NOT via Windows Explorer. If you remove a PST file from Outlook and don't need it anymore then you should delete it via Windows Explorer. Removing a PST file from within
 Outlook doesn't physically delete the file from the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#4 - In terms of .ost files, these are not files that need to be "managed" since these get created automatically by Outlook and are mirrors of what exists on the server. The one caveat to this is that if data is stored in folders labeled as "This Computer
 Only" then those folders need to be manually backed up (exported) to a PST file otherwise that data will be lost if the IMAP account is deleted or the OST file is otherwise orphaned. OST files can only be opened by the Outlook profile/email account that originally
 created it. If Outlook can't find the file for any reason, it will automatically create a new one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#5 - Getting back to the "plethora" of PST files - if that's the case, that means that a whole bunch of things have gone on which haven't been described so this is obviously not a clean profile where clean = a simple case of just configuring an Imap account.</p>

<h2>            Visio&#58; How do I quickly change a shape to use another colour in the theme&#39;s palette&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm a bit of a Visio newbie, so this is probably something obvious that I'm missing.</p>
<p>I'm creating a diagram with a bunch of basic shapes, and I'm using one of the built-in themes. By default, all the shapes I create are using the main theme color (with variations of its tone for the gradient fill, line, shadow, etc), but obviously I don't
 want every shape on the diagram to look the same, as this would be very bland and not great for creating professional looking diagrams!</p>
<p>I can see from the themes menu that each one defines a number of related colours that will work well with the default colour. I presume there is a quick way to change a shape to use these other theme colours, the same way I can apply template styles to text
 in word without having to set font, font size, colour, etc. separately, but I just can not find it in the interface. All the dropdowns and menus I try seem to apply changes to every shape in the document, rather than the individual one I have selected.</p>
<p>Would much appreciate any help you guys can provide!</p>

<p>Some people do have to sleep and do other work occasionaly!</p>
<p>The only quick way I know of is to right-click the shape. As well as the normal context menu you'll get the formatting menu with drop down boxes for all the common format functions, fill, line, text etc.</p>
<p>HTH.</p>

<h2>            WMDC 6.1 install backs itself out and does not install</h2>
                    Running win 7 32 bit home premium OS. Had problem connecting my Palm Treo 700w with Outlook 2007. Uninstalled WMDC and driver. When I downloaded and saved wmdc 6.1 and ran as admin, install starts and then backs itself out and WMDC does not install. There
 are no error messages. WMDC is in startup and running. Appreciate any ideas on how to solve this?

<h2>            Microsoft Security Essentials error code&#58; 0x80070643</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>Been in and out of multiple websites, forums, blogs, and even chat rooms for the past 7 hours. Previously, say maybe a few months back, I did a clean install of Windows 7 Ultimate followed by the basics of computer life which happened
 to include Microsoft Security Essentials. Life was happy, and neither rain nor sleet nor snow nor tsunami seemed to make my laptop even hiccup.</p>
<p><span>Today, or rather late yesterday night, MSE told me there was a more up-to-date version of itself in need of downloading. So, dutifully&nbsp;pursuing a healthier end for my laptop, I attempted to let MSE update itself. It failed. I
 uninstalled MSE and tried with a clean install after rebooting. It failed. I tried /all/ of the fixes listed on several threads throughout Microsoft Answers. They failed. I visited multiple websites and articles, patiently wading through endless fixes that
 failed and failed and failed.</span></p>
<p><span>I must clarify the /all/ from before as I've put 7 solid hours into this. I've never installed any other kinds of anti-virus software. 3 hours ago I did install Spybot S&amp;D as someone suggested that a present piece of malware may
 influence the process. It came up clean. I've scoured the logs, though they seem woefully inaccurate as there's not an error to be found. The time tags reveal the logs only contained instances from more than 5 days ago, so somewhere along the line the logging
 stopped.</span></p>
<p><span>If I get a copy/paste of the classic list of 'solutions' to this error, I'll get my laugh in for the day, but that's all it'd be good for.</span></p>
<p><span>If anyone has a link to a zip containing a pre-installed MSE, then my problem will likely be over. That option aside, there's nothing left. I'm hoping someone's found something that I missed.</span></p>
<p>Summarized:&nbsp;Using Windows 7 Ultimate, updates both optional and important are installed (though why I installed 20+ languages is beyond me), verified 'genuine,' HP dv6t laptop, used almost exclusively for writing short stories and poems / programming / watching
 movies through Netflix.</p>
<p>Issue: MSE error code&nbsp;0x80070643 refuses to subside. I really don't want to reformat and find it's a lapse of attention opposite the end-user...</p>

<p>Since you've seen the standard reply for this annoying and miserably inadequate error code, I will spare you. If you have not already done so, open a support case.</p>
<p>In my experience, the most common reason for this error is conflicting security software - in whole or remnants. It appears that v2 is more sensitive than v1 to conflicts, probably due to the network filtering components. The second most common reason for
 the 643 error is a system state that is unexpected by MSE - permissions incorrect, services off, files or folders missing or corrupt. And, third, though fairly rare, is an infection that is actually active. Note that the second item can have been caused by
 removed malware.</p>

<p>Support case is open and been more active since my previous post, nevertheless with continued&nbsp;repetitive and disheartening suggestions that I've found across the span of this issue. I must take a moment to give a feather for Microsoft's cap on their support
 team's&nbsp;persistence, though.</p>
<p>Your response in mind, I've a feeling a reformat is in need; if not a new venue in anti-malicious software protection. A piece of malware, or other infection, seems the most likely culprit. I'm hoping future research wont show MSE to be so&nbsp;sensitive&nbsp;that
 it detects artifacts of its own late version and promptly does a full about-face in response. As amusing as that imagery is, it'd leave even more users bursting blood vessels. MSE seems to be the unique protection software that has a coded fear of the very
 opponent it's fighting.</p>
<p>Appreciate the response, it shed some light on the situation. Being a new update, I've no doubt there will be patches and alterations forthcoming to help sort this out. Hopefully sooner rather than later, MSE was quite&nbsp;efficient.</p>

<p>I hope that it wasn't an infection and that the problem turns out to be simple to deal with.</p>
<p>I've sent a message to our MSE contacts asking for some assistance/information regarding the 643 errors and others we've been seeing so many of with this upgrade. A few new ones have cropped up and we have no good information to work with. For example, I
 just pinned a thread for the 645 error that seems to be the solution, but only because one person reported a response from Support that worked for them.</p>

<p>Unfortunately we do not know that answer and if they are planning on it, it is any ones guess when it will come. One thing is for sure it is not in the immediate future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just do not think that they are giving up on mobile; it is just on "hold" for a bit and we will just have to wait to see what and how they implement their mobile strategy. Mobile (IMHO) will still be a part of the Windows 10 strategy just what it will
 be is yet to be seen....</p>

            Thats not an available option. What you should do is edit the persons contact number from the People app.
<br />
<br />After doing so, launch Skype, press Control + i
<br />Click Settings
<br />
<br />Scroll down to Contacts
<br />
<br />Click 'Use my address book'

<div>
<div>
<p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>I've used the feature of receiving e-mail directly on my Nokia E71 before and it has worked fine. But now it has been fixed for a keyboard error and i'm trying to reinstall my email so i receive it directly to my phone again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is: i do get updates on the email i have received, subject titles and number of emails in my screen. However, when i do click on it just as i would have when i have received a sms, it doesnt open. I tried syncing, going online and offline, adding
 and removing new emailaccounts. It doesnt seem to work. It is my gmail account. How can it recognize that i received email but not show it? Is there something wrong with my settings so it doesn't show me e-mail? It has always worked before!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would be forever grateful if you could help me reconnect to the world</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely, a confused girl</p>

<h2>            VBA question&#58;  In Excel, how to know if autofilter criteria are applied</h2>
                    <p>I need to know in a program whether or not a given worksheet range (an Excel table/ListObject) is filtered by autofilter criteria. &nbsp;That is, I need to know not if the filter indicators are displayed (I think the autofiltermode can tell me this), but rather
 if there are any critieria set in any of the columns. &nbsp;A simple true or false is all I need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I sort of solve the problem with this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>dim bn_CriteriaApplied as boolean</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Range("Table1").Count &lt;&gt;&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;Range("Table1"). _</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SpecialCells(xlCellTypeVisible).Count Then</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bn_CriteriaApplied = True</p>
<p>End If</p>
<p>
</p><p>But this seems an awkward workaround and I'm not sure it will always be reliable. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>No that method isn't reliable because it assumes that the action of a filter will actually filter out rows&nbsp;which it might not because no rows might meet the filter criteria. So in short we could&nbsp;have a filter and a criteria set and your method would return
 TRUE,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try it this way</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Dim bn_CriteriaApplied As Boolean<br />
If ActiveSheet.FilterMode Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bn_CriteriaApplied = True<br />
End If</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT...Note that FILTERMODE tests if a filter criteria is in place compared to AutoFilterMode which simply tells is if the sheet has a filter on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But also note that FILTERMODE does not tell you if the applied criteria filtered out any rows, to establish that you would need to use your counting method in addition to this test.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You're exactly right about the flaw in my solution. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately FilterMode doesn't work. &nbsp;I think it has something to do with the fact that I'm working with tables (ListObjects), each of which can have its own autofilters. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I use your code as-is it does not detect the presence of autofilter criteria in the table so the boolean variable is never set.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I try to use the Filtermode property against the range object or the listobject it simple fails as there is no such property for those objects.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I think filtermode will work fine if you're using a simple range on a sheet with autofilter, but that doesn't help me in this situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other suggestions?</p>

<h2>            Latest Upadate to Onenote for Ipad now requires a 365 account to access Sharepoint</h2>
                    <p>I was using Onenote to take notes on the factory floor and was Sharing the note book with my desktop through our internal SharePoint site.&nbsp; I upgraded to the latest version and now I am unable to access the Notebook from the iPad.&nbsp; It says I need a 365 account.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Thanks for breaking my workflow.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I can still access the Notebook on my Onedrive but saving work files that potentially contains our IP Outside our Network breaks all sorts of rules.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Is there any way around this restriction or can we yell at Microsoft to change it back?</p>

            <p>Daniel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>i don't think you get Ron's question. Microsoft has hard coded the new OneNote app on iOS so you can't connect to On-Premise SharePoint unless you have an active O365 subscription. Microsoft has taken away an option that they have had since the very first
 release and trying to force customers to sign up for O365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How was this decision made? Microsoft thinks they need more money from their Enterprise customers. I'm in the same situtation as Ron because I can't have Company IP just sitting out there. With OneNote on On-Premise SharePoint I had it completely locked
 down and only certain things could be done while connecting it to their OneNote on iPad or iPhone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please have this restriction removed as it is seriously hurting my business and our ability to roll out new devices. Is Microsoft trying to push customers to Evernote? If that is the goal then you are doing a pretty good job.</p>

            <p>Justin you have understood my problem exactly.&nbsp; I could still use Onenote like I was before assuming I was allowed to store my companies information in the cloud (Oops not allowed by security policy.) and assuming Onedrive was not blocked.&nbsp; (Another oops.)&nbsp;
 The really goofy part is I can still use Onenote on my iPhone to access the file on SharePoint.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I can also browse to the file and open it with the Onenote web app.&nbsp; I can still kinda do what I need but the web app is a little bit behind the iPad version.</p>
<p>The part I am really not understanding is my company is already paying for SA for Office Professional, SharePoint and all the web apps.&nbsp; I'm not a&nbsp;hundred percent sure but&nbsp;is that not roughly the equivalent of O365?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Ron,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is just Microsoft wanting more money. I'm in the same boat as you as I pay for all my software with our EA agreement and then they throw this at us. If you want to add 0365 to your account it is an extra cost so you would be paying MORE just to access
 your files locally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm the IT Manager for my company and pushed everyone to OneNote since it was included in all of packages and worked greatly. Now it looks like I need to think of something else because I can't get one response from the OneNote team or my Microsoft account
 manager.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately your statement about the other Office for iPad apps being less restrictive then that is not accurate. When I try to open any Office document from Sharepoint they are opened as read only with a message to upgrade to Office 365 to be able to
 edit the file. If the same file is stored on Onedrive I can edit away. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Really annoying part is that the per user license option that My company might buy to solve the problems can't be purchased yet. Really annoying.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Okay, you are right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe they want to stop corporate customers from getting an iPad with free Office Apps for the same price as a full Office License and use it for editing spreadsheets. ;-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would understand that, but they could just take money for the Office apps. Now they make us buy a bus ticket for using our companies own minivan....&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The worst part is the taking away of once free features!</p>

            Yeah the rest of Office for the iPad never allowed me to edit stuff on Sharepoint so the fact that it still doesn't is annoying but I can live with that. &nbsp;But Onenote used to work and then it didn't. &nbsp;That is rude to say the least. &nbsp;I have other words
 I could use but won't post here. &nbsp;

 to change the code before to add stuff, so I changed a 1 to a 0 in the enforcement section. Maybe it's something in the code again?&nbsp;</p>

            Thanks for the extra information. If you choose <strong>Review&gt;Protect Document</strong>, uncheck
<strong>Protect document for:</strong>, then enter the password, the document will be unprotected from Read-Only status and the yellow text background will disappear. If you don't have the password, I'm afraid you'll have to live with it.

<h2>            Mystery - How long does &#34;Delay Updates&#34; settings delay non-security Win. updates&#63;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;Does anyone know how long the "<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Delay Updates</span>" setting delays non-security updates?&nbsp; I know you can't delays security updates, but I need to know how long the Windows updates other than security updates can
 be delayed.</p>
<p>&nbsp; The info in Settings-&gt;Advanced Settings just says you can delay them for "<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">a while</span>".&nbsp;&nbsp; So what I'm asking is how long is "<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">a while</span>" in this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;realize this
 is really more relevant to the release version, but I asked over in that forum, and it seems that nobody there knows.&nbsp; TIA</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In response to your query, please be informed that we do not have information on how long the updates can be delayed, however, the normal time should be until a next critical update is rolled out which is when the update gets installed automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this answers your query.</p>
<p>

            <p>&nbsp;Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; Interestingly that raises the question of whether the cumulative updates are considered critical.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason I ask is that I support 28 desktops in 4 remote locations where each location has 7 desktops sharing a very slow 1.5 Mbps DSL wired connection.&nbsp; When these cumulative updates come along like the 210 MB KB3176938, it takes approx. 2 hours each
 for a total of 14 hours to download and install.&nbsp; I've checked the "Defer updates" box, but I don't know whether this will delay these huge (for the network) performance killing updates for the 3 months I need.&nbsp; If not, I've found a Wiki article that will
 allow us to disable ALL Windows updates including security ones, but I won't do that unless I can't delay these cumulative updates for the 3 months I need.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;If I don't get an answer, I found a way to totally disable Windows updates here:</p>
<p>http://techgage.com/article/taking-back-control-of-windows-10-updates/</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I guess that's what I'll go with because we can't stand what those big cumulative updates are doing to performance with the slow download speeds we have to live with.</p>

            I checked the August Security Bulletin and both Important and Critical updates are listed.&nbsp; These are all included in the cumulative updates.&nbsp; I assume you have&nbsp;read the Security Bulletin information in detail.&nbsp; Do you use WSUS or SMS to distribute your
 updates?

            <p>&nbsp;A little background.&nbsp; These systems are at senior centers using hardware, Windows, and Office software provided by the local Senior Services wing of the county.&nbsp; The maintenance of the hardware is provided by the county, but the software (which is licensed
 by the county) is maintained and used solely&nbsp;by volunteers for the purpose of educating seniors in the area on computer basics.&nbsp; There are 4 of these centers distributed throughout the county, 7 desktops to a center, each with a single 1.5 Mbps DSL connection
 (cable connected).&nbsp; There is no central location for distribution of updates because each location is totally isolated.&nbsp; It takes approx. 2 hours on a single PC to download something like the 210 MB&nbsp;32 bit version of the latest cumulative update,&nbsp;KB3176938.&nbsp;
 Outside of the ever present exposure to malware, there is no secure data on any of these computers, solely educational material.&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously this is very different from commercial environments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;From looking through the security bulletin it appears that I just need to turn off all security updates until I can make my quarterly rounds to apply the cumulative updates.&nbsp; I just finished getting them all up to date through KB3176938 for the 32 bit Windows
 10 Anniversary Update systems, so I'll just proceed with disabling all updates and make the rounds quarterly since it is apparent that the "Defer updates" setting will be insufficient to prevent these cumulative updates from killing performance.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; It's too bad we can't talk the bureaucrats into improving the speed of the network, but as the saying goes "you can't fight city hall"!&nbsp; :(</p>

            <p>Have you ever used the Windows Update Catalog at</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/home.aspx (only available in IE11).</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can download the cumulative updates from it and write to dvd or usb.&nbsp; Then you don't have to have each computer download the files and you can make several dvds to facilitate simultaneous servicing.&nbsp; Afterwards you will want to have each Windows Update
 check for updates specific to the hardware, but those files are not frequent and are small.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example:</p>

            &nbsp;Yes, that site is a huge benefit.&nbsp; Before upgrading from Windows 7 to 10 this summer, we had Windows Update always on, and it worked well for us because the individual updates were small enough for our highly pokey network to handle them as they came
 out.&nbsp; But now that we've upgraded to 10, we've got to deal with these 200+ MB cumulative updates.&nbsp; In order to use that site for quarterly updates, I'm going to have to disable Windows update from automatically trying to download and install these beasts and
 killing performance.&nbsp; Now that I've delved into the details, I feel like I've got this tiger by the tail with an approach that should work well for us.&nbsp; (Famous last words I know!)&nbsp; :)&nbsp; Disabling Windows Updates by the method outlined in the article is simple,
 easy, and doesn't require a registry patch (like setting a metered connection does).&nbsp;

            I think it will work for you.&nbsp; You do know that after the first cumulative update the following downloads are actually much smaller because only updates not previously installed are downloaded.&nbsp; The listed size only applies if no updates have been applied
 to the system before.&nbsp; You will be downloading the entire cumulative update each time but when you run the updates on the individual computers only the latest updates that are needed actually matter.&nbsp; That means the second time you make your rounds the computer
 time needed for the update process will be far shorter than it was the first time.

<p>&nbsp;What you say is how it's SUPPOSED to work.&nbsp; Actually it only does the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
installs</span> for the newer updates, but it did download the whole 210 MB update prior to installing.&nbsp; However I had these systems up to date with the two cumulative updates that came out before this past week, and when KB3176938 came out, it started downloading
 everything before starting installing, crushing performance like you wouldn't believe.&nbsp; Once I disable all updates though, that will put a stop to that!&nbsp; Thanks for all the good feedback.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The way I would do it is to copy the file to the target desktop and run the update from there, then delete the file.&nbsp; It is faster than letting the update go back and forth to the dvd.&nbsp; I would do the same with a usb because I doubt the target computers
 have usb 3.0 ports.&nbsp; If they do then running the update from the usb is just as fast.</p>

<h2>            Home Outlook for Mac not deleting emails off Microsoft Exchange Server</h2>
                    I have an exchange server at work and am using Outlook for Mac 2011 at home. &nbsp;At first I was able to delete emails from my inbox on my Mac at home and not see them when I logged back in from my PC at work. &nbsp;Now the emails just won't delete. &nbsp;I get send
 and receive emails (though if sent from my home Mac they don't show in the sent items on the exchange server. &nbsp;This is driving me absolutely nuts. &nbsp;What do I need to change? &nbsp;I have both iphone and ipad linked to Exchange server and that works just fine so
 not sure what I'm doing wrong. &nbsp;Help!

            Control-Click (Right-click) on the&nbsp;Exchange name in the folder list. Under Folder Properties &gt; Storage you should be able to reset account.&nbsp;(I don't have Exchange account so this might not be exact instructions) &nbsp;If you see Synchronize now you could try
 that first.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>If this fails to fix, I suggest you create a new&nbsp;Identity. Enter&nbsp;Exchange account and verify it's working correctly.&nbsp;If yes and you have other accounts/data in&nbsp;Outlook see this article:&nbsp;</div>
