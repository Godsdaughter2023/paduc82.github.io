<h2>            my home screen just has blank squares</h2>
                    
<p>Just got the xbox one, but the home screen just has loads of blank square, also can't see my profile picture or any of my friends. it would make sense if my xbox wasn't connected to xboxlive and couldn't download these images, but have been playing hardline
 online no problem?</p>
<p>any suggestions? have already tried logging out and disconnecting the wires.</p>

<p>thanks</p>

<p>Additionally, I also seem to remember this issue dealing with BT hub if you have one. Trying opening Internet Explorer on the Xbox One and one of the tabs should have a BT Hub web page. Go ahead and open that page and follow the instructions, sign into your
 BT account. Once signed in, reboot the Xbox One and the images should now display if that was the problem.</p>

<h2>            Using File History to &#34;Keep Saved Versions&#34; &#58;The correct sequence of steps&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Greetings,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a question about the correct sequence of steps, for this situation. I'll present the two versions, here. Would a Microsoft engineer who's good with Windows 10, please&nbsp;help with this?&nbsp;&nbsp; I think version two is "more correct" since you would probably
 turn File History on ...first, and then configure the "Keep Saved Versions" setting.&nbsp; Can you help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Version 1: </p>
<p>* Create a network share, configure NTFS, and then share permissions. </p>
<p>* Configure the "Keep Saved Versions" setting. </p>
<p>* Turn on File History</p>
<p>
</p><p>Version 2:</p>
<p>* Create a network share, configure NTFS, and then share permissions. </p>
<p>* Turn on File History</p>
<p>* Configure the "Keep Saved Versions" setting. </p>
<p />

    <title>Windows 10 updates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sarathompson1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 updates</h2>
                    <p>Trying to offer complete information here:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday morning when I turned on my Windows 10 computer (new as of mid December) it insisted that I install updates for Adobe products. I started that&nbsp; and went to use Excel (Office 2010) and the computer said it had to install updates for that. I told
 it no, because I was already installing updates that it required and I planned to start the additional updates when those were done. After the first set of updates finished I clcked on Excel again so that it would do the updates that it had insisted I needed
 previously. When I clicked on the shortcut it again insisted that it wouldn't run without updates and I told it to do them now which it did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the updates were finished I discovered that my user data files for Outlook had been moved to user\TEMP and the same was true for my Chrome data files and I suspect many others. All my Office programs and other programs insisted that I had to re-initiate
 them as if this was the first time I had ever used them.&nbsp; In time (all day long) I tested where a new pst file (Outlook) or bookmark (Chrome) file showed up so I copied my previous user files for those two programs into the new user\TEMP... directories which
 Windows updates had selected for the Office programs to use.&nbsp;I thought that fixed my side of things sufficiently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fortunately I copied instead of moved the user data files because this morning the monitor was so slow to get a signal that I thought the system was totally messed up but eventually all restarted and the various Office programs as well as Chrome were reset
 to look for the user data files in the locations where they were originally installed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This part may or may not have had anything to do with tonight's problems but I will add:</p>
<p>Everything was apparently back to normal on both computers before I downloaded an upgrade to Windows 7 Professional for my old Vista/Windows 7 Home Premium computer because I want to access that computer from my new Windows 10 computer via Remote Desktop
 and I needed that upgrade to do so. I got the upgrade totally legitimately, by the way; it cost me $18.&nbsp; I had the Windows 10 computer turned off while I downloaded and upgraded the old computer which was successful and I am using the upgraded Win 7 machine
 now. No problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, after determining that the upgrade was quite successful I investigated to see if I now had the ability to designate users for using this Win 7 computer as a remote host.&nbsp; As expected, no users were suggested since I did not have the Windows 10 comuter
 turned on.&nbsp; So I left that area of the Win 7 computer and I tried to turn on the Windows 10 computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The new Win 10 computer did not boot, it will not boot and it will not turn off unless I unplug the electric to the machine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anybody tell me what to do?</p>

<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />
<br />Click System Restore, see if you can go back to an earlier time.
<br />
<br />If not, boot into the recovery environment again, then try performing a startup repair.
<br />

<p>That's extraordinary information, Andre. I thank you very much for that clue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Powering on and off three times would have to mean unplugging the power, pushing the power button, unplugging the computer... etc. because the system would not shut off even though it would not boot either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last night I decided to leave the computer "on". I left the computer plugged into the power and I hit the power button on the machine and just left the thing "on" all night JUST IN CASE the system was trying to repair itself in some fashion, again with no
 notifications to me of what was going on, if anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning I UNplugged the computer again to turn it off, then re-plugged it in and just for kicks I hit the power button to see if it would boot.&nbsp; After all, the day after everything demanded updating and then launched as FUBAR it all came back in proper
 order again after maybe a 5 minute delay in "igniting" the monitor. So here I am this morning with everything set up as I originally had it and nothing seems to have returned to the user\TEMP\user-data locations as they were altered on the first day of all
 the update demands.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I'm on my way to purchase a dedicated 8GB USB drive on which I will install a Windows 10 ISO file using the Microsoft Media Creation Tool, all the while wondering what would have happened if I had already created one when I "needed" it yesterday afternoon?
 Would unplugging the computer so that I could restart it and boot from the USB drive have been a good thing to do or would it have made my problems infinitely worse? What exactly was going on?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am scheduled to receive a call from microsoft support tomorrow at 1:15 pm at which time I will have a whole list of questions such as that one to ask them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thank you again for the very cogent, informative steps to consider.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best wishes,</p>
<p>Sara</p>

<p>I understand.&nbsp; However, pressing the power button has no affect. I tried to turn it off many many times. Nothing happened. I tried holding the button down and nothing happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was suggested to me by someone today that I might have a problem with my user profile.&nbsp; When the computer was new in mid December it assigned me a profile name and I never changed that.&nbsp; Should I have changed that?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I mentioned in my original post that I have a second computer running Windows 7.&nbsp; The two computers have been linked since I first started actually using the new computer and I used the link to copy over many files that I had not already copied to a USB
 drive for transport. Can this link be the cause of profile problems? The two computers do not share the same name or profile names. However, I do use only one email address that I've had since 1991.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ultimately I would like to be able to work on one old VB6 program in particular that I have on the Windows 7 computer via Remote Desktop - hence my purchase of Windows 7 Professional when I only had Windows 7 Home Premium previously. There simply is no room
 for two monitors so using Remote Desktop would alleviate the need for two monitors or a switch box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this not going to be possible or is it "linked" to the problem?&nbsp; I have NOT tried to set up the remote desktop yet but that was the plan before I was unable to boot the Windows 10 computer. The person I talked to seems to believe that I will continue
 having problems because of a profile problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you can tell me that is unlikely.</p>

<p>Thank you very much, Andre.&nbsp; I think I have the set up correctly, I'm just afraid to try to use it yet.&nbsp; The last step was to install the Professional version of Windows 7 which was necessary to make that computer a host machine.&nbsp; I've put that on hold until
 I can get a bootable recovery USB to be created correctly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed YOUR excellent instructions and I now finally understand the difference between using the media create tool to create a CLEAN windows 10 USB drive but I really wanted to have all my copious settings so now I guess I have to try to find out why
 there's a problem creating the bootable recovery drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason I brought up the remote desktop is that in spite of what I THINK should be totally irrelevant to my Windows 10 failing to shut down and then failing to boot, I thought it wise to tell you that the two computers are linked but not YET ready for
 me to use remote desktop into the Windows 7 machine because when I tried to turn on my Windows 10 computer it would not boot so I couldn't select my user account on this machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I'm off to study the system file checker tool.&nbsp; I had hoped that the booting and shutting down and user data in a TEMP locations had everything to do with updates not yet finished, though the system does not warn you about anything.&nbsp; Maybe there's something
 more serious going on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wish me luck.</p>

<p>Andre,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry, but I believe you have a lot more knowledge than the Microsoft Tech guy I spoke to yesterday and I will very much appreciate it if you don't mind me asking for your assistance at least a little bit more, perhaps starting right now.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm making some headway in figuring out what's up on this computer by pouring through the Event Viewer.&nbsp; Tedious stuff!&nbsp; But I'm glad I asked the Tech guy if there was a system log anywhere that I could look at. I do not want to be lashing out and reinstalling
 Windows 10 (and EVERYTHING ELSE) when it's highly likely that I have a setting wrong, permissions wrong, or elections set in conflict of what Windows needs to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Studying the system log I have an idea of what happened when the computer would not shut down or boot up. The wireless, solar keyboard that I am NOT using kept creating errors until the (read in the box)</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>SYSTEM32 RUNTIME BROKER INITIATED POWER OFF OF COMPUTER PROBABLY BECAUSE OF THE SOLAR KEYBOARD PROBLEMS. I MUST FIGURE OUT HOW TO DISCONNECT IT FROM THE WINDOWS 10 MACHINE EVEN THOUGH
 IT IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE CONNECTED TO THE WINDOWS 10 MACHINE.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Furthermore, since the system didn't shut down normally (confirmed in the next box) it couldn't start either but pulling the plug and then plugging it back in and pressing the power button was good and we know it worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And now I know that the system was not doing ANYTHING at all when I left it over night under power but not booted.&nbsp; So my wondering if I interceded unknowingly upon an update that needed to finish is answered. Not at all - I already had been given all the
 nonsense Candy Crush your Eyeballs, etc. stuff that Windows wants me to have... sigh.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Operating system started. Log says the last shutdown's success status was false.&nbsp; The last boot's success status was true.Also says the system has rebooted without cleanly shutting
 down first.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
</p><p>I had totally forgotten that I had installed that solar powered keyboard on the Windows 10 computer at all but regardless, I wouldn't have thought an installed keyboard that I was not using would generate a lot of errors.&nbsp; Oh yes, the newer keyboard is also
 wireless but I can link two computers to it - when I dare to turn the Windows 7 computer back on again.<br />
</p>
<p>Anyway, that keyboard installation has been firing off umpteen errors for the system which often but not always cause the system to also generate the following error.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><span>ERROR</span><span> -Application-specific permission settings do not grant local activation permission for COM server application with CLSID {D63B10C5-BB46-4990-A94F-E40B9D520160}
 and APID {9CA88EE3-ACB7-47C8-AFC4-AB702511C276}</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The other error that I get repeatedly is the following and I think it only happens when the system starts up.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><span>ERROR</span><span> -The application-specific permission settings do not grant Local Activation permission for the COM Server applicatio with CLSID {6B3B8D23-FA8D-40B9-8DBD-B950333E2C52}
 and APPID [4839DDB7-58C2-48F5-8283-E1D1807D0D7D}</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Anyway, I plan to look into any information I can find about these - maybe one or both will quit coming up after I removed the solar powered wireless keyboard (now it's done).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I'm all out of time for this evening so I'll go ahead and ask you if you can point me in the right direction for me to decipher with which application-specific permission settings the above two server applications interact?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any light you can shed on where to look for information would be magnificently appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so very much, Andre - I'm still going to continue working on creating the bootable rescue usb drive that generated 8.2 GB of information but failed (to create the "bootability" part) night before last but there's no point in going there again until
 I fix any problems that I can on the computer first or I'll end up just reinstalling them. If I have to do a bootable copy of Win10 first I can but I'm using your instructions for the other type of rescue USB first.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Sara</p>

<p>It's a good day, Andre and I want to thank you for your very kind assistance and hand holding. Since you're involved in helping people perhaps my experiences below will be at least thought provoking if not actually helpful to you in helping them:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have finally eliminated all the 10016 errors thanks to information that I got at ITEXPERIENCE.NET, the article called
<em>Event ID 10016 </em><em>The Application Specific Permission Settings Do not Grant Local Activation Permission for the Com Server Application with CLSID</em> (without this I would still be floundering)</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>&nbsp;</em>AND ghacks.net&nbsp; article&nbsp;<em>How to enable the hidden Windows 10 administrator account&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>which information told me that the administrator account that belongs to me is
<strong>inactive by default</strong> and needs to be enabled before it can be used.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was very, VERY annoyed to find out that I had no administrator privileges the whole time I was trying to fix the system errors (forl days and days) and even the great article from ITEXPERIENCE.NET didn't think to mention that possibility.&nbsp; No, I did not
 enable any hidden Windows 10 administrator account but I DID ENABLE MY ADMINISTRATOR ACCOUNT which, prior to that, prevented me from changing permissions in Regedit and/or Component Services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, prior to solving the above stuff I ran another Command anti-malware scan of my computer and that program quarantined two files :</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\PROGRAM FILES (X86)\MICROSOFT SDKS\NUGETPACKAGES\BUNDLERMINIFIER.CORE\2.2.301\BUNDLERMINIFIER.CORE.2.2.301.NUPKG. Engine_Heuristic detection of Application named&nbsp; W32/S-9448cbdf!Eldorado</p>
<p>
</p><p>and&nbsp;</p>
<p>C:\PROGRAM INSTALL BACKUP FILES\LOGITECH FLOW FOR MICE AND KEYBOARDS\OPTIONS_6.72.344.EXE-&gt;(NSIS)-&gt;FILE142-&gt;(NSIS)-&gt;FILE064. Engine_Heuristic detection of Trojan named&nbsp; W32/S-5f53b8a4!Eldorado</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should know that two years ago Command Anti-Malware suddenly quarantined some TurboTax files that prevented the program from running (nobody wanted to help me from TurboTax - I guess too busy?). Sometime later I tried to get help from Command Anti Virus
 and it turned out that the files were flagged erroneously. <strong>So that can happen.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Last night&nbsp;</strong>I tried to make a bootable USB drive for the second time.&nbsp;<strong> SUCCESSFUL</strong>!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first time the system didn't recognize me as an administrator, the RuntimeBroker wasn't allowing Local Access or Local Launch and the Shell Host Service wasn't allowing Local Access or Launch (there were hundreds of keyboard service reported errors that
 apparently are spurious 7031 &amp; 7024 errors and Windows knows about them but still can't fix them so disregard that) and the Recovery Drive Creator created a good, bootable (I hope) USB that has only one file that the failed creation did not have and that was
 the ReconstructWIM2 file at 652,535kb.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Now&nbsp;</strong>I don't have to be <strong>totally</strong> annoyed that <strong>
the system's automated recover point system writes over specific recovery files that were good and I thought I had available to go back to with files that now have a problem, even though the extra space I set asside so that multiple recovery points can be created
 (with descriptions of what's not been added yet).</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I do have a question:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>My husband's computer has Windows Office 2010 Outlook on it and, after a recent update he can no longer receive or send email from it. I checked the Internet and others have and have had in the past, the same problems
 after an update.&nbsp; Nobody has a solution and some have said that you just have to wait for Microsoft to issue another update to fix it.&nbsp;
<strong>DO YOU HAVE ANY HELP FOR ME ON THAT FRONT? </strong></p>
<p>Thank you again,</p>

<h2>            Is it Possible to Stop Start Menu from Defaulting to Search&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I use the Start Menu for&nbsp;fast access to applications.&nbsp; I hit the start key, then the first letter of the app, and boom! the application opens.</p>
<p>However, in Win7, hitting the start key defaults the selection to the search box.&nbsp; So, now when I type the first letter of the app, I get search results instead of the application opening like I wanted.&nbsp; IRRITATING!.</p>
<p>I did the whole Disable Search thing in the control panel, but that also disables search in Explorer and Outlook, which I don't want to do.&nbsp; So, my question is:&nbsp; Is there a way to edit the registry or something so hitting the start key does not take you
 to the search box first, but to the top of the start menu like it used to do?</p>

<p><span>Hi cbjella,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>With Windows 7 Start search feature, you can still open the application you wish to open.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To use the search box, open the Start menu and start typing. You don't need to click inside the box first. As you type, the search results appear
 above the search box in the left pane of the Start menu.</span></p>
<p><span>A program, file, or folder will appear as a search result if:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Any word in its title matches or begins with your search term.</span>
</li><li><span>Any text in the actual contents of the file—such as the text in a word-processing document—matches or begins with your search term.</span>
</li><li><span>Any word in a property of the file, such as the author, matches or begins with your search term. (For more information about file properties,
 see <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Change-the-properties-for-a-file" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>Change the properties for a file</span></a>.)</span> </li></ul>
<p><span>For instance, if you wish to open
<strong>Windows DVD Maker </strong>from the Start menu, all you have to do is click
<strong>Start </strong>and type <strong>dvd maker </strong>in the Start search box. This should bring up a list of programs/files/folders that match the keyword “dvd maker”. You may select the application from the search results to successfully open the program.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Refer the following articles for detailed information on the search feature of Windows 7:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Windows Search</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/products/features/windows-search" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/products/features/windows-search</span></a></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you wish to disable the Start search box from showing files and libraries, do the following:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p><span>1. Right-click the taskbar and select Properties.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click the
<strong>Start Menu</strong> tab. </span></p>
<p><span>3. Click
<strong>Customize.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>4. Scroll down and locate the
<strong>Search other files and libraries</strong> option. </span></p>
<p><span>5. Select
<strong>Don’t search</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>6. Click
<strong>OK</strong>, <strong>Apply</strong> and <strong>
OK</strong> to save the settings. .</span></p>
<p><span>Refer:</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This would bring up only the programs in the Start search menu.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Thanks, but&nbsp;your solution tells me that what I used to be able to do with two or three keystrokes can now only be accomplished by multiple extra keystrokes (i.e., hitting the start menu key, typing several letters of the app name into the search box, and
 then scrolling through who-knows-how-many unwanted&nbsp;results to select the one I need).&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm sorry, but&nbsp;that's even slower than if I simply switched to using the mouse.&nbsp;&nbsp;And for me, it pretty much destroys the whole point of even having a start menu key on the keyboard.</p>
<p>The solution I'm currently using&nbsp;is to hit the down cursor immediately after hitting the start menu key, which brings me to the top of the list of apps.&nbsp;&nbsp;From there I can hit the letter of the app I want.&nbsp; But that extra step of having to hit the down cursor&nbsp;is
 what brought me here in the first place.&nbsp; If even one extra&nbsp;keystroke is irritating, why in the world would I want to add several extra keystrokes?</p>
<p>Is there really no way to make it so the start menu does not default to the search box?&nbsp; Or, barring that, is there no way to disable the start menu search without disabling other search functionality?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I totally agree</p>
<p>It find it so annoying that I click Start | Run and type in Explorer, and on most machines, Internet Explorer loads.&nbsp; I do not want that, I want windows explorer, which the exe is just explorer.exe</p>
<p>If I wanted Internet Explorer I would either click its icon, or type in iexplorer.exe</p>
<p>Yet to find a way to stop the start menu from searching</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and as for search, well, sheesh, that just sucks spectacularly.</p>
<p>I spent over an hour on a DC the other day trying to find the files in the scripts area that had the phrase "mforms" in them</p>
<p>Could not find them so had to look manually.&nbsp; In the old search you just did contents = "mforms" and you were away</p>
<p>On my workstations Iuse Agent Ransack, but I cannot install onto our DC's tue to company policies.</p>
<p>MS have ruined a few things with W7 and W2K8 server (can't comment about Vista as that was so poor my company laughed and said - NO WAY)</p>

<p>Yes, it's frustrating, isn't it?&nbsp; I realize that the people who answer questions on this board aren't the ones making the design decisions, so I've gone ahead and submitted the issue in the feedback area.&nbsp; But that doesn't mean anything will be done about
 it or that, if something is done, it will happen anytime soon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, I was hoping someone here would be able to give me some kind of hack that would work in the meantime.&nbsp; Doesn't look like that's going to happen.</p>
<p>Win7 is a vast improvement, but I do wish that Microsoft wouldn't be so quick to destroy extremely useful functionality in their efforts to dumb things down and control how people work.&nbsp; The same thing is true for Office 2007...some really great new features,
 yet at the same time my productivity&nbsp;has been&nbsp;severely hampered because they removed or changed the&nbsp;keyboard access to so many things.&nbsp;&nbsp;People who spend a lot of time typing just don't want to switch back and forth between mouse and keyboard that often...it's
 too slow and aggravates the carpal tunnel.</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for your response.&nbsp; It's good to know I'm not the only one irritated by the Start Menu search.</p>

<p>I couldn't agree more...I'm a programmer, and use the keyboard primarily. In Vista, I would hit the START key with my left thumb, and the D key and Dreamweaver would start; Q and Quickbooks would start; E and Excel would start; you get the idea....I had
 a couple dozen of them. Now I have 10 or so keypresses or need to take my hand off the keyboard to get to the mouse just to select the program/doc that I want to open. MICROSOFT: Please find a way to make it so we have to click in the search box if we want
 to search in Windows 7. Thank you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wait -- <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em><strong>here is a workaround</strong></em></span>...kind-of.&nbsp; After you press the START button, hit TAB.&nbsp; That will take the focus off the 'search' box, then I can hit Q for Quickbooks, N for Notepad...whatever.&nbsp;
 It's one extra keypress than before but it works.</p>

<p>Yep, that workaround is similar to the one I posted above, which is using the down cursor.&nbsp; But I think TAB might be faster, so I'm going to see if I can train my fingers to go there instead.</p>
<p>It's funny, though.&nbsp; I've been using the extra keypress workaround for months, but I still&nbsp;often forget and just hit the first letter of the app.&nbsp; Then that obnoxious search function kicks in and I have to hit escape.&nbsp; Argh.&nbsp; I think the problem is because
 when I hit the start key, I already have in my mind what the first letter of the app is.&nbsp; And since that's what's in my mind,&nbsp;that's where my fingers go, instead&nbsp;of to the workaround key.</p>
<p>I understand why they wanted to make the search function available on the start menu.&nbsp; What I don't understand is why&nbsp;they felt the need&nbsp;to&nbsp;force everyone to go there FIRST.&nbsp; Or why they made it impossible to disable without disabling search functionality
 elsewhere.&nbsp; I simply don't need to use search that often...but I do need the apps on my start menu every single day, multiple times per day.&nbsp; But for some reason, Microsoft arrogantly decided that search was more important to me than the apps I use every day.</p>
<p>It reminds me of&nbsp;those parents who expect you to find their kids as adorable as they do.&nbsp; Search seems to be Microsoft's new baby, and they're going to shove it in everyone's face as much as possible, whether we want it or not.&nbsp; Dear Microsoft: I know it
 hurts to hear, but your search kid is&nbsp;a brat.&nbsp; It's intrusive and obnoxious and most definitely not adorable.&nbsp; Kindly keep it away from me.</p>

            <p>It is all about effectiveness - the quickest way to start my favorite apps in XP is to hit the Start key, then the relevant letter. I just can't understand why MS would get rid of this ultimately useful way to start apps!</p>
<p>It was the main reason for me not to use W7, although I bought it already, I sticked to XP.</p>
<p>Actually, the workaround is nice, but...&nbsp;where I now&nbsp;hit Start then&nbsp;A to start the file "Archive.xls", with the workaround there are 4 strokes: Start, Up arrow, A and Enter...</p>
<p>Please MS - tell us which registry entry to change to skip the search box and get to the upper menu straight away! Just for the sake of&nbsp;using W7 as effective as possible!</p>

            <p>Thank goodness for the person who mentioned using the Tab to get beyond the search box so at least I can go back to using the Start + 1st letter for fast access to all my Applications. I have been doing this from my days with a Word Perfect tool (DOS-based
 - probably WP Office) that allowed for setting up different applications next to different letters and starting them that way.</p>
<p>I use a keyboard mostly and like the quick starting of my applications! Now if I could get the two little jump menus off the IE menu. And kill the search bar!</p>

<h2>            Saitek Flight Yoke and Throttle Quatrant no longer working</h2>
                    <p>I have not used X-Plane 11 and my sim hardware for several weeks. When I tried a couple of days ago, the hardware is not recognized by my laptop.</p>
<p>Note, the rudder pedals DO work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have confirmed that the hardware is working by attaching it to an iMac. Others are reporting the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder if a recent Windows update may have caused the problem. This one looks suspicious because of the timing and the fact that it includes a USB system update:&nbsp; https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4025342/windows-10-update-kb4025342</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am unable to uninstall this specific update (it's not in the list; I see one from June and 2 from August but nothing from July when it was installed.). There is also not a restore point prior to the update (20.Jul.2017)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm in contact with Saitek/Logitech but could use some help here. Is it possible to uninstall the update.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

    <title>Duplicate Hard Drive GUIDs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> crashoveride318  say:</h3>
<h2>            Duplicate Hard Drive GUIDs</h2>
                    I have upgraded my machine from Win 7 Pro to Win 10 Pro. I have 2 HDDs attached and both are the same capacity from the same disk manufacturer (WD), but they are different models. Both are partitioned as Simple Volumes. They are both connected to the SATA
 bus on the motherboard in the following configuration: Disk 0 (C:) Bus Number 0, Target ID 0, LUN 0, and Disk 1 (D:) Bus Number 0, Target ID 1, LUN 0. I am seeing a repeated warning in my Event Viewer with Event ID 158, that; "Disk 1 has the same disk identifiers
 as one or more disks connected to the system. Go to Microsoft's support website (http://support.microsoft.com) and search for KB2983588 to resolve the issue." I have gone through the KB referenced but the KB applies to Windows Server platform and not a workstation
 so I cannot install or enable MPIO. Both disks were present when Win 10 was installed except that when I first began seeing this warning in Event Viewer, I copied the data from the secondary drive to another of the same capacity and installed it thinking that
 the different drive would take care of it, but it didn't. How would I go about resolving this issue as I think it might be the root cause of my other issue (

            It would be nice if some of these MS people could offer some constructive assistance here. As I stated in my OP the KB referenced is of no use in a workstation environment where the disks are simple or dynamic volumes. One can't install MPIO, unless your
 machine is a server, and creating VHDs would result in data loss. I was asked for my machine configuration 2 weeks ago by

            <p>I agree CrashOveride318 - for 'normal' pc's the MPIO is not suitable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe one should do a search for: "diskpart uniqueid disk id"</p>
<p>and check out the site:</p>
<p>"How to Change the Disk Signature of a Drive Without Losing Existing Data or Reformatting"</p>
<p>and/or the technet site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note, this may be suitable for 'fixed HDD's' </p>
<p>
</p><p>Regretfully though, when using a cardreader, diskmgmt.msc shows additional disks (0 bytes)</p>
<p>Assigning a unique number there seems impossible. </p>

            I don't think it matches the OP's situation, but Mike's seems to be the issue I have, too. A USB multi-format card reader registers removable drives F/G/J/K/L as Disk 4/5/6/7/8. No media is currently mounted. The warning is given for disks 5/6/7/8. Given
 that Disk Management (GUI) and the diskpart command can both recognize the removable/no media situation, logging this warning is pointlessly annoying. In this situation, it seems to be nothing to worry about either. One of many, many events to learn to ignore.

            I have this problem as well. However, it is not something I can ignore. It causes my USB drives to all be disconnected and then reconnected multiple times. It is especially annoying when this happens during data writes and I lose photos or videos I have
 captured.

            Although <a href="http://www.benq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Benq</a> officially stopped supporting many scanner products for Vista and Windows 7 in general and 64-bit in particular, there have been several&nbsp;<i>work-arounds</i>&nbsp;found that apparently work well in most cases.
 The most successful results seem to come from installing the&nbsp;<i>VueScan</i>&nbsp;drivers from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hamrick.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.hamrick.com</a>.
 They developed their own set of scanner drivers for many models of scanners and All-in-Ones. The
<a href="http://www.hamrick.com/vuescan/vuescan.htm#acer_benq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><i>VueScan</i>&nbsp;documentation</a> does not specifically list the&nbsp;<i>6678-9BZ</i>&nbsp;scanner, but the documentation may be missing the model number due to the Acer/Benq overlap.

<br />
<div>
Note that after a&nbsp;demonstration&nbsp;period, there is an associated cost with the software. Without the software package, the drivers alone may or may not work long-term for your particular installation.</div>

    <title>External Hard Drive doesn&#38;&#35;39&#59;t standby when XBOX does, - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> trainedkilla187  say:</h3>
<h2>            External Hard Drive doesn&#38;&#35;39&#59;t standby when XBOX does, waste of power, heat and life of drive, should have been enabled from day 1</h2>
                    
<p>So Microsoft Devs finally got one right and allowed the users to purchase any HD they wanted and plug it in saving a fortune on storage space. &nbsp;However, in order to use the instant on features of the Xbox One you have to allow the external hard drive to
 remain on FOREVER. &nbsp;What a waste and how hard could it be to put a USB port to sleep if the Xbox knows that it's the External Hard &nbsp;Drive and if it needs to download it could just wake it up. &nbsp;Seems like a no brainer, oh well so much for quick start games
 which was a really cool feature. &nbsp;If I wanted to leave the hard drive on all the time I wouldn't have paid extra for the 4 TB and just gotten a cheaper 2 TB. &nbsp;It's the model that Larry Herb used and he didn't mention anything about having to leave it on 24/7.</p>

<p>Hey Trained, You can actually go into the settings of the xbox one and put a check on the feature where your ext hdd will turn off with your xbox. I believe it's games and apps, settings, and it's in the system tab. It's definitely there though. Here ya
 go. Settings &gt; Power &amp; Startup and check the "When Xbox is off, Turn off storage" option. With this option checked it should shutoff as you'd like.</p>

<p>Hey, thanks for the reply. &nbsp;In my post I stated clearly that in order to use the instant on feature your external hard drive will have to remain on 24/7. &nbsp;What I want is to be able to use this feature and still have my external HD standby. &nbsp;It's not complicated,
 you can do it with power settings on a PC running windows 7. &nbsp;I think you didn't read my post and instead just instant replied and told me something I already knew.</p>

<h2>            Surface 3 and HP Envy 4500 printer</h2>
                    I'm having trouble connecting my surface 3 Windows 10 with my HP Envy 4500 printer. I've installed the required files, and connected it to the same network several times. It shows up in the control panel but when i try to print it says its not connected
 to the printer. Because it's not connected, it won't let me set it as the default printer. I've done the whole "add a new device" process several times with no luck. A message has popped up twice about network firewall. It was then disabled but still won't
 connect. The installation process goesas network printer installation and fails. Does anyone know go to fix this?

<h3> almightybeing  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t activate my windows 10 after upgrading motherboard</h2>
                    <p>So I just upgraded my motherboard and cpu of my pc I built myself 6 years ago which had a genuine copy of win 7 ultimate ( which was then upgraded to win10 professional) but I don't have the digital key because it was so long ago. I activated it and put
 it on my microsoft account a few years back but it keeps coming up with errors that don't seem to be related to me or my pc (cant access servers at the moment, etc.).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just checked my devices on my account and it has my pc on it but it has two versions of it now and one of them says to be filled by OEM which doesn't make sense because I built both versions of this pc myself. I tried contacting microsoft directly because
 I was told that if my reason is legitimate they can give me an product key but the only contact options I could find were here or their virtual assistant that is barely even AI let alone any help. If there are microsoft personnel here can I please contact
 you privately to get a product key?</p>

            Activation depends on what type of license you have of Windows 7/8/10. 
<br />
<br />If Windows 7/8/10 came preinstalled with the computer, that is called an OEM license. For an OEM license, the license dies as soon as Motherboard dies. So essentially it is non-transferable. If that is the case you need to get a new license. 
<br />
<br />However, this is not same for retail licenses i.e. you purchased the license through Microsoft store. That does carry transfer rights. If that is the case, please see the below steps: 
<br />(Not applicable to you) 
<br />What you need to do is to grab the key using any Software like Showkey Plus, uninstall that key from older PC and use it on another computer. 
<br />
<br />Download Showkey Plus: 
<br />www.thewindowsclub.com/showkeyplus-product-key-finder
<br />
<br />Uninstall the key
<br /><a href="https://winaero.com/blog/how-to-deactivate-windows-10-and-change-the-product-key/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://winaero.com/blog/how-to-deactivate-wind...</a> 
<br />
<br />Use the key by Showkey Plus on the newer computer. 
<br />(Not applicable to you ends)
<br />Alternatively, there are two more options available other than this(one if you have already run activation troubleshooter)
<br />
<br />Contact Microsoft using the phone numbers below or use the chat support link(weekdays only)
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4051701/global-customer-service-phone-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/405170...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/windows/tech-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/...</a>
<br />
<br />Use the Activation troubleshooter on the new PC signed in with same MS account. 
<br />Go to Settings&gt;Update and security&gt;Activation and run the troubleshooter. 
<br />Select I recently changed hardware on this device.
<br />Please let us know if you need any assistance.

            Hi,
<br />unfortunately for reactivation on new hardware you need a product key. And unfortunately lost key is not recoverably,
<br />Any way you may try to call Microsoft support and ask for help but I don't believe it will give a positive result.
<br />Do you have old Windows 7 backups? if yes it is possible to extract you key.

            I just checked on my XP system and it turns out XP SP2 or later has the newest version of Movie Maker built in.&nbsp; You can't remove it and you can't upgrade it.&nbsp; If you need a newer Movie Maker, you'll need Vista or later.<br />

            Yes, it's all very confusing! lol.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I actually thought that's how it was when i first made the post and linked to Windows Live Essentials.&nbsp; Unfortunately, when I did a clean install of XP SP3 on my spare machine and tried to install Windows Live Movie Maker (the one installed using wlsetup-web.exe)
 it doesn't list Movie Maker as an installable option.&nbsp; It lists everything else - Photo Gallery, Writer, Silverlight, etc... but no Movie Maker.<br />
<br />
After a bit of digging, I found the article in my previous post that said Movie Maker was baked into SP2 and apparently the Windows Live version won't replace it.<br />
<br />
Could you confirm when you get a chance?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

    <title>using Regedit to fix &#34;The User Profile service failed the - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> conor dar  say:</h3>
<h2>            using Regedit to fix &#34;The User Profile service failed the login.&#34;</h2>
                    In the Support.Microsoft fix it says use regedit and get to a certain location and look for a folder starting with S-1-5 (Sid Key) followed by a long number,<br />
<br />
&nbsp; The problem is, Instead of having 2, I have 5 of them, but only 2 of them have the same number, (1000) which shows the picture in the fix.<br />
<br />
Is this the one I should be changing to .bak or what?<br />
<br />
Appreciate any help.<br />

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
You change the ones that have the same name except one has the .bak added.<br />
<br />
You can try to fix with Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you bootup. The ADMIN account in Safe<br />
Mode has no password by default (so unless someone changed the password it should be available).<br />
<br />
Some programs like the Google Updater (if you added the Google Toolbar, Chrome&nbsp;or Google Earth)<br />
has been known to cause this issue.</p>
<p>Error message when you log on to a Windows Vista-based or Windows 7-based computer by using a<br />

<br />
BE VERY CAREFUL IF USING THIS ONE :<br />
<br />
DO NOT USE THE HIDDEN ACCOUNT ON A DAILY BASIS! If it corrupts you are TOAST.<br />

<br />
Use the Hidden Admin Account to lower your account to user APPLY / OK then raise it back to<br />
ADMIN. This helps clear corruption. Do same for other accounts if needed after following the<br />
above message.<br />
<br />
You can use the Hidden Admin Account - Make another account as ADMIN with your same<br />
password (or two with same password) use one to test or fix the other.<br />
<br />
You can run the Hidden Admin Account command from the Command Prompt from here if needed.<br />
<br />
This tells you how to access the System Recovery Options and/or from a&nbsp;Vista DVD<br />

<br />
If you can't access your old account you can still use an Admin to migrate to a new one (remember<br />
to always leave an Admin Account that is unused except to test and fix).<br />

<p><strong>Using the F8 Method:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>

<div>When the computer starts you will see your computer's hardware being listed. When you see this information start to gently tap the<strong>F8</strong> key repeatedly until you are presented with the<strong>Windows Vista Advanced Boot Options</strong>.</div>
</li><li>
<div>Select the <strong>Safe Mode</strong> option using the arrow keys.</div>
</li><li>
<div>Then press the <strong>enter</strong> key on your keyboard to boot into Vista Safe Mode.</div>
</li><li>When Windows starts you will be at a typical logon screen. Logon to your computer and Vista will enter Safe mode.

            Same thing happened, System restore, week or 2 later, it does it again,<br />
<br />
The same thing happened with Temporary profiles, which I never got fixed.<br />
<br />
2 questions, do I have to do ALL of the methods? i was just going to do the .bak one,<br />
<br />
If I do the .bak one and follow it thoroughly, none of my files should be missing, right?<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Use the methods in the troubleshooter in my reply above and the system should<br />
be as it was before the issue happened and hopefully not return again. You can<br />
make a Restore Point to return to where you are now if you are concerned. Be<br />
sure to follow the directions using the Registry in the order given.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Did you also raise and lower the accounts using the HAA and the other methods?<br />
<br />
Sometimes you have to find out the cause as it can repeat.<br />
<br />
Make a couple of extra ADMIN Accounts with your same password. Reboot and logon<br />
to make sure they work. Keep those to test and fix as needed and not to use on a daily<br />
basis.<br />
<br />
Good troubleshooting!<br />

no. You can build APPS with the unity engine for windows rt, but you cannot install web plugins or anything like that (which i believe is what this topic was about).

            <p>Your <span><span>Huawei B260a isn't really a "modem."&nbsp; It's a wireless 3G (cellular broadband) gateway device, which means that it combines the functions of a modem
</span></span>(to connect to the Internet via the cellular telephone network), a router, and a wi-fi access point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, the instructions describing how to connect the RTP 600 to another pre-existing router at page 11 of the User Guide for the RTP 600 are, though not generally incorrect, very likely to lead you astray given the equipment that you have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before getting into the gory details of how you should connect your devices, please answer all of the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where do you connect the Ethernet cable from your PC?&nbsp; I suspect that you are connecting it to one of the yellow "Ethernet" ports on the back of the RTP 600</li><li>Where do you connect the Ethernet cable between the Huawei B260a and the RTP 600?&nbsp; I suspect that you connect it between the sole Ethernet port on the back of the B260a and the blue "Internet" port on the RTP 600.</li><li>Where do you connect the "base unit" of the PowerLine adapter?&nbsp; PowerLine adapters come in pairs.&nbsp; One is connected to your PC (by either Ethernet or wi-fi).&nbsp; I'm asking about the other unit.&nbsp; Is it connected to the RTP 600 or the B260a?&nbsp; And to which port?</li><li>Do you care about using telephone service over the Internet (VoIP)?&nbsp; If you do, have you successfully done so?&nbsp; If you've been successful, have you connected the phone to the jack on the B260a or to one of the two jacks on the RTP 600?</li></ul>
<p>If you have wi-fi capable computers or other devices, they should be able to connect to the Internet using the Huawei B260a without needing the RTP 600.&nbsp; Have you tried this, and if so, did it work?</p>

            <p>Thanks for the detailed response.&nbsp; Your last paragraph is very interesting and suggests that the problem may not be what I first thought.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm somewhat confused by your reference to a Siemans A58H Gigaset.&nbsp; As near as I can determine, that's a cordless phone and should be connected to a base unit that it turn is connected to a phone line, not an Ethernet port.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Putting aside any issue with respect to the A58H, if I understand you correctly, you connect</p>
<ul>
<li>RTP300 Yellow "Ethernet" port 2 to your XP computer</li><li>RTP300 Yellow "Ethernet" port to a PowerLine unit</li><li>Another PowerLine unit to your Windows 7 computer</li></ul>
<p>With the above connections, both the XP and Windows 7 computers can access the Internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You then </p>
<ul>
<li>disconnect the Ethernet cable from the XP computer</li><li>disconnect the PowerLine adapter from the Windows 7 computer</li><li>connect the Windows 7 computer to RTP300 Yellow "Ethernet" port 2 using the same cable that previously had connected to the XP computer</li><li>connect the Ethernet cable to the same port on the Windows 7 computer to which the PowerLine adapter had been connected.</li></ul>
<p>With things connected this way, the LED on RTP Yellow "Ethernet" port 2 is off and the Window 7 computer does not connect to the Internet.</p>
<p>

            <p>I'm stumped.&nbsp; The only thing that I can think of that would cause the behavior you describe is a filter set up in the RTP300 to block access to your computer, probably by MAC address.&nbsp; Because such filters are not created by default, you would know if you
 had created such a filter.</p>

                    <p>I have exactly the same problem as discussed in the thread "<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware/windows-10-usb-30-ports-fails-to-work-after-pc/f56d1990-81ae-461c-a2a7-44e181f588c1">Windows 10: USB 3.0 ports fails
 to work after PC come out from Sleep Mode</a>" (which is already close so that I can't reply):</p>
<p>
</p><p>Quote of the original post:</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock"><em>Windows 10 upgrade complete on Z77X chipset system.&nbsp; Only one issue remains:&nbsp; after entering sleep mode, the USB 3.0 ports on the back panel do not work with USB 3.0 devices upon wake.&nbsp; USB external hard drive (connected
 via USB 3 cable) no longer shows in File Explorer or Disk Management, and USB 3 flash drives are not detected.&nbsp; However, USB 2.0 devices plugged into the ports are still recognized.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock"><em>The 3.0 functionality returns after a Windows restart, but consistently fails after the computer enters and then wakens from sleep mode.&nbsp; Have already worked on USB power options, reinstalled (latest) drivers, etc.&nbsp;
 No issues are apparent in Device Manager.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock"><em>FWIW, system has two front panel 3.0 ports, and they work normally after sleep mode, but that's a lousy place to plug in an external USB HDD.</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>
</p><p>The interesting fact is that the affected USB ports are also the one from the Z77 chipset. However there is one major difference:</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Windows system is clean Windows 1709 installation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I have read in other forums that Z77/Z77X chipsets are often affected by this problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the only available USB3.0 driver is the one from Microsoft and this seems to be a defect in the driver.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>@Microsoft: Please stop implementing dozens of useless features and start fixing the existing bugs. Comparing Windows 7 and 10 the latter a lot slower and has way more bugs...</p>

            I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Step 1: download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />My recommendation to users going forward is not to pounce on every new Windows 10 Feature Update that is released. If your system has been working just fine with the current version, wait it out a while or skip it all together. If there is some specific feature in the update you want, then thats an exception, but these feature updates are becoming more difficult to install on older devices; and it sometimes makes you wonder if the inconvenience is worth the hassle just to keep doing the same thing. 
<br />
<br />If you look at whats considered the flagship features of Windows 10 1709, they are aimed at newer generation devices like the new Surface Book 2. Otherwise welcome features like Story Remix, which you have to upgrade to 1709 to get, could be supplanted with third party alternatives.

</p><p>
</p><p>You are joking. Windows 10 1703 is beyond it's support cycle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway as a consumer you have to install the latest Windows version as an MVP you should know that. Preventing the installation of a feature upgrade is not possible. Only enterprise customers can do that for a limited time span.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if I could do a downgrade to 1703 I don't see the point in doing so. The post I linked to is from 2016/2017 and describes the exact the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>@<span style="color: rgba(0, 103, 184, 1)">auggy: The Z77 chipset was released in 2011. The last BIOS upgrade available is from 2013 and of course installed.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 103, 184, 1)">Furthermore the USB3 ports worked 100% correct on Windows 7 (using the Intel drivers - those are not available on Win10).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 103, 184, 1)">The conclusion of thos facts combined with a lot of complaints of Z77 chipset owners is that the Microsoft USB driver is defect.

<h2>            Windows 7 home premium 32 to 64 bit.</h2>
                    I have a custom made computer that can support either the 32 bit or 64 bit version of Windows, However, at the time i bought the 32 bit version of "Windows 7 home premium" (mainly for access to older programs). &nbsp;Can i update by borrowing a 64 bit installation
 disk from a friend (of course using my CD key, not his)? Or will i have windows genuine problems? If not, is it possible to get the installation for the 64 bit version (such as the ISO) as i already have a CD key? &nbsp;
<div>(P.S. i do understand i will need to do a clean install to upgrade from a 32 bit to a 64 bit)</div>

            <blockquote>I have a custom made computer that can support either the 32 bit or 64 bit version of Windows, However, at the time i bought the 32 bit version of "Windows 7 home premium" (mainly for access to older programs). &nbsp;Can i update
 by borrowing a 64 bit installation disk from a friend (of course using my CD key, not his)? Or will i have windows genuine problems? If not, is it possible to get the installation for the 64 bit version (such as the ISO) as i already have a CD key? &nbsp;
<div>(P.S. i do understand i will need to do a clean install to upgrade from a 32 bit to a 64 bit)</div>

You can use you friends copy if its a 64 bit copy that corresponds with the edition you have a license. Or you can download a copy and use the same product key you used to activate the 32 bit copy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will have to do a clean installation, there is no in place upgrade path from Windows 7 32 Bit to 64 bit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using the Windows 7 64 bit disk, install the Windows 7 Windows Easy Transfer Utility from the DVD (To find it, just navigate to x:\support\migwiz, 'x:' represents the name of your disk drive. In this folder, you will see a collection of files, the important
 one you need to look for and double click is 'migsetup'.) , run it and create a WET file (Windows Easy Transfer file), if you have an external hard disk, you can have it stored there so you can access it later when you do a clean install of Windows 7 64 bit
 disk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you have done that, simply do a clean install of Windows 7 64 bit disk. In Windows 7 64 bit disk, launch Windows Easy Transfer, follow the on screen wizard, point to where you stored the the WET file (external hard disk), and it will restore your personal
 files and settings. Reinstall any necessary applications.</p>
