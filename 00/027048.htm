<h2>            2 hotmail apps on appeare on HTC Windows 8S</h2>
                    <p>I have a HTC Windows 8s which came with a Hotmail app. Somehow, I have managed to duplicate it, which is annoying because now it show that I have new email when I don't!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone know how to delete one of these apps?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both apps are displayed on the apps list: th e first as Hotmail and the second as Hotmail 2.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I hold down either app it gives me the option to pin to the start, but not to delete. The make more space option doesn't give me the option to delete. Help!</p>

How about trying this.&nbsp;&nbsp; Go into Settings-&gt;Email + Accounts.&nbsp; See how many Hotmail accounts are set up.&nbsp; I had duplicate accounts show up when I used my Microsoft Account from my WP, as my login in for office 365 subscription. I setup Office 365 under the Office
 Hub, including the email and ended up with duplicate email tiles. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I removed the tile by long pressing the tile then touching the pin in the upper right of the tile.&nbsp; This removes it from the screen.&nbsp; Then I went back into the Setting for email accounts and removed the office 365 email option.&nbsp;&nbsp; Duplicates stopped.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Alleluia, its not just me!!&nbsp;&nbsp; I am having the same issue with approx 20 of my users that use calendar sharing (and rely upon it) over 2 of my locations in San Diego and Denver that are part of our corporate network,
 plus a handful of outside sales reps at various locations around the USA that are not part of our corporate network.&nbsp; We are using Outlook 2007 and have been using calendar sharing via office.com successfully for years with no problem, now suddenly as of Monday
 Feb 11, 2013 we can no longer share successfully.&nbsp; We can’t <span>&nbsp;</span>'unpublish' calendars, change sharing permissions or publish new calendars because it wants valid windows live credentials to do any of these functions and it wont accept them.
 I have tried to publish a new calendar from a fresh copy of Outlook with a brand new profile on a new machine to no avail.&nbsp; Attempting to publish a new calendar prompts for windows live email and password twice and fails with a message 'Failed to sign in'
 and points to problems with Windows live ID credentials.&nbsp; Attempts to access other users shared calendars already subscribed to prompts for Windows live id and password twice then fails saying that the calendar link at https://calendars.office.microsoft.com/pubcalstorage/etc
 etc.ics&nbsp; is not a valid calendar.&nbsp; All users can log in at windows live site successfully so credentials
<i><u>ARE</u></i> valid.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have Googled this issue to death and have gotten nowhere and I was just getting ready to plop down the $ to open a case with Microsoft thinking I was going crazy when I saw this post!&nbsp; There are dozens of people that are posting
 similar issues this week on this <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2007-outlook/outlook-not-accepting-microsoft-live-credentials/79a4fefd-2061-4982-8b25-4a12f02c4be9">

<div><br />
<div>Particularly pages 2-3 - &nbsp;it looks like there are quite a few of us that have published a calendar through Outlook (which has worked fine until now) and are now unable to update and/or share with others because of credential issues. &nbsp; Those same credentials
 work fine on Microsoft web sites.&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Thanks, Bob for pointing me to this thread.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are also having the same problem.&nbsp; We use Outlook 2007 and have been using calendar sharing with office.com for a few years now.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since around February 13, 2013, we have not been able to update calendars.&nbsp; There is also a sign on screen for Windows Live
 that keeps popping up asking for User Name &amp; passwords every few minutes.&nbsp; The&nbsp;user name and passwords are valid.&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone pointed me to the following quote on another thread:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<font color="#000000"> </font><span><font><font color="#000000"><strong><em>Calendar Publishing to Office.com (PubCal)</em></strong></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><em>Users will no longer be able to publish calendars publicly to Office.com using Outlook 2013, and the Office.com calendar sharing service will be shutting down for older versions of Outlook as well. We will publish a
 follow-up blog post detailing the timeline for the service changes, as well as ways to get the same feature set using Exchange or Outlook.com.</em></font></font></span></p>

            +1 The problem here as well. We had 16 users all sharing calendars through Outlook 2007. Last week it all went down with no obvious answer. Good to know I am not the only one, but causing some real headaches in having multiple login boxes pop up in Outlook
 for all our users! Grrr....<br />
<br />
So MS, is the service coming back online?<br />

            Hi everyone,<br />
<br />
I have found a work around to this issue using a 3rd Party cloud webDAV provider.<br />
<br />
I signed up for a free account at: https://secure.cloudsafe.com/login/ <br />
You won't need to sign up for any of their premium plans.<br />
<br />
Once signed up, I created a new "Safe" and enabled "webDAV" on that safe. Once that safe has webDAV enabled you can use the webDAV address, email address for the Cloudsafe account along with the webDAV access code to share your internet calendars. This is working
 for our small team of 10 users.<br />
<br />
When you share your internet calendar in Outlook, just make sure you select "Publish to webDAV", then enter the log in credentials supplied from the webDAV server.<br />
<br />
Disclaimer: I am not affiliated with Cloudsafe in any way. There are probably a ton of alternative cloud storage providers with similar webDAV capabilities. A quick google and you should find a whole heap. I chose Cloudsafe because they seem to have a greater
 emphasis on security and encryption.<br />
<br />
If you need any help implementing this solution, reply to this and I will help any way I can.

<p>
</p><p>I am currently using Word 2016, version 16.0.6965.2053. When I insert Picture content control via Developer tab, and insert the picture via control. It does nothing however when I insert picture using insert tab, it works fine.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>If so, we suggest you use Insert tab to add a picture as a workaround. Inserting the picture via Developer tab will be fixed in the future,
 please wait for the new release version. </span></p>

            Hello robertofnc 
<br />
<br />Thank you for participating in the Microsoft Community, My name is Miguel T. I'm an independent Advisor  
<br />
<br />* Login to Outlook.com with your Microsoft email account.
<br />
<br />* Select the event that you want to have an email reminder for.
<br />
<br />* Click or tap Edit in the box that comes up.
<br />
<br />* On the Details page for that event, choose the link called Add an email reminder. It should be right above the large text box at the bottom of that page.
<br />
<br />* Choose a reminder time from the "Email reminder" drop-down menu  or select a custom date and time. The options you see here are dependent on when the event is in relation to today.
<br />
<br />* From the "Send reminder to" menu, choose either Me or All attendees. This option describes who the email should be sent to.
<br />
<br />* This is the only way Unfortunately you cannot set this as default
<br />
<br />I hope this information has been useful, please let me know if you still need assistance.

    <title>Outlook 365 Calendar Sync problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> atlantiasp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 365 Calendar Sync problem</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently started using Office 365 to manage my appointments across multiple devices, as opposed to iCloud (the company is moving away from Mac products). I work both in my office as well as out in the field, and when I'm out in the field sometimes I do
 not have internet connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had assumed that if I created an appointment in outlook 365 on my laptop (or in a pinch, my phone), that once I got back to a signal and opened outlook, it would sync any appointments I had created while I was out of range.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This does not appear to be happening. They still show up on the device I created them in (my laptop or phone) as a calendar entry, but they do not appear on any other device that connects to that account. They also do not show up in the web interface. I
 have double checked that I am creating them in the correct calendar etc. (ie. not a local calendar or a different calendar to the one that is synched).</p>
<p>
</p><p>To compound the problem, I think it may be synching some of them, but not all of them, so the only way to ensure that all my appointments are properly synched, is to open up the calendar on my desktop and laptop, check what appointments haven't synched and
 create them again while connected to the server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried doing send/receive and it simply says all folders up to date. I've tried creating new appointments as well while connected and these synch within seconds, so the synch is definitely checking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a huge problem, as there is the potential that I can miss important appointments because I look at the wrong device and it doesn't synch properly, or I could double book an appointment time, unless I check all of my devices which is not realistic.
 This never occurred with iCloud and I could always rely on it being up to date and synching.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice would be extremely helpful, as I can't find anything on the forums or the web about this.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is an outlook.com account. There is no error message at all. I just create an appointment in my calendar in outlook expecting that it will sync once I connect to a network again, but it doesn't...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've attached 2 pictures (1 from my laptop, which has all my appointments in it&nbsp;and 1 from desktop, which is missing a lot of them) highlighting where appointments have been missed during the sync process (or for some reason).</p>

 but an appointment I entered last night while connected to the internet is showing up correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is definitely a problem with syncing appointments made while not connected to the internet...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't believe this is a problem that hasn't been encountered before... Surely not everyone only creates appointments while connected to the internet?</p>

I need some more information to help you better.<br />
<br />
Check if you find any report in the Sync Issues Folder by following steps mentioned below and post back the same:<br />
<br />
a) Open Outlook &gt; press <strong><span>Ctrl</span></strong> + <strong><span>6 </span>
</strong>keys to change the view to folders list.<br />
b) Now go to <strong>Sync Issues</strong> folder and check if you’re able to find any report.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, you may try working in a new Outlook profile and verify whether offline content gets synced.<br />

            <p>i have the same problem as the other customers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an I phone and the only way that i can find to have the Outlook calendar sync is to make an appointment in Outlook by first clicking on the Calendar (icloud) pink bar. &nbsp;if i happen to remember to do that, then it syncs on my IPhone and IPad. &nbsp; If
 i accept a meeting request in Outlook it also does not sync.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surely in 2014, there is a better way to do this in your system. &nbsp;Can you please tell me what it is?</p>

</p><p>Thanks for the response. I've set up a new profile and tried a few times to create new appointments and see if the information syncs. Again it is a "hit and miss" affair.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of them synced straight away as soon as I connected to the internet next, but others didn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an experiment, in the new profile, I tried disconnecting from the internet and setting up a new appointment. I then closed outlook, reconnected to the internet and opened outlook. After waiting a minute to give it time to sync, I then closed outlook,
 disconnected from the internet, changed back to my old profile, reconnected to the internet and started outlook. After a few seconds, the new appointment showed up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However the next time I did it (waiting substantially longer before reconnecting) it didn't show up. Even when I switched back to the new profile, the appointment shows up in the calendar under the new profile, but even sitting around waiting for ages didn't
 result in it syncing the appointment and showing up online or in the old profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's almost like if it tries to sync and fails, it just doesn't try again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In response to your first comment about checking Sync issues, the sync folders were all empty and no errors were showing up.</p>

    <title>Hide Text Box After animation &#40;not bulleted lines in text box&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> darrell.catmull  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hide Text Box After animation &#40;not bulleted lines in text box&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I've tried different scenarios to have 7 bulleted lines appear in a click sequence and then have the text box (and all the lines) disappear after the last bullet has been appeared to allow for another text box to appear over it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The obvious scenario is Hide After Animation of the entire text box -- but this results in each previous bulleted line disappearing while executing the click sequence.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to make a text box disappear after completing of the bullet sequence (but still displaying each line)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for your time and expertise.</p>

<h2>            Contribute to Map Updates</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would love to see a system that would allow individuals or businesses to update the POIs in the new Maps app. Provide a dashboard like how Here Map Creator has been doing and allow toggle that would allow users to use/superimpose unverified POIs that has
 been contributed to ensure that one can get the latest information on the Map.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also have a regular POI, roads, etc updating schedule to ensure the information is fresh. Would also be SUPER important that the update is as wide and global as possible and not US centric only. Maybe MSFT centers/offices in other parts of the world could
 be assigned to help oversee the updates too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>

<p>I am having the same problem. If I go to any site I have in my favorites that I use to make a payment I get halfway through entering the information, IE crashes with a window saying that there is a problem and IE has to restart. Windows Edge does not work

<p>We should look into the problem and you may try open Internet Explorer without add-ons and see whether problem persist and also update Windows.</p>

<p>If I try to use IE without add ons, then I am unable to use my password vault to fill forms.
</p>
<p>As far as Edge goes it can not use my password vault. When I try to use Edge&nbsp;I get a window telling me to reinstall my internet connection because Edge can not find the connection.
</p>
<p>I think Microsoft has sabotaged IE to try to force people to use Edge. I may have to go to FIREFOX. At least it will work with almost of my software.</p>

<p>Do you have enough free space on your C:\ partition?&nbsp; 30+GB now required.<br />
Any copy of files is on your C:\ partition.&nbsp; On my test laptop my C:\ partition is now at 27.9GB used.</p>
<p>Having been through enough builds and updates I can remember when I was told that Windows 10 was only 12GB and I should not ask if they and over 20GB.&nbsp; The thing was if you were doing a clean install on a clean formatted drive it did in fact use less than
 12 GB but as things went along most people wanted to keep all of the programs and apps that they had loaded and the space needed was more.&nbsp; My Windows folder alone is over 10GB and windows.old is also over 10GB so there is over 20BG without any programs.&nbsp;
 After 30 days the Windows.old is stripped of the old windows folder and the size goes down.&nbsp; But when we are getting a new build every week or two it is not stripped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just looked at my desktop which is on the retail build and the C:\ partition has 91.3GB used.</p>

            Did you have any 3rd party Virus/Malware programs installed in the Win7? as 3rd party software sometimes cause problems upgrading, you may need to do a hard reset hold the power button down until the system shuts down and turn it back on.

            <p>Also check with the computer manufacturer to see if your model is supported with windows 10 drivers. Win 7 laptops and some older win 7 desktops&nbsp;are not good candidates for upgrading unless there are win 10 drivers available. Laptops are especially dependent
 on the manufacturer's customized drivers. </p>

    <title>Font and windows on Office Word changes very unstable - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sbodea43  say:</h3>
<h2>            Font and windows on Office Word changes very unstable</h2>
                    I have Windows 8 and Student Office 2007. My font continually changes while I am working on the document. I don't do anything to make this change. Sometimes it goes from small to large and vice versa. Sometimes when I set the size to 12 or 14 it still
 comes out &nbsp;really small. When I print it out though it comes our large, sometimes too large since I increased the size to accommodate the document while it's still on the computer. I can't help but think it is an issue with Windows 8. I can't go to 8.1 because
 it causes my Internet Explorer to stop working and it won't work with Family Tree Maker. I have had to do a full recovery twice.&nbsp;

            <p>I'm guessing that you're inadvertently changing the Zoom ratio on your Word screen. This can be done by dragging the Zoom slider on the status bar, but it's quite possible that this is also a function of the scroll wheel on your mouse. Make sure the Zoom
 is set to 100% (or whatever you find comfortable); when the type becomes too large or small, check the Zoom setting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you find that this is caused by the mouse scroll wheel, you can probably change the mouse settings in the Control Panel. Some mice even allow you to define different functions for the buttons and wheel in specific applications.</p>

I haven't done anything with the Zoom. This just happens as I am creating my letter. I don't have a mouse but do have a touch pad on my laptop. &nbsp;I ran a diagnosis and at the suggestion that I put in the source , I put in my CD. &nbsp;These are the results but I
 am not certain what I should do with all of these results as I have done full recovery on my Windows 8 when the update for 8.1 caused conflicts with IE and Family Tree maker. I had to go back to 8. &nbsp;Here are the results:
<div>
Disk Diagnostic&nbsp;— Failure of hard disk predicted
<p>The Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology (SMART) feature of your hard disk has found errors that may indicate that the hard disk is likely to fail. SMART is a feature that some disk drive manufacturers provide to give users advance notice
 of potential hard disk failure. Instability in your Microsoft Office programs may be the result of these hard disk drive errors.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;Note&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;This result can indicate a severe problem, but some hard disks may not accurately report their results.</p>
<p>We recommend that you do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Back up your important data immediately.</li><li>Check the results of other diagnostics, and follow the instructions for resolving any issues that the other diagnostics have reported. After you resolve those issues, run Microsoft Office Diagnostics again to see if this Disk Diagnostic issue is resolved.</li><li>If you continue to get this result, contact someone, such as the vendor of your computer or hard disk.</li></ol>

<li>The Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology (SMART) feature of your hard disk has found errors. SMART is a feature that some disk drive manufacturers provide to give users advance notice of potential hard disk failure.</li><li>Microsoft Office Diagnostics has found blocked-out (failed) sectors on your hard disk.</li><li>Microsoft Office has had trouble accessing files from the hard disk; it needs these files to function properly.</li></ul>
<p>We recommend that you do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Check the results of other diagnostics, and follow the instructions for resolving any issues that the diagnostics have reported. After you resolve those issues, run Microsoft Office Diagnostics again to see if this Disk Diagnostic issue is resolved.</li><li>If you continue to get this result, contact someone, such as the vendor of your computer or hard disk.</li></ol>

 screen and font or a smaller screen or font. Since this never occurred with Windows 7, I have to assume it's a problem with Windows 8.&nbsp;

            I am watching what I am doing and I guarantee I am not hitting the control and plus or minus button. This change in screen doesn't just happen on word. It also happens on pages like this when I am posting. Just a minute ago I wanted to respond to you and
 click on the button to sign in. Suddenly the screen size and font increased. I have been working with computers since 1996 so I know when there is a glitch in the system and Windows 8 definitely has it.&nbsp;

<h3> rcracer09211947  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2010 shared file can&#39;t be edited</h2>
                    <p>I have windows 10 Pro &amp;&nbsp;Microsoft Office Professional 10 &amp; Windows Mobile 10&nbsp; on two Windows phones which have Microsoft Mobile &amp; my wife and I both have Onedrive accounts. I want to share a file between my PC and my wife's Windows Phone. I did the following:</p>
<p>1. Copied the Excell 2010&nbsp;spreadsheet to my OneDrive folder on my phone.</p>
<p>2. At this point I can open and edit the file on&nbsp;OneDrive account&nbsp;on&nbsp;my phone or any other device that I have logged into with my Onedrive account.</p>
<p>3. On my PC in OneDrive I selected a folder</p>
<p>4. I selected the file</p>
<p>5. I clicked Share at the top of the page</p>
<p>6. I selected Allow Editing</p>
<p>7. I selected Email</p>
<p>8. In the Enter email box I entered my wife's email address &amp; clicked Share</p>
<p>9. She received the email with the file link which she touched</p>
<p>10. The file opens, BUT when she edits the file (which it allows her to do) and she clicks Menu&gt;Close the file does not save nor does it sync back to me</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Thanks for responding Nathan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created the file by opening Microsoft Excel 2010 on my computer. I saved it to My Documents. Then I copied the file from My Documents to My OneDrive folder on my computer. Then I logged onto my OneDrive account on line and shared the file as mentioned
 in my first message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My wife received the email stating that I shared the file with her. She clicked the link and the file opened on her phone. I don't know what program opened the file but I assume it opened in the browser. How can I tell for sure?</p>

<p>Hi <strong>DS947</strong>,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
I’d just want to make a follow up if you still have concerns with the shared Excel 2010 file that can’t be edited. If so, the file should be opened via Excel Online on the web browser as the time that it was shared through the OneDrive link. As soon as you’ve
 launched the file. Just to confirm, are you having issues with a <strong>specific file only</strong>? I’d suggest that you try sharing another Excel file in OneDrive and see if you’ll get the same result. Click
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/work-with-worksheet-data-in-onedrive-c051a205-1c06-4feb-94d8-793b0126b53a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Click here">here</a></strong> for the step-by-step instructions.<br />
<br />
Just in case that the same issue persists, it could be that the error is with OneDrive. Having said that, I’d recommend getting in touch with our OneDrive in-app support by clicking on this
<strong><a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=528676" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Click here">link</a></strong>.<br />
<br />
<br />
I’ll wait for your update.<br />

            I tried sharing another file. BTW it is being opened on her phone with OneDrive Live in the address bar at the bottom. Anyway she received the email with the link of the shared file. (Also it should be noted that when I share the file it only lets me use
 her comcast email address. If I try to type in her Outlook.com address it doesn't recognize it. And yes her Outlook.com address is also in her contact card on my phone). Back to the second shared file. When I clicked the link in the email on here phone it
 opens the spreadsheet. There is a pencil in the upper right corner. I click it so I could edit the file only this time the pencil went away and it would let me edit it. Now the pencil is missing. Yes in the permissions it says Can Edit so I know that I sent
 it correctly. Basically the file, when on her phone, acts like it is in view only, but the permissions say Can Edit.

            Ok I tried something different. I went on line to my wife's OneDrive account. I created a test spreadsheet. I had her share that file with me. I received the link in the email. BTW when she shared it, she was allowed to type in my Outlook.com email address.
 When I tried to share a file with her it wouldn't let me use her Outlook.com email address. Back to the test file. I received the email. I clicked the link. The file opened. I was able to edit it. EVEN while she still had the file opened in OneDrive on her
 computer, the change/edit I made showed up in the file while it was still open so it is working in that direction.

            We appreciate the information that you’ve provided. If you were able to edit the test file that you’ve created and the specific Excel 2010 file that you’re having issues with, it’s possible that the file is corrupted. Regarding this concern, I’d suggest
 that you the Open and Repair command option to that specific file. First step is to
<strong>download the Excel 2010 file from your OneDrive account</strong>. Once it has been saved locally to your drive, follow the steps provided on this
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/open-a-document-after-a-file-corruption-error-47df9d48-2165-4411-a699-1786ac734bc3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Click here">article</a></strong>.<br />
<br />
<br />
Let me know the outcome after trying the steps.

<p>Hey there,&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/5adb9e06-d4d9-487d-a595-e2c0067efd58" title="DS947">DS947</a></p>
<p>Sorry for the delay in response. I have been revising for exams at University.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can check if it is opening in the browser by looking at whether or not it launches the web browser and says Web Online on the splash screen when the document is opening.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is from the phone, then it should open the document in the relevant Office App downloaded on your device. This is the case, even on PC. The only time it will open in the web browser is if your on outlook.com.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please also note, when your saving files, or even to share them, you don't need to copy the document into the OneDrive file location on the PC. It should just sync from your Documents. Sometimes this can cause the file to not sync or the OneDrive program
 to become confused. That folder location is to display what files are on OneDrive that are been synced, or can be synced to your computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you try going to the file on <a href="https://onedrive.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
OneDrive.com</a> and sharing the file via link. Then emailing the link to your wife. Then see if it saves any edits, please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile I am going to be doing some digging with this, as I have never experienced this before and if it is a bug, we do need to get this passed along so the OneDrive/Office team can review it and fix it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,&nbsp;</p>

<p>I will try your suggestions. I should note that I may have explained myself incorrectly.</p>
<p>When I first created the file, I did so on my PC in the local version of Excel. "Then" I copied that file to my OneDrive folder "on my PC". This of course caused it to show up on my OneDrive account. At that point I went to my OneDrive account on line, observed
 that the file was there, shared it with my wife, and you know the rest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I get a link and email it to her, after she changes the file how does she send it back? Does she open her OneDrive account and get a link for that file as well to email back?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally what would cause OneDrive to say "Sorry we cannot find and exact match" when I try to enter her outlook.com email address when trying to share the file via email? (Her outlook.com email is in her contact card on outlook.com and on local PC Outlook
 contact card.)</p>

<p>Regarding the suggestion to use the Link feature to share a file, I could send the link and on her phone I could open the file and edit it, but then I'm stumped as how to proceed from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the Share problem in general, as I stated earlier when:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Open OneDrive on my PC, go to the file I want to share, select it and click Share at the top, I get the box asking me to choose an option.</p>
<p>2. When I type in my wife's outlook.com email address it states that "it cannot find an exact match".</p>
<p>3. The only one that shows up is her personal Comcast email.</p>
<p>4. I checked her Outlook.com account and her outlook.com email address is live and listed in here personal contact card as well as at the top next to her name.</p>
<p>5. If I share the file using her Comcast email address she can open the file on her phone, but her edits do not save.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Conversely:</p>
<p>1. If I reverse the process by using her phone and sharing a file with me, it not only sees my outlook.com email address, but the message comes to me and I can edit it.</p>

            Unfortunately, there isn't a way to synchronize more than one calendar with a windows mobile devices.&nbsp; If you get a windows phone 7 device, you will be able to synchronize lots of different calendars to the phone, but that would require purchasing a new

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let's start working on this by checking if there's a pending phone software update. To check it, just go to
<strong>Settings</strong> &gt; under <strong>System</strong>, tap <strong>Phone update</strong> &gt;
<strong>Check for updates</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>After updating the phone's software, we suggest that you perform a soft reset. To soft reset the phone, just press and hold the power and volume down buttons at the same time until the phone restarts.&nbsp; Performing a soft reset is the same as pulling out the
 battery. It will not delete anything from your device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<h2>            Possible Bug in MS Project 2013 Interop With Sharepoint 2013 Using OneDisk for Offline Edit of Task List</h2>
                    <p class="contentHeader1">Project 2013 and Offline Edits</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have found some flaws in how Project Pro 2013 interacts with SharePoint 2013</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">Affects</p>
<p>
</p><p>SharePoint 2013</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Project Site Template</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Project Summary Object</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Project TaskList</p>
<p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Sync Via OneDrive Connection&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>OneDrive for Business</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Sync to 'Site Assets' for MPP file associated with Project Task List</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">Background</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are implementing <strong><em>SharePoint 2013 </em></strong>with <strong><em>Project Professional 2013
</em></strong>and are examining methodologies for connecting Project Pro</p>
<p>to the project task list generated when a '<strong><em>Project Summary</em></strong>' object is added to a site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have had unpredictable results using project 2013 with offline MPP files where Sharepoint 2013 is involved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With <strong><em>Sharepoint 2010</em></strong> we were able to sync offline MPP files with MS Project lists. This allowed managers to work with MS Project</p>
<p>2010/2013&nbsp;even if they were&nbsp;temporarily offline from Sharepoint. (ie: laptop out of office building)</p>
<p>
</p><p>In <strong><em>Sharepoint 2013</em></strong> no such local storage of the <strong>
<em>MPP</em></strong> file takes place&nbsp;. The expectation appears to be that <strong>
<em>MS Project </em></strong>will always </p>
<p>connect to task lists via the network without any working files local to the desktop. This is a problem for our managers who need offline files
</p>
<p>that can sync when they get back online. They now&nbsp;appear to be out of luck when it comes to offline editing of project tasks..</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">Procedures Followed</p>
<p>
</p><p>To connect to the task list we select the 'Open with Project' button from the Sharepoint list ribbon. This opens the task list in MS Project 2013.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Saving from MS Project syncs the work in MS Project to the Sharepoint task list. This works fine. This also creates an MPP file in 'Site Assets' list in the SharePoint 2013 site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One work around we thought&nbsp;of for the 'offline' work with MS Project 2013 and SharePoint 2013 was to use
<strong><em>OneDrive for Business</em></strong> to sync the <strong><em>'Site Assets</em></strong>' list to offline storage. This should theoretically work. It does not work consistently though. We have 3 sites generated from the '<strong><em>Project Site</em></strong>'
 template, only one of which can sync the default project&nbsp;task list via <strong><em>OneDrive</em></strong>.&nbsp; For some reason we have not been able to duplicate this successfully with any other sites of the same type, permissions, template, user, groups, etc..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will reiterate the procedure followed in a step wise manner to make it clear what we are attempting to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Create a site using the '<strong><em>Project Site</em></strong>' template</p>
<p>2.)&nbsp;&nbsp; In Sharepoint select to&nbsp;'<strong><em>Edit</em></strong>' the project task list associated with the&nbsp; built in 'Project Summary'</p>
<p>3.)&nbsp;&nbsp; On the ribbon use the 'List' options for the project list to '<strong><em>Open in Project</em></strong>'</p>
<p>4.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Edit the task list in Project 2013</p>
<p>5.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Save work by syncing back to Sharepoint 2013</p>
<p>6.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Close MS Project 2013</p>
<p>7.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Navigate to 'Site Assets' for the project site in SharePoint 2013. An MPP file should now appear there.</p>
<p>8.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Use the page/list sync to connect the 'Site Assets'&nbsp;list using <strong><em>OneDrive for Business</em></strong></p>
<p>9.)&nbsp;&nbsp; OneDrive will ask to create a folder in the 'User' path on the workstation/laptop.</p>
<p>10.) Once the OneDrive folder is created the content from 'Site Assets' appears there</p>
<p>11.) In file manager (Windows Explorer Not SharePoint) navigate to the folder where the OneDrive has the files shared.</p>
<p>12.) Open the MPP file with MS Project 2013 from the OneDrive sync directory</p>
<p>13.) Edit the project tasks using the shared file,&nbsp;&nbsp;save and close </p>
<p>14.) OneDrive should now sync the shared files back to 'Site Assets' in SharePoint 2013</p>
<p>15.) Check the project task list. Sometimes it gets updated. Mostly it does not. Create a few similar sites to test the behavior.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The MPP file in the Site Assets list gets updated always, but those changes do not always change the Project Task List.</p>
<p>The SharePoint task list is disconnected from the MPP file in the Site Assets list more often than not.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">Questions</p>
<p>
</p><p>a.) Is there a way to sync offline MPP files to the Project task lists in SharePoint 2013&nbsp;more consistently?</p>
<p>b.) Is it bad form to use OneDrive to make 'Site Assets' available for offline edits that automatically sync when reconnected?</p>
<p>c.) Are there any other offline methods that may be used to interact with the Project Task list in SharePoint 2013 Project sites?</p>
<p>d.) Is there a way to have the same SharePoint 2013 project task list functionality but store the data from the task list somewhere other than Site Assets?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for your time</p>

<p>I am not sure that I understand tour question. But add a pst file to<br />
Outlook and move message to that pst file. Normally an ost file is<br />
only a local copy of the contents of their mailbox.<br />

<h3> paulbates  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Task Manager Exclusive Programs list... how&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I've been using my ATT Tilt (HTC TytynII) for about a month now. Its Windows Mobile 6.0. So far so good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is my question. I am trying to figure out how to use the <strong>
Exclusive Programs List</strong> portion of <strong>Windows Task Manager. </strong>
This is the part of the operating system that allows you to always keep a certain set of applications running even when you instruct windows to stop all programs. (This is not the To - do list part of Mobile Outlook)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know how to bring up the <strong>Task Manager</strong>. I can get to the
<strong>Exclusive Tab </strong>and see the empty exclusive program list. The remove button is greyed out because there are no exclusive programs. My problem being, I can't figure out how to add programs. The menu button does not have any options. Pressing and
 holding the pen on the screen does nothing, whether on the empty running program list, or on one of the running programs on the running programs list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am praying this does not require a registry tweak. How are programs added?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any help. Paul</p>

<p>Hi Paul! Have you seen the <strong>Running Tab</strong> in front of the
<strong>Exclusive Tab</strong>? It shows a list of programs that are currently running. If you click any one of the listed programs, a menu containing two options:
<strong>Activate</strong> and <strong>Add Exclusive</strong> should show up.</p>

<h2>            display bound value of a multivalue field&#47;A2010</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am using Access 2010 and am trying to find the bound values of the entries in a multivalue field.&nbsp; I have read the Microsoft tutorial at
<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/access-help/using-multivalued-fields-in-queries-HA010149297.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/access-help/using-multivalued-fields-in-queries-HA010149297.aspx</a>&nbsp;but following the instructions to set the Lookup-&gt;Display Control setting to text box does not force a query to display the bound values as stated in the
 article.&nbsp; I continue to get the display values.&nbsp; Since the article applies to 2007, I assume something has changed.&nbsp; However, there appears to be no updated information available.</p>
<p>I attempted to find the hidden table that holds the values for the field, but none of the MSys tables seemed to be the one I was looking for.&nbsp; Then, in an attempt to try to determine them for myself, I used&nbsp;the numbers 1-10&nbsp;as search criteria in a query.&nbsp;
 I figured I could use the process of elimination to&nbsp;figure out which numbers correspond to which display value.&nbsp; No luck, however.&nbsp; All numbers 1-10 failed to pull any results.</p>
<p>So I'm stumped.&nbsp; Without the bound values,&nbsp;I have no idea how to use this field, but I also have no idea how to find the bound values.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p><span>Hello kwinbo,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I ran through a quick test and I can view the bound values within the combo box for the multivalued field. Here are some of the lookup
 properties for this field within the table.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Row Source Type: Value List</span></p>
<p><span>Row Source: 1;"Red";2;"Blue";3;"Green";4;"Yellow"</span></p>
<p><span>Bound Column: 1</span></p>
<p><span>Column Count: 2</span></p>
<p><span>Column Widths: 1";1"</span></p>
<p><span>Allow Multiple Values: Yes</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When I expand the combo box I see both columns of the value list (1,Red) and when I check both (1,Red and 2,Blue) I see 1,2 displayed
 in the combo box.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would review your bound column, column count and column widths properties.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>PowerPoint 2010&#58; How to define Textbox default properties - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mmo17  say:</h3>
<h2>            PowerPoint 2010&#58; How to define Textbox default properties</h2>
                    <p>Is it possible to (re-)define certain drawing objects' default&nbsp;properties? E.g. after a while when I start a new slideset it always starts driving me nuts, that I have to adjust the internal margin of each and every TextBox that I create (unless I keep copying
 from another TextBox, that I already "corrected"). The built-in defaults are much too wide for me and waste lots of space.
</p>
<p>Or I almost always adjust the diameter of the curved edges of&nbsp;rounded boxes. Why do I always have to redo that manually? Aren't computer there to memorize such things and take tedious tasks off their users?</p>
<p>In earlier versions of PPT (2002?) is was possible - at least for one presentation - to "Set as default" certain properties. I haven't managed to achieve that with PPT 2010, yet, but I have a hard time to believe, that this vital feature was slashed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any pointer?</p>
<p>M.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 Spelling check in Subject line different from body text</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We found that running the latest version of outlook 2016 the spell checker in the subject line is different (US) to our body text (NL).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes emails need to be send in English, other times in Dutch. Switching the primary spell check language didnt gave the wanted results and remained that the subject line spell check remained in English</p>
<br />
<p>Does anyone else have this problem as well or knows how to ge this fixed without completely removing a language from outlook.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greetings,</p>
<p>Jordy</p>

            <p>Hi Gary. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I found the awnser! Under Windows 10 -&gt; <strong>Settings -&gt; Time &amp; Language -&gt; Region</strong> settings were set on English.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I changed the region settings to Netherlands and rebooted the PC and the spell check in the subject line is now also in Dutch.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help. </p>

    <title>PowerPoint 2010 Multiple Triggers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tamras72  say:</h3>
<h2>            PowerPoint 2010 Multiple Triggers</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 5 markers and 5 callout boxes on&nbsp;one slide. I want to use the markers as triggers to make the callout appear/disappear.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know how to get it to appear/disappear but that would require users to click 2x the same marker.&nbsp; But, what I want is to get 1 callout box to appear while hiding the other 4. So, if user click marker#1 (which displays callout#1) then click marker#2....I
 want callout #1 to disappear and callout #2 appear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If marker#1 is clicked, it should only display callout#1 -- and callout#2-5 should not be on the screen</p>
<p>If marker#2 is clicked, it should only display callout#2 -- and callout#1,3-5 should not be on the screen</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I can only seem to make it happen on the first marker/callout.&nbsp; If I set up the triggers on the other callout boxes, they are already in 'appear' state as the slide loads.&nbsp; I also tried 'motion path' so the callout are initially outside of the slide -- but
 it didnt work.</p>
<p>Any idea how I could accomplish this task?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Sorry if I confuse anyone. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks. </p>

            <p>You need to set up a trigger for each marker to make the correct callout appear and all of the others disappear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>THEN add with previous (non triggered) animations to make the ones you do not want visible at the start disapear.</p>
