<h2>            Monopoly Family Funpack</h2>
                    I bought my version through live. Every time I try to connect with a quick match I just sit idle no one ever joins. If I go to custom match it will give me the following error "it was not possible to connect to the chosen game session. Please try again."
 My friend who bought the hardcopy couldn't join me on any games last night either. Is there a difference between owning A hard copy versus downloading via live?

<p>There is not a different because both install the same files to the harddrive where the game will run from when playing. Most likely it is a server issue or an issue with your connection. You may want to test your NAT and if it is not open then try these
 steps: <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/networking/nat-error-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Also if it continues to fail try using an ethernet cable if you are not already!</p>

<p>There is no home internet issues. &nbsp;It's the Uplay service. &nbsp;Live stays connected and chat still works. &nbsp;Several times now, playing a game with friends and the connection is lost - but chat and friends are still all active. &nbsp;The game doesn't allow you to
 reconnect or join with a code to save your place - it's a shame and a waste! &nbsp;Play for over an hour, game is about to end and all players are dropped and all progress lost. &nbsp;It's unreal the quality of software these days, it's all released broken and not tested
 enough. &nbsp;I hope this gets fixed soon - or at least allows you to connect back and resume a game - there should be a save progress system. &nbsp;:( &nbsp;Most of the time our concerns are ignored and fall on deaf ears.. I hope they prove me wrong.</p>

                    <p>I developed an application in VB on a Vista based PC.&nbsp; This App uses the MS jet 4.0 provider to access an MS ACCESS Database.&nbsp; I compiled the program as an x86 app on my Vista machine using Visual studio 2010.&nbsp; I then installed the program on a Windows 7

<p>splitscreen wtf is that I have 8 of the 10 games out right now and one of them I can play 2 player with people in the same room good thing I don't have more than on kid ...I don't care about the talking to the xbox option I would like to play with 2 people
 in the same room but the only way to do this is to buy 2 of everything even the new halo game doesn't support splitscreen ...its a overpriced joke Atari had 2 player back how many years ago....and I love the xbox package I bought that came with 2 controllers
 and 3 games and out of the 3 games...no 2 player...well unless you wanted to have a race on forza with just 2 people no other cars ...and not to forget the waiting time just to play a game for the first time on the system ....they should have just updated
 the 360 but no money in that....so thanks xbox for killing games unless your a geek that lives in his mothers basement and has no life

<p>It's a shame that even late last gen these got VERY rare, and it's a shame cos it's not the same to play with your friends online. Or it's good too, but there's nothing quite like hanging at a friends place playing together.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I really hope that local co-op gets more common again in the future. If I had to rate top 3 best console features, splitscreen games are definitely up there..</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I was just at a friends place playing Diablo 3 with 3 other friends and it once again made me think like "damn, why are local co-ops so rare now!" :P</p>

<p>We can't have it all. People expect the pretty graphics of the next gen games and split screen will have to lower the resolution to render two or in some cases four screens.<br />
<br />
I think most developers are looking at it from the point of view of who actually uses the feature. Kids and families with kids for the most part. It's been a very, very long time since I've gone to a friends house to play a video game and I'm sure that's the
 case for most adults. Even my friends with kids have multiple consoles so it's not something that would see much use.<br />
<br />
In a day and age when everyone has an internet connection I think we'll see less and less split screen which may not be a bad thing if the developers are&nbsp;using the resources that would have gone for developing the split screen towards new game features.</p>

As recently as Jan 4 Blizz said they have no further platform announcements and that would be only the 360, PS3, PS4.<br />
<br />
I just bought it for the PS3 and I am currently playing through it, characters will transfer to the PS4. I own it on 3 platforms now ( PC, 360, PS3 ), I have no desire to purchase three expansions.</p>

<p>I think split screen has become a neglected feature due to the massive boom in online play. Obviously online play has great advantages such as not having to leave home and getting the full screen to yourself. It is a shame to be honest but I always hated
 only getting half the TV anyway.</p>

<h3> nick_adam  say:</h3>
<h2>            Netflix app &#40;entire app window&#41; drops out of maximized mode when switching video to full screen and back</h2>
                    This just became an issue yesterday, after the app for some reason started up on the wrong desktop yesterday (dual monitor setup) and I had to manually move it back to the correct screen. I usually have the Netflix app maximized, and jump into full screen
 video when watching something. Afterwards when I go out of full screen it would usually just jump back to maximized window, but now it always goes to windowed mode, slightly smaller than maximized and hiding parts of the lower menu behind the task bar. I have
 to manually change the window back to maximized every single time I leave full screen video.<br />
<br />
How has this happened and what do I do to get it to stick with maximized like it did before?<br />
<br />
Also, the monitors are still set up the same, the same screen is primary like always. The bug when Netflix moved to the secondary happened after a game started and seemed to get confused about my monitor setup and minimized itself when starting up, and moving
 two open apps to the secondary monitor desktop. The display driver must have bugged out and dropped the main monitor for a second or something.

    <title>Windows Movie Maker is always freezing. Particularly when adding - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jrosworld  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Movie Maker is always freezing. Particularly when adding titles.</h2>
                    When I'm using Windows Movie Maker, I have a big problem in that the program keeps on "not responding". In most cases the program cannot recover and closes, meaning that I lose any unsaved work. Although this problem happens with alarming frequency, I've
 noted that it is particularly bad when adding titles or credits to the timeline. Often to add just one title, the program will freeze and shut-down on 5 attempts before I'm able to add it successfully. And ideas on how to fix this would be greatly appreciated.

<blockquote>It didn't help. It was fine when I was editing the .avi files that I was making the video with. But as soon as I started adding in titles and transitions, it probably closed due to 'not responding' around 10 times.<br />
<br />
Any other ideas? Would it be likely to help if I deleted and reinstalled the program?<br />

================================<br />
You could have an issue with your video driver...if<br />
you reduce the Graphics Hardware Acceleration as<br />
per the instructions in the following article...you may <br />
see an improvement. If...yes...you need to update <br />
your video driver. (improvement or not...be sure to<br />
return the acceleration to full after the experiment)<br />
<br />

<br />
(Scroll down to : On a computer that is running Windows Vista)<br />
<br />
And...there's a possibility that the .avi file you are <br />
working with is not fully compatible with Movie Maker. <br />
It may be worth a try to convert the .avi to .wmv and <br />
try again.<br />
<br />
You might try using one of the following apps to <br />
convert the file.<br />

(the mirror download site is faster)<br />
<br />
Reinstalling the default version 6 of Movie Maker is <br />
not really an option since it is included in the operating <br />
system. However...there are two other versions you<br />
could try if you wanted to experiment.<br />
<br />
If you go this route be sure to create a system restore <br />
point before proceeding.<br />
<br />
Good luck...<br />
<br />
There's a stripped down version for systems that are <br />
not powerful enough for version 6:<br />
<br />
Windows Movie Maker 2.6 for Vista<br />
For Vista users who cannot run the<br />
Vista version of Movie Maker<br />

<p>Hiya!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Paul from the Xbox Forums Team here to assist, it sounds like the purchase didn't go through for the promotional price. Unfortunately if you missed the promotional timeframe we wouldn't be able to provide you with the promotional price. I recommend waiting
 for the holidays to see if we have another promotion available at that time. </p>

<p>I realize it was my error but you can see what day i ordered the item. &nbsp;I cannot wait to see if you have other sales. It is a christmas gift. &nbsp;I thought since you could see i was attempting to order on cyber monday you could help out by granting the promotional
 price. I will complete this order but will not order from microsoft after this.</p>

<br />C. Recommendations
<br />
<br />1. Create a system restore point so that if something wrong happens you can revert. 
<br />Type restore point in Cortana Search &gt; Create a Restore point &gt; Check whether against your drive, Protection is ON or not. If not ON, click Configure button below to Make it ON &gt; Now press Create to create a restore point 
<br />
<br />2. Update Trend Micro to latest so that tmevtmgr.sys gets updated. If you still face problem uninstall Trend Micro and use Windows Defender in its place.
<br />
<br />3. Run Memtest for at least 8 passes (Do it overnight before going to bed)

            Pretty much it is the driver, you should contact Sony if they have a Windows 10 compatible driver the said camera.

<h2>            Will not run .TVPI files when not on C Drive</h2>
                    <p><em>? How do I set the drive or folder so that files downloaded into it will run automatically?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click a TV show in TitanTV I should be able to click the record button and it automatically adds a schedule to the WinTV record schedule.&nbsp; That's how it used to work in W7.&nbsp; It does not work in W10 (Anniversary update).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe it has to do with drive, file or folder permissions.&nbsp; Here is why and background</p>
<p>
</p><p>The main drive is partitioned into C and K drive.&nbsp; Chrome was set up to download files into the K drive and is configured to automatically run the .TVPI file with the correct software.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>- When the file downloads into the K drive folder I cannot run it (it does not work as expected)&nbsp;manually or automatically.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - No error messages. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Nothing happens.</p>
<p>- When the settings download into the C drive downloads file it works fine.</p>
<p>- BTW...any other file downloaded into the K drive download folder runs fine when I manually execute (I have not tried any auto executes)</p>
<p>- The drive, file and folder security permissions are set to "Read &amp; Execute".
</p>
<p>- I noticed that WRITE is not set for some of the Users profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've&nbsp;searched for information on file/folder permissions but there is too much noise in the results.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Nick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would like to know about this concern so we can better assist you.</p>
<p>Do you have the latest version of the app?</p>
<p>Have you checked if the drives C and K have similar permissions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We also suggest that you perform a clean startup: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/331796" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Perform a clean startup to determine whether background programs are interfering with your program.</a></p>

            <p>The program (Windows and WinTV) are the most current. &nbsp;As indicated , the C&amp;K drives have different permissions. &nbsp;But changing these is less than intuitive. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So how do I copy the permissions from the C to the K?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried using Xcopy to copy the folder from C to K but it did not work (did not copy the folder).</p>

<p>What error exactly are you getting when trying to use your converter?</p>
<p>Please check, that your video setting on the TV connection (settings / audio and video settings) is set to "hdmi" and not to "auto", as with the converter in line the one cannot get proper information to use "auto" for setting up the connection to your TV.</p>

<h2>            Banned Accounts &#40;MUST READ&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>look at the enforcement teams responses in this link: <strong>[Mod Removed]</strong>. They're
<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong> and don't even give a crap about anyone but themselves! They never even try to help you in the slightest, they only tell you the "reason" why you got banned on the forums which is pointless because the email already tells you
 that, but to make matters worse they even make a joke out of the "reason" you got banned if you do try posting on the forums for help. Every time you call their support line they always say they can't help you and always direct you to their useless forums
 and that's rubbish! We all know that the forums are are a joke, the only way I've ever heard of someone getting unbanned was from a YouTube video. Now they have the audacity to stop the banned account forums so we can't even tell them about our problems (not
 that it would matters anyways because they don't care) but if there was ever a chance that some enforcement member would have an ounce of sympathy for another human being to actually help us that's out of the question now because the just changed it so that
 you're only able to make a case on the website shortly after your account gets banned and get this, you have a time frame window! So this means all the people that were previously banned don't even have the option to open a case. That method would have actually
 been good if everyone was able to open a case and not have a limited amount of time but no, it's Microsoft so they're complete tools who don't want to deal with their problems. Not to mention at least half of the people on Xbox Live have been getting banned
 for no reason or because of getting infections from someone on an older Call of Duty game that they didn't even ask for. What bull Microsoft! I thought you were better than this but you show that you're nothing but heartless tools that give zero cares about
 your own mistakes. My account<strong> [Mod Removed]</strong> banned for over 4 years and they took away all of my stuff that I have purchased and my hard earned time that I put into the account like I'm a criminal, as if they weren't bad enough they try to
 make you spend your thousands of dollars that you've invested on your account on a new one! That's beyond messed and I'm surprised they're still getting away with this. Do what I do and don't give the criminals money! If you want something then get it Licence
 Transferred from a friend, and if you have an Xbox One do "Home Xbox's" with friends so they you can get their gold and their games. I'm not spending another cent on Microsoft unless I get my old account back. P.S I even used the banned account forums before
 they ended it and one of the enforcement member said my account was unbanned and that I should be able to access it "just fine". Long story short it wasn't unbanned and they removed the thread, but I still got the screenshot to prove it in this link:
<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong> also does anyone know what supentions are? They must not have spellcheck in their office. This is a friends account, my email is:<strong> [Mod Removed]</strong> T<span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">hanks Microsoft.
 I used to do nothing but support your consoles but now I can't even look at them without feeling angry and like I wasted a lot of time and money. I have little hope for Microsoft at this point but I thought I'd give them one last shot before blowing the candle
 out.</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong><br />

<p>I got caught? What did I get caught with? I was in a lobby on Call of Duty Word At War with people that were hacking and (XBLPET Mike) came into the lobby and banned everyone. You can't help when you get into hacked lobby's on that game. Activision, the
 publishers are too lazy to fix it and if you try playing that game today you'll notice nothing's changed and it's still hacked. Then when I post to the forums one of your enforcement team members says my account should be unbanned and work "just fine" when
 it isn't and he/shecan't even spell correctly, LOL! Take a look:<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong>&nbsp; I don't care about the account I just find it messed how the enforcement team is so ban happy and flawed and when they ban you how they take all the stuff you purchased
 along with the account. I'm going to keep spreading that link to show how faulty the enforcement team is and get the word out. You can try putting the blame on me as much as you want but I'm just a casual gamer who has been wronged.</p>

<p>I'm aware of that, that's why I said I think it's unfair that you lose all the stuff you purchased along with the account. Do you not agree that when an enforcement member says that your account should be unbanned that it should be unbanned? Also if I get
 banned from the forums for this I'll just move onto Twitter because people have to know about how faulty the enforcement team is and how to get by with a new account without rebuying your stuff. This forum is only to help people that have been wrongfully banned
 and to expose Microsoft for having a faulty enforcement team.</p>

enforcement.xbox.com/home</a> and click on the hammer. That's ridiculous how they suspend you from communicating with other players, that's a big part of Xbox Live, but then again it's the enforcement team so I'm not surprised. Hope I helped you!</p>

    <title>Windows 8 photo import stuck at 0 of X. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 8 photo import stuck at 0 of X.</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I have found the solution to a problem in Windows 8 photos. So I'm posting it here in so that someone may find it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I connected the Canon PowerShot A620 to start importing pictures and videos to the computer the process did not make it past "importing 0 out of X".</p>
<p>When canceling the process only one of the pictures would have imported to Windows. If I reconnect the device again the same thing would repeat, only this</p>
<p>time the total number of pictues to be imported has been reduced by one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To fix the problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Go to Windows store.</p>
<p>2. Click on updates in the top-right corner.</p>
<p>3. Select photos and start updating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When the update finishes the problem is resolved!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Sorry if I posted this in the wrong section, just wanted to get the solution out there since google gave me no hits when I searched for it : )</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since Bit locker requires TPM (Trusted Platform Module), the KVM switch interferes with the computer’s ability to detect the physical connection of the mouse, keyboard and monitor.
 The hardware has to be directly connected.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><strong><em>There are various methods to reinstall Vista</em></strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no Windows Vista download available from Microsoft.</p>
<p>You can contact your&nbsp;Computer Manufacturer and ask them to send you a set of Recovery Disks.</p>
<p>They should do that for a small cost.</p>
<p>To reinstall Vista using their Recovery Disk/s, you Boot from the 1st Recovery&nbsp;Disk they supply&nbsp;and follow the Manufacturer's instructions to reinstall:</p>
<p>You will have to change the Boot Order to make the DVD/CD Drive 1st in the Boot Order:</p>
<p>How to change the Boot Order in BIOS:</p>
<p><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/fixtheproblem/ss/bootorderchange.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">http://pcsupport.about.com/od/fixtheproblem/ss/bootorderchange.htm</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"How to replace Microsoft software or hardware, order service packs, and replace product manuals"</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/326246" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/326246</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if you never received a Recovery Disk when you purchased your Computer there should be a Recovery Partition on the Hard Drive to reinstall Vista back to how you bought your Computer.</p>
<p>The Recovery process can be started by pressing a particular Key or Keys&nbsp;combination at Boot. (Power On / Startup)</p>
<p>It may be F10, F11, Alt + F10, etc depending on the Manufacturer.</p>
<p>Ask them for the correct Key sequence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some manufacturers no longer have Vista Recovery Disks available.</p>
<p>If that happens, you may have to try this instead:</p>
<p><span>You can also borrow and use&nbsp;a Microsoft Vista DVD, that contains the files for the various Vista Editions (Home Basic, Home Premium, Business and Ultimate)&nbsp;to be installed. The Product Key on your Computer / Laptop case&nbsp;determines which Edition is
 installed. </span></p>
<p><span>Other Manufacturers' Recovery DVDs are not to be used for the&nbsp;above purpose.</span></p>
<p><span>And&nbsp;you need to know&nbsp;the "bit" version for Vista, as 32bit and 64bit Editions&nbsp;come on different DVDs</span></p>
<p><span>Here is how to do a clean install of Vista, using a Microsoft Vista DVD:</span></p>
<p><span>"<b>How to Do a Clean Install and Setup with a Full Version of Vista"</b></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/117366-clean-install-full-version-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/117366-clean-install-full-version-vista.html</font></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>And once the Operating System is installed, go to your Computer Manufacturer's website and obtain the latest Drivers for your particular Model Computer or Laptop.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>And phone Activation may be required when using the above clean install Method.</span></p>

            Hello,
<br />
<br />This is widely reported and known issue at the moment. We're expecting a fix from Microsoft, in upcoming Windows Updates.
<br />
<br />As of now, you can use classic Windows Photo Viewer to view photos:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/open-images-with-windows-photo-viewer-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.kapilarya.com/open-images-with-wind...</a>
<br />
<br />To edit Photos, you can use MS Paint or third-party program such as Paint.net, IrfanView.
<br />
<br />Regards.

            Hi, CalebBaker1 
<br />
<br />Follow these steps, I hope you can solve the problem.
<br />
<br />Go to Settings&gt; Applications&gt; Applications and features. From here you should look for the application in question. You will not be able to do anything unless you enter the advanced options. Here you will see an option called Reset and that, pressing it will solve the problem. Just sit down and wait for the system to do its job, then do the test to see if you have found the right solution.
<br />Another option is to reinstall the app. Yes, this can be done if you use the PowerShell (press the Windows key + S) and type the following command: get-appxpackage * Microsoft.Windows.Photos * | remove-appxpackage. Then you just have to find the app in the Store and install it again. Now that the Store is out, you can choose another of the free apps that are available to you and then use them as default apps if you do not like Photos as such.

<div>Hi Gary Rich,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>USB 2.0 VGA Adapter is not a program. It's a hardware device.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. What automated troubleshooters have you tried?</div>
<div>2. Are you referring to secondary monitor by any chance?</div>
<div>3. What Operating system is installed in your computer?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Well, since, you have mentioned USB 2.0 VGA Adapter which , I am sure the issue has to be with secondary monitor.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You would be interested in following the below given steps in order to fix the issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 1:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You may access the link below and follow the steps to setup dual monitor on your computer and check if it helps in detecting the secondary monitor.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/976064" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/976064</a></div>

<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/work-and-play-better-with-multiple-monitors#section_1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/work-and-play-better-with-multiple-monitors#section_1</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Refer the links below for more details on troubleshooting multiple monitors:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Move windows between multiple monitors<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Move-windows-between-multiple-monitors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Move-windows-between-multiple-monitors</strong></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Troubleshoot multiple monitor problems<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Troubleshoot-multiple-monitor-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Troubleshoot-multiple-monitor-problems</strong></a></div>
<div><br />
<strong>Step 2:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If the issue is still not resolved, I’d suggest you to uninstall the display drivers and re-install the same and check if that fixes the issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a. Click Start, type Device Manager in the Start search box and hit Enter.</div>
<div>b. Locate Display adapter and expand the same.</div>
<div>c. Select the display adapter you wish to uninstall.</div>
<div>d. Right-click and select Uninstall.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Follow the on-screen instructions. Restart the computer, if prompted.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>After the computer restarts, visit the manufacturer’s website and download and install the latest chipset and display adapter drivers and check if that fixes the issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 3:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If that doesn’t help, you may also try by reducing the video hardware acceleration and check if that fixes the issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a. Open Display Settings by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking Appearance and Personalization, clicking Personalization, and then clicking Display Settings.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
b. Click Advanced Settings, click the Troubleshoot tab, and then click Change settings.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that some video card drivers do not permit you to change settings.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>c. Move the Hardware acceleration slider to different levels, apply the changes and then try to play the game.</div>
