<h2>            HTC 8X Bluetooth Connectivity Issues</h2>
                    I am running OS 8.0.10327.77 and trying to connect to bluetooth devices. The phone connects however, I walk away more than 2 feet and it chops up or breaks all together. I've tried unpairing and pairing the devices however it still hasn't worked. It doesn't
 detect any updates so the phone is up to date. And it still isn't working, no idea what else is left.

</p><p>Hi AZGN,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Main reason for those devices not working at more then two foot distance could be that they may be incompatible with Windows OS. The connection is most likely to be stronger if you use other Microsoft devices to pair with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the inconvenience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Wishes,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Polina S.</p>

    <title>Random reboots with 8.1 update developer preview - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Random reboots with 8.1 update developer preview</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>since installing the 8.1 update developer preview, I have seen random reboots on my Lumia 920. The reboots happen at least once a day while using the phone but also when it is in standby.&nbsp;This happened with the black firmware before and after a hard reset
 and unfortunately continuous after installing the cyan firmware with the nokia recovery tool. When 8.1 developer preview (no update, at that time with the black firmware) was installed, I did not encounter these issues. Is there any way to debug/fix these
 problems?</p>

            <p>If it was a software problem it would happen with all phones.</p>
<p>The official 8.1 Update 1 will roll-out with accompanying firmware that might be needed for your phone to work 100% with the new update.</p>
<p>Still, it is good to get in touch with your local Nokia Care to see if they have a solution for you.</p>

    <title>Problems with StyleRef field in header on pages where endnotes are - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rayvd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems with StyleRef field in header on pages where endnotes are displayed</h2>
                    <p>Hello,<br />
</p>
<p>I have a 400+ page document that has a number of section breaks, and many of the sections have some number of endnotes, which in some cases span a few pages&nbsp;(and whose numbering restarts with each section). On the top of each page in the document (beginning
 after the table of contents), I have two fields. The left one for the Heading 1 StyleRef, and the right one for the Heading 2 StyleRef.<br />
<br />
Everything works fine for the main body of text, but on pages where only endnotes are displayed, both StyleRef fields (left header: Heading 1 and right header: Heading 2) display text from seemingly random places in the document. In fact, sometimes it changes
 without apparent reason (no change in the document). It seems to pull them typically from headings near the beginning of the document.<br />
<br />
It seems to be a bug, but is there a work-around that doesn't require manually editing the header for each section's endnotes? I tried updating the fields, but to no avail.<br />
<br />
Thank you for any help you can provide.<br />
</p>

<p>My skype to land line phones was working fine then I ran out of credit as my new credit card got lost in the mail so could not top up. I now have the new card and sucessfully put $25 onto my account but now every time I try to make a call it gives about
 two rings and cuts off. I have tried various numbers that I know are working and get exactly the same result.</p>

                    I am using word 97 - 2003. The document is set up with 1.0 space but when I send to the mailing/envelope tool, both the deliver to and return addresses show up with extra spacing. When I try to remove the spaces while in mailing the second line&nbsp;combines
 with the first line as if there is no space. When I go back to paragraph in&nbsp;the originating document I do not have the option to remove space after paragraph, only to add space after. What step am I missing?

            <p>It would appear that your Envelope Address style has some Spacing Before/After. There are two ways around this (short of modifying the style, which will solve the problem permanently):</p>
<ol>
<li>In the Envelope dialog, select the entire address, right-click and choose Paragraph, and then, in the Paragraph dialog, remove any Spacing Before/After.
</li><li>In the Envelope dialog, delete the paragraph break between lines and substitute a line break (Shift+Enter).</li></ol>

<h2>            Attachments not Displaying in Inbox</h2>
                    <p>The new version of Outlook.com has stopped displaying attachments (file and MMS) in the inbox. This worked fine up to the 27th September in the old version. I know the attachments are there because when I reply or forward, They show up in the right-hand
 detail pane. I doubt that it's my Norton's Internet Security because all&nbsp;was working fine until Tuesday. Can anyone help?</p>

            <p>Hi Jamile,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the response. I also posted the problem to a different thread and it has been resolved. Apparently you need to have&nbsp;an outlook.com email address as a primary for attachments in the inbox to show properly. Considering all the problems caused by
 the outlook.com upgrade it would be nice if users had a single reference sheet to help them with the upgrade problems instead of floundering for weeks. There are still other problems which I will post separately.</p>

    <title>Visited Links Not Changing Color After Bing Search IE 11 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Visited Links Not Changing Color After Bing Search IE 11</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>if I click on&nbsp;links after a Bing search process (over address bar or <a href="http://www.bing.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.bing.com</a>) and go back to the search site again, the visited links&nbsp;are still in&nbsp;their default blue color which is really annoying. If I do the same with Google preferences (address bar or
<a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.google.com</a>) it works all as it should: visited links are purple and all other are blue.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I tried changing manually the color profile over "Internet Options" and used the tool for resetting the IE options but nothing helped so far.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I hope using other search vendors isn't the only solution&nbsp;to solve my problem because I really like the Bing search results.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks for helping!</p>

<h2>            Receiving someone else&#39;s email to my Hotmail acct &#40;same email address&#41; - help&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>About a week ago I created a hotmail account.&nbsp;&nbsp; Almost instantly I started receiving spam-type emails but addressed to someone named Gretchen.&nbsp;&nbsp; My name isn't Gretchen.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of these emails are legit emails, pertaining to university alumni, professional
 inservice dates, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; All addressed to Gretchen.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I noticed when sending anyone an email from this account, strangely I would have this strange picture showing in my hotmail profile.....of a lady and a little boy.&nbsp; Not a picture I uploaded or have
 ever seen.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of the emails (like those going to a particular email list) show a full name for Gretchen, eg) (not real name).....Gretchen Smith-Jones.&nbsp;&nbsp; So I looked up that name on facebook and there was that strange picture....and according to that person's
 FB profile, it makes sense why I was receiving a lot of career/professional membership/association type emails (as her profile shows what she does for a living).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So how can this be?&nbsp;&nbsp; My first thought was that maybe this email address of mine was an old one that she used to use?......but if at any time she closed that account, how would have been able to just enable it again when I set up a new account...and when
 it came to the place in the account set-up where you choose your username and it tells you if that name is available, it obviously said that it was or I wouldn't have been able to use that one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I'm really at a loss here as to how I was able to create a hotmail account with a username that's the same one that someone else did/is using?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone ever encountered this before?&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not believe this is a case hacking, based on the age and professional background of this woman.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ALSO..I did send her a message through Facebook trying to find out if she still uses the particular hotmail
 email address I'm using, but she hasn't responded (likely because I'm not a 'friend' and my message ended up in her 'other' messages folder that she either doesn't know about or hasn't checked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

 bank statements, etc. Hopefully someone here will help us straighten this all out. I don't know about you but I am totally frustrated over this!!! Good luck.

            Yeah Gail -- can you imagine some of your bank statements being sent to some stranger?&nbsp;&nbsp; That's beyond ludicrous.&nbsp;&nbsp; The blame is fully, 100% on Microsoft because they should not have EVER allowed people to create new email accts with addresses that had
 been previously used in the past.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is unthinkable and mindblowing.&nbsp;&nbsp; The lady who I sent a msg to on FB (whose confidential emails I'm receiving), she hasn't read my PM.&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, it's bad enough getting one's own spam, now to get spam intended
 for someone else is a huge steaming pile of horse chyt.

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>First of all-DON'T! I'll explain why and it involves the oldest trick in the book after the apple-and sheepherding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, right click the sender in the list and choose View message source. You will see the full message and it's sender information. things to look for are things that say FAIL or unknown and if there are several email addresses in the list of recipients.
 The last one is especially indicative of a likely fraudulent/SPAM message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, spammers play on your curiousity...they bank on you clicking or replying, because you are NICE and want to solve a perceived problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, DON'T. You are being compromised if you do. Mark it as spam, a phishing scam if that's what you fell it is or just delete it unopened. I would recommend that you do report it as it helps Your email provider (ANY ONE) define spam and combat it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, how can you be certain that a link is genuine and that it's going to where you think it should?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it's already in you Junk/Spam folder then the chances arepretty good that it's what the folder says it is. If you are sure it really isn't find Move to and put it where it belongs. This will also train not to put it in Junk,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A: It's not always so easy. You have possibly expected to see the links revealed at the bottom of the browser screen when you hover over them and that's not always the case. You may not be sending where you think and that's a big problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Stop knocking Microsoft. They didn't invent email, hypertext protocol (http) or most of anything you all complain about and it has nothing to do with Outlook/Hotmail/MSN-Live.com. The answer here is common sense, which ain't so common as it has been said.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If mail is not addressed to you, you don't recognize the sender and especially if you didn't ask for whatever it was/subscribe/belong to/not a friend or relative etc...don't open it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using View message source allows you to see the content, as does a preview but I couldn't vouch for a preview as it could trigger an auto-opening routine if that were part of an exploit (i.e. malware/virus etc). Many email programs and sites offer a preview
 window if you need to explore further and most block suspicious images to protect you (and you can still ask to view them).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft recommends that and it isn't just talk.</p>
<p>

            <p>Um dude, what are you talking about?&nbsp;&nbsp; The issue myself and Gail are having (and no doubt many others) has nothing to do with "clicking on any link" in any email we received.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I set up the particular hotmail email acct 2 weeks ago and within a half hour I was receiving a lot of emails addressed to "Gretchen".&nbsp;&nbsp; Emails to this individual were the first emails I'd ever received in my inbox to that new account.&nbsp; In fact, I'd never
 even sent out an email from that account at that point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I go into the search box on Facebook&nbsp; and type in my email address (that was obviously this woman's previous email address), it takes me directly to her Facebook profile.&nbsp;&nbsp; The very first email I sent from this hotmail acct had some strange picture of
 a woman holding a little boy, that was foreign to me (I don't even have kids).&nbsp; As it turns out, that is her main FB profile picture.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The emails I'm receiving are not all spam.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of them contain her person info, they come from one of her banks which show her current balances (mortgage, savings) and credit card debt balances.&nbsp;&nbsp; This woman works as an Human Resources professional as
 per her FB profile (University Degree in same).&nbsp;&nbsp; 80% of the emails I'm receiving are from her professional career associations, university alumni correspondence, professional-related conferences and workshops.&nbsp; I'm even receiving email notifications each
 time someone tags her in a message on Facebook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I'm dealing with has nothing whatsoever to do with phishing, clicking on links.&nbsp; I have never clicked on any link because I know better than that.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sorry buddy but you're off the mark here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>From what I've seen this is pretty similar to several other questions asked here, perhaps searching them and reading through the answers you can find the answer. I don't have Facebook, that's not relevant...if Outlook is using some social avatar as a default
 you can change that in settings. If you're getting email for a Facebook member perhaps you should look to see if there is a problem realted to a Facebook issue or an exploit.</p>

            <p>I wasn't aware questions asked here on a Microsoft Question Forum were answered merely by non-Microsoft people who were essentially just "guessing."&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>It is very relevant about the connection in my case between Facebook and this occurrence and given that you don't even have a FB account, perhaps you should stick with things you actually know about.&nbsp;&nbsp; This has nothing to do with being hacked....it is a
 matter of me creating a hotmail account with an email address that someone had previously used (and had connected to their FB account) but either disabled or let go dormant.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's clear that you're not really understanding my issue or Gail's and thus you're
 continuing on with the 'hacking' stance.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not looking for someone to "guess"......was looking for others who are experiencing this and what they were able to do to resolve it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Please don't bother offering me any further "help" because I simply don't
 have time or the patience to deal with useless responses made up of ignorant "guesses" and clearly not taking into consideration all of the particular details I provided.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            i am having the same unwanted emails problem! i recently set up a new email address, but it seems that it is still in use somewhere else aswell....i keep getting german/austrian job applications with CVs attached etc. i know that the email address was
 previously used by an austrian man, because Paypal helped me figure out what was going on at the start. as far as i am aware, he de-activated the account on hotmail and paypal, so it was therefore available for me, but i cannot figure out why i keep getting
 emails for his clients?! i keep junking them, but i want them to stop. i tried to google search the man's name and the email address, but i cannot figure out where these job application people are getting this address.

            <p>It's definitely frustrating.&nbsp;&nbsp; Clearly Hotmail screwed up and should never have allowed a previously used email address to be used again by someone else if this is what happens.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have not tried this yet and don't know if it will work but this seems to
 be a phone # to reach Hotmail.&nbsp;&nbsp; Clearly they rely on people like us to answer each other's questions which is useless when we have the same problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe give them a call too?&nbsp; In your case, it's possible he has an old outdated website somewhere with his
 old/outdated email address still posted?&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe you could try emailing some of these people back and asking them where they got the email address from/what website?

    <title>&#34;About me&#34; and Delve points to old ID - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;About me&#34; and Delve points to old ID</h2>
                    
<p>Several months ago we changed our company UPN from an ID to our email address. We successfully converted all existing SharePoint users over to their emails using PowerShell and permissions, etc., all work fine. The only problem we seem to have (and this
 only with some people) is that when they click on "About me"&nbsp; or select Delve from the app list, they get the following error:</p>
<p>We can’t load your profile right now. Please try again later. If you keep seeing this message, contact your IT department for help. Correlation Id: d2143c9d-9005-2000-2113-2da0e110b817</p>
<p>If they then click on "Profile" in Delve their profile will then load correctly.</p>
<p>In troubleshooting this I discovered that when these users click on About me or Delve their URLs are pointing to their old ID. I looked at their profiles in SharePoint Admin Center and the old IDs do not exist, yet they are still being directed to the old
 ID. When they click on "Profile" within Delve the URL changes to the email address.</p>
<p>I have looked all over their profile and I cannot figure out why this fragment of the old ID is still connected to the About&nbsp;me option. Any help would be greatly appreciated!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Could you help check the following?</p>
<p>Go to user info list of my site host site collection 
https://mvc***-my.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/people.aspx?MembershipGroupId=0. Are there duplicated records? If the old profiles are available there, please delete them and see if the issue can be solved.</p>
<p>If no redundant records are listed, let us know and we’ll investigate further.</p>

<h2>            Connecting my university&#39;s Outlook email to other services</h2>
                    <p>Half a month ago my university moved all emails to outlook. I used to have it connected to my personal email account but now I can no longer do it.</p>
<p>When connecting accounts, I have to fill out the fields for username, password and POP server.</p>
<p>I know my password and the POP server is&nbsp;outlook.office365.com according to the settings in Outlook. The port 995 seems correct too.</p>
<p>However, my main problem is the username. The way I have to connect to Outlook is by using my old email as a username, which takes me to my university's login page where I use my student ID number. None of them alone let me connect the accounts, I effectively
 have two usernames for my login and can only use one in the required field.</p>
<p>How can I connect my emails?</p>

<p>Hi KaspKarl,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your posting. According to the subject, connecting your university account to other service, May I confirm with you, whether what you mentioned is connected account feature in
 Office 365? And you want to add your personal account to your school account as a connected account? And both two accounts are Office 365 pure online accounts? Please be kindly noted Microsoft have removed the ability to add new accounts to Outlook on the
 web using the Connected accounts feature since September 2018.​ Here’s more details about that:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/connect-email-accounts-in-outlook-on-the-web-office-365-d7012ff0-924f-4f78-8aca-c3912d886c4d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Connect email accounts in Outlook on the web (Office 365)</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or your main issue is you can’t add your university account to Outlook desktop client? If so, please try to update Outlook firstly via File-&gt;Office account-&gt;Update Options-&gt;<strong>Update
 Now</strong>, this way to make sure that the client is in the latest version. About the login ID, I suggest that you may need to contact your admin to confirm which your current login ID is and use your current ID to add your account to the client. Besides,
 in most situation for Office 365 account, we often suggest users using Exchange Autodicovery to add their accounts to Outlook. Have you ever received any error messages when this issue occurs? If yes, could you please share a full screenshot of that error
 messages with me for checking? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please feel free to let me know if there are any misunderstood or you have the different scenario.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Anna</p>

<h2>            internet explorer won&#39;t load any sites</h2>
                    i don't know why but when i type in an address and press search absolutely nothing happens. as my homepage i have MSN news and that is live as the pictures change as usual. i have windows 8 and the latest IE. i know my internet connection is fine because
 i am now using firefox and writing this. i have norton 360 and have scanned my computer, done tune up etc but still IE doesn't work. i suppose in the scheme of things it doesn't matter as i can use others like firefox, but it is alittle annoying that i can't
 figure out whats up or how to fix it. any suggestions. oh yeah, i have a norton toolbar on the browser and i can open sites with that but not with IE, norton is an add-on.

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">As per the issue description, you are unable to access any websites using your Internet Explorer 10 as nothing happens when you type the website address and press
 the “Search” button. You have also mentioned that you are able to access the websites using Firefox browser and also your homepage which is “www.msn.com” loads without any issues on Internet Explorer 10 and also gets updated by itself. It would be great if
 you can provide me with some information regarding this issue.</font></p>

<p>
<font color="#000000"><span><span><font>1.</font><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">If you are facing this issue with all the websites, then I would first suggest you to check if you are typing the website address in the correct place. You should
 be typing the website address only in the address bar of Internet Explorer 10. Try the first method to make sure that you are typing the website address in the address bar.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000">When you open the Internet Explorer 10, if you are getting the homepage as “<b><i>MSN for Windows 8</i></b>”, then you will have its web
 address “http://t.msn.com/” in the address bar of Internet Explorer 10. You may delete this address from the address bar and then type “www.microsoft.com” and press enter on the keyboard and check if you are able to connect to Microsoft website.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">If you are sure that you are typing the website address in the address bar of the Internet Explorer and still if you are unable to connect to any websites, then
 this might be due to the Internet Explorer performance issues. To check this let’s try the next method and check if that works.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">Let’s check if the Add-ons are causing the issue. For this try the following:</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">This will open the Internet Explorer with all the Add-on disabled. So now, try to access the web pages that caused the Internet Explorer to crash. If you are able
 to access those web pages without any issues, then you may check which browser add-on has caused this issue by referring the article: “Manage add-ons in Internet Explorer” from this link:</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>

<h2>            Help&#33; Can you beam movies from your device to a smart TV&#63;</h2>
                    Hi, I'm. New here and really want to the 1520, but coming from a note 3, it's a deal breaker whether or not I can beam media(movies) onto a smart TV screen. Also, does anyone no if you can download torrents directly to your mobile etc for movies and music
 and watch them on the device as well as beam them onto the tv? Is there torrent apps available for that kind of thing?<br />
<br />
Many thanks in advance.

<p>Most Samsung Smart TVs only support this with Samsung mobiles. Lumia Windows Phones do have the ability but the TV does not support unless it does DNLA</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Due to the closed nature of the OS there is no option to download torrents straight to the phone. Would not really see the benefit for that either though. I do download torrents to my NAS at home which I can access though the phone though. I can then stream
 the video to the phone using Plex,</p>

            Just in response to the torrent comment. I have you tubed downloading torrents on a lumia and there are videos showing people doing this. There are torrent apps in the app store as I checked. I have no idea if these are the correct apps that are relevant
 for what I want as I am new to Windows phones. But coming from a Samsung user on Android, I would really miss having the option to be able to download movies and music to my device.

<p>The point is that while you can get a torrent app it will not be able to download the video to a location other apps or the system can access them. Only the torrent app can access the data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While it was announced the expected update (this spring) for Windows Phone will allow up- and downloading to/from say the SD card we do not yet know how this will be implemented exactly or whether that would include things like torrents.&nbsp;</p>

            Ah, OK. I understand...kind of!!! Doesn't seem much point in having the torrent apps available if you can't do anything with the files on your phone afterwards. I think I will have to have a rethink on whether to migrate from my Galaxy note 3 to a 1520.
 Shame, as I am in love with the yellow version!<br />
<br />
Many thanks for taking the time to explain things.

            Does wp torrent give you the option to search and download them straight to your device as well as watch them?<br />
<br />
Can I download and play music too from it? And would all my music be in one place still, or would the torrent music be in a seperate place?<br />
<br />
Thank you.

<p>I just searched for torrent apps and read some of the app features.</p>
<p>The torremt music would probably be in the app. I didn't read anything different in the app.</p>
<p>You probably can not use the app and 'play to'</p>

            Ah, ok, Thank you for letting me no that. I have a note 3 at the moment and downloading stuff is a breeze. I no windows is more of a closed OS compared to Android, and I'm not expecting it to be as easy as it is on my Note 3, but as long as there's a way,
 I'm happy happy to sacrifice ease of use so I can get my hands on the Yellow 1520 lol!<br />
<br />
Many thanks for your help once again.

            <p>Hi SO,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am afraid I don't have a solution for you but is may comfort you to know you're not the only one. There seems to be issues with the 'input' layer of this build. Usually, waiting a bit works and if that doesn't help, do a restart (keep pressing Alt-F4 until
 you get the 'power' menu). </p>
<p>
</p><p>It is just one of those things that running a preview build throws up from time to time. And its no good saying that this should have been fixed long ago. Things are changing continuously at all levels. Building an OS is not like building a house, i.e. you
 build a foundation and when that is done you progress to the next layer and so on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just be patient and wait for the next flight, it shouldn't be too long now</p>
        </p>

            I know this. I'm just saying even on the official stable builds this still remains a problem, but just not as bad. Simply reseting Windows Explorer usually fixes the problem, but that doesn't work here, nor do the other fixes. So, yes it should have been
 fixed a while ago. Along with the gaping issues the Windows Store has for everyone as well.

            The problem is that it's not a common bug and when it's reported many don't supply info about the system that is having the issues, &nbsp;a lot of times this can be fixed by doing a "clean" install, some problems are caused by corrupted files when downloaded,
 I still see people trying to use the Preview as an everyday system which is no problem but need to understand that it is beta and may have problems.

            <p>Hi Gregoire,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately I can't help you other then saying that since I last posted, I did a Clean Install, starting&nbsp;with the 14295 build and that my problems with the Start menu not opening have largely disappeared, but not completely. It is simply still a weak point
 with all W10 builds. I did have some other minor issues (Edge and Shutdown slow, ...), and those have disappeared. On the whole the 14316&nbsp;build is simply running better. So I recommend just doing a Clean Install. It so happens that in another thread someone
 claimed to have an 14316 ISO and I have asked where he got that. I have in the past converted an ESD to an ISO but the tool I used before does not work anymore&nbsp;on this build. From what I gather the decryption key has changed again and I couldn't find any newer
 tool anywhere. The 48-hour delay is a bit of a bummer. So I will post If I have any more info on this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I don't think that doing a clean install could help solve the bug here and so I'll leave it waiting to help solve this issue (I don't know for how long as for a strange reason my legitimate Windows XP isn't recognized as "original" anymore and windows 10
 is my only windows I should use for the program which don't have linux support).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, thank for your answer :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is a simple swap of windows.old and windows enough to return to build 14295 ?</p>

            <p>Hello <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/ac23f71b-47a8-4659-8629-1847c21c4cb9">
<font color="#0072c6">Nadadavies</font></a>,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We apologize for the delayed response on your inquiry. I understand that you are seeing a different profile picture after sending an email. Let me help you with your concern.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By default, Outlook.com will display the profile picture that you have set up on your Profile. You can delete or manage the profile picture showing on your account&nbsp;by going to this
<a href="https://profile.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you try to connect any third party service on your account? If yes, I would advice that you check the settings for third party connected service on Outlook.com. Kindly follow the instructions below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sign in to <a href="https://mail.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://mail.live.com</a> or
<a href="https://outlook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.com</a>.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the&nbsp;<strong>options icon</strong> located at the upper right part of the screen.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select <strong>More mail settings</strong>.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under “<strong>Reading email</strong>”, click <strong>Content from third-party networks</strong>.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Choose <strong>Don't show public content from third-party networks</strong>.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click <strong>Save</strong> to confirm changes. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If in case the steps did not work, and you still see the stranger's picture, try to remove the connection of any third party service on your account. See the instructions below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How to remove the connected services</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sign in to <a href="https://account.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com</a>.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click <strong>Permissions</strong>.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click <strong>Manage other accounts</strong>.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click <strong>Edit</strong> under the connected service that you want to remove your Microsoft account from.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ex. Facebook</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click <strong>Remove this connection completely</strong>.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click <strong>Remove</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>or </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sign in <a href="https://profile.live.com/cid-e69224bfe91692c9/services/?biciid=accounts&amp;view=manage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>. </p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click <strong>Edit</strong> under the connected service that you want to remove your Microsoft account from.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ex. Facebook</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click <strong>Remove this connection completely</strong>.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click <strong>Remove</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank&nbsp; you for your answer <em>however, </em>I<strong>&nbsp; DO NOT </strong>have a Facebook account and the profile&nbsp;photo&nbsp;which is linked to my email address is not my profile. It is the profile of someone who has the same name as me who does have a Facebook
 account. I <strong>CANNOT</strong> remove Facebook from the connected services because I do not have a facebook account and&nbsp; therefore Facebook is not listed as a connected service for my profile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can 'hide' her picture by going into more mail settings and setting <strong>
Don't show public content from third-party networks </strong>on - but this does not break the link. When I go to this page (more mail settings) it shows this woman's photo profile under Facebook - but like I said above I don't have a Facebook account.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a theory: I have a hotmail.com email address, this stranger&nbsp;maybe has&nbsp;an outlook.com email address and as we have the same name Microsoft&nbsp;Outlook thinks we are the same person but she has a Facebook account and I don't - &nbsp;so somehow Mircosoft Outlook
 has made a false link between our identities which I can't break using&nbsp;the instructions above because I don't have a Facebook account (as I have already said a few times now).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So how do I get rid of the link with this Facebook account? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This must be happening to more people than just me -surely there is a solution.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks N. </p>

                    I&nbsp;have Microsoft Office Home and Student 2010, i bought it in July 2010 and it has been working perfectly well up until this week. Everytime I try to open any of the applications (excel, word, powerpoint) I am getting an error message saying " Microsoft

 message. Please help me as I need access to my files.

<h2>            problem with Music player in E52</h2>
                    
<p>I have E52 and I use it as an MP3 player for audio books.</p>
<p>I have the following problem:</p>
<p>I pause mp3. Then either I call somebody or somebody calls me.</p>
<p>When I end the call the mp3 starts playing again.</p>
<p>The player starts even if I don'y pick up the call - simply after the call request ends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where should I change settings to avoid automatic stsrt of mp3 player after finishing of a call?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And related question but about additional mp3 player:</p>
<p>Does anybody know an mp3 player software for E52 that allows starting playing mp3 file from any moment of the record (not only from the beginning)? So far the only method I know is to stop player in the middle and turning it on later.</p>
<p>The audio book files are 15 to 25 minutes and I don't want to play one file twice from the beginning.</p>

<h2>            Cannot print from any browser</h2>
                    I cannot print from either I8 or Firefox, on a new Dell computer with Windows 7 factory installed.<br />
<br />
With I8 comes the following message:<br />
<br />
Line&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2032<br />
Char&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br />
Error&nbsp;&nbsp; Unspecified error<br />
Code&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0<br />
URL:&nbsp; res://ieframe.dll/preview.js<br />
<br />
I have no printing problems with any other programs.<br />
<br />
I can make the problem go away by restoring the system to the previous Automatic Restore Point, but after a while it comes back and doesn't go away until I restore again.<br />
<br />
I have reset I8, but that did no good.<br />
<br />
I have attempted to run regsvr32 ole32.dll as an administrator but always get the 0x80070005 error.<br />
<br />
Help! <br />
<br />

That's probably a sign of a permissions problem.&nbsp; I would run ProcMon to trace the registry accesses the regsvr32.exe command is trying to make.&nbsp; That could show you if there was a key which needed to have its permissions changed.&nbsp; Etc.&nbsp; Another possibility
 would be to check if there are any extra diagnostics created to supplement that error code.&nbsp; E.g. perhaps in the Event log?&nbsp; ProcMon could help with that too, e.g. show you if any files were being written to just after the error was detected.<br />
