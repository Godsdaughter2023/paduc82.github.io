<h2>            Unable to delete MKV file</h2>
                    In Windows 7 I am trying to delete a large(5 GB) MKV file. When I right click and try and delete the file I get an error message " File in use - the action can't be completed because the file is open in Windows Explorer"
<div>the file is not open or in use and if i go into task manager and stop windows explorer - i can't do anything. How can I delete this file. I have tried rebooting and everything i can think of! Very frustrating!

<h2>            Zipped encrypted file doesn&#39;t prompt for password while opening</h2>
                    <p>Windows 7. I have a zipped passworded file. When i open the file with the password with wordpad. IT will then open that file every time with out a password.</p>
<p>It is listed in the recent file list and when i click on it. It will open that file everytime with out asking for a password. I have to go into regedit and delete recent files to clear that list. What that means is anyone with access to my computer can open
 that file without using a password. </p>
<p>Is there anyway to set wordpad so it will have to ask for the password before it opens the file?

<p>The file has a password. And i am asked everytime if i go to the file and try to open it.
</p>
<p>But Wordpad does not ask. It is almost as if wordpad keeps a temp file with the text in it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am not aware of a facility within Wordpad to password-protect a file. Please use snippingtool.exe to create a snapshot that shows exactly how you apply this password. You will need to save the file, then uploade it with the "mountain" icon in the symbol
 bar of your reply.<br />

            <p>Hi and thank you for your response.&nbsp; I attached an image of my Start Screen.&nbsp; Strange issue.&nbsp; Here is a sample scenario:</p>
<ul>
<li>I open Outlook</li><li>I open powerpoint</li><li>I minimize powerpoint - the Start Screen reappears.&nbsp; Outlook SHOULD appear, though, right?</li><li>Also, pressing the windows button at this point does nothing.</li></ul>
<div>
<p>However, I can make the Start Screen appear by pressing the Windows button.&nbsp; Then, it will disappear when pressing it again.&nbsp; It just won't work in the above scenario.&nbsp; Strange, right?</p>

                    <p>Original title: I have an Windows 7 computer and when I try to create a video I get an error "cannot open demuxer." How can this be solved?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I get that error message when I try to create a video. I got a new laptop but I only started to receive this message recently. When trying to create a video of pictures and music with other programs, that message appears. Could something have been removed
 during an antivirus scan and now it's missing?<br />
<br />
If something was removed, I can I find out and fix the problem?<br />

            Hi,
<br />
<br />Connect the phone to PC and navigate to the camera roll... Take the file ending .tmh and copy it to desktop.
<br />
<br />Right click the file &gt; Properties &gt; edit the .thm off so it ends .mp4 &gt; save and acknowledge the warning about changing file extension
<br />
<br />Now you have the mp4 video of the Living Image. It has no audio but will play in any mp4 video compliant player. Then use any converter to make a gif.

<p>Hello ZilberTC,</p>
<p>Yes, Microsoft point cards can still be redeemed to buy content from Xbox LIVE. However, the Microsoft pints will be converted into currency for you country. The currency for the Points will be how much you bought worth of. For EX: 1,200 Points= $20 after
 that you then can start buying games and apps from Xbox Market Place.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

            Hi Matt<br /><br />I am an independent advisor here to help?<br /><br />what happens when you try to upload this file? Any error messages? Do you have the dump file saved? are you able to move it into the OneDrive folder on your computer and let it synchronize from there? Are you able to log into the website and drag and drop it into the web browser page?

<h2>            Battery, conservation mode</h2>
                    <p>Hi people, I don't take my laptop around with me any more, and I leave it plugged in. so, its often 100% battery and every now and then a pop up says that keeping the battery above 70% for long periods of time is bad, and I should switch on conservation
 mode. the problem is I can't find conservation mode anywhere on my Lenovo, Windows 10. does anyone know what to do to fix this?</p>

<p>Hi Edwin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to us today. I'm sorry to hear about any issues that may be occurring with disc games playing on your Xbox. Have you tried the games on a different Xbox one console to see if they work fine? Do other types of discs work on your Xbox
 one?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest for you to go over the troubleshooting steps on this article <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/disc-error" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
'How to troubleshoot problems playing a disc on your Xbox One'</a></p>

<h2>            Windows 7 - Slow resume from hibernation - 2 minutes delay on Resuming Windows</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am having a problem with resuming from hibernation. I have 
Windows 7 Pro 64-Bit, Intel Core 2 Duo E7500. When resuming from hibernation the computer displays "Resuming Windows" screen and waits for 2-3 minutes. I see no disk activity during this delay. It just sits there. After this "freeze" it will load everything
 fine. I upgraded chipset drivers, video, BIOS. I see no errors in the System and Application event viewer logs. I tried to disconnect network and all devices except mouse and keyboard - still the same. I installed Windows Performance Tollkit and made the "hibernation
 trace". Don't know how to read this but interesting thing is that during this delay nothing was recorded. At least it seems like this. Has anyone seen such behavior or has any idea how to approach this?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I have purchased several games on demand. Alan Wake, Halo Wars, and Mirrors Edge among them. They all ran quite smoothly, maybe it's possible that ME just runs worse for some reason as a GoD but I doubt it. To be honest with you I own it on disc and while
 it's a great game it does slow down/stutter (or lag as you say) a lot of times. Its just a issue the first game had. Like I said, I doubt the downloadable version is worse, it just isn't fixed either.</p>

<p>Is the game installed on your hard drive? &nbsp;I believe this helps with faster loading screens, have it installed on mine for months and haven't experienced any "lagging". &nbsp;Installing games to your hard drive also eases the stress on your machine, in particular
 the DVD ROM, which has been a sore spot for many XBOX owners in the past.</p>

<p>It's nothing to do with Games on Demand.<br />
<br />
Mass Effect 1 suffered from variable frame rate drops because of some of the Unreal Engine 3 properties that were not refined. Sometimes it would be noticeably bad as you seem to be describing, other times it's non-existent it's just the way it is. It helps
 some when you have the game installed on your hard drive as opposed to loading from a disc as the loading times specifically will be a bit better, but nothing drastic.<br />
<br />
Mass Effect 1 isn't locked at 30 frames per second like Mass Effect 2 is either and you can tell immediately that in intense combat situations you do not have slight "lag" in ME 2 that you would see on say for example Noveria in the Hot Labs when fighting the
 Rachni in ME 1<br />
<br />
It may seem pretty unbearable, but I wouldn't just give up on the game just yet. I experience the stuttering quite often on my playthroughs in ME 1, most noticeably in the intense combat areas, but I just keep on going through it as the game isn't broken it's
 just a slight annoyance and I think the overall superb value of the game far outweighs that annoyance in the end in my own opinion.

<p>It's quite noticeable to be honest, at least for me. It doesn't happen often mind you, but when it does it's unmistakeably a difference in gameplay and pretty much fluency during combat.<br />
<br />
However, I have seen far worse "stuttering" in other games like say for example Fallout 3/NV that happens a lot, so this little issue is really nothing to me and like I said is just a tiny annoyance amidst playing through a superb game that Mass Effect 1 is.<br />
<br />
Same goes for the slow texture loading that does happen in ME 1 and <i>sometimes</i> in ME 2, it doesn't happen all of the time and not in every new area, but when it does it's pretty noticeable and again doesn't hurt the experience just a cosmetic indifference.

<p>CrypticZero nailed it. most of the slowdown, pop in, lag and stuttering experienced in Mass Effect is because of the Unreal tech its based on. no idea why it happens but its definitely Unreal, not Go[um..]D</p>

<h2>            Store installs apps without my permission</h2>
                    The Windows 10 store installs apps without my permissions. Usually these are games that I could care less about. Is there any way to block Windows from automatically installing apps from the Windows store? Or is this something that needs to involve a class
 action lawsuit against Microsoft?&nbsp;

<p>I never installed it in the first place to remove it. So I'm having to remove apps that I never installed. Case in point:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/76834206-b9c4-4741-aa15-73599dd79caa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/76834206-b9c4-4741-aa15-73599dd79caa" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've never installed either of these, but for some reason Windows decided to install them. Many people have had this complaint as well, especially IT where these apps are coming pre-loaded or loading automatically on their own.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a refresh on my PC, never had these two installed, but for some reason they were installed without my acknowledgement. Again, this may need to be escalated to a class action lawsuit.</p>

<p>The games in your screenshot are not installed on your computer (that's why they have the option to download them at the far right side -- that button would not show if it was already installed).</p>
<p>
</p><p>But remember, Windows comes with games - just like it has came with Solitaire and Minesweeper for 35 years.&nbsp; But they won't come back after you remove them, just like always.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, if you refresh your PC back to factory defaults, it will have everything back to day 1, but that's normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But again, if you remove them, they will never come back (unless you factory reset again).</p>
<p>
</p><p>You'll have a heck of a hard time complaining about something that's been the same for 35 years.&nbsp; Windows has always come with games by default. And it's always let you remove them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Now if you remove it and it comes back -- that's another story.&nbsp; Just let us know if you ever see that happen.</p>

<p>You're wrong. Solitaire. Minesweeper, etc. were one thing. They weren't these large 100MB packages of games. In fact, they were Microsoft games, not a third-party game. Candy Crush is not Microsoft, so that's not a Microsoft game that comes by default. Oh
 and the same with March of Empires. Seems like that's Gameloft, not Microsoft. Hmm... oh and would you look at that Keeper Password Manager isn't Microsoft either.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>This is true, but I have noticed that sometimes the Updates in the Store app don't get refreshed and still display these apps as being installed. Because of this, it updates them, and since they have been uninstalled it must reinstall them again. This happened
 to me a while ago, so I hope this helps with slooksterpsv's question.</p>

<p>Yes, I did uninstall them. Why would they show up in my library if they hadn't been previously installed? They were installed right after the refresh. Again, this is not acceptable. I don't see what is so difficult to understand about this problem.</p>

<p>When you refresh, you go back to factory conditions.&nbsp; If the games were included when the computer was purchased and shipped from the factory, then of course they will be back after you refresh.&nbsp; This is normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>25 years ago if you purchased Windows (which came with Solitaire), but you removed Solitaire, and then did a factory reset, solitaire would have "come back".&nbsp; It's the same as always.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Complaint:&nbsp; "Factory reset actually resets computer back to factory conditions"</p>
<p>That's not a problem, that's what it's supposed to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm unsubscribing. You're obviously not happy, but no one here can ever possibly do anything to help you.&nbsp; You can, at least, take comfort in knowing that it will never come back once you remove it. Unless you intentionally reset it.</p>

<h2>            Video and Audio Settings on NEW Skype Update</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>Wondering if anyone can help.</p>
<p>I used to be able to change my video settings (such as brightness, zoom and Auto focus) on my webcam during/before or after a webcam video call but it seems this option has now been removed from the settings section - leaving only a basic, 'which device?'
 option and nothing further.</p>
<p>This is making the call quality of my video calls exceptionally poor - could you please advise?</p>
<p><br />
Regards</p>

<p>I have the same problem as the OP. Here is my configuration:</p>
<p>Windows 10 Pro, version 10.0.16299 Build 16299</p>
<p>Skype for Windows 10, version 12.13.274.0&nbsp;</p>
<p>Webcam: external Microsoft Lifecam Cinema webcam</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything was great with the old Skype, until I uninstalled the old version and downloaded the new Skype version today. I used to be able to adjust video brightness, zoom, etc. Today I installed the new Skype for Windows 10, version 12.13.274.0 -- and now
 1) I can't find those video adjustment options anywhere, and 2) I really need them, because the picture quality is terrible -- so dark you can barely see anything.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get those adjustment options back, and/or how to I revert to the earlier version of Skype for Windows which had much better default picture quality as well as much better adjustability?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi, I posted above you with the same problem. I wanted to mention two things I discovered. One was that with this new version where the picture was extremely dark, the picture brightness/quality suddenly improved when the person I was Skyping with maximized
 their Skype window. This happened on two different calls. The first time I thought it was just a coincidence, but when it happened on the next call also, I concluded there is some real effect there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, it's unacceptable to have to tell your Skype partner to change the size of their Skype window in order to fix the camera, so I uninstalled that Microsoft Store version of Skype from my computer completely, and instead downloaded and installed
 the full version of Skype from</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.skype.com/go/getskype-full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.skype.com/go/getskype-full</a>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>After installing the full version from this website, I then had to deal with various login problems (which had driven me to change Skype versions in the first place). But once I got those sorted out, this full version of Skype behaved properly and did not
 have the dark video problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

    <title>Power plan is ignored once a month - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> technonath  say:</h3>
<h2>            Power plan is ignored once a month</h2>
                    <p>I wanted to highlight an issue that I have finally solved with win 8.1 seemingly randomly ignoring the power plan.</p>
<p>I have come up with a workaround but I thought I would document it here to help others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is my explanation of why machines with "power off the screen" set to never in their power plan, (such as information display screens) once a month are going in to screen power off mode.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>An examination of&nbsp; the event log is showed the following two events:-</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a3a1be8b-fb32-40bb-a0f2-3f263b107f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a3a1be8b-fb32-40bb-a0f2-3f263b107f91" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>These two events are showing that the power scheme is being changed from the current plan where the screen is set to never power off, to the "High performance" power plan, which by default "Turn off the display" set to 15 minutes of inactivity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>And as the machine has not had any keyboard or mouse activity for 15 minutes, as soon as this power plan changes - it powers the screen off.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">So which task is doing this?</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>A bit of detective work reveals that it is the "Working set swap assessment maintenance task", although it doesn't show as being scheduled monthly - but the time matched up with the event log and if I force this task to run and the machine has been idle
 for longer than 15 minutes - the screen will go immediately blank.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>So how do we fix it ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know how to stop the Working set swap assessment maintenance task as it appears it is not actually scheduled to run again!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the answer is to modify the "High performance" power plan so that it too has "Turn off the display" set to never.</p>

<p><span>Windows could enter Connected Standby if you Set the “Turn Off Display” Power Options to Never</span>
</p>
<p><span>Consider&nbsp;the following scenario:<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0"><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span>You are using Windows 8 tablet or RT based machine and set the “Turn Off Display” Power Option to Never in Plugged in scenario which would disable the Connected Standby function.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0"><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span>Keep the system idle with AC plugged in</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0"><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span>Sometimes, you will find the tablet will still enter Connected Standby and the display would be turned off.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Windows will trigger Automatic Maintenance while the machine is idle and with AC plugged in. During the scheduled task, WINSAT.EXE will be triggered to perform some jobs and do performance evaluation. It is expected, and WINSAT.EXE will change the
 current power scheme for highest performance to complete the job faster and get the accurate Windows Experience Index. However the change of power scheme will set the “Turn Off Display” setting other than Never and Connected Standby would be possibly triggered.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This behavior is by design.</span></p>

<p>I've run into this same issue with Windows 10 and an HP 608 Tablet.&nbsp; The real kicker is that it considered to have "Modern Standby" and doesn't list the High Performance power plan via the GUI or the PowerCfg.exe /LIST command.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, you can still edit/change it with PowerCfg.exe using the GUID (<span>8c5e7fda-e8bf-4a96-9a85-a6e23a8c635c)</span>&nbsp;or SCHEME_MIN alias.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi aryabhatt,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Let’s follow these methods &amp; check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 1</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>You may perform a power cycle of the laptop and check if it solves the issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Unplug all external devices from the laptop.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Take out the battery of the laptop.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Press the power button of the laptop for 10-15 seconds.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. Insert the battery into the laptop and restart the computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5. Connect the AC adapter and check.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 2</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>You may also contact your computer manufacturer to update the BIOS (Basic Input Output System) and the chipset drivers.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> Modifying BIOS/ chipset incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/chipset can be solved. Modifications
 of the settings are at your own risk.</span></span></p>

    <title>Surface Pro 3 &#34;bricked&#34; after imaging - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> howard gyton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 3 &#34;bricked&#34; after imaging</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We received two new Surface Pro 3 machines a few weeks back. The first thing we did was to deploy our Windows 8.1 Pro x64 image to them via Altiris 7.5. This is the same image and process that we use for our Dell kit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The SP3 boots via PXE into the deployment environment, the image is transferred via Ghost and then driver injection occurs, at least the ones that are usable in DeployAnywhere, and then it reboots.</p>
<p>After the reboot the Surface sat on its splash screen and nothing happened. After a minute or two waiting a very small on-screen keyboard appeared at the bottom of the screen. But it did not boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then found that you couldn't even use the volume controls at startup to go to the BIOS or boot from external media. The machine was dead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to our second device and turned off secure boot. With this one the exact same thing happened but with a red background instead of black.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had both devices replaced under standard warranty and they turned up yesterday. I now have a dilemma. I haven't managed to speak to a single person at MS that has any technical knowledge with regards to this issue. Whatever I did wrong, the worst I would
 have expected is for the machine to fail to boot Windows correctly because such and such a driver was missing, not a completely dead machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no way of knowing whether a repeat attempt will do the same thing or not. I know that Enterprise deployments are possible and supported as it mentions this in the driver pack you can download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So has anyone else experienced the same issue, perhaps with a different imaging solution as well?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any responses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Howard</p>

            <p>Well, these Surface tablets are really "something".&nbsp; They can be an animal all to themselves in how they function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not done this myself but may be worth trying and a little more non-destructive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Set one tablet up for the Enterprise configuration and then go to Drive C: and create a new image and also a bootable USB pendrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try deploying that by restoring the backup onto the Pro 3 tablets instead of the Enterprise image.&nbsp; It may be a pain, but if it fails, it will not crash the tablet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is something you can try on a couple of machines to see if it works.&nbsp; Don't know if this would be practical: it depend on how many tablets you will be configuring.</p>

            <p>Hi James,</p>
<p>
</p><p>That was the first thing I tried this morning. I already had a recovery key created from the original machines. I booted from this via Power+VolDown and then did a full reset, including wiping of the hard disk partitions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That seemed to work quite nicely, although a lengthy procedure. An Altiris imaging task takes about 4 minutes or so in comparison.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However the issue I had once imaged was it did not respond in any way once rebooted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My next task will be to boot from a USB 8.1 disk and rebuild that way.</p>

            <p>Hi Howard,</p>
<p>
</p><p>How did you get on with imaging with Altiris 7.5?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just received a bunch of SP3s and proceeded to brick the first one as you have above.&nbsp; Did you reach an explanation as to what is happening here?</p>
<p>Our Windows 8.1 SOE was recently created on an EFI/GPT virtual machine and deploys without issue to other EFI devices.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why one earth would this be happening?&nbsp; If you blow away the whole SSD it just boots to the EFI setup and the Power+VolDown PXE/USB boot works fine, but if you image it using Altiris you end up with a brick??&nbsp; What an absolute&nbsp;failure of a device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope you can reply.</p>

            <p>Hi Brad,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry, not really. I didn't really dare try rebuilding the two replacements we got with Altiris as I was and still am 99% sure they would be bricked again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this time I have recommended to all of my colleagues that we should not by any more of these devices. Despite what Microsoft have said these devices are NOT Enterprise ready. There is no reason that I can see that imaging a disk should cause the underlying
 hardware to be bricked like this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My only assumption is that disks have some kind of reserved partition on them that is required for the OS to boot perhaps and that by imaging it this is overwritten and bricks the machine. I&nbsp;performed&nbsp;a rebuld of one of the returned ones using a USB recovery
 stick created with the OS and that works fine, even when I chose the option to completely wipe the disks but as to how completely this is I don't know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other reason I have recommended that we buy no more of these devices is the level of support we are likely to receive. We are mainly a Dell shop and receive excellent service from them. From Microsoft however the best you can hope for is a swap. I can
 get that level of service from Dixons! Even with the extended cover all that entitles you to is a swap before the old one has been sent back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I reported the fault there was absolutely NO chance of talking to anyone in any way technical or directly involved with the diagnostic and repair of the devices we sent back. They are nothing more than box shifters in that regard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also had no response from anyone at Microsoft in regards to this thread yet I have been informed that MS techs often visit here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The icing on cake here is that the trackpad is awful on them. I thought that the Dell XPS machines were bad but these really take the biscuit. Come on MS. This is your third attempt at this, surely you can do better!?</p>

            <p>Hi Howard,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the quick reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;attempted a second one after updating the SP3's firmware and bringing Altiris up to 7.5 SP1 HF3 - all to the same effect. Both units are being returned to our reseller as we speak.&nbsp; I'm in Western Australia and they have to go back to MS in the Eastern
 States apparently.&nbsp; Good to know about the extended warranty we've purchased, means we won't be down in the mean time.&nbsp; Lucky I have another six to play around with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Onto the issue itself, it has to be the way the Surface relies on the hidden EFI System partition.&nbsp; I performed a capture and a deploy from PXE from/to the same unit, and it worked as expected, so the problem isn't with Altiris but the image I'm using.&nbsp;
 Even when blowing away the data on the C: partition, it still allows PXE/USB boot and just fails at booting Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something I did do was Ghost the data partition from my image straight over the data partition of the Surface.&nbsp; This kept it alive (no bricking) but still wouldn't boot.&nbsp; A quick look at the&nbsp;BCD stores and I noticed that the values were unknown for 'device',
 'osdevice' etc.&nbsp; I changed these to the C: partition and it booted my image from there.&nbsp; Also the Boot Manager values were considerably different to those in my image (prepared on VMware, simple install and sysprep).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So in short, I have a workaround (still bears user testing..), and I can re-capture this new image for use with this batch of SP3s.&nbsp; I'm still shocked at the complexity of this as the image is fine on three other EFI/GPT devices I've tested.&nbsp; Totally agree
 that this product is not ready for the enterprise, but sometimes the decision to adopt a product isn't ours to make...&nbsp; We're an HP shop at the moment and are used to excellent support - something I'm not looking forward to when these start to have issues
 in the field.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>
<p>Brad</p>

            <p>Same thing happened to me.&nbsp; My SP3 is on its way back..&nbsp; Went to the MS store and they tried their USB recovery and it didnt do diddly as I knew it would.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Im starting to think of just creating a separate SP3 image with the 8.1 OS on it.&nbsp; Has anyone had success in doing that?</p>

            <p>That should work, I've had no issues with images captured <em>from </em>the Surface.</p>
<p>I had already put too much effort into my 8.1 SOE and didn't want to start again which I was I finally worked out the process above.</p>
<p>The new image created (using only my data partition) from the Surface also appears to work on other devices, so this is effectively our new SOE image.</p>
