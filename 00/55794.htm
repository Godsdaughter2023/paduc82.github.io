<p>
</p><p>I recently had a hard drive crash. Have replaced the drive and have been reconstructing as many of the programs I previously used. I was unable to retrieve the data on the old drive. The new drive was installed and was loaded with Windows 7 Professional.
</p>
<p>I then re-downloaded a new version of Windows Live Mail, set it up according to Cox's recommended settings. I can receive mail but I cannot send. I have been through it with several Cox technicians and they all tell me it is not a problem on their end. I
 have uninstalled and re-installed WLM, deleted all email account info and have even changed my password, at the behest of Cox TS.</p>
<p>Here is the error message I get:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The message could not be sent because the server rejected the sender's email address. The sender's email address was '*** Email address is removed for privacy ***'.</p>

            <p>That is exactly the same as the error message you posted earlier.&nbsp;Either you didn't enter&nbsp;a unique subject for the new test message, or&nbsp;you sent the previous test message again instead&nbsp;of the new one.</p>

<p>If you got as far as 3A and you still see the same error even though you enter exactly the same credentials as you use (successfully) at webmail.cox.net, then either there's something wrong at the server end - perhaps the account has lapsed for some reason,
 or been deactivated - or it's time to set up the account again from scratch. To do this,</p>

            <p>Thanks for all your prompt attention to my problem. However......all we have done so far is not working.</p>
<p>It has been my experience that MS is going to conclude it is a Cox problem and Cox is going to conclude it is an MS problem and I am in the middle still unable to SEND email. I can still RECIEVE. I tried your suggestions and the following came up:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The message could not be sent because the server rejected the sender's email address. The sender's email address was
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***'.</p>
<p>Subject 'We are testing again'<br />

Protocol: SMTP<br />
Port: 465<br />

<p>
</p><p>Please don't give up yet, though, because I haven't. I keep thinking there is a setting deeper into Windows 7 Proffesional that is causing this prob.</p>

<p>Did the new account download the contents of your inbox?&nbsp;If it did, the email address and password are entered correctly. On the
<em>Servers</em> tab of the account's properties sheet, have you entered these same credentials after clicking
<em>Settings</em>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have anti-virus or other software, e.g. anti-spam, that is intercepting outgoing mail? Cox error messages usually give a reason for rejection - e.g.
<em>authentication required</em> or <em>invalid domain. </em>If the error message is in fact being returned by a program on your computer, this would explain why the error message looks unfamiliar.</p>
<p>
Otherwise, if the SMTP server is still rejecting your credentials, there must be a block at the server end.</p>

            As I also pointed out, Cox is refusing to relay the message. If you are sure you are connected directly to Cox, then you should try their support to find out why the message can't be relayed.

            <p>Just an update with this issue, Cox is now saying they are having an issue with their servers in the Tulsa area and that it will affect some customers differently. Some can send and not receive, others can receive and not send(me), and others cannot even
 sign on. They have no estimate when it will be repaired , but they will be having a briefing this week to update customer service personnel.</p>
<p>Thanks to all that have graciously tried to help with my problem and I will not hesitate to use this forum again.</p>

    <title>Saving images from the internet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeckle0  say:</h3>
<h2>            Saving images from the internet</h2>
                    I have accessed a Family History website and attempted to save a copy of a certificate. The website gives you the option to save the image online and/or save to your computer. In the past I have chosen to save to my computer and navigated to the relevant
 folder on my computer, given the file a name and hit the save button. Done!! This was using windows XP. I could then view/print the file at any time. It was where I expected it to be in the folder I had created for that purpose.<br />
<br />
Now&nbsp;I am told&nbsp;I do not have permission to save to my selected folder on C drive.&nbsp;"Would&nbsp;I like to save to My Pictures?" eventually&nbsp;I relented and said yes.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Result, I can only see the picture when I save another image to the folder. In the save window.<br />
<br />
The folder says it is empty when&nbsp;I attempt to view the image through the explorer window. It appears I can only see folders not files in the Libraries view. I attempted to create a new folder in the My Pictures folder so&nbsp;I could organise the images but&nbsp;I can't
 see files in there either.<br />
<br />
How can&nbsp;I fix the problem?<br />

<p>Hi<strong> Jeckle0,</strong></p>
<p>1) What is the exact error message when you try to save on different folder?<br />
2) What happens when you try to save it on a different folder?<br />
3) Were you able to save the files to this folder before?</p>
<p>I would suggest you to try creating a new folder and save it on to that. Also save the file on a different location and try to move it to the folder and see what happens.</p>
<p>Also try to create a folder on desktop and then save those images and see if it works fine.<br />
<br />
Thanks and Regards:<br />

<h2>            Problem with updates and installation priority</h2>
                    <p>Is anyone else having a problem with your Xbox One starting to install/update something, getting a quarter or halfway through the update and&nbsp;then jumping ahead to something else on your queue without you telling the Xbox to do so? For example I just set up Super Hot to install, with Warhammer and Paladins behind it on the queue. I play a game for a bit and then check back on the queue and Warhammer is&nbsp;being downloaded at 30%, Paladins is behind it&nbsp;at 20% and Super Hot is at the bottom at 15%. This has happened more than a handful of times and I have no idea what is causing it.</p>

<h3> saganandroid  say:</h3>
<h2>            Getting Printer Drivers &#42;Without&#42; Simultaneous Internet and Printer Connection&#63;</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">&nbsp; I have to install several older printers onto a Win7 x64 Thinkpad system. The system is at a site
<strong>without</strong> internet access. Web searching says that Microsoft has passable drivers for the printers. (Printers are Brother HL-5170DN, Xerox Docuprint N17, HP LaserJet 5P, Epson Stylus 1200 model P113A).<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;The problem is the MS support site only seems to give access to download the drivers IF, and only if, the printers are connected to the same machine at the same time it's downloading the drivers.
<br />
<br />
&nbsp; It's impossible to relocate the printers and computer to a location with internet access. We need to be able to download the printer drivers from the Microsoft site and then bring them back (via thumbdrive or SD card) to the target machine and install it
 there. Direct URLs would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
How can we do this? &nbsp;Thank you in advance.<br />
<br />
<br />
(Incidentally, the Xerox DocuPrint N17 is the same as the &nbsp;<span>"IBM Network Printer 17 PS" which is supposedly the
 same as the</span><span>&nbsp;IBM 17 (or 4317). Online reports say the IBM driver supports duplex printing better.)</span></p>

            <p>Hi Sagan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can imagine the inconvenience you are experiencing without having internet connection. Unfortunately, there are no passable drivers for the printers as such and you need to have internet connectivity to download them. Windows helps you update the drivers
 with the associated latest Windows Updates, which again needs your system to be connected to the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, HP LaserJet 5P, Epson Stylus 1200 and IBM Network Printer 17 PS models have digitally signed device drivers that were
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/293378" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><em>included in Windows XP</em></a>, but not in Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, you might to contact the printer manufacturers' support&nbsp;to ask for the installation media of the corresponding device drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Do let us know if you need any further assistance, we'll be glad to assist you.</p>

</p><p>Keeping in mind the popularity of Win7 x64, Is there a general consensus that printer drivers are more apt to work with
<strong>Win7 x64</strong>&nbsp;if they match architecture width (drivers that work on XP x64) or would a Vista 32 or Win7 32-bit driver be more apt to work (on Win7 x64)? Or is it pretty much "ya never know". I'm looking for a general trend here. Owing to the hacknied
 wintel architecture I am guessing 32bit drivers won't often work well on later x64 OSes like Win7 x64?<br />
<br />
<br />
&gt;&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><em>Unfortunately, there are no passable drivers for the printers as such</em><br />
<br />
Don't be so sure about the high end&nbsp;<strong>Epson Stylus Photo 1200 printer</strong>. One Epson support site (I forget which country's) &nbsp;linked to Microsoft&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">stating that functional drivers for Win7
 x64 and this printers are available from Microsoft, but, and it's a big bu,: the driver was actually for the R200 not the 1200. So, is there any reason why the Stylus 1200 driver that works with XP 32-bit would not work? Or is it always just a matter or trying
 and seeing what happens? I have seen the "compatibility mode" but how would I activate that for a printer driver? Will this mode cajole a x64 Os and 32 driver to play together?<br />
<br />
The <a href="http://tech.epson.com.au/downloads/category.asp?sCategory=Inkjet&amp;id=stylusPhoto1200&amp;SelOS=Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Find driver by OS">
Epson.au site lets you select Vista 32 and x64</a>, to search for compatible drivers, with each linking to a different PDF file.
<strong>This means they affirm that Vista x64 drivers exist for the Stylus 1200.</strong> For later OSes like Win7 and a few others, the links say there is no driver offered. Which both suggests there is a Vista x64 driver (because the link does direct to a
 PDF on the matter). &nbsp;I wonder if the lack of Win7-and-later drivers suggest they're written by the rules such that they didn't need to rewrite a specific Win7/8 driver?<br />
<br />
The problem of course is that they tell you <strong>the Stylus 1200 Vista x64 drivers exist, but not where</strong> to find them online!!<br />
<br />

Can your guys contact Epson and point out that the driver link only shows the PDF? Because a lot of Epson users would like to get that driver and try it on a more modern Windows OS. I've gotten nowhere with them.<br />

 Some computers are prohibited from internet access for a reason.<br />
<br />
I can't imagine MS being foolish enough to tromp all over secure systems this way. it would drive them to Unix, mac, linux, etc.</p>

Are you sure? Because <strong>Brother</strong> says Microsoft has the <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
HL-5170DN&nbsp;</span>driver right here:<br />
<br />
http://www.brother-usa.com/lp/windows7compatibility.aspx#WinUpdate<br />
<br />
And that, is why we need a way to download the drivers to storage from MS's site and move them to the secure destination computer,

            <p>Hi Sagan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your update on the issue. I appreciate your extended analysis of my post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ideally, any executable file can reach your system via internet connection, physical installation media, FTP (File Transfer Protocol, that again needs network connection) or peer to peer 'network'. If a system is set isolated or in a secured environment,
 there has to be <em>some</em> medium that transfers the file to that secure location. It could be via wireless connection, cable or transferred physically. Even if the driver is 'passable', it needs some
<em>connection</em> or medium to get passed or transferred. We can make the internet connections secure as much as we can but we cannot isolate the system and expect any incoming driver from the outer world. Also, when we say "<em>we need a way to download
 the drivers to storage from MS's site and <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
move</span> them to the secure destination computer</em>", we need to determine a connection or medium on which the file will
<em>move</em> to reach the secure destination computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have mentioned a Brothers link in your last post, which shows download from Windows Updates for your printer model. Windows Updates need internet connection to get patches and packages from the Microsoft server for Windows Updates to show, download and
 sometimes install on your system. Unless the system is connected to any network, you cannot install the drivers using Windows Updates as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, there is a solution on how to install&nbsp;XP drivers in later versions of Windows. Again, if you get access to raw executable driver files (via internet or physical installation medium from the manufacturer), you may refer to the following steps to
 install Windows XP or Vista drivers on Windows 7 system in compatibility mode:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Right click on the downloaded driver file.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong><span>Properties</span></strong> and&nbsp;then select <strong>
<span>Compatibility</span></strong> tab.</span></li><li><span>Tick mark the option <strong><span>Run this program in Compatibility mode for:</span></strong> and then select
<strong><span>Windows Vista</span></strong> or <strong>Windows XP </strong>from the drop down menu.</span></li><li><span>Click <strong><span>OK</span></strong> and install the driver.</span></li></ol>
 of Windows</span></span></a></span>

</p><p>Is this some kind of Poe joke? Look, I've been using computers since '79, started coding in 1980, and designed my first IC circuit by 1982. By '83 I was coding in Assembly for 8080 and 6502. By 1985 I was using unix and the Amiga and was on the early internet
 that same year. So you can cut this derisive nonsense. How can such simple questions be misunderstood repeatedly?<br />

<br />
You've got to be kidding me. In this context, "passable" meant "serviceable", "good enough", "supporting enough features to be worthwhile".&nbsp;</span><br />
All I want is to be able to download the drivers to portable media. Connecting the target computer to the MS support site is
<strong>non-negotiable.</strong> The files need to be available in the form of .ZIP or compressed executables, etc. that can be downloaded on computer A, then brought to secure computer B. How the *^#$@* is this so hard for you to understand?<br />
<br />
You know what? Can you just pass my query on to somebody who understand my request? Because I don't even know where your head is.,<br />

    <title>Wedge mouse won&#39;t connect after reboot - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Wedge mouse won&#39;t connect after reboot</h2>
                    Hi, I'm using a Surface pro with a Microsoft wedge keyboard and wedge mouse (not the surface edition). The problem is that every time I reboot the surface does not recognise the mouse. When I check Bluetooth the mouse is there as a device, and in the device
 manager it is listed as working, but the mouse does not work. The only way I can get it to work is to remove the mouse as a device and then add it again. This is pretty annoying to have to do every time, if anybody has any suggestions to fix this that would
 be much appreciated.

<p>Sorry to hear about your issue with the Wedge Mouse. Please try the steps in the following article

            Thank you for your reply. I have already been through all of those steps and they did not solve the problem. I can get the mouse to pair with the surface by removing it as a device and then adding it back in, and it works fine. The trouble is that every
 time I&nbsp;reboot the surface it does not recognise the mouse and I have to go through the process of removing it and adding it as a device to get it to work. The mouse is still listed as a device in bluetooth&nbsp;and in the device manager it is listed as working,
 but for some reason it does not actually work until it has been removed and then added back in as a device.

<div>go to the Windows Store on your Windows 8 computer and search for QR - there are</div>
<div>several free ones you can try. Windows itself does not have a built in program</div>
<div>that reads QR codes. You need a third party app. </div>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may run Network troubleshooter and check if that helps: Using the Network troubleshooter in Windows 7:http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Using-the-Network-troubleshooter-in-Windows-7<br />
&nbsp;<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may also try the below steps:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Double-click on the "WiFi Connection" icon. It can be found in the system tray at the bottom of the laptop screen.<br />
b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on "Properties."<br />
c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select the "Wireless Networks" tab.<br />
d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use the "Add" button at the bottom of the dialog if your WiFi network isn't in the "Available Networks" section.<br />
e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on "Configure" when you see your network's SSID in the "Available Networks."<br />
f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter your network's SSID and WEP key.<br />
g.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on "Start," then choose "Connect To" and "Wireless Network Connection." Your computer should now be able to access the WiFi network. If the WiFi network is connected to the Internet, it should also be able to connect to the Internet.</p>

<p>Hi Ayaan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that the Bluestack app fails launch on Windows 10. I will certainly help you.</p>
</span><span>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to install the Bluestack app in <strong>Compatibility mode </strong>
and check if it resolves the issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p>A compatibility mode is a software mechanism in which a software either emulates an older version of software in order to allow incompatible software or files to remain compatible with the computer's newer hardware or software. Here's how:
</p>
</span>
<p><span><strong>1.</strong> </span><span>Click on
<strong>Start </strong>and select <strong>All apps</strong>, locate <strong>Bluestack app
</strong>, <strong>right click </strong>on it and select <strong>Open file location</strong>.
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> </span><span><strong>Right click </strong>
on the setup file of the software and select "<strong>Properties</strong>". <br />
<strong>3. </strong></span><span>Select "<strong>Compatibility</strong>" Tab.
<br />
<strong>4. </strong></span><span>Place a check mark next to "<strong>Run this program in Compatibility mode</strong>" and select operating system
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<strong>Windows&nbsp;</strong></span><span><strong>8 or Windows 7</strong>) from the drop down list.
<br />
<strong>5.</strong> </span><span>Click on <strong>Apply</strong>,
<strong>OK </strong>and then check the functionality.</span></p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. If the issue remains unresolved, please get back to us and we would be happy to help.</p>

<h2>            Cannot Delete Folders following any instructions</h2>
                    For some strange reason I now have a folder on my C drive with a name having a 25 random mix of numbers and letters (lower case). &nbsp;I have no idea how it got here. &nbsp;Also there are 23 sub-folders most with 4-digit names. &nbsp;The remaining folders have names
 like: Graphics, VC_Red_x64, VC_Red_x68, and vstor40. &nbsp;All attempts to delete any folders fail by following the Microsoft instructions and several on-line advice instructions. &nbsp;Also it doesn't allow me to see the contents of any folder. &nbsp;My OS is Windows 7.
 &nbsp;Help !!!!

            <p>I'm afraid that your recovery partition has been damaged even if not been deleted since you couldn't reinstall windows from OKR. Thus, you have to order a set of recovery discs form lenovo support center. Or, you can make use of a 3rd party software Aomei
 onekey recovery to make a new recovery partition or recovery device and restore from them using Aomei onekey recovery when accidents happen. More about

            <p>Hey there Trudeau!</p><p><br /></p><p>Are you able to connect your console to your network using a wired connection? That is often the easier way to connect. But if you're still having issues with that, I would recommend resetting your home network as well. Unplug everything and wait for 5 minutes or so and then try again. If that doesn't work, I would consider resetting your home network to defaults and resetting your security information.

<h3> kimberleelarson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Transferring files from Windows 7 to Windows 10</h2>
                    We bought a new computer with Windows 10. &nbsp;Our older computer has Windows 7 and we are giving it to our son. &nbsp;However, I would like to save the documents, pictures, and music for our new computer and take them off the older one. &nbsp;I've saved all three onto
 Windows Easy Transfer, but now find out the new computer doesn't support it. &nbsp;Is there an easy way to do this without purchasing a cord or downloading another program? &nbsp;I also need help deleting what I transfer from the old computer. &nbsp;TIA

            <p>Thanks, but that's a work-around, not a solution. &nbsp;A reason has to be found as to why the links no longer work in Windows 10, don't you think? &nbsp;When right-clicking on the entry, all it says is "Internet Shortcut". &nbsp;The actual URL to the page is no longer
 there, the URL that is there just points back to the desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will provide feedback to Microsoft and see what happens.</p>

<p>Thank you for trying to help, that is appreciated but even as a work-around that will not always work. I was in the Windows 10 Twitter App and found that a link within a twit would not work, click it and nothing happens other than the animation and the click
 that normally indicates that a hot-link was pressed and that it will soon open in my browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem with the work-around presented is that not all links are copyable -- like links within the Win10 Twitter App. The link can't even be highlighted and copied-nothing. So basically SOL with that type of issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been a problem since Windows 10 came out, is Microsoft actually looking into fixing this rather annoying and IMHO major bug? I sure hope so, it is not too fun having to work around the bug dozens upon dozens of times a day. Makes me want to reboot
 into that 'other' OS that happens to be free.</p>

<p>When I play Forza5 , it &nbsp;cause a big problem in braking and accelerating . If I push LT/RT with only half distance , the car is already full braking or &nbsp;full accelerating.</p>
<p>I never saw such problem on my old xbox 360 and Forza4 , so I guess my controller maybe broken ?</p>

<p>You can customize the controller sensitivity and dead zones in the forza 5 settings. there is nothing wrong with your controller. Most hardcore forza drivers hit up this section of the settings and config it to their liking.

    <title>Pen Tip Kit Question - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thunder1025  say:</h3>
<h2>            Pen Tip Kit Question</h2>
                    <p>Hello Microsoft Community, this is my first question I have ever posted here, I hope I did everything right....<br />
</p>
<p>So I dropped my Surface Pen to the floor by accident, the pen tip broke and I knew I need to get a replacement, probably the tips, so i searched up the Pen Tip Kit that i fondly remember but unfortunately didn't buy, as I went to the store page I saw a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/store/d/pen-tip-kit/8pwbnt5bcpjm?SilentAuth=1&amp;wa=wsignin1.0&amp;activetab=pivot%3atechspecstab</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Pen tip kit that I remembered the most is now "out of stock", but looking at the reviews section it seems that people are upset that now it comes at 3 pieces rather than 4, I was confused and decided to dig deeper. Then I found this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/p/surface-pen-tips/912896799bkg/6gb2?cm_mmc=store&amp;activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it seems that the "Pen Tip Kit" is replaced by the "Surface Pen Tips"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was confused and I have a couple of questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Why is the "Pen Tip Kit" phased out in favour of the "Surface Pen Tips"?</p>
<p>2. Where is the H pen tip? Why is it not included in the new product?</p>
<p>3. Can I able to get the&nbsp;Pen Tip Kit on a physical Microsoft Store?</p>
<p>4. If not, then how am I suppose to remove the old broken pen tip?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Surface Pen is from the First Gen Surface Book</p>

            Hi Luis.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Please post a screenshot of Disk Management, which I read like a doctor reads X-rays.  Follow the steps here so I can see everything needed to advise you:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/post-a-screenshot-of-disk-mgmt/04a8ef8c-c882-404e-a26b-89867c4ddf55?tm=1441932228382">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/foru...</a>
<br />
<br />Have you tried changing Where New Content is Saved in Settings &gt; System &gt; Storage?  Does the D drive show up to choose there?  See here:  <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/how-install-apps-separate-drive-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowscentral.com/how-install-apps...</a>
<br />
<br />This will only change it going forward, so to move apps you'll need to uninstall them and then reinstall with that setting changed to D. 
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />
<br />If you receive a popup asking if this solved your problem please ignore it, as it will remove my ability to help you and others may also not help.  Please wait until after the issue is resolved to answer the popup or mark your question answered to help others.

            Hi Luis
<br />
<br />My name is Sarah Kong and I am an independent adviser that is here to try and help you with your issue.
<br />
<br />Right click start and go to disk management and then right click it and select to format and choose NTFS.  FYI this will WIPE EVERYTHING ON YOUR DRIVE.
<br />Once that is done try again.
<br />Also you can tell windows to install programs in another drive.
<br />To do that go to start - settings - storage - change where new content is saved.

                    <p>Original title: Microsoft Teredo Tunneling Adaptor</p>
<p>I have HP Omni 200-5480qd All in One Desktop PC and it is set up to be used wireless. When I click on Devices and Printers I am able to view an icon that looks like the tower and it has a yellow triangle in left hand corner. At the bottom of the page is
 the message needs troubleshooting. When I click on Troubleshoot, the fix tries to make an installation that will fix the problem. However, I get message Microsoft Teredo Tunneling Adaptor has driver problem and was unable to install.&nbsp; I reported the problem
 to HP tech support and after several tries with their recommended fixes, the problem remained unresolved. Their Tech support suggested I contact Microsoft Support as they felt the problem pertained to IPv6. I reviewed an answer on this website that looked
 as though it might answer the question regarding teredo and followed the instructions. When I went to networking and clicked on properties IPv6 and IPv4 were both already checked. I am now using this method to see if someone can give me an answer that will
 fix the problem. My operating system is Windows 7 Home Premium, 64 bit.</p>
