<h2>            Problemas nos Servidores COD Black Ops 2</h2>
                    
<p>Fala galera, criando o t√≥pico aqui pra ver se esse erro ocorre ocasionalmente com voc√™s tbm</p>
<p>Diariamente jogo, por√©m de uns dias pra c√°, come√ßou a dar uns erros chatos, e bem aleat√≥rios</p>
<p>do nada, quando d√° um Host Migration e a partida volta, minha conex√£o cai, e volto pra op√ß√£o do multiplayer (xbox live, system link, local, loja)</p>
<p>quando tento entrar novamente, diz que os servidores est√£o em manuten√ß√£o, pra entrar em contato com a Treyarch</p>
<p>o curioso que acontecendo isso n√£o entra mais, ae eu tenho que voltar pra dash do xbox, reentrar no jogo, ae volta ao normal</p>
<p>Lembrando que minha NAT sempre est√° aberta e estou com o Ping baixo, as partidas raramente ficam com Lag, as vezes de madrugada, com algum Host do Leste europeu, e Australianos, acarretando tbm erros pra achar jogadores, j√° que os servers do BO2 n√£o s√£o
 dedicados '-'</p>
<p>Menos mal que esse erro acontece em intervalos longos, coisa de 2hrs pra mais, e n√£o chega a incomodar, mais msmo assim revolvi inform√°-los aqui pra quem joga pra saber se √© normal</p>

<p>putz que chato isso heim</p>
<p>esse √© o COD que achei mais completo, e mais divertido no modo Online</p>
<p>se os servidores fosses dedicados seria perfeito</p>
<p>realmente isso come√ßou a me encomodar essa semana, mais tou jogando diretinho</p>
<p>agora que tou Goldando diversas armas. Haha</p>
<p>se voltar pro game, d√° um al√¥, ae te add pra gente jogar umas Matchs</p>

<h2>            XBOX ONE 1TB - Really slow starting up nearly 2minutes&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi there - I have a 500mb XBONE and recently purchased a 1TB for my son. My 500 takes just under 40seconds from switching on, but my sons takes just under 2 minutes which seems pretty poor. Just wondering if anyone elses 1TB takes this long? :(&nbsp; ps start
 up settings are both on the same instant on settings. Cheers in advance.</p>

<p>Firstly the boot times you are listing for both consoles sound a little long if the consoles are set to instant on mode.
</p>
<p>On the console that is slower to start can you press and hold the power button on the console for 5-10 seconds to force the console to fully shut down, once the console has shut down and the light on the power brick has gone orange unplug the power supply
 for 2 minutes and then restart everything to see if this helps with the situation.</p>

<p>Just timed my Xbox one and from first pressing the power button on the controller to the dashboard appearing without logging in took 10 seconds.</p>
<p>When I check my settings the console is set to instant on and the only option not ticked on the right is "on start, go to TV"</p>

<p>Right I did the console button reset on both machines my 500 is now down to 4seconds from the 40seconds but has made know difference to my sons 1TB when we 1st did it the dashboard would come on and then the machine turnt itself off a couple of times, tried
 the hard reset a couple more times since and no difference from the just under 2 minutes. I also tried the power block from my XBONE and the time was exactly the same. im starting to think its got issues and id be better off taking it back to Argos as its
 only a month old - Any other ideas out &nbsp;there? Thanks for your Help thus far -TELV666</p>

<p>Stop raging in COD &amp; be more careful..(Joke) if you broke 3 wired head sets.. you will most likely break the wireless... they tend to me be more fragile...and much more money...and if you want to know about wireless... &nbsp;I mean like what?? they do the same
 as a wired.. but guess what.... there is no wire</p>

<p>If you're careful and don't actually break your headsets, I'd recommend the Turtlebeach x42s (or higher). They're wireless and can be used in conjunction with the Kinect sensor (allows for you to ignore TV sound while simultaneously using the sensor) or
 with the headset adapter. ;)</p>

<p>The 360 wireless headsets were much more robust due to being much tighter packed in a small area, I never broke a single one, just had them replaced a few times because of dying batteries. The wired headsets on both 360 and Juan have been cheap, flimsy and
 frankly I'm surprised they don't break when you look at them.</p>

    <title>How to Install Windows 10 from USB device - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to Install Windows 10 from USB device</h2>
                    <p>I bought the Windows 10 Home upgrade install that is on a USB device.&nbsp; The instructions say that once you put the USB into a port you are to power on the computer &amp; configure it to boot from the USB drive.&nbsp; How does one do that? There are no instructions
 included on How to configure to boot from the USB drive. I feel that the person who wrote these instructions expects everyone to be an expert on how to reconfigure boot commands for computers.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've done the Del at bootup to try do that but got confused on
 what to do.</p>

            &nbsp;What you want to do is to get into the UEFI/BIOS and turn off&nbsp;<strong><em>secure boot</em></strong>.&nbsp; Exactly how to do that depends on your specific make and model computer, and I'm afraid you neglected to say what that is.&nbsp;

            &nbsp;Not really.&nbsp; If you would supply the MODEL of that Asus motherboard, it would be possible to go to the Asus web site, download the user guide, and look it up.&nbsp; If you have the user guide, look and see what it says.&nbsp; You might also look at the table Cal54
 posted above; I see it says F8 is the key for Asus desktops, so you could give that a shot.

<p>How about some info as to just what you are trying to do.&nbsp; It is very easy to jump to conclusions and even lead you entirely in the wrong direction -<br />
</p>
<p>1&nbsp;&nbsp; Why are you buying W10 Home?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it because the PC is running W8, W7 or prior?</p>
<p>2&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you have a working PC? </p>
<p>3&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have a working PC, then the instructions for using the USB is simply.&nbsp; You just insert the damn USB and under "This PC" you lick on the USB and select "SetUp".&nbsp; Perhaps that is why there are no detailed instructions for a very simple detail</p>
<p>4&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, if you have a dead PC, the use of the USB is entirely different.&nbsp; You have to get the PC to operate without an operating system until an operating system gets installed from an USB.&nbsp; This is much more involved and I doubt the USB stick you now have
 now will even work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a valid W10 on a stick then you should have a valid W10 key to go with it.&nbsp; This should be the easy one if you have a working PC. &nbsp; If you have dead PC, the whole thing changes.&nbsp; I would not follow any instructions you have received so far until
 you clearly define just what you are trying to do.&nbsp; Some to date solutions assume that you have a dead PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will look for your response.</p>

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not good to configure the PC to boot from the USB stick. Once you do that, your PC will always try to boot from the USB stick and Windows installation will not be finished unless you interrupt booting from the USB stick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should insert the USB stick and then try to boot from the USB stick only once. Then on next restart, booting device will revert to HDD and installation of Windows will continue from HDD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

            There are multiple .cab files that are corrupted &amp; Windows is trying to update itself ( error code 80070570) &amp; can't do so until the the problem is fixed. I'm attempting a clean install but the installation files are on a USB stick I bought at Best Buy.
 I guess this what Microsoft considers an improvement.<br />

I'm playing a game running around blowing someones head off and screaming profanities (my character in game) and yet I send one text to someone with a VERY non offensive statement after they metaphorically hump me in-game and I lose what I&nbsp;JUST&nbsp;PAID&nbsp;FOR??</p><p>This Enforcement Team nonsense has got to stop.

            <p>as live is a global service and for families too then there are rules in place. &nbsp;it can be to easy to offend someone somewhere in the world and they have to take that into account, they have to incorporate rules and politics globally. &nbsp;it might be acceptable bantor to your own country but can be very offensive to others.</p><p>this same thing happens on other platforms also, so before sending that kind of text again I would think about if it would be offensive to you, as to what the player was doing in the game then ignore it, most likely got teabagged which is just a simple way of saying " you got owned ".</p>

            <p>I agree with you. My account got suspended for 2 weeks. I was playing division, this guy and his team were triple teaming me. Then my team got on, we wrecked them. I sent him a message (not being serious at all, I was just trash talking like everyone else does) saying, "all you guys can do is jump someone, you guys suck." Maybe, I shouldn't haven sent that but,&nbsp;why get banned for it when this dude said way worse stuff to me? I'm pretty sure he did not get banned or get his account looked into for saying stuff like "you have no friends, pathetic." Really? But, I'm the one who gets banned just by picking and trash talking like everyone else does. Especially, on that specific game.</p>

            <p>Yea they are... I ended up getting a double suspension (Not sure how that happens anyways) all because a chick and her 5 guy friends were in a lobby and I&nbsp;kicked there **** on CoD, in the lobby, I&nbsp;was called a p*ssy n*gger b*tch, A fa**ot, that I need to die, that I should go drink bleach, pretty much everything in the book from the chick and the 5 guys.... All I said to them was That they need to go back to cutting themselves for attention then left the lobby and reported all 6&nbsp;of them.... &nbsp;And I was the one that got a 14 day chat suspension. Then 4 days after that I&nbsp;ended up getting a 14 day Xbox Ban (No gaming or anything) because I apparently harassed someone in a message (Which is bull, because I&nbsp;was already chat suspended from that cut yourself comment) and I appealed and got the same copy paste automated response that&nbsp;I got for appealing my first suspension.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>External Hard Drive Not visible - but there&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            External Hard Drive Not visible - but there&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have a 4TB USB3 WD External Hard Drive and it's been working great! &nbsp;I have all my games on there and they all run smoothly. &nbsp;The problem is that sometimes (most of the time) the drive is not visible. &nbsp;The percentage of storage it says I've used is a percentage
 of the internal drive, which is about 84%, but when the External Drive is there, it says about 18%. &nbsp;Now the weird thing is that it really is only invisible. &nbsp;The drive is still working. &nbsp;I can still play all the games I have stored there and they work fine.
 &nbsp;However, if I hit Menu and select Manage Game, there is no information at all. &nbsp;It's totally blank. &nbsp;If I go to settings and select Console, I can then select Storage and it shows that name of my external drive next to the internal drive, but when I select
 View Contents, if just goes to my full library and doesn't give me the option to look at games and apps only on my external drive. &nbsp;Very weird problems. &nbsp;Anyone else seeing this?</p>

<p>Which drive is your primary drive? Do you download/install games on the Internal HDD then move them to the External or do you go straight to External but have games on the Internal one.</p>
<p>Try switching to Internal as Primary</p>
<p>Unplug the External HDD then plug it back in</p>
<p>Then switch External HDD to primary </p>
<p>See if that helps your HDD reporting on the dashboard.</p>

<p>When I connected the external drive, I made it the primary. &nbsp;I transferred most of my games, but I left some on the internal. &nbsp;Since I installed the external (a couple months ago now) I have downloaded several games, so the ones on there are a mix of games
 that were transferred over and ones that were downloaded directly to it.</p>
<p>I have unplugged and plugged back &nbsp;in the External drive, and sometimes it's visible after, but the next time I sit down to play games, it's not visible again. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Since it's an intermittent problem, and since I can still play games off the drive when it's invisible, it seems like it's just being buggy. &nbsp;I was hoping this was a known issue that was set to be patched soon. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Try a hard reset and see if your issues clear up. Hold the power button for 8 seconds until the console fully shuts down, wait 30 seconds, power the console back on.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can go to Setting &gt; Power and Startup &gt; Restart Console </p>

<p>I have the same exact issue with the same storage device. It worked when I first got it and made the external hard drive the default for installing games. My Xbox would show me the status of the hard drive in the games and apps venue in terms of memory storage.
 However, not sure when it happened but I noticed that my Xbox is giving me the status of my internal storage and it's filling up quickly. Thought it was weird and noticed that games are being installed on my internal hard drive rather than external. When I
 try to switch it back, it doesn't give my the option. Its still recognizing the device cause I can still play games previously installed on the external hard drive and I can see it in the settings menu under manage storage. Just like you, it's takes me back
 to the general games list rather than the games specifically installed on the external hard drive when I select it. Tried reformatting it which no I have to redownload all the games on it again, unselected the box in the power save option, rebooted and moved
 the usb to a different port but nothing worked. I now just have my Xbox saying the external hard drive can be used but not letting me use it.

<p>Hi all,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry you're having issues. As this is an older thread and the OP likely has found their answer if the steps below do not work, please create a new thread of your own.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, please try the hard reset mentioned above. If that doesn't work, then I would suggest plugging the external drive into another port. If it's still not working, then you can try the solution below to factory reset, or you can plug the drive into a
 Windows computer, format it in NTFS (see link below), then plug it back into the console and make sure it's recognized.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also make sure that you use the link below and check requirements for the hard drive (USB 3.0 ect and 256GB)</p>

<p>This is a very unhelpful reply. &nbsp;As pretty much everyone has stated, the HD worked fine, now it isn't showing at the list of Apps and Games although it is the default, yet you can still play games installed to it and it shows under manage storage, you can't
 however install to it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>A factory reset is really not acceptable, do you really expect people to wipe Terabytes of data and re-download it all? Also as stated above everyone has already tried troubleshooting, that's the reason we are posting here! &nbsp;Same for Formatting Disks and
 Drives, why give us instructions for Windows 7 formating a hard disc, totally relevant.</p>
<p>Could someone from MS please have a look at this issue.</p>

<p>Same exact issue for me, and I don't want to format because it'll take a full week to reinstall ever game I have on it again. I saw for some people that was a solution. I have never seen anything like this before, it's hard to tell whos end it is on, the
 Xbox or the hard drive?</p>

"This folder is empty" even when that folder has sub folders. It also does not show sub folders underneath the folder on the right side.</p>
<p>So when I map the drive it just show that folder name but don't show the sub folders either underneath it on left side of explorer or on right side of explorer.</p>

            <p>Have the same problem. My case has nothing to do with folder permissions or ownership,</p>
<p>mapped drives, etc. Sometimes I can drill down multiple levels before I hit this issue. Other times</p>
<p>I can't drill down at all ie get the problem on the top level directory.&nbsp; This alternates back and forth. 0-1 level then 3-4 levels then 1-3 levels etc. In the plainest English so all can understand...sometimes
</p>
<p>directories 1-4 populate fine then level 5 I get 'folder is empty'. The next time it happens any of</p>
<p>1-4, which populated correctly the previous time, give the folder empty message. The time after that</p>
<p>I might get successfully down to 5 or 6...before the problem appears.</p>

    <title>win 10 dual boot option for bootcamp and virtual machine, how&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            win 10 dual boot option for bootcamp and virtual machine, how&#63;</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">Hi all,</p>
<p class="contentStandard">there is a problem with Windows 10 running on Macintosh both under bootcamp and virtual machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">I already have asked in the vmware, parallels, apple, and microsoft forums but no solution till now.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">The problem:</p>
<p class="contentStandard">I, and many many others, have a Apple Macintosh, and a installed Win 7 running under bootcamp. When i try to update to win 10 via gwx / media creation tool, the update itself works without problem, after the upgrade process i have
 a working and activated Windows 10 running under bootcamp. So far, everything is well.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">But ... there are some circumstances when i must run the same Windows 10 under a virtual machine, either vmware fusion or parallels. Then this Windows 10 installation tells me under the virtual machine that it is not activated and
 must be activated again.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Back to bootcamp the Win 10 again tells it is activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Trying to activate this win 10 under virtual machine fails, i get&nbsp;</span><span>Fehlercode: 0xC004C003 (cannot be activated because activation server has detected the product key is locked). Once i had to re-activate under bootcamp. This has worked.</span><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Looking into the forums of vmware, parallels, apple, only a few users tell that they have win 10 activated both for bootcamp and virtual machine, but most of them say nope, only for one of them.</span><span><br />
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>One Apple service technician told me that win 10 must first be activated under bootcamp, then under virtual machine to get success. But nope, bootcamp will be activated automatically by gwx so there is no chance to make a "first manuall activation" under
 bootcamp.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A clear and reliable how-to is missing, which version of win 10 must be present (gwx or retail, or ??), what must be done after installing to get a reliable dual boot both for bootcamp and virtual machine.</span></p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
</p><p><strong>So pleaaase microsoft, what must be done to install Windows 10 under bootcamp, so that it can be activated both for bootcamp and virtual machine?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>My windows 7 is running perfectly both under bootcamp and virtual.</p>

            <p>They are two separate installations running on two individual hardware platforms. As such they require separate licenses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows 10 upgrade registers the previous 7 license as running on the bootcamp based platform which is a new function. Then if you try to authenticate the parallels install based on the same key the registration server sees the key has been used on other
 hardware because as far as licensing is concerned parallels is the hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under the terms of the EULA this is correct and was also the case under Windows 7, parallels and bootcamp are two installations in their own right and each should have a license even though only one can run at any time. It is just that now with the on line
 registration it can be detected.</p>

            <p>I am currently searching for the "not helpfull" button in this forum, i got similar answers before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, it cannot be solved with the online activation. When i try to activate the virtualized, i get an error code that says the prod key is already locked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From my viewpoint both bootcamp and virtual machine are the same installation. One disk, one computer, one installation, one license. No violation of Eula anywhere. With Win 7 this is no problem, works perfect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be easy for microsoft to add a "i am on a virtualized bootcamp session" recognition to win 10. Or to allow a dual hardware footprint recognition for one and the same installation, so that win 10 can boot alternating bootcamp or virtualized.</p>

            <p>Sorry but in terms of the EULA your viewpoint is not applicable, they are two installations, they need two licenses. Similar arguments have been made for years over multiboot systems as only one installation can be used at a time so why do we need more than
 one license and that very specifically is on the same hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has always been the case, using the same license for more than one installation is a breach of the terms, the difference now is due to the on-line registration of the application of an upgrade&nbsp;license it can be detected and blocked more easily.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You got similar answers before because that is the only answer, asking again is not going to change it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are the applicable sections of the Windows 7 EULA</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span>2. INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS. </span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong>a. One Copy per Computer. </strong></span><span><span>You may install
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>d. Use with Virtualization Technologies.
</strong></span><span><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Instead of
</span>using the software directly on the licensed computer, you may install and use the software within only one virtual (or otherwise emulated) hardware system on the licensed computer.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have underlined the key points, "one copy" and "instead of". The point is as you should only have one installation of Windows 7 you can only have one installation of the upgraded Windows 10</p>

            <p><span>my viewpoints concerning 2a:<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>There IS only one copy. Bootcamp and virtualized are the same physical disk.<br />
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>2d:<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>When i boot the virtualized session, i start it instead of the bootcamp. Because bootcamp and virtualized use the same one and only copy that exists, they cannot be started simultaneus.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>And when i have a closer look at 2d, it says there is one licensed computer, and on the licensed computer one virtual machine is allowed.
<strong>Instead</strong> of the licensed computer. Exactly what i want to do.<br />
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So i dont see any eula violation</span>.</p>

<p>I don't think you understand how VMWare fusion and boot camp work together. There is one physical copy on a partition on disk. You can either boot it directly as the native OS, or boot the exact same copy in a VM under OSX. It's not a second install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's more, using the same license is an express feature of VMWare fusion, approved by Microsoft. To make it work under Windows 7, you simply have to activate under VMWare fusion first. It takes care of the details for boot camp.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 does not provide that ability, so it breaks VMWare fusion. Actually, I did the same thing with Windows 7, and it was simple to resolve. The activation process gave a phone number to call. When I called it, Microsoft allowed the activation under
 VMWare Fusion, which completely resolved the problem. I see no similar option under Windows 10.</p>

<p>Actually, after posting I was able to resolve the issue myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From VMWare Fusion, I used the "troubleshoot" option of windows activation. This switched me from using a Domain login to using a Microsoft Account login. This did not immediately resolve the problem, it said this hardware was not associated with the account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, I booted from Boot Camp, where Windows is activated, and logged in using my Microsoft Account login. Presumably this created the association.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I rebooted back to OSX and launched VMWare fusion, and logged in again under the Microsoft Account. Lo and behold, Windows is still activated.</p>

<h2>            How can I delete OracleServiceXE, it remains in the services.</h2>
                    I have ultrabook with Windows 8 installed from Dell.<br />
I added Oracle XE to run primavera, but mis-configured it.&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;I uninstalled OracleXE, deleted the files, but the service remains, and I can't reinstall OracleXE until all the services are gone.<br />
I had Oracle XE working, but had configuration issues and appears to have a dirty uninstall.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I removed OracleXE the services remained, and I can't just delete registry keys like other windows versions.&nbsp;&nbsp; I deleted the directory with XE, and emptied the
 recycle bin, so I can't get the files back.<br />
<br />
There are 5 services I need to remove to get Oracle / Primavera working again.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
How can I delete OracleServiceXE, I uninstalled OracleXE, deleted the files, but the service remains, and I can't reinstall OracleXE until all the services are gone.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Hi Bill Savage,
<div><br />
Thank you for posting here!<br />
<div>Q: What <strong>version</strong> of oracle serviceXe have you installed?<br />
<div>Q: Does it prompt to remove any particular services?</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Follow these steps</strong></div>
<div><br />
Try to delete the services using the <strong>command prompt</strong>:<br />
<div>Open<strong> charms bar</strong>, swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap
<strong>search</strong>.<br />
(If you're using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, and then click search.)</div>
<div>1: Click search, type <strong>‚Äòcmd‚Äô </strong>in the search field.</div>
<div><br />
2: when ‚Äòcmd‚Äô shows up in the list of options, right click it and select ‚ÄòRun as Administrator‚Äô.<br />
<div>3: Command prompt window will open</div>
<div>4: At the Command Prompt window, type <strong>‚Äúsc delete OracleServiceXE‚Äù</strong> without the<strong> quotes
</strong>and press Enter.</div>
<div><br />
5: C:\&gt; sc <strong>stop</strong> OracleServiceXE (to Stop service)</div>
<div>6: C:\&gt; sc <strong>delete</strong> OracleServiceXE (to remove)</div>
<div>7: Type <strong>‚ÄúExit‚Äù</strong> and press Enter.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Once you delete the services, I would recommend you to <strong>restart</strong> the computer and
<strong>re-install </strong>the services.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Also refer to oracle support</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Incremental backups with WIN7 BACKUP utility restores files &#38; folders in both old &#38; new locations</h2>
                    <p>I recently experimented with the WIN7 BACKUP &amp; RESTORE utility &amp; did a full backup.&nbsp; Afterwards, I shuffled subdirectories around to different locations &amp; then did an incremental backup.&nbsp; I did confirm that it was indeed an incremental &amp; not a "new" backup
 data set.&nbsp; Restoring from the incremental backup results in subdirectories located in both old &amp;&nbsp;new locations.&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears that the WIN7 utility restores everything whether moved or deleted.&nbsp; I was under the impression that the incremental backup would restore
 the files to the locations of selected date chosen for the incremental backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I need to do a DIFFERENTIAL backup instead &amp; if so does the WIN7 utility do this?&nbsp; As far as I can tell you cannot actually coerce the WIN7 utility into any one of the backup types.&nbsp; It is done so automatically by the utility depending on the changes

<p>
</p><p>Please do not bother linking me to MICROSOFT general descriptions of the WIN7 utility.&nbsp; My questions are direct &amp; very specific.&nbsp; Please answer them directly or if you have links that address this issue with specificity!</p>

            <p>Hello Jeff, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Community. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description, I understand that you first performed the full backup of your computer and then performed incremental backup after shuffling subdirectories around different locations through Windows Backup and Restore feature. After successful
 restore from incremental backup you found that&nbsp;all the files were&nbsp;backed up instead of only the newer files since the last backup.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate if you can provide us the following information to help us understand the issue better.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Where are the backups being saved? Are these being saved on a hard drive in network location?</li><li>Do you have Windows Media Player network sharing service enabled on your computer?
</li></ol>
<p>Incremental backup may not work if the backup is being saved on a hard drive in network location. It perform the full backup instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An incremental backup provides a backup of files that have changed or are new <strong>
since the last incremental backup. </strong>To do this a file set with the incremental option selected is used to perform a backup. Whereas a differential backup provides a backup of files that have changed
<strong>since a full backup </strong>was performed. A differential backup typically saves only the files that are different or new since the last full backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may check disabling Windows Media Player network sharing service and check if that helps.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow the steps below to do so:&nbsp; </span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Press <strong>Windows+R</strong> key on desktop to open run box.
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Type ‚Äú<strong>Services.msc</strong>‚Äù without quotes in run box and press

</li></ol>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>If that doesn't work you may check differential backup to backup only the selected data since the last full backup.

<p>I am saving to an external USD hard drive.&nbsp; WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER network sharing is disabled.&nbsp; That issue should have been corrected at some point in time through MICROSOFT incessant updates.&nbsp; The fact it is still an issue is REPREHENSIBLE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The subdirectories that I shuffled around in location should constitute a change.&nbsp; Nonetheless, WIN7 BACKUP &amp; RESTORE utility restores those subdirectories &amp; files in both new &amp; old locations.&nbsp; Why?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did experiments with AOMEI &amp; it restores the files &amp; directories into the correct organization even after shuffling them around.&nbsp; If 3rd party software gets the job done why does MICROSOFT continue to let their utility remain in the state of disrepair
 that it is?&nbsp; I understand that 3rd party software is applicable across multiple types of operating systems, and MICROSOFT cannot expend resources to make their utility that universal.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, at the BARE MINIMUM it should work on a WIN7 computer.&nbsp; It
 DOES NOT unless you can point out otherwise.</p>

<p>
</p><p>You can repeat the behavior quite easily on your own computer.&nbsp; Do a full backup first &amp; then take a subdirectory &amp; move it &amp; redo the backup.&nbsp; Hopefully you get an incremental backup &amp; not a full backup.&nbsp; The WIN7 utility apparently does not allow you to
 choose a backup option of differential or incremental.&nbsp; It simply makes that choice autonomously based on the changes since the previous backup.&nbsp; How that decision is made is a bit nebulous &amp; MICROSOFT does not do a good job on elucidating that process.</p>

            <p>Hello Jeff, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply and apology for the delayed response. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate the time taken by you in keeping us updated on the status of the issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur if you have the Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service enabled on the computer. The Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service indexes media files. By doing this, the service changes the metadata of the files for tracking purposes.
 When you back up your media files, Windows Backup detects that these files were changed and then performs a full backup of the media files. To prevent this issue,
<strong>do not save multimedia content to the Public folder (%SystemDrive%\Users\Public).</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You may refer the following Microsoft article below for further help on this.</p>

            <p>That is NOT a blue screen of death. &nbsp;Notice that they cannot even spell correctly (suck, instead of such). My suspicion is that it is "hostage ware" and you'll be asked for a payment if you call that number. &nbsp;A reverse lookup states that the number is "unlisted"
 at the owner's request.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do a Ctrl-Alt-Del, you will see about a dozen "Form 1" apps running, each of which corresponds to one of these fake BSOD screens. &nbsp;Kill each form, one at a time, and then you will eventually get to your desktop. &nbsp;Run your Antivirus and Antimalware
 immediately and get rid of that hostageware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MORE INFO:</p>
<p>This appears to be tied to a process that calls itself "Micosoft Defenders" - note the plural Defender(s) on that. &nbsp;The process is repeatedly running Mint.exe located in the C:\Windows\SysWOW64 folder.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>After I open the Device Mgr, only this adapter is listed under the Network Adapters:</p>
<p>Intel(R) PRO 100 VE Network Connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I'm something missing there...?!? I'm not able to post the screen but that's all is listed there...</p>

<p>Your Gateway GT5428 does not appear to have a wireless network adapter.&nbsp; Most desktop/tower computers do not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can buy an inexpensive USB-connected wi-fi adapter.&nbsp; If your computer, like most, has its back panel next to a wall, I suggest buying a wi-fi adapter that has an external antenna rather than one of the "mini," "micro," or "nano" adapters.&nbsp; If there's
 a way to have a cable between the adapter and the antenna, that would be even better, so you could place the antenna in a better location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is just an example of USB-connected wi-fi adapters for $25 or less:&nbsp; <a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&amp;IsNodeId=1&amp;N=100158094%20600014288%204024%204093" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>Of course, in addition to having a wi-fi adapter installed in your computer, you also need a wi-fi capable mode/router/access point.&nbsp; What is the make and model of the device to which the Ethernet cable from your computer is connected?&nbsp; Please report the
 make and model shown on the label on the back or bottom of the device.</p>

<p>Hi LemP:</p>
<p>It's me again (Tony H) - for your info: I've immediately reviewed the link with the adapters you've sent me, and actually I like an adapter with the external antenna - here is the link for the adapter I like:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://c1.neweggimages.com/NeweggImage/ProductImageCompressAll300/ADA2_131748200702497777NBFxnhXki5.jpg?ex=2</p>
<p>
</p><p>- could you quickly 'evaluate' my choice and would you recommend it?</p>
<p>- ALSO:&nbsp; I'd like to use another (same type)) adapter <em>also</em> for my wife's LAPTOP (Hewlett-Packard, Model No.
<em>2000-299WM Notebook PC</em> ) 'connected' to another wireless router used for our TV (DirecTV/AT &amp; T) connection, and they are BOTH located on the MAIN floor (of 2-storey house) ...whereas my Desktop-PC is located on 2nd Floor - any special issues with
 this plan...?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks...!</p>

<h3> computerwunder  say:</h3>
<h2>            Logitech webcam hd c270 and Windows 10 Build 15063.413</h2>
                    <p>As of today, 8th July 2017, &nbsp;the above webcam will only give sound when used with Skype on a PC.</p>
<p>There is no picture just a blank white area.</p>
<p>Tried updating drivers without success. Tried using the Windows camera app but the result is the same.</p>
<p>Removed then reinstalled camera without success</p>
<p>Is this caused by a recent Windows update and what is the solution? When first used today the picture did flash up briefly, but not since.</p>
<p>I know webcams were affected by an update last year, but this is a different case and the webcam has been working fine since purchased in 2017</p>
<p>Any help or advice appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Activate Windows 10 after hardware change</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently changed the motherboard in my PC, and I am unable to activate the computer. I've used this license before (upgraded from being a windows insider a few years ago), and I have changed components before without issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I go through the troubleshooting steps, and then when prompted to select the PC that I'm using that had it's components changed it tells me that I cannot activate windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I reinstall windows and try again? Or what are my options here...</p>

            Hi there David, thanks for your question. Hopefully I can help! 
<br />
<br />There are a couple things to try to resolve your Windows activation issues. Firstly, read through this short Microsoft support article to see if your motherboard change affects your license. It's possible that such a substantial hardware change could affect your license, as some licenses are tied to the motherboard. 
<br />

<br />
<br />You can also try the Activation Troubleshooter here:

<br />
<br />If none of that works, you can try the Microsoft Support live chat service to investigate your license and see if they can resolve the issue:

                    <p>For whatever reason I am unable to use my front facing camera. The rear works just fine but the front is not working at all. Why is this? the device manager does not even show that there is a front facing camera.&nbsp;</p>
