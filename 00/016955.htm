<h2>            9814&#47;9860&#47;9879 How I fixed all the crashes&#47;NVidia drivers crashes&#47;Audio card crashes&#47;dpc violations&#47;Bsod Screens&#47;etc.</h2>
                    <p>First when installing anything new grab all the latest drivers for your system</p>
<p><strong>Motherboard/Video card/Processor/Audio Cards/Mouse and keyboard/Printer/any and everything you plug up to your PC including your cellphones!!
</strong></p>
<p>Save them to a flash drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Preparing for Installs Make&nbsp;a backup of all&nbsp;your&nbsp;serials to your apps so if you have to reinstall them so you’re not trying to look them all up.</p>
<p>Always Always do a full clone of your hard drives especially if you already have multiple OS running. So after an install one crash may push to a recovery rampage!!
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Disconnect manually all the hard drives in your system so that only one hard drive is installing Windows 10 Beta's. That way if a crash does happen you can just reconnect a drive and try again without constantly
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">rebooting loops</span>!!'</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Installing the build's 9814/9860/9879 was easy but those NVidia crashes ...wtf just happen aka
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">(Dpc Violation)</span> Fixed by going into safe mode to install NVidia drivers/sound blaster drivers helped alot. Stopped all the crashing and
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">bsod screens</span>. None of the builds wouldn't let install the NVidia drivers’ normal without a reboot&nbsp;crash until i started install them in safe mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also keep doing disk cleanups a lot to free up space from windows old, temporary files,&nbsp; A lot can pile up from Windows updates, Application installs, Driver installs,. By doing this i barley saw slowdowns in loading&nbsp;windows at all. If your system is slowing
 down you might have to many services loading in your start up and regular&nbsp;services. So you may need to disable some of them. Just click on task manager to see how much is being used. Ex. if it shows your hard drive at 100% usage than you may have way too much
 running in the background and need to disable stuff. Also use the disk tools to check for errors and fix them as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Caution:&nbsp; Even if you’re using&nbsp;driver down loaders can cause a major crash not to mention freezing your system. Just like installing anything&nbsp;with&nbsp;your anti-virus running can also&nbsp;cause major problems. (As a rule never run anything when installing driver,
 OS,&nbsp;application etc. The smallest block of an install can be a huge impact to your system. Ex; installing a Video Card Drivers while your Firewall is running can block/lock up/ incoming freeze/hold the power button and restart all over again sequence.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can always look up the reviews on drivers before you install them. And if you’re locked out of your video card control panel try restarting your PC up just before the desktop can fully loads up click on your&nbsp;video card control panel and&nbsp;while everything
 is loading up it should open for you&nbsp;in a couple seconds.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the latest video drivers&nbsp;are causing problem like the 344.75 NVidia&nbsp;driver 4x crashes for me but after installing in safe mode no more crashes.</p>
<p>After i had everything running great the&nbsp;Sound blaster aka creative driver cause Bsod Screens per build&nbsp;which&nbsp;again I had to install in safe mode. Now I'm running 9879 build and i noticed OneDrive keeps trying to sync stuff that i never put in it folder
 so i stopped that as well. Everything is&nbsp;running great and loving it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
I hope this helps some of you with the problems you may be having. Ps Hope you all have a blessed Thanksgiving</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;<span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/3B8DCF5E-5991-4B3D-A1AC-B188127F3B33">joshi01uk</a>,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The drivers you are looking for are Windows drivers for the bluetooth that is on your laptop. You will have to find the original Installation CD that came with the laptop or try to find out what bluetooth connector you have
 and search the brand or connector for the drivers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The headset should connect to this once properly installed. The bluetooth profiles for the headset may not actually be compatible with the one on your laptop, this is another reason that it may not be working.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Here are the Bluetooth specifications for the headset:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Bluetooth specification v.2.0 with EDR </li><li>Handsfree Profiles 1.5 and Headset Profile 1.1 </li></ul>
<p>Lets us know how you get on and I hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            Hotmail blocking mails from safensoundmail</h2>
                    I have recently set up an email account for my son. As I want to have control of whom he mails I set this up through safensoundmail. Unfortunately hotmail seems to block mails from this mail provider. Is there a genuine reason for this or in error? I have
 contacted safensoundmail who have told me hotmail are classifying mail from them as spam but so far have not removed them from the blocked list.

            When an email provider blocks email domains/accounts/ip addresses, they do so with reason. It would take action on the part of safesoundmail to work with Hotmail to get this changed. Nothing you can do about it.<br />

<h2>            Retrieving Calendar in my Treo 700wx</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
I deleted&nbsp;all of the data from my&nbsp;Office 2007 (Calendar,&nbsp;Contacts, Files, Tasks, etc.)&nbsp;in my Treo (not sure how I did it). I use Active Sync 4.5 to sync the Treo with my Laptop (Office 2007). I cannot find a command that tells the synchronization process to
 copy files from my laptop onto the Treo. I am worried that if I just sync the files using 4.5 that it will take the last change (which eliminated all of my Office Files) and thus eliminate all of the data on my laptop.

            <span>If you have an existing ActiveSync partnership between your pocket pc and computer and have synced this information in the past, when you sync this time, all your calendar, contacts, files and tasks will be
 deleted from the computer as well.<br />
<br />
To avoid this, backup these items on the computer, then delete your existing ActiveSync partnership.&nbsp; When you are asked if you wish to delete your My Documents folder, say NO.<br />
<br />
Then set up a new partnership.&nbsp; Upon sync, ActiveSync may ask you how you wish to proceed (1) Combine the data; (2) Replace the data on the pocket pc with data from the computer; or (3) do nothing.&nbsp; If you get that message, choose REPLACE.&nbsp; Otherwise ActiveSync
 should just sync all that data back to your pocket pc.&nbsp; If something goes wrong and the data gets deleted from your computer (which it shouldn't), you'll have that stuff safely backed up.<br />

<p>OK, I did what you told me to do, Prof. Julie. However, now I received an error message 0x80883001 telling me to manually sync the Treo. Now how does one manually sync their device? I'm stumped.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Addendum to last message: I did get through and I it went to take me through the installation process. However, it said that I could not sync because it was already synching with another computer (I don't have another computer). I am using a
 VPN to get me into my College's microsoft exchange server but then they ask for a domain name. Eeek!</p>

<h2>            Windows &#34;Mile IQ&#34; and Mutual Liberty &#34;Right Track&#34; not compatible&#63;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The app <strong>Mile IQ</strong> created by <strong>Microsoft</strong> isn't compatible/supported for my Windows phone, you must have an Android or Apple phone to install? I've been using Windows Lumia Phones now for three years and am sold, all in.
 Microsoft stated months ago that they are working on the "app" situation. Seeing an app they developed that's not supported by their phones doesn't give me a lot of hope. Since I cannot stand Android phones I guess I will be getting an I phone even though
 I'm not the biggest IOS fan. It flat out sucks, there is nothing to dislike about a Microsoft Windows phone except for the lack of apps supported. So what it's going to be Microsoft? Are you throwing in the towel on smart phones? I mean stores don't even carry
 them anymore, Best Buy use to sell the Lumia 640's, I believe as a "Go Phone." They don't do that anymore, now its a bunch of Android crap.
</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Also, my car insurance company has a discount plan kind of like "Safe Driver's program" I have to install the devices app to use it, well the app isn't even listed under the Windows store. It's like a catch 22, either you lose or you lose. I'm not the
 one to download a **** ton of apps but when you actually need one for a specific reason you won't find it under the Windows Store.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Could I download google play on PC and save&nbsp;Mutual Liberty "Right Track" in file explorer then upload it on my windows 640 XL using a USB cable?</p>

            We have been seeing this for months, if not years now. MS stopped making phones in 2016 - why should they care about apps for them ? Their own apps for Android and iOS are miles better than their Windows 10 Mobile equivalents. For those following the platform
 it was already clear 3 years ago, if not earlier, that it is doomed. You just jumped on board when it was already too late. I stopped using a Windows device as my main daily driver probably around the time you got yours and I haven't looked back. Every day
 I still come across something new which I couldn't have done on a Windows phone and count my blessings.

 I absolutely cannot stand IOS updates from Apple. Yep, Windows is the way to go, I want to believe Microsoft won't quit what they started.. Just because there weren't hundreds of thousands Windows phone users in beginning months doesn't mean you abandon ship.
 Heck, Microsoft wrote out the Apps they couldn't find any dev's to invest their time since they didn't have many users.. Microsoft had many of top brand carriers shaking in their boots when they released their first line of smart phones. AT&amp;T jumped right
 on the bandwagon, next came T-Mobile etc. All while they were looking for Dev's to program their apps, Microsoft had everything written out for them.. Just doesn't compute. Owning a PC with Windows OS alon

<p>Hi <strong>Michael</strong>,<br />
<br />
There are few techniques that a hacker use to get your account password. One of them is through a malware or it could also be through phishing emails. To isolate your concern, we'd like to ask the following:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Can you recall if you've received any suspicious emails pertaining to your account recently?
<br />
</li><li>Do you also have any other devices that your account was logged in to?<br />
</li><li>What exact notification did you receive regarding your account being hacked? Can you possibly send us a screenshot?
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, you may check on this <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/my-outlook-com-account-has-been-hacked-35993ac5-ac2f-494e-aacb-5232dda453d8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> to get more information if your
 Outlook.com account has been hacked. <br />
<br />
We'll be waiting for your response. </p>

<p>I have received no suspicious emails beyond the normal junk email which I don't open (newsletters and old subscriptions I'm familiar with). I run "Kaspersky Total Security" to regularly check for malware (always clear). A secondary scan of my entire PC has
 again come up with nothing malicious. Computer and mail antivirus runs 100% of the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have my iPhone signed in to use the same email account. I haven't been using it overseas, in 3 different countries in the space of 1 day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I first received notification via mobile from +46 75-032 46 12 detailing that "someone else might have accessed Microsoft account *******. Recover at account.live.com". I have provided Microsoft with my mobile number in order to verify my identity so it
 makes sense to receive a text. Can you confirm this number came from the Microsoft service?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not click on the link on the message, instead waited until I got home, logged online to my Microsoft account and indeed saw 3 successful sync records, spaced 1 hour apart logged in my "recent activity"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have changed my passwords, added 2-level security to my account. So it now combines an authentication, incorporating my fingerprint to allow sign in access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no connected accounts to this email and there is no forwarding from the account.</p>

            We appreciate the information that you've provided, Michael. <br />
<br />
When an account was compromised, there's no specific way to determine what information was taken from it. The best option to do is to change the password of your other account that may have been connected to your Outlook to ensure its safety.<br />
<br />
In addition, I'd suggest taking more precaution to help protect your <strong>Outlook.com</strong> email account, you may check on the steps provided on this

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you can't seem to find the drop down arrow next to <strong>All
</strong>and can't seem to figure out how to add a new contact. <font><font color="#000000"><font>Let me assist you on this matter and rest assured that I will do my best to help you sort this out.</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please be informed that if you do not see a drop down arrow next to <strong>All</strong>, your People page has been updated. There has been a recent change in the People page and part of the update was the steps in managing your Groups.<br />
<br />
<strong>The dropdown option or filter for Groups next to the word All on top left corner of the page has been removed.</strong> Hence, the Groups are viewable or accessible by scrolling down your contacts list or by typing in the name of the group as it conforms
 with the alphabetical arrangement of your contacts. Furthermore, the creation of a new Group is under the dropdown button next to the option
<strong>New</strong> in the command bar of your People window. Please try to add a new contact by following the steps below.</p>
<p><br />
1. Go to your People page. <br />
2. Locate and click the group name in your contact list. <br />
3. Click <strong>Edit</strong> in the command bar on top of the page. <br />
4. To add a member, type the contact's name in the Add member box and click the desired contact from the dropdown option.<br />
5.&nbsp;Hit on&nbsp;<strong>Save</strong>. </p>

<h2>            Word 2016 for Mac - saving documents to computer and not OneDrive</h2>
                    I cannot seem to save documents to my computer, either it be desktop or documents folder since I downloaded word 2016. It only allows me to save to OneDrive. How can I start saving to my computer because if I want to send a document I have to email it
 to myself first and then send it.&nbsp;

<p>Provided that you backup essential data first, have you tried resetting your N80 by keying in *#7370# on standby screen followed by 12345 (default Nokia lock code) unless altered by yourself to restore device to out of the box condition in case of any possible

<p>Hi Brett,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the file is stored in you OneDrive, you can select the file &gt; version history to restore the previous versions.</p>
<p>If the file is stored on your local Mac folder, we can find back unsaved file or crashed file. However, for your scenario, you save over the file, there’s no feature in Office for Mac to restore a previous version file stored in Mac local folder. if you
 have set time machine back up for your Mac, you may try to restore in this way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Rena</p>

<h2>            Excel 2016 changes Font size on opening document</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use office 2016 and i have a excel 2016 worksheet where i fill in numbers. Everything worked well till last week when i did do the windows 10 update to 1703. Since then when i open the document i see it for 1 second in the correct font size and some bold
 numbers I made to some of the numbers and then excel changes some of them to non bold an reduce the size from Arial 14 to Arial 10 but not in all fields. And when i make a single change to the document then it's ruined all get saved to the automatic changes
 excel 2016 made. I can send the document to a friend who uses office 2013 and for him the document opens correctly with the numbers in Arial 14 and some bold like i made the document a few weeks ago.&nbsp; So i have no idea where to find that automatic function
 that changes my font size and styles on my document when I open it. I want to turn off that it changes my document on opening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<div><span>I must have inadvertently created them while attempting the creation of the summary (very similar, but different from "index")<br />
</span></div>
<p><span>Once I removed&nbsp;</span><span>all&nbsp;</span><span>the "index entries" by means of physically removing the entire content between graphs (graphs included)</span></p>

<h2>            Inbox folder shows unread messages, but none of these are in the folder.</h2>
                    I am running Outlook 2010. In one of my e-mail accounts the inbox folder shows 2 unread messages [beside the folder it shows (2)] but when the folder is opened there are no new messages. I can mark all as read and the (2) disappears, but a few days later
 a (1) or (2) will reappear. Are there messages I am not seeing when I open the folder? How do I correct this? This problem only occurs in one of my secondary e-mail accounts, not in my master account with my internet service provider.

<h2>            WP8 Nokia 920 unusable for vehicle navigation on trip of more than 3 hours</h2>
                    This week I drove to Houston - a 3-1/2 hr trip. &nbsp;My 920 (with all the latest updates) was at full charge when I departed for Houston. &nbsp;When I arrived at my Houston destination and unplugged the phone from the car charger, I noticed the battery was at 8%
 and it didn't last another 15 minutes. The 920 is certainly not fit for this purpose. &nbsp;Unfortunately, a web search reveals this is a very common problem. Some are indicating this is a common problem across WP8 devices.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It is unacceptable for this to occur. &nbsp;I switched from an iPhone to the 920, with the mistaken belief that other than the availability of apps, it was a superior device/OS. &nbsp;Other than the camera, it is not. &nbsp;I like the WP8 interface. I can find mostly
 suitable app alternatives. &nbsp;But the battery life issues are intolerable. I don't mean to rant but I am
<i>very</i> unhappy about this. &nbsp;I've been a MS user since 1985. This is disappointing, and I find myself calculating how long it will be under my 5-month old contract before I can go back to an iPhone. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Surely somebody is looking at this. Is there any solution to the battery life issue in the works?</div>

            <p>Your car charger needs to be at least 1.2 amps. That is what the wall charger is. I have made 2 hour trips and the battery is higher than when I started. &nbsp;Sounds like a 500 or 750 milliamp car charger.</p>
<p>To prevent data usage and take less power the maps for your area can be downloaded to the phone and a data connection is not necessary.</p>

I don't know whether this situation applies to you:<br />

"Nokia E51 "#" key will switch the line for outgoing calls if your SIM card provides support for this. In such a situation, the # key will not toggle profiles between silent and general"

Thank you for emailing Nokia Care.<br />
<br />
With regard to your email, I recommend that you reboot your Nokia E51 by switching it off before removing the back cover and battery. After 10 minutes, replace the battery and back cover, then switch the phone on. This acts as a temporary measure to reset the
 software of the phone and refresh the device's memory. Check and see if you still have the same issue.<br />
<br />
If the issue persists, I would suggest that you update your phone software. Nokia Software Updater allows you to keep your phone up to date and improves the overall performance of your mobile phone. Kindly log on to the following link for Nokia Software Updater:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://europe.nokia.com/softwareupdate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://europe.nokia.com/softwareupdate</a><br />
<br />
Alternatively, I suggest that you take your Nokia E51 together with your proof of purchase to your nearest Nokia Care Point as the technicians would be able to advise on the most up-to-date information on software versions for specific Nokia phones and also
 to update your phone software. They will also assess if your phone requires a repair and advise if this may be covered under the warranty.<br />
<br />
Contact details of your nearest Nokia Care Point can be found at:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.apps.nokia.co.uk/clubnokiaservice/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.apps.nokia.co.uk/clubnokiaservice/</a><br />
<br />
The reboot didn't fix the problem!<br />
<br />
My software version is: 100.34.30

            I have had the exact same problem. # key just putsa # on the keyboard. Software 100.32.20. I reloaded (all I got offered was the same version, i didn't get offered a .30) but that made no difference.<br />
A colleague at my company who has the same phone (just got his yesterday) and SIM from same ISP, has his # key working to toggle silent so I will check what firmware version he is on.<br />

            OK I can confirm this problem is nothing to do with dual line SIMS or such like as has been reported here.<br />
<br />
I have two colleagues who just got E51s, theirs both toggle silent mode as per the manual WITH MY SIM, my E51 does not.<br />
All phones have the same firmware (latest). My phone although black has a silver bevel around the outside, theirs are all black, so I wonder if there is a subtle difference in the phone models. Look like I have got a duff one and will be returning it.

            I found out the problem with the Nokia E51 and the # used to change from general to private.<br />
<br />
YOU have to go into Tools, then Profiles and click on ie Silent then you have to personalize that by changing the ringing tone to SILENT...<br />
<br />
Hubby's came already done for some reason so if anyone else has this problem PLEASE try the above.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hubby's phone is Black and mine is the Silver, hope this helps.

            Sorry but the stuff about going into silent mode etc is missing the point. The '#' key simply DOES NOT WORK as advertised. What its meant to do is put you into silent mode - and yes, if your silent mode was set up wrong, then all that stuff would help.
 Since all it does on my phone is print a # on the screen , rather than activate silent mode, its no use. I did try it anyway, of course, it made no difference as it was set like that to start with, and I still just get a hash. My silent mode itself works fine
 when I go down through the menus to activate it but its not activating via # like it should.<br />
<br />
re firmware, despite (pointlessly) updating to the latest firmware it still doesn't work.<br />
<br />
:-(

Yes it works on most people's like that but there seems to be a group of E51's, especially on the UK, where it just doesn't work. Holding # "for a few seconds" is how its meant to work, but for me and others, it doesn't matter how long you hold # down for,
 all you get is a # :-(

            Assuming that you only type in one language and that is the language selected when installing Office, you shouldn't have to install anything. If you click in a word and press Shift+F7, you should see a list of synonyms.

<h2>            Excel LAST CELL reference faulting out of range to XFD&#58;1048576</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p><span>I'm working with a fairly moderate data set with actual last used cell at DE:3600. I have not used any cell outside of this range, but after some auto filtering and sorting operations
 the last cell reference (ie ctrl end) is now at the extents of possible workbook range XFD:1048576. Once this occurs the workbook ceases to operate due to the excessive used cells. This has occurred repeatedly.&nbsp;I tried deleting all unused cells but after leaving
 my computer overnight it was still going in the morning. I have never experienced this problem with Excel 2000.</span></p>

<p><span>Hi,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks guys for all your feedback. Unfortunately any solution involving deleting 1000000 rows simply takes too long (hours). I tried copy and pasting only the used cells but the
 problem persists. I did find a supposed patch "</span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244435" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244435</span></a>",
 and while this seems to strip the excess cells (after resaving) it doesn't stop the problem. Next time I run filters/sorts the problem re-occurs.</span></p>
<p><span>I was even more disheartened when I found out later versions of office&nbsp;VBA doesn't support method FileSearch anymore.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I've resorted to bringing my personal laptop to work (with office 2000) and having no issues.&nbsp;I'm currently pleading with&nbsp;my&nbsp;IT guys to re-install Office 2000 on my work machine.</span></p>

<p>The method Biff suggested does not take "hours" to delete all the unwanted rows.&nbsp; And, just because you fix the problem, does not mean you can do the same thing that caused it to begin with and it won't happen again. XL2007 is not unique in that regard.&nbsp;
 But I do whole heartedly agree with you about the user-hostility being exhibited in each new version of Excel.&nbsp; I have to work with over 1000 users, having all versions of Excel so I have 6 versions on my computer, but given the choice, I use only XL2000 every
 time.</p>
<p>Seems a shame that we have to "beg" our IT Depts to do the things we want......looks like we should be able to "tell" them what we want and unless it causes extreme grief to the Company system, they should have to just do it.......without mouth!&nbsp; It's stupid
 how some Companies put the entire company computer equipment budget under the IT director.......if my Boss can afford it with his budget, I should be able to have it.......'nuff soapbox.</p>

It should take<em> seconds</em> using the method I proposed. If it is taking longer, there is something wrong with the installation/configuration. If copying the valid data range did not cure the<em> Last_Cell</em> placement, try a search using<em> Look in:

            Just to backup what 'Jeeped' said: I just took an Excel 2010 file I have that had entries in column A of 1,000,000 rows and selected rows 3 through 1,000,000 and hit the Delete icon on the [Home] tab. In under 2 seconds the rows were gone.&nbsp; (Windows 7

            Thanks so much for this solution.<br />
<br />
I was having this problem with a fairly large sheet, last cell CK698, and followed your instructions and it worked perfectly. I had tried at least five other solutions I had seen online and none of them worked.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the help.<br />
