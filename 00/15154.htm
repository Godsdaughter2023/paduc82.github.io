<h2>            3d Model Lighting inside PowerPoint</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Hello, </p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Lately Microsoft published guidelines for inserting 3d models into Office applications, here:</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/3d-content-guidelines-for-microsoft-03a7b493-d549-4f1a-9735-f2457adf6261" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/3d-content-guidelines-for-microsoft-03a7b493-d549-4f1a-9735-f2457adf6261</a></p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Thank you for this guide! I've been looking for such guidance for months, and didn't find anything similar. All my knowledge on 3d in PowerPoint was based on trail and error.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
However there is one issue that I still cannot find an answer for:&nbsp; How can I turn OFF the default PowerPoint lighting while inserting a 3d model to PowerPoint?</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
My 3d models are "baked" meaning that they don't need an extra light, the light is baked into the textures (which is a common practice in all modern computer games) and I just want to turn off that light. So actually what I need is ZERO environment lighting,
 and have my models show off their baked lighting on the textures. (In some other 3d platforms such as UNITY and UNREAL it is much more complicated - I guess it should be simple here)</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
By the way - my models look great in Microsoft's 3d Viewer - where I have control over the environment, but when the same model is inserted to PowerPoint - the PowerPoint light "burns" it, by adding light to the pre-baked textures.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
I even tried to save them from the 3D viewer - hoping that the light settings will be transferred to PowerPoint, with no luck.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
I looked everywhere inside PowerPoint, even found the in the Format tab under material some options that had a little effect on it.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Again I'd like to praise the new guidelines , but at the same time to ask Is there any one who knows who I can ask about this? Or where I can&nbsp; read about it.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Thanks,</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">

<p>Hi Gidon,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My name is Michelle, and I'm a Program Manager in Office in charge of 3D support. Thanks for reaching out with this issue, and think we have a workaround for you to try, which will disable the document default lighting. There currently isn't any friendly
 UI to manipulate lights in Office, so we suggest manipulating the XML directly to edit/add/remove lights in a document.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the steps to try:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Insert a 3D model into a PowerPoint doc (pptx)</li><li>Crack open the .pptx file with an XML editor (or rename the .pptx to .zip and use a normal text editor), find the “<strong>ppt/slides/slide[n].xml</strong>” doc containing the model</li><li>Find and remove the lighting sections, which will all begin with "<strong>am3d:ambientLight</strong>" and "<strong>am3d:ptLight</strong>", for ambient and point lights, respectively.
</li><li>Save the changes and rename the .zip file back to .pptx</li><li>Open back up in PowerPoint</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We think that if you remove all of the point lights, or the point lights
<em>plus </em>the ambient light, then the model will look more like you intended.&nbsp; The lights are properties of a 3D model, and will stick with the model as it is copied/pasted around between slides or apps, so there isn't a good way to clone these lights to
 other 3D models with UI.</p>

<h2>            C3-00&#58; ovi, software update, etc - no GPRS &#47; WLAN only&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>C3-00</p>
<p>software details:</p>
<p>V 04.60</p>
<p>31-08-10</p>
<p>RM-614</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(new phone, bought yesterday)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My plan has only voice and sms, no data (this is from very cheap provider which doesn't even have GPRS).</p>
<p>Problem:</p>
<p>Whenever I try to use internet (thru my home wifi) I get no connection (or so it seems);</p>
<p>for example:</p>
<p>- when i try to use ovi store I can see the WLAN icon. "Welcome to Ovi Stor..." and "A new version of the Ovi store is available...blah blah blah...must update" so I select download and I get "Temporary network problem" followed by "Link not available",</p>
<p>- when trying to update phone software it seems working (wlan icon is there, "Updating" message appears) but after some time I get "No network connection. Unable to download." message,</p>
<p>- when i select "Internet' (I don't know what browser it is - I'm new to Symbian OS, or Series 40 OS, or whatever it is in this phone) and choose any of the pre-set bookmarks there (i.e. nokia.mobi) I get the "Temporary network problem. Link not available."
 message,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>YET when open Opera Mini browser that came with this phone, I have no problem browsing the web, so obviously there is no problems with phone's WLAN or my home wi-fi network.</p>
<p>The problem lies in the phone's settings somewhere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, should it all work over wifi at all, or not?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(and please don't suggest using USB cable - I have already 9 different type USB plug cables from various cameras and phones in my collection, but none of them fits this phone, and I really don't want to buy yet-another-cable just to update the phone which
 HAS built-in working wifi! that would be ridiculus)</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some solutions for you:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Select Menu &gt; Settings and Configuration &gt; Preferred access point — View the saved access points and choose the preferred WLAN access point.</p>
<p><br />
Select Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Connectivity &gt; WLAN &gt; Internet Connection :Ask first<br />
you are asked for the connection method every time you open an application that requires an Internet connection such as Browser or Mail.</p>
<p>Select Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Configuration&nbsp; &gt; Personal settings &gt;</p>
<p>Add &gt; Web &gt; account name "My Web" and use preferred access point "yes"</p>

<p>Mahayv,</p>
<p>thanks for reply, however I have seen your exactly the same reply posted few posts earlier and I have already check it out. Yes, I DO have it all set exactly as you have posted earlier (and now). And yes again: it still doesn't work with exactly all the
 symptoms as I have posted in my first post.</p>
<p>As I've said in my first post, I don't have actual connection problem (wifi is working fine), it is the software update /&nbsp; the browser&nbsp; itself (again: not Opera which works fine, only the other browser that is part of this operating system can't see the
 connection) that doesn't work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here:</p>
<p><a href="http://img263.imageshack.us/img263/941/imag0006sm.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://img263.imageshack.us/img263/941/imag0006sm.jpg</a></p>
<p>As you can see for yourself, my wifi connection is fine and working, yet the software update says "no network connection".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(edit - screen photo link added)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ACTUALLY, I have just tried the Ovi Store again (I haven't try it since yesterday) and after the same message it suddenly showed me new version to download, which I downloaded and installed already. So, Ovi Store works now (updated to latest version I presume).</p>
<p>BUT Sioftware Update still gives the same error message (no network connection blah blah blah). Is there any other way to force the update?</p>
<p>I have 8GB memory card for this phone, can I download the updated firmware on my PC, copy it to SD, and then force the phone update from the memory card somehow?</p>
<p>TIA</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help appreciated, but <strong>please don't mark my thread as "solved" while MY problem HAS NOT been solved ye</strong>t, thank you.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Well it is always helpful to follow the other forums if the similar cases are available.</p>
<p>In your messages&nbsp; i have not noticed any information about this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can update your phone with different methods: Is it possible that you try also the other methods?</p>
<p>-In your device Menu -&gt; settings &gt;phone &gt; Phone updates and&nbsp; you can update by the WLAN.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-By Nokia Ovi Suite.&nbsp; The link below explains how to.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi mahayv, and thanks for reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is I can't update from Menu-&gt;Settings-&gt;Phone-&gt;Phone Update.</p>
<p>It starts, shows "Downloading", my wifi turns on automatically, I can see on my home router that wifi is connecting somewhere, and then - after about a minute or little bit more - it shows "No network connection" (as in the photo in my previous post).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By Nokia Ovi Suite - I don't have a cable to connect phone to my PC</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By using Device update software:</p>
<p>thanks for the link. I just check it out:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>did step 1 (*#0000# )and got my phone software details:</p>
<p>v 04.60</p>
<p>V 191.01</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>step 2</p>
<p>doesn't apply, as I don't have option "Check for update" (only Exit on the right side)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>step 3</p>
<p>doesn't work!</p>
<p>I opened my phone, removed battery, copied the phone's "Code" numbers exactly as they are printed there - including capital and small letters! - and all I get on this page is:</p>
<p>"Please Enter Valid Product Code."</p>
<p>Well, try it for yourself if you want, this is my code copied from the phone:</p>
<p>059D73703201116r1E</p>
<p>Go figure...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a direct link to software update which can be normally downloaded on a PC, then copied to microSD card, and used to update the phone when inserted there? That would be the simplest way to do, and that's how all my other phones were updated... but
 no, Nokia had to reinvent the wheel... (scuse my rant, but I'm already very annoyed by all this, if not for the late hour I would have probably drove back to the store and return it)</p>

<p>You can find product code under the battery back of the phone and it is 7 digit number.</p>

<p>mahayv, this is the "code" thats inside my phone:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fimg585.imageshack.us%2fimg585%2f987%2fnokiacodeimag0009noimei.jpg" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>as you can see, it is more than 7 digits, and contains letters too...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>UPDATE:</u></strong></p>
<p>I have tried all the digits first (since you've said it has to be 7 digits only), but actually the "code" also takes letters too.</p>
<p>Entering the first 7 characters (including the letter: "059D737") on the webpage got me this message:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>---</p>
<div><strong>Latest available software for your device: </strong><br />
<strong>Version::</strong> <span>04.60</span></div>
<p><strong>Compare numbers: </strong><br />
If this version is greater than your current software version, update now to get the latest features, applications and improvements.
<a href="http://europe.nokia.com/A4176089" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Go to Nokia Software Updater download</a></p>
<p>---</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since my phone's software version is 04.60 then there is no update available obviously.</p>
<p>BUT</p>
<p>it still doesn't resolve the problem with network connection when I try to do it from the phone using wifi, I should have receive same/similar message when using phone, not some "no network connection" error, right?</p>
<p>Are there any additional settings somewhere (like hidden or buried within some other options) that I should check on my phone?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It shows that at this moment there is no new sw available for your product code.. Depending on the country or operator variant new sw time changes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In some cases end users complained even the WLAN is working but internet will connect to GPRS operator network and of course it costs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the solution is :</p>
<p>Select Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Configuration&nbsp; &gt; Personal settings &gt;</p>
<p>Add &gt; Web &gt; account name "My Web" and use preferred access point for WLAN &nbsp;"yes"</p>
<p>In other way your internet connection will go with the WLAN.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try this one&nbsp;if&nbsp; you have not done before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>

<p>Thanks for the suggestion, but for more than 95% of the 200 plus images I have in a 124 page document I need that setting on Top and Bottom, so there is no textual flow either side of them. I see that selecting Top and Bottom selects the text to be in a
 fixed position on the page, which doesn't work for me as I want the images to flow with the text when editing or inserting new text, which is a common requirement to keep the instruction document up to date. To make the text and images keep their relative
 positions when editing I also need the Allow Overlap check/tick box to be de-selected. I seems totally silly that their defaults do not seem to be individually selectable. It seems such a basic a requirement as documents vary so much.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for taking time to make the suggestion but I am afraid it doewn't help ubfortunately.</p>

            Insert each image into its own paragraph.&nbsp; They will then move with the text and the text will not flow either side of the image.

<p>Thanks for that, it is useful to know as I hadn't thought of that. </p>
<p>
</p><p>However I see issues with that:</p>
<p>1) If you are editing text you could inadvertently merged an image paragraph with a textual one, where as Top and Bottom setting would still separate them if the image is allowed to flow with the text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) In the areas where I have multiple small images, where I do have text typically wrapping around the left side of the small images, not allowing overlap stops a lot of unforeseen behaviour as text is edited and the document page is expanding and contracting
 etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The settings are their to be used, that being the case there shouldn't be a requirement for a work-around, they should be definable in the template.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Useful info to know though, as that has explained one behaviour I have come across when text hasn't flowed as expected across a page break.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again</p>

<p>Inadvertent editing of any kind can easily be undone by using the Undo button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there are situation where you do want the text to wrap around an image or some images, you will have to use the appropriate wrapping setting. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would set the default to be in-line-with text and switch to another setting when required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note, I suspect that having images inserted into the text in other that in-line-with-text and then moving those images around in a document is frequently the cause of subsequently being unable to open the document due to mismatch xml tags.</p>

            Yes am aware of those facts but have not experienced any issues with not being able to open docs using my configuration. I have full version backups anyway. Those settings I have mentioned ought to be configurable to be set as defaults. You obviously have
 a vast knowledge of Office, so I assume there isn't an answer unless Microsoft changes its mind and alters the code. So frustrating. Nothing new there I guess. Thanks again. Stephen.<br />

<h2>            Why is &#34;&#38;&#34; an invalid file name character</h2>
                    I just received an error that my file had an upload error. I opened the file and the suggestion was to save a copy. I noticed the file name was "Meeting notes 4-22-12 &amp; 5-12" and wondered if the &amp; was the problem. I changed it to "and" and it uploaded
 fine. Changed it back and it gets an error. I'm pretty sure that has uploaded before with no problem. Why is it now? &amp; is a valid windows file name.

            The <i>&amp;</i>&nbsp;(i.e. <i>ampersand</i>) is used by various programming languages as an
<i>escape character</i>. In HTML it signifies that what follows is the code for a special character; e.g. &amp;quot is used for ". Other languages have other purposes. In Windows graphic text it is used to signify that the next character should be underlined; &amp;File&nbsp;displays&nbsp;as
<u>F</u>ile.
<div><br />
<div>It would appear that the language used by whatever is uploading your file may now use the
<i>&amp;</i>&nbsp;as an escape character in its syntax. If the ampersand passed muster previously, perhaps a different version treated it differently.</div>

            I'm not quite sure I understand your answer. What do you mean by "whatever" is uploading my file. It is skydrive/office 365.
<div><br />
<div>Plus, I'm having more issues now.</div>
<div>1) I have 10 other items that uploaded just fine w/ an &amp;. So what's the deal with that?</div>
<div>2) I have a document that now won't upload because of "," in the name. However, there are 45 other items in the same folder with a comma.</div>
<div>3) I deleted these files (cut to a different directory). Closed Skydrive (b/c the error wouldn't refresh and go away...kinda a problem). Reopened and it was up to date. Added the comma file back and it didn't sync...so closed again and now it is up to
 date and the file is synced...great...but what is going on?</div>
<div>4) In searching for other &amp; files, the one I moved is coming up in the location it was moved from, but if I try to open it it says it isn't there...but the search still shows it. How is skydrive messing up the indexing?</div>
<div>5) I tried the same thing with the &amp; file, but moving and moving back doesn't work...still a sync error</div>
<div>6) When I open these files in office it is giving strange filenames in the title bar. The &amp; is appearing as ^0 and the comma as ^J</div>
<div><br />
<div>Just noticed another problem. Many (if not all) of my office files now have today's date for the date modified. I just finished the first big sync (was changing over skydrive accounts to my one for the office 365 student). Why is this happening?</div>

            So then why when I rename and remove it. Does that fix the problem? Same with the comma file? And why is it displaying funky in word? And why is it listed here:&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2813150?wa=wsignin1.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2813150?wa=wsignin1.0</a>
<div><br />
<div>Anyway, it is working now after several moves and restarts of skydrive...which is not so much an answer...</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also, can you please tell me why every office file now has either yesterday's or today's date as the modified date. This is very frustrating as I do use this field from time to time to know files I haven't accessed in a while.</div>

            Hi, <br />
<br />
<br />
It seems that your device's software is corrupted, especially it gets stuck with a lightning and a bolt icon on the screen. To get this resolved, we advise you reset its Windows through the Windows Device Recovery Tool. This resolves software issues with the
 Windows Phone. You can download and install it on your PC. For more details, see this article:
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12379/windows-10-mobile-device-recovery-tool-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Device Recovery Tool: FAQ</a></strong>.<br />
<br />
Your update is important to us.

    <title>Outlook 2016 IMAP sent messages problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bulkhedd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 IMAP sent messages problem</h2>
                    <p>I use Outlook on my PC primarily.&nbsp; &nbsp;I also use Mail on my iPhone and iPad and sometimes Outlook on my iPhone and iPad.</p>
<p>Lately I have been having issues with sent messages.&nbsp; I have an IMAP folder called Sent.&nbsp; Normally all my sent messages go into that folder.&nbsp; However, sometimes they go into a folder called Sent Items.&nbsp; That folder does not appear in my IMAP account, but
 shows up under Outlook Data File.&nbsp; I cannot move the Sent Items folder into my IMAP account folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot find a way to tell Outlook to use the Sent folder instead of the Sent Items folder.&nbsp; Under Options/Mail/Save Messages there is a checkbox to save sent messages in the Sent Items folder.&nbsp; That box is checked, however, usually sent messages still
 go into the Sent folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't care what folder they go to, I just want them all in the same folder and that folder to be in my IMAP account folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Sent Items folder is showing as an option for sent messages under Mail and Outlook on my iPhone and iPad.</p>

            It sounds like you have a local data file and sent mail is going into itinstead of the folder in the imap account. Do you have a pop account in the profile? It would use the sent items folder. 
<br />
<br />The option to save sent items basically tells outlook to save sent messages - the account determines which sent folder.

            They shouldn't be going there... they should be going into the imap account's sent folder, and if not, into one called Sent items, in the imap data file, not in an Outlook Data File. A sent items folder in the imap account will sync up to the server but you can end up with 2 or 3 sent folders (the imap account's, outlook's, and one from a smartphone f it uses 'sent messages')

<p>Well I thought I figured something out.&nbsp; I discovered the Sent Items folder was in my trash so I moved it out.&nbsp; No sent e-mails are being moved there, though.</p>
<p>They are still going to the Sent folder or the Sent Items folder in the local data file.</p>
<p>I've noticed something else, though.&nbsp; The ones going to the local data file seem to happen only when I send an e-mail a particular way.</p>
<p>I use a program called Foxit PDF Reader.&nbsp; If I have a file open in that and click the e-mail button to automatically open a new e-mail with the file attached, that sent e-mail will go into the folder in the local data file.</p>
<p>But if I use Outlook to create a new message it goes into the Sent folder.</p>
<p>The PDF app just opens a new blank Outlook message with the file attached.</p>

            Is the pst set as default data file in file, account settings? You could try setting the imap account as default (not necessarily my favorite suggestion because of the ‘this computer only ‘ folders). 
<br />
<br />One Of two things is happening. It’s either the way the external programs hook into Outlook and bypass the point where the sent  folder is selected or this is an issue similar to mail merge where the default data file is used (and the message is sent from the account that is delivered to the default data file, not the default account).

            Hi, i hope you're doing good today.
<br />
<br />You're having the issue only with old files? What happens if you create a new file, save it and open it again? Those files are stored in OneDrive/SharePoint?
<br />
<br />Double check that, and try this to see if it helps.

<p>I created a new file and pressed Save.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the Save As dialogue box came up I named it "Test 8-29" and placed it on the desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I pressed Save however something weird happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Name on the Top of the document REVERTED back to Document2 and I got the same Read-Only message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>And again, if I try the duplicate button nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BIZZARELY, I just checked my desktop and there is indeed a file there "Test 8-29" but when I open it up the name again disappears and it becomes "Document1" or some other number.</p>

<p>Hi Christopher,<br />
<br />
The error message seems not upload in your post. Could you share it again?<br />
<br />
Here is a suggestion you could try first: Reactivate your Mac.<br />
1. <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/how-to-remove-office-license-files-on-a-mac-b032c0f6-a431-4dad-83a9-6b727c03b193" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to remove Office license files on a Mac</a><br />
2. <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/activate-office-365-office-2016-or-office-2013-5bd38f38-db92-448b-a982-ad170b1e187e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Activate Office 365, Office 2016, or Office 2013</a><br />
<br />
And for further troubleshooting this issue, could you confirm the following information with us?<br />
1. Could you check are you signed in to your Office?<br />
2. Could you share the following screenshot with us? Open Word &gt; Word in the top left corner &gt; About Word:</p>

<p>I signed in to Office. I guess I wasn't signed in before. But it didn't make a difference. I encountered the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm game to remove the license files as described above, but am not quite sure I know where the license number is from when I downloaded the software originally. Is that going to pose a problem?</p>
<p>

            Hi Christopher,<br />
<br />
Thanks for sharing with us.<br />
<br />
There are serval reasons may cause file read-only.<br />
1. If the product is not activated it will go into a reduced functionality mode. The activation Information could be checked in the
<strong>About Word</strong><br />
2. Check if all the files are locked: Right click the file&gt;<strong>Get Info</strong>&gt;clear the Locked checkbox.<br />
3. The file could be read-only itself: When the file opens, go to<strong> File </strong>
menu&gt;<strong>Properties</strong>&gt;<strong>General</strong>&gt;<strong>Attributes</strong>, if Read-only is checked, uncheck it.<br />
4. Or go to <strong>File </strong>menu&gt;<strong>Save As</strong>&gt;click <strong>Options</strong> on the bottom, if
<strong>Read-only(recommended)</strong> is checked, uncheck it and click <strong>
OK</strong>.<br />
<br />
Office 2016 for Mac could just activate by the sign in with the email like described in this article:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/activate-office-365-office-2016-or-office-2013-5bd38f38-db92-448b-a982-ad170b1e187e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Activate Office 365, Office 2016, or Office 2013</a>. If you have concerns, you could share the image with us we could check which license do you have and determine whether you could try removing the license<br />
<br />
To upload images in the forum, you could click the Insert Image button above the text box. Could you share the error message and the About Word window with us again?<br />

            Hi Christopher<br />
<br />
Please try this:&nbsp;<br />
1. Remove the Plist file:<br />
&nbsp; a. Quit all Office for Mac programs(or force quit if needed)<br />
&nbsp; b. On the Go menu, click Home.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; c. Open Library.<br />
&nbsp; d. hold down the OPTION key while you click the Go menu.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; e. Open the Preferences folder.<br />
&nbsp; f. Look for a file that is named com.microsoft.Excel.plist.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; g. If you locate the file, move it to the desktop. If you do not locate the file, the program is using the default preferences.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; h. If you locate the file and move it to the desktop, start Word, and check whether the problem still occurs. If the problem still occurs, quit Microsoft Word, and restore the file to its original location. Then, go to the next step. If the problem seems
 to be resolved, you can move the com.microsoft.Word.plist file to the trash.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Then try Clean boot for Mac: refer to this KB: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2398596/how-to-use-a-clean-startup-to-determine-whether-background-programs-ar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
KB 2398596</a>. If the problems are gone under the safe boot of Mac, the issue might relate to some third party apps.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Besides, could you also share the screenshot of the error message too?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Alex

<p>Hello Jackin,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reason is that you attached the file from OneDrive and shared it as a OneDrive link. You can see the screenshot below:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/46efdaa2-ba0a-454c-9b7c-2d8b8fdc5fff?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/46efdaa2-ba0a-454c-9b7c-2d8b8fdc5fff?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the screenshot, you should upload the attachment followed by the steps below:
</p>
<p>1. Click <strong>Attach</strong> and choose <strong>Cloud locations</strong>, choose the file from OneDrive. Click
<strong>Next</strong>.</p>
<p>2. Then you choose <strong>Share as a OneDrive link</strong>, instead of <strong>
Attach as a copy</strong>. </p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ae1dbbe5-864f-4a1a-ac7c-ba786af9a047?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ae1dbbe5-864f-4a1a-ac7c-ba786af9a047?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don’t have step 2 to choose, you should have chosen “<strong>Remember my choice for files from OneDrive</strong>” by mistake and clicked OK, so every time you attach a file from OneDrive, it will share as OneDrive link without asking you to choose.
 To fix it, please see the following instructions: </p>
<p>1. Click the <strong>Gear</strong> icon and click <strong>Mail-&gt;Attachment Options-&gt;Attachment preferences.
</strong></p>
<p>2. Under For files I choose from One Drive, choose<strong> Ask me how I want to share them every time
</strong>and save it.</p>

                    I've been using Outlook.com since its in inception. I've also used it in conjunction with an iPhone and iPad, it's worked perfectly until last week.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now, whenever an email is deleted, I get a dialogue popping up saying its unable to move the message to the trash. If I change the delete option to archive, it works fine.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>There hasn't been an iOS update, so what has changed with Outlook.com?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've read some threads relating to IMAP and changing it to pop3 but this is a step backwards and I'll lose my sync between iPad and iPhone</div>

            I solved my problem last nite after many hours of trying different things,it may be worth a try on yours. When you open your mail click on your ipad so that it shows all your files I.e. Inbox,sent,trash and any others you may have. Click on edit and delete
 your trash file,now mine automatically made a new file straight away since then it's been working fine. If it doesn't create a new trash file then you need to create one,you never know its worth a try!!! Good luck I know how frustrating this fault is.

<h2>            Sync iPhone &#34;Archive&#34; folder and Outloook Archived emails</h2>
                    <p>
Hello,</p>
<p>
There is an "Archive" folder in my iPhone's Outlook app. However the archive functions in my computer's outlook do not seem to match it. How do I make it so that I have a folder in my computer called "Archive" that syncs with my iphone "Archive" folder (seems
 simple enough).</p>
<p>
Just to get something out of the way, I&nbsp;<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">HAT</span></strong><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">E</span></strong>&nbsp;the "AutoArchive" function in Outolook. I work in sales and some sales
 to big companies may take several months to complete and I want to keep those important emails in my inbox, in contrast, other sales may be closed in one afternoon so "how old an email is" is just not good enough to define which emails should be archived.</p>
<p>
I just want to very quickly move emails to an archives folder (that does not take the space my email client provides) and have that folder synced with my iPhone "Archive" folder (perhaps make use of the 1TB of space Microsoft gives me???).</p>
<p>
Hope it's not too complicated, seems like an obvious feautre to have.</p>

            <p>You dont say what type of mail account is used in MS Outlook, IMAP, Pop, Exchange or?</p>
<p>If you create a pst file and name it archive you can simply move mail as required to the archive data file, should you not wish to use the Outlook, Archive function.</p>
<p>The archive functions on modified date, not received date.</p>
<p>And no you cannot store an outlook data file on OneDrive or any network location, if that file is currently connected to MS Outlook, as that will lead to data file corruption</p>

            <p>Thanks for you answer,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The mail account it an IMAP acocunt.</p>
<p>Is there a way to automatically sync the .pst file with my iphone "Archive" folder?</p>
<p>Even if the emails would be selected by date modified and not recieved date it would still not be good enough.</p>
<p>I think the AutoArchive function uses a .pst file. Maybe use that one? How do I do it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I want is to be able to archive messages either on my iphone or pc and have it replicated on the other one, have easy access to them, and most important of all, be able to select individual messages to archive.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Sounds to me like you're using a Microsoft account on Outlook.com. That server has an "archive" function (that's really not an archive function) that creates a folder names "Archive" that you can see
 either in Outlook 2016 or in an Outlook for iOS app. I believe the two will sync because there's nothing particularly special about the "Archive" folder. It's just an ordinary folder. It will always remain in your mailbox and count against your mailbox size,
 as far as I can tell. It is totally unrelated to Outlook 2016's Autoarchive feature, which does use a local PST. What you see in an IMAP folder set is unrelated to anythng you'll see in an archive PST.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I have to ask: If you are using Outlook.com as the mail provider, why are you using IMAP? If you aren't using Outlook.com for your mail provider, it still remains that the archive folder you see in the
 Outlook for iOS app is just a folder on the server and it should sync with Outlook 2016 no differently.</span></p>

            First off, most sign up email services used a return verification system.&nbsp; However, some countries are using 1st or 2nd generation Internet access system they obtain from some Internet R&amp;D companies.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like wise some&nbsp;global email service&nbsp;sell off their
 older system.&nbsp; I don't&nbsp;know your&nbsp;network but&nbsp;check your ISP service provider,&nbsp;but if you are the ISP provider for that area....I guess it licensing issue or just your government.&nbsp; You should be able to use the local account but if you download from your ISP
 network......while...

            It might be possible with a micro usb male to A female and a memory stick ( not a drive: power issues). There are adapters like that.&nbsp;

            I'm not sure what your asking. USB disk drives need power. Your phone has no support for power up the disk drive. Only USB sticks are supported. Go to your local PC warehouse and order a micro USB male to female A USB adapter.

<p>This is definitely not an isolated problem, as I have experienced it as well. The documents I seem to have the most problems with are object rich. I include several Equation objects as I am processing my Calculus homework, but also include Drawing objects
 for graphs. This may have something to do with the irregularity of the issue.</p>
<p>Although I am not a MS Engineer (of any kind) I will say the lack of recovery data is not at all surprising, since it freezes during the process of creating the file, there is no file for it to reference when attempting to recover. The other problem I am
 having is that if I allow the "fix this issue" or any other kind of graceful close of Word, when I attempt to reopen my last save it tells me that it is currently only available to My Username, this makes absolutely no sense.</p>

<p>I had this happen 3 times tonight while working on a plain text document with minimal graphics. The problem you describe with the program telling you it is currently only available to your username is called a Data Lock. Essentially, the program thinks the
 document is still open and won't let two users try to change it at the same time. The surefire way to clear the data lock is a reboot. Unfortunately, with Word hung, Windows 7 won't reboot correctly either and it takes a hard power down to get it to happen
 for me.</p>
<p>As to the lost changes, I thought that was the case until I started poking around. Instead of prompting you with the last autosave, Word 10 just quietly tucks it away and you have to dig for it. After opening the document, click the "File" tab and look through
 the "versions" of the document on the bottom left for the most recent autosave. Your manual save may still be more recent.</p>
<p>A bad workaround is simply to turn off the autosave. Part of my pay is based on turnaround time on the documents I work on, so I can't afford to be constantly rebooting and recovering where I was in the document. A better solution for me is to turn off the
 autosave since that is what is crashing the program. I can work through it that way, but I'm wondering if Microsoft would back me down to a more stable Office 7 until they figure out this program killer.</p>

<p>That was finally the solution I came up with too. Ever since I turned off autosave I have had no problems. I just save the document a lot more often than I used to save.</p>

<p>There is no autosave in Word - only automatic saving of recovery information. This recovery information is used in the even of a crash. If the program is hanging when the 'autosave' activates then of course there is no save taking place to recover the data
 when Word restarts. You need to identify the cause of the crash, which is likely to be corruption in one of the user setup files or registry see<a href="http://www.gmayor.com/what_to_do_when_word_crashes.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gmayor.com/what_to_do_when_word_crashes.htm</a>

<p>Reinstalling rarely achieves anything useful as the core program is rarely the cause of the problem.</p>

            I had the same problem using Word 2010 on windows 7, but it seemed to have stopped and started again. I do want to say that I was working on a document for a significant portion of my night with "autosave" working just fine when it decided to freeze. I
 was unable to shut down my computer and after force shutdown and re-opening word none of the previous autosaved files were on record either. I understand that the file it was saving during the issue would not be there, but I would expect the other files to
 be, and they were not. Also, to comment about word not having an autosave function, and needing to identify the cause of the crash ... the cause of the crash is clear, it is AUTOSAVE. I have reinstalled word and continue to have the same problem. When the
 "autosave" bar shows up at the bottom of the screen, word hangs and then is stuck. It seems pretty clear to me what the cause is.&nbsp;

            Hey, I know this question is really old but I just have to post this somewhere. &nbsp;I just had a problem with this too where I almost lost 4+ hours of work. &nbsp;I know I should have saved but w/e. &nbsp;Luckily I went to the AppData/Office/Word and found the corrupt
 recover. &nbsp;Right clicked and went to properties and changed it to open from Microsoft Shell or some bull to Microsoft Word. &nbsp;Worked wonder, got essay back... boss.

            <p>This issue still happens to me, has there been a solution found besides turning off the feature?&nbsp; It happens to me in BOTH Word and Excel.</p>
<p>If I manually save faster than the auto-save it won't hang, but if I pause long enough for Autosave to kick in, I'll hang.&nbsp; Sometimes I can recover, if I wait long enough, like 10+ minutes, other times it's frozen until I restart the app.&nbsp; This is VERY frustrating
 and a waste of time and a loss of work.</p>

            Yes, BetaSki's description is very accurate. &nbsp;Same problem with me. &nbsp;My Word crashes regularly several times a day and has done for over a year. &nbsp;The problem is that it is a very large document with lots of graphics. &nbsp;This is absolutely a bug in the memory
 management. &nbsp;Microsoft needs to get rid of the bug and improve the recovery feature. &nbsp;Ironically, it is a catch-22 glitch in the very feature that is supposed to protect against data/work loss. &nbsp;In the hierarchy of bugs, I was always taught that bugs that
 result in data loss are the very highest priority. &nbsp;I hope Microsoft will learn to see things this way.&nbsp;

                    <p>Back in 2016, I created a recurring appointment for every Wednesday...and somehow it ended up in the "Birthdays" calendar.&nbsp; I can't delete it because the "Birthdays" calendar is "read-only".&nbsp; That's the error message I get when I try to delete it...but I
 really want it gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>System: I have an Office 365 subscription, and this is a Microsoft Exchange account.&nbsp; Windows 10.&nbsp; The recurring appointment shows up on both my desktop version of Outlook and on Outlook.com. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I've even tried simply deleting the Birthdays calendar itself...that seems to remove the calendar, but it comes back within a couple minutes.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I tried the "contact support" chat feature within outlook, but the person on the other end just suggested the basics (like highlight the appointment and press the delete key)...pretty useless.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Any help would be much appreciated!&nbsp;</p>

            You need to disable the birthday calendar from Outlook on the web's Calendar Options and choose Turn off the birthday calendar

<p>Thank you.&nbsp; Here's a bit more detail for anyone else with this problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) If you are using Outlook.com BETA, you have to turn that off so that you can get to those options.&nbsp; Within the "beta", I could not find this option at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) once you turn off the Birthdays calendar, and save&nbsp; that change, you won't see the birthdays calendar.&nbsp; At first I figured that just eliminated the symptom (by hiding it)...but</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) You can now turn on the Birthdays calendar again, and the mysterious "undeletable" appointment is gone!</p>

            1. The beta is going away from everyone over the next few weeks - there should be a Calendar options in beta mode tho. 
<br />3. it may come back within 24 - 48 hours. :( 
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />Back in 2016, I created a recurring appointment for every Wednesday...and somehow it ended up in the "Birthdays" calendar. 
<br />&gt;&gt; 
<br />The birthday calendar gets the dates from the birthday field on contacts as well as from linkedin (if you have them linked). The b-day calendar is fairly new, so i don't think you did could have accidently created it on that calendar.  If the source still exists, Exchange might add it back.

            1. Looks like they removed the option from the beta calendar since i last checked... or my system was messed up because i keep toggling beta off and on.  
<br />
<br />For future reference, this link *should* get to the options, at least until they remove it completely from the dumbed down interface. :(
