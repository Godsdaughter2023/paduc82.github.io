    <title>Cannot do a System Restore - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> c..wagner  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot do a System Restore</h2>
                    &nbsp;I have Windows 10 Home, Version 1607, OS Build 14393.1480. I cannot System Restore to my most recent restore point nor to any prior ones. Message comes up that System Restore has failed and my system hasn't been changed This problem seemed to appear at
 the same times as another one: a lack of file permissions which kept me from saving or reading previously saved files. This permissions problem has now been mostly (not entirely) resolved with the help of a Microsoft rep on this forum. The System Restore issue
 is still present though. I would appreciate advice as it is risky to install new programs without being able to first save a restore point that works, to go back to if necessary. Thanks.&nbsp;

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There may be a number of reasons for this type of issue to occur. Since System Restore is failing, we would request for you to send a screenshot of the error message, so we can have a closer look. We would also suggest that you try System Restore in
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Safe Mode</a></strong>, to isolate all other possible apps that could be conflicting with restore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the outcome.</p>

<p>The first couple days after the dash update I was fine. Now, whenever I start up my system I get to stare at a "signing you in" spinning circle for roughly a minute. This never happened before the udpate. &nbsp;I hate auto-sign in turned on and only one account
 assigned to my xbox. It completely defeats the purpose of instant-on and game resumes when it takes this long to start up the system.</p>

<p>Hey mate,</p>
<p>Do as scooby has suggested, and see how that goes. To do a hard boot of your console, when the console is on, hold down the power button for 10seconds until the console switches off. Wait for a couple of minutes, then turn it back on and see how it goes.</p>
<p>Let us know how it goes :)</p>

<p>I've got this issue too. in fact it's rendered all internet connection practacly useless, and makes using any app that streams like YouTube or Netflix innoperable - lurking the forums for a solution.</p>
<p>my UL/DL speeds are fine. the 360 opperates flawlessly. all other devices on my network are fine. I've cleared Persentient storage, reset DNS, IP, and MAC to automatic. soft restart. Hard re-boot. checked my gateway and modem...</p>
<p>I was on with a tech here at XB and they had me remove my profile... needless to say - after the unplug/rebot session I can't even get signed back in.</p>

<h2>            Internet connection lost after password change</h2>
                    I changed the microsoft password via my phone.&nbsp; On my computer there are 2 internet "connections".&nbsp; One is the standard and has always been the default.&nbsp; Netgear27.&nbsp; The other is Netgear 5-G.&nbsp; Now the standard won't work and says I have no internet connection.
 If I switch to Netgear 5-G I have internet.&nbsp; I didn't change anything else and I can't seem to find out how to update the microsoft password so the default will work again.&nbsp; Any thoughts?

<p><br />
You should always make sure you are plugged into an uninterruptible power source (wall outlet)&nbsp;before proceeding with a system recovery or re-installation procedure.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you seeing noticing any drive activity or any indication of movement in the progress bar?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you have already interrupted the process once, there is no telling why it seems stuck, so be patient and if it does not complete in a reasonable amount of time, you may want to restart the process (at your own risk), by powering down and restarting
 your computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can either press<strong> F8</strong> to boot into your recovery options page or the<strong> left</strong>
<strong>ALT+F10 Keys </strong>as soon as you reach the ACER Logo screen<strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Make sure you system is plugged into a wall electrical outlet before proceeding.</p>

<h2>            Solution To My Issue And Advise For Those Having Issues With The New Skype Software</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday, I was still researching how to resolve my issue, video static, upon connecting on the skype support page, and lo and behold....a chat window popped up, if I need assistance with skype.&nbsp; I clicked that window fast, and
 a skype technical support representative came on.&nbsp; I told him everything about my issue, and showed him a picture of the problem.&nbsp; He told me that the new version of skype has many known issues, with the problem I was experiencing one of them.&nbsp; He said he
 can fix it.&nbsp; He uninstalled my version of skype and reinstalled an older version.&nbsp; The older version is good until September.</p>
<p>http://www.skype.com/go/getskype-full</p>
<p>Well, after installation of the older version...guess what.....problem solved.&nbsp; Yes, the newer version of skype created all the problems I had.&nbsp; If there were known problems with skype, why didn't they revert back to the older version
 until the newer version had no bugs?&nbsp; You don't fix something that is not broken.&nbsp; At least I know that my mother can use the older version and there are no issues until September.&nbsp; If skype can't fix the problem, I ask you revert back to the older version
 that works for everyone.&nbsp; I am so thankful for the skype help team.&nbsp; I thought I may have to restore to factory settings my computer, but now, I know I don't have to.&nbsp; Skype is a great product.&nbsp; I can keep an eye on my elderly mothers who does not live close
 to me.&nbsp; She can see me and I can see her.&nbsp; It is a wonderful product for both of us.&nbsp; When it is not working, it frustrates her and I have to resolve it.&nbsp; Again, Microsoft....if you can't make the newer version work correctly...go back to the older version.&nbsp;
 Another bug with the new version, you can't tell if someone is available, unless skype is open on their screen.&nbsp; The older version worked if you minimized the program.&nbsp; Between that, and the scaled down options, and the video issues, you took a good products
 and made it miserable to use.&nbsp; Thank you for all your help.&nbsp; I hope I can help someone else with this post.</p>

<p>Hi, <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/0b93269c-cac7-45fd-9011-63bcefe58671" title="Steve3NJ">
<p>
</p><p>I agree with your experience and feedback&nbsp;with the new Skype version and it should be bug free like the classic version of Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll take this thread and forward it to our development team to help improve the new version of Skype in the upcoming new Skype updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently, the new skype version is working on improvements and should be able to meet customer satisfaction like the classic Skype, as Skype declared discontinuing this version on September 1, 2018. These improvements need to be integrated in the new version
 of Skype before the deprecation of the classic version.</p>
<p>

            Hi Paul,
<br />
<br />Its possible the rates increased since then. This is what Skype list on its page for calling from the US to Switzerland:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://secure.skype.com/calling-rates/Switzerland?language=en#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://secure.skype.com/calling-rates/Switzerl...</a>
<br />
<br />If you believe you were incorrectly charged...
<br />
<br />I recommend you contact chat support and choose Technical problem so an agent can help diagnose whats the problem with your account:
<br />
<br />Go to the following link to get assisted live support:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/contactus/skype/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/contactus/s...</a>
<br />
<br />Select Account &amp; sign-in 
<br />Select Payment and Purchases 
<br />Click Chat<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d8385712-995a-4744-96db-84115936d5bb?upload=true" />

<p>The rates listed are correct. &nbsp;I called a mobile device and the rate was 20 cents/minute. &nbsp;This is outrageous, in my view. &nbsp;Much higher than it was even 12 months ago. &nbsp;I'll be finding a new calling app!</p>

    <title>My sons xbox is blocked - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chrisgto  say:</h3>
<h2>            My sons xbox is blocked</h2>
                    Hello. My son is 11 and we have a Xbox 1. Yesterday evening already received an email which at first I thought was a scam about Xbox enforcement action being taken on my son's Xbox. I have never seen an email like this before so I decided to investigate
 a little. I have checked the Xbox he plays on and I noticed that there is a message about week-long suspension of various services. He was about to fall asleep so I asked him what it is and he had no idea. Further investigation into this matter gave us a clue
 that it might have something to do with someone reporting my son to some sort of Reporting Center of Xbox. Are you ask my son to describe what happened in the recent hour of playing and he said that some guy contacted him and he recognized his name from before
 as a person who is not only vulgar and racist but also a bully in the past and my son asked him what flipping he wants from him again. And it seems that this person reported my son for something which I have no idea what it is

            Hi, it is possible that your son has something inappropriate on the profile picture. Or he has a rough say in online gaming and someone has reported it. Or he wrote something insulting to someone. Then they are behind this sanction because they violated
 community rules.<br />
This is a threat to BAN players, either for communication or for other functions.

            No. My son has his name as nickname and i would never agree to offensive nickname or picture. Nor some racist etc remark etc especially given that my son is biracial. He is waking up right now and ive asked him about it. He said this guy in past was harassing
 him multiple times and contacted my son yet again. And my son was scared and freaked out he says and he asked him what the f€ck do you eant from me " or something like that. He doesnt remember exact words. But i highly doubt an 11 year old child has "offended"xbox
 gods with a message. Especially its a fortnite game not some xrated adult game. What irks me is the fact that noone bothered to reach out to me thru either phone call or a email to ask for whats happening. Im not playing xbox daily. Its once in blue moon like
 perhaps 1 hr a month if that. Xbox is for my son and i know noone rlse touches it and he is not a psychopatic online troll abusing people. However i will not stand by and watch my son being punished for trying to defend hi

            My xbox one is at home. I admit i dont know everything about that console. It is home. He doesnt share with anyone password etc. And noone except him plays. Unless you take me playing hour here or there . And if i dont want him to lose multiplayer option
 with his gaming buddies who are all over the world with some restrictions. Im not sure how or what i can do to prevent random isiots provoking my son then from ehat im hearing from my son probably posting it on youtube channels of theirs gloating how they
 got someone banned. I am not happy right now with the way xbox handled this issue but if i find out that xbox is actually helping the abusers achieve their goals i will be livid. When i was setting up the account not long ago with a live person from xbox paying
 gor account etc access noone said anything about issues like this or warned me. And if my son needs a lawyer to play a game with xbox then i will gladly contact mine and let him deal with that in court because i as heck will not tell hi

<h2>            I couldn&#39;t view video  on nbc nightly  news with edge or IE</h2>
                    <p>I couldn't view video&nbsp; on nbc nightly&nbsp; news with edge or IE. So I installed Google Chrome And it worked for this site. Any clue whats wrong with my 10586.338&nbsp; through .456 Pro . I used to have no problem with this</p>
<p>just a few&nbsp; weeks&nbsp; ago. I really wanted Edge to be my sole browser&nbsp; . Was something removed when build .318 was updated.

    <title>Playback devices option missing &#38; Mic not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yumene  say:</h3>
<h2>            Playback devices option missing &#38; Mic not working</h2>
                    <p>I have tried to search but I've gotten nowhere. What is happening is this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to use my headset mic but it's not working.&nbsp; I opened the sound settings window and verified that the device is selected and set as default.&nbsp; I make sure that enhancements are disabled as well (ie: 'Allow Exclusive Control') but still not resolved.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I try to do a "Listen to this device" and it DOES work via that, when I speak I can hear myself through the speakers, but on actual programs and apps, the mic is not giving any sound. On the actual sound interface, when I talk there are no green bars like
 there should be; on either the headset or the builtin mic as it's done before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to uninstall the audio drivers and restart so that it re-installs them, but nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps it's good to note that on the taskbar tray, when I right click the speaker icon there used to be an option "Playback Devices" but that option is also no longer there, I had to enter the playback devices window via the control panel.&nbsp; I also have
 not installed anything new or made any system changes since this started happening.&nbsp; The only thing that happened recently to the computer is some windows updates when I shut down the computer a couple days ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am at a loss at what to do to get my mic to work and any help will be appreciated.</p>

<p>You can't. There is no 16-bit sub-system in any 64-bit Windows.</p>
<p>If your device needs 16-bit TWAIN you can dual boot with XP, get XP in a virtual machine or get a new device with 64-bit drivers.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>

</p><p>The People app is your address book and your social app all in one. You can add your contacts, see updates on social networks (like Twitter), and keep in touch with friends and family on Skype—all from a single app. Windows 10 Mail app will
 use People app for fetching the contacts from it.</p>

<p>The difference in terms of graphics etc isnt that much from what i have played. Its deffo not a next gen game, the reason i bought it tho is 1st person mode. This changes everything about the game and makes it a much more immersive game. It slows the pace
 a little as you take everything in. you notice things you didnt before. Like talking to the npc's.</p>
<p>On the other hand combat, driving etc is much harder in 1st person. Plus i only technically paid £25 for it. Dunno if i could recommend it at £50 tho.</p>

<p>I've rebought it on my PS4 an it's great fun in first person perspective, looks awesome as well. Not sure I would bother if I only had a Xbox one though. Seems to be having frame rate issues and doesn't look much better than the 360 version.</p>

<p><strong>[Mod removed]</strong> - No frame rate issues whatsoever on xbox one, game looked amazing last gen, looks even better now</p>
<p>Agree with Boas about the first person mode, makes the game feel so different, but really adds to the experience, there's also some brilliant new easter eggs : )

<p>I've completed it on the 360 but I will be rebuying it again for the XBOX ONE just because like a good film or book, I want to experience it again. Although I will probably mainly be playing it in 3rd person view, The first person perspective I'm interested
 in seeing and experiencing for myself. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Watched my buddies playing this and it doesn't seem to look any different than when I played it on the 360.</p>
<p>To be fair it probably does. &nbsp;I'm just used to playing on the ONE now and so GTA V on the ONE looks at home on the ONE whereas on the 360 it stood out like a gem.</p>
<p>So I'm not really in a rush to experience this again at new game price.</p>

<p>You said exactly what i said to my mate last night whilst playing.</p>
<p>Even afetr playing killzone on ps4 going back to gta5 on the 360 the game looked old.</p>
<p>It does look better but it doesnt look next gen, but then next gen is the norm now i suppose. (was still astounded by DAI beauty tho).</p>

<h2>            How to split and cut videos in windows 10 &#40;NOT TRIM&#41;</h2>
                    I was wondering if there was any way to cut or split videos in widows 10 without for free or without 3rd party software. The video editor supplied with windows 10 seems to only be able to trim the video. If this is not possible (which would be shameful
 considering even&nbsp;<em>movie maker</em> could do this simple task) is there any 3rd party software that I could use for free?

            Photos app provided with Windows 10 will not be able to do this. You can use free VLC Media player which provides the ability to cut clips also. 
<br />
