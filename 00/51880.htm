<h2>            Nintendo Joy Cons and Windows 7</h2>
                    At the moment I have Windows 7 and Joy cons as said by the title. I want to play this game and I have added the Joy Con devices in to my computer. However they won't work. I have tried using the game controller program but the joy cons will not show up
 in the window.&nbsp;

    <title>Losing HDMI signal from Windows Media Center - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> travis.illig  say:</h3>
<h2>            Losing HDMI signal from Windows Media Center</h2>
                    I have a Dell Studio Hybrid PC running Windows Vista Home Premium attached to a Samsung LN52A750 LCD HDTV via HDMI. If I switch the TV away from the PC input and back, I lose the video signal... but only when Windows Media Center is running full screen.<br />
<br />
This works fine:<br />
<ol>
<li>Turn the TV on. </li><li>Switch to the PC input on the TV. </li><li>Turn the PC on. </li><li>Fire up Windows Media Center. </li><li>Turn the PC off. </li><li>Turn the TV off (or switch to a different input). </li></ol>
<br />
This also works fine:<br />
<ol>
<li>Turn the TV on. </li><li>Switch to the PC input on the TV. </li><li>Turn the PC on. </li><li>Fire up Windows Media Center. </li><li>Minimize Windows Media Center. </li><li>Switch the TV to a different input but leave the PC on. </li><li>Switch the TV back to the PC - you still see the PC's desktop. </li></ol>
This does NOT work:<br />
<ol>
<li>Turn the TV on. </li><li>Switch to the PC input on the TV. </li><li>Turn the PC on. </li><li>Fire up Windows Media Center. </li><li>Switch the TV to a different input but leave the PC on <em>with Windows Media Center running full screen</em> .
</li><li>Try to switch the TV back to the PC - no picture or sound is on the screen and the PC has to be fully rebooted to get sound/video back.
</li></ol>
<br />
I came across this problem recently (after switching from a VGA/DVI connection to HDMI). I first came across it when the PC would go to sleep - the video signal would shut off and the TV would stop seeing the PC signal even once the PC woke up. I read a little
 online and thought this was something folks refer to as an "EDID handshake" problem. I thought just not letting the computer sleep (and not shutting off the video from the PC) would fix it, but I ran into another issue. Sort of a twist.<br />
<br />
I was showing some friends how Media Center worked, I switched to the PC, showed them Windows Media Center, switched to a different input, then switched back to the PC (because I forgot to show something). The blue Media Center background appeared for a split
 second and the signal was instantly lost. I had to totally reboot to get the signal back.<br />
<br />
I retried the experiment - fired up Media Center, switched the TV away from the PC, then switched it right back - same result. Signal lost, hard reboot.<br />
<br />
I don't know how I stumbled upon it, but at one point I did the experiment with a twist. I fired up the computer, started Media Center, and minimized it. Then I switched the TV away from the PC and back... and the signal was still there. I did it again, and
 again, the signal was there. Turned the TV off and back on - signal still there. Then I maximized Media Center, switched the TV away from the PC, and when I came back... NO SIGNAL.<br />
<br />
So: <strong>With Media Center full screen the signal gets lost, but when Media Center is minimized the signal stays.</strong>
<br />
<br />
I started thinking about how my recent use of the Media Center differed from previous times. Normally I use the Media Center, watch a movie or whatever, and then switch and do something else. I don't switch back and forth from the PC to something else and back.
 And every time I'd switched to the PC and it'd kept the signal, the screen saver had been on - the "Bubbles" screen saver.<br />
<br />
Something I'd noticed with the "Bubbles" screen saver is that it sometimes brings the Windows task bar to the foreground so it appears "on top of" the full screen Windows Media Center. I usually switch the TV to the PC input before "waking the computer up"
 and getting the screen saver to go away.<br />
<br />
Now I'm wondering if the lost signal has something to do with Windows Media Center. I [think I] know a little about how Windows works and the concept of running different "desktops." I wrote a screen saver a long time ago in unmanaged C++ and I remember there
 was some crazy stuff you had to do when writing a "windowless" application (like Media Center - there's no border around it when it goes full screen) and doing "overlays" like the "Bubbles" screen saver. I'm wondering if it has something to do with the standard
 Windows desktop working correctly but the Windows Media Center app full-screen "desktop" not working right.<br />
<br />
I tried another experiment where I kept WMC full screen, let the TV lose the signal, and hit Win+D to minimize it and show the desktop. Then I switched the TV back. No luck - once the signal was lost, it was lost for good.<br />
<br />
I have since been researching various answers. I read that setting the ACPI suspend mode to S3 would fix it, but it doesn't. I tried setting up a hotkey tied to a script that would change the display resolution to 640x480 and then change it back because I read
 that changing the resolution would refresh the signal - that didn't work.<br />
<br />
Basically, I've found no alternative except to keep WMC minimized when it's not in use.<br />
<br />
I'm going to try setting the "Bubbles" screen saver to 1 minute or something and see if that will at least let me switch the inputs on the TV after a minute of inactivity. Still, it'd be nice to know if there's some setting I'm missing.

            Something I found that fixed my issue was <a href="http://www.edbott.com/weblog/?p=2480" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this little $20 HDMI switchbox</a> . Putting that switchbox between my Dell Studio Hybrid PC and the TV seems to change something up so the signal isn't lost when I switch the TV away from Media Center and back again. I can't promise it'll work for everyone,
 but it works great for me.

            Hello Nayru2210,<br />
<br />
To answer your question.&nbsp; Most of the problems occur because there really isn't a industry standard in regards to HDMI.&nbsp; This means that at this time various companies are utilizing the HDMI technology in slightly different ways.&nbsp; Basically until everyone uses
 one stardard, there will be issues like this.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I've been researching HDMI issues for the past year personally.&nbsp; Since computers have enter the HDMI&nbsp;arena, there's a good chance that most issues will be resolved sooner than later.<br />

<h2>            TURBO TAX PROBLEMS</h2>
                    <p>I've been trying to run TurboTax 2016 after I installed it. TT support has been unable to offer any help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Initial install seems to work fine. The program will open and appears ready to use. I can run the program by double clicking on the exe file in&nbsp;file explorer. However, when I run the program from the desktop shortcut I end up with "Problem with Shortcut
 Fatal Error During Installation". Prior to this error message there is a display that opens up that is titled Turbo Tax 2016 WinPerReleaseEngine that shows windows is configuring. This occurs prior to the fatal error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This also happens with my TurboTax 2015, which used to work!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Windows 10 HOME, ver 1607 installed on HP 15 laptop</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have uninstalled and reinstalled numerous times.</p>
<p>Emptied my recycle bin.</p>
<p>Ran the .net framework repair tool</p>
<p>Ran sfc /scannow</p>
<p>Disabled anti-virus programs</p>
<p>Tried installing the proper version of .net framework only to be told that I already have that version installed.</p>
<p>Changed windows firewall app settings to allow free access to the turbotax program</p>
<p>Checked for windows updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sure could use some EZ help, THANKS!</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have searched the internet but still can't find an answer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>A File conversion Utility is a specialized application that opens multiple types of files and allows the user to to convert the file to another type.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A good example on a Macintosh computer is Graphics Converter &nbsp;that will open any type of Graphic file jpg, jpg200, png, gif , pdf and converter it to a different versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Say you have a drawing in gif,jpg, or png and you want convert to say PDF to merge into an existing PDF. &nbsp;&nbsp;You would open that file in its original format. Then on Mac you would use SaveAs and choose PDF the click on okay. A copy of the file will then become
 a PDF file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am explaining this in Macintosh terms because that is&nbsp;what I use. I am sure that there are equal converter Utilities on UNIX,Linux, or Widows PC and the wording of commands will be different. But the Principle works the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most application such as Database, Spreadsheet, Word Processing.&nbsp;Graphics program all have some limited abilities to convert to different formats. But a Converter or conversion Utility has much Richer abilities.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Go to the support website&nbsp;of your computer manufacturer. Locate your computer model (be exact) then download and install the necessary driver. If in doubt about which one it is you need, send them an email.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Avoid 3rd party driver detection utilities and download sites, especially those that want payment. Drivers should be free from your computer manufacturer or the manufacturer of the piece of hardware. I have never paid for a driver in 30+ years of computing.</p>

            <p>Code 28 means that the device driver is not installed. A driver is software that enables the Windows operating system to communicate with a piece of hardware.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Try right-clicking on the device and selecting <strong>Update driver</strong>.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Do you know the model no. of the Biostar motherboard?</p>

            <p>The calendar I use on my desktop is a feature of Outlook 2007.&nbsp; I do not use the calendar app because I could not figure out how to sync with my iCloud calendar.&nbsp; When I bought my ipad mini about two years ago, I synchronized the calendar on my ipad (iCloud)
 with the calendar in Outlook.&nbsp; I also synchronized&nbsp;my contacts.&nbsp; Each time I entered an event on one calendar or added/edited a contact on one device,&nbsp;it was entered on both.&nbsp; Everything worked well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When we upgraded to Windows 10&nbsp; on the desktop (perhaps 2 months ago or so), the sync no longer worked.&nbsp; This did not happen immediately after the upgrade but rather a couple of weeks ago.&nbsp; I tried connecting the ipad to the desktop as I periodically do,
 but it would not backup the ipad or sync the calendar or contacts.&nbsp; It was as though something was blocking the process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I am in Outlook and go to "Calendar" and then click on "Calendar in iCloud," I get this message:&nbsp; "The set of folders cannot be opened. The information store could not be opened."&nbsp; Previously, this was the process I used to get to my calendar while
 in Outlook, which I usually keep open at all times.&nbsp; My primary email account is with Google.</p>

            <p>Hi,
  </p><p><br /></p>
<p>&nbsp;
  </p>
<p>To help determine the root cause of this issue, kindly answer the following questions:
  </p>
<p>1. Is your device connected to a wired or wireless network?
  </p>
<p>2. Have you tried updating other games and check if the same issue persists?
  </p><p><br /></p>
<p>We recommend downloading the game update from the Windows Store. Refer to this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/b5e4e2e4-cc9d-47ef-8782-7a1c81e735ef/check-for-updates-for-apps-and-games-from-windows-store" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a> for the steps.
  </p><p><br /></p>
<p>If the same issue occurs, kindly perform a clean boot. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update. Click this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a> for the steps.</p><p><br /></p><p>Keep us posted.<br /></p>

    <title>Windows 10 acting up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chris w62  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 acting up</h2>
                    <p>For reason, my Windows 10 installation has decided to not show desktop icons, just the text. The spacing allows room for Icons, but there is no icon at all. Also, File explorer doesn't show any icons either, nor does the system registry. But the start menu
 shows icons. I've tried creating a new profile, rebuilding the icon and thumbnail cache and have run sfc. Nothing helped, or found any problems.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It happened suddenly, after I tried to manually enable the dark theme. That didn't work, so reversed out and after a reboot, it was all wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As usual a pic helps, so here's one:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ebaafeea-625e-4fd4-b7a0-4e8559d35490" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ebaafeea-625e-4fd4-b7a0-4e8559d35490" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see, the start menu has the icon for sharpdevelop, but now look at the desktop, text at the top, no icon (and yes, the view setting says to show, otherwise you'd not even see the text).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now another shot:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f4eb4733-2b3a-416d-bc41-cd519f8f6ec5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f4eb4733-2b3a-416d-bc41-cd519f8f6ec5" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This clearly shows how the text occupies the top position (where normally the image starts. Highlighting shows that there is no transparent icon, otherwise the outline would show. View is set to medium icon size. You can also see that the spacing is allowing
 for the icon image. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Two other noteworthy observations: </p>
<p>1. The property dialog does not show</p>
<p>2. Many icons don't show (inside the file explorer, registry editor),</p>
<p>
</p><p>Graphics drivers were reinstalled, made no difference. I might try and go back to VGA and start from scratch. However, it seems to be more than a simple rendering issue.</p>

            <p>No, I can reset, but that seems to suggest it will remove installed applications, I can't go to a previous build, it was updated too long ago. I can probably recover a older disk image, but was hoping to simply find a fix, because it doesn't seem like a
 profile or system corruption. I don't use this one a lot, so if no one has a clue, I'll probably just restore a disk image. Of course this will trigger a massive windows update, but I'll plan for that,......</p>

            As mentioned, this setting is already checked, hence you can see the icon text. Flipping it, off-on, it doesn't trigger a redisplay. Same for flipping the size, or most combinations I could think of.

            <p>I wasn't referring to a Reset. System restore is different and restores the system back to a previous date. (before the problem started)</p>
<p>Search restore in windows search and select Create a restore point. This actually gives the option to restore to a previous point.</p>

            If you restore your image I would suggest turning on system restore on the main C:\ disk. Sorry I can't think of anything else. If you don't want to Reset and lose your programs, the image sounds your best option.

            I'm back to the older image, it works fine, just have to do some minor changes to some of the programs. However it has been a while since Windows did something like this, which I find worrying.

            <p>Have completed the required tweaks and installed the latest versions of software I need. Now saving the disk image before I let Windows Update do its worst. I don't like W10 in that respect, For W7 I could at least tell it to just tell me and I'll decide
 when what gets updated. Especially the Software Removal tool, which has a reputation for attacking legal and valid software. After the advised recovery procedures absolutely trashing my W7 installation, I prefer the disk image route, that and WSUS offline
 update. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Still don't know what caused it, and if it could be fixed. But I do know that it didn't take a lot to make it happen, so hoping it is a very specific sequence and it won't happen again......</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that would be the size of all the Windows files on your device. Kindly refer to the notes for the reminders before downloading/creating a Media Creation Tool for Windows 10 Fall Creators Update:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>An internet connection (internet service provider fees may apply).</li><li>Sufficient data storage available on a computer, USB or external drive for the download.</li><li>A blank USB flash drive with at least 8GB of space or blank DVD (and DVD burner) if you want to create media. We recommend using a blank USB or blank DVD, because any content on it will be deleted.<br />
</li><li>When burning a DVD from an ISO file, if you are told the disc image file is too large you will need to use Dual Layer (DL) DVD Media.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if there are any other concerns.</p>
        </p>

<p>First of all I would like to thank Jomel Santos for responding to my query.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somehow, I do not want to reinstall Window 10 Fall Creators Update.&nbsp; Until now, I haven't experienced any problem with the OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After my query, I browsed various sites relating to Win 10 Fall Creators update.&nbsp; Somebody, suggested that one of the&nbsp; reason for such a huge size may be due to the presence of old drivers in Windows\system32\DriverStore. I did delete some obsolete drivers.
 But didn't gain huge space in terms of GBs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also read in Microsoft's site that MS will remove unnecessary folders after a period of 30 days from the date of installation. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I checked the size of Windows folder just now, the Size is : 53.6 GB and Size on Disk is 53.7GB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume that after the expiry of 30 days, I hope Windows folder size will be reduced.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again</p>

<h3> mcisar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why can&#39;t WIndows 10  warn about incompatible software BEFORE installing updates.</h2>
                    <p>Just received the Win10 anniversary update and after the update was installed I get notifications that 3 apps have been removed because they "are not compatible with this version of windows".&nbsp;&nbsp; Why the heck doesn't the installer do a scan and warn me of
 these incompatibilities BEFORE installing the windows update.&nbsp; Then I would have the ability to decide whether the new update is more important to me than the applications I will lose.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my particular case before the update I had a perfectly working laptop with a docking station connected to three 27" monitors.&nbsp; After the update I'm now stuck working on the single 14" built in monitor on the laptop because Windows decided to uninstall
 the display driver for my docking station.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Had I known this in advance I would have definitely not installed the anniversary update because there is NOTHING in the update that I would consider important enough to lose access to my external displays.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know Microsoft wants to pretend they are Apple and protect users from ourselves... but I want to set up my PC the way *I* want it and thusfar with Windows 10 Microsoft is making WAY too many decisions for me... and they aren't the right decisions.</p>

            <p>My computers just upgraded to Windows 10 Anniversary overnight without asking. In the process, Microsoft arbitrarily removed several required applications from my systems. I am enraged by their arrogance. I already wished I hadn't been forced to buy Windows
 10 when I built my latest machines. Now, they remove my software?!? I don't build computers to run Windows. I build them to run applications. Given the choice between a new Windows update or running my software reliably, Windows would lose every time. Perhaps
 they should let each Windows 10 user walk into their homes and remove their refrigerators, DVRs, or TVs, so they know how we feel. Seriously. It's an equivalent exchange in my mind. They stole things I use every day. We should be allowed to return the favor.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This terrorist act of destruction by Microsoft should never have happened without asking permission because I definitely would have refused. I gave them permission to update Windows, not remove (or break) my critical applications. Every time I talk to support
 people at my various software vendors, the first thing they ask me is, "Did you upgrade to Windows 10 Anniversary? We've had a lot of problems with that version." I hadn't planned to update to Anniversary. Given all the problems, I assumed that it was an optional
 update. Apparently, it became a critical update yesterday and it was forced on me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hey Microsoft. Bring back Windows 7 with security upgrades. Thanks to your oblivious OS designers, I hate Windows 10 even more today than I did yesterday. If my software would run on any other platform, I'd abandon Microsoft at the speed of a lightning strike.
 If I can't get it to run on this buggy mess you just installed, I'll be forced to look for a way to get Windows 7 back on my machines, legitimately or otherwise. I literally never had a problem of any kind with Windows 7. Windows 10 is a horrible joke.</p>

<h2>            How to automatically forward incoming faxes via e-mail&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
I have setup faxing on my Windows 7 machine and would like to have incoming faxes automatically routed to my e-mail account. I was able to do this in Windows Server 2003 a few years ago, but I can't seem to be able to do it in Windows 7.<br />
<br />
Anyone know how to do this in Win 7? If it is not possible to do it directly from Windows Fax and Scan, then is it possible to do it from Task Scheduler?<br />
<br />
Thank you for any help,<br />
Paul</p>

<p>Hi Paul Greiner,</p>
<p>Unfortunately automatically forwarding the faxes option is not available in Windows 7.</p>
<p>The only option is to forward the mails manually.</p>
<p>These options are only available in Windows Servers, if you still wish to use it, you may use your favorite search engine and check if you can find any third part application for the same.</p>

<h2>            Changing Account Regions</h2>
                    
<p>Hello. I<span>&nbsp;want to migrate my region to Korea, from Canada, as I live in the ROK now. I can change my region on my actual Xbox 360. However, when I go to change it here (<a href="https://live.xbox.com/en-CA/AccountMigration/Confirm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://live.xbox.com/en-CA/AccountMigration/Confirm</a>)
 there is no option for Korea (even though there is an option to select it on xbox.com 대한민국 (Korea</span>)). Any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p><span>Cheers.</span></p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>When you log into Xbox online you can change the country on the bottom left hand corner of the page. &nbsp;Click the country then select the one you want. &nbsp;See if this helps.</p>
<p>For migrating I assume you have done this:</p>
<p>How to change your region</p>
<p>1. Go to the Account migration page.</p>
<p>2. Sign in using the account that you want to migrate to another region.</p>
<p>3. At the bottom of the page, click Next.</p>
<p>4. On the “Moving your Xbox Live account” page, select the region that you’re moving your account to, then click I Accept.</p>
<p>There are some things that can stop the migration:</p>
<p>You won’t be able to change your region if any of the following conditions apply:</p>
<p>* You changed regions within the last three months.</p>
<p>* Your account is currently suspended (for example, if the credit card on one of your memberships has expired).</p>
<p>* You have an Xbox 360 Entertainment For All contract.</p>
<p>* You are a minor (as defined by applicable law) in your current region and will not be a minor in the region that you want to change to.</p>
<p>* You are currently not a minor (as defined by applicable law) in your current region and will become a minor in the region that you want to change to.</p>
<p>As Korea is an option in the regions (bottom left) I have to assume it is available when you migrate. &nbsp;Yet if non of this helps you may be best to contact support directly either online or via twitter @XboxSupport</p>
<p>Good luck &amp; happy gaming</p>

<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.
<br />
<br />Out of Box Experience
<br />
<br />The Out of Box Experience page is where you get to configure detailed settings in Windows, which includes creating a user account, configure privacy, sync PC settings and install modern applications.

            Hey Connor.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />It's probably choking on the present install, especially if it's loaded with factory bloatware.  
<br />
<br />You can try to run Factory Recovery if your PC has a key to trigger it (F11 for HP, F12 for Dell) but if you want the best possible install follow these illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Connor,  the Windows 10 Reset function is generally more successful if run from the Recovery Environment . . .
<br />
<br />Press Shift while clicking Restart
<br />
<br />From the Windows Recovery Environment, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC
<br />
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing
<br />Then start the Reset
<br />
<br />If the Reset Still fails, your best option is to clean install Windows 10
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

<br /> 
<br />Since you were trying a Reset and it failed I would do a complete Clean Install and start with a Clean Slate (of course this removes all). Other options are also below.
<br />
<br />If you do a Clean Install then it would be activated with the Digital Entitlement.

<br />Other options to try to get the computer stable and/or allow a Reset.
<br />
<br />If you had a 3rd party antivirus on the OS you upgraded OR if you have one now uninstall it and then run its maker's removal tool. Use Windows Defender which in Windows 8/8.1/10 is a full antivirus. Despite all the hype out there Windows Defender and the Windows Firewall are true superstars.

            Hello, 
<br />The reset Image might be corrupt so try pointing the recovery image to a different media.
<br />Make sure you have Windows 10 ISO file and has install.wim in Sources folder.

    <title>How do you morph a skill&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do you morph a skill&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Still trying to learn the interface. This is the first MMORPG I have not played on a PC. I'm sure it's something obvious, but I can't figure it out. I have a skill point available but can't seem how to morph an existing skill.</p>

<p>When a skill is ready to morph it'll have 3 small dots or small diamonds next to it indicating that it can be morphed. When you click on it you get to choose between 2 morph ability options. Read what each one does and choose the one that suits your play
 style best, roughly speaking. That's how it worked for me any way. I'm only lvl7 or 8 and I've already morphed 2 or 3 different attack abilities.</p>

<p>Hmmm...I wonder why I can't morph any of my skills then? Do the base skills have to get to a certain level or something first? Does it take more than one point? I'm confused as to why I don't have the option.</p>

<p>@ Tungsten Shark,</p>
<p>You need to raise a Skill and it will give you the option to Morph it once it gets enough Experience and it takes 1 Skill Point to do it.</p>
<p>There are several ways to get Experience for a Skill that I am aware of below:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Use that Skill directly like using Puncture for the "One Hand and Shield" Skill Line while in Combat.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Use the Skill indirectly like Dodging (LB + A + LS in direction you want to dodge) to raise Armor Skills (will raise slightly even when you avoid all damage by dodging the attack if you have at least 1 piece of Armor equipped).</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Just have a point in the Skill Line (does not have to be used and can even be a Passive Skill).</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;Read every Book you can find as some are for certain Skills and will raise it one Level for a one time use.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;Read Lorebooks because they can give a slight raise to some Skills.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;Complete Quests to gain Experience to everything, which can at times lead to several Skills gaining a Level alone with your Character gaining a Level.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;Help other Players (your Skills will raise slightly faster even when you are not part of a Group/Guild).</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;Choose "Moral" or "Good" Options in Dialogue will raise your Skills faster than letting them die (letting someone live or convincing an NPC to let another NPC live and this can sometimes lead to bonus Quests or even help later in the game).</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;Resurrect other Players if you are able to (not sure about this yet).</p>
<p>Those are just some of the ways I have discovered to raise Skills to be able to get them to Morph when their Level gets high enough (I think it varies based on Skill Line, but not sure). &nbsp;Also, I think only "Usable" Skills can be Morphed.</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>

    <title>MSMouse and Keyboard Center ERROR 1603 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ariel negron  say:</h3>
<h2>            MSMouse and Keyboard Center ERROR 1603</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded to Windows10. HP ProBook 4530s i3. Came across some incompatible apps which had to be removed (HP Protect Tools). Also glitch with missing&nbsp; Bluetooth On/Off Toggle switch, pending solutions. I initially downloaded Microsoft Mouse and
 Keyboard Center for my Sculpt Touch Mouse , which is an awesome device. However I made an error and accidently removed the Blue tooth device. I then did a "Reset This PC" hoping to restore my Bluetooth device. It appears that my Bluetooth Device was returned
 under Windows 7 Home Premium&nbsp;reset and was able to connect my Sculpt Touch Mouse via the Bluetooth. However, when I attempted to download MS Mouse and Keyboard Center&nbsp;&nbsp;under W7 Home Premium a window error popped up from Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center:</p>
<p>"Setup must close because an error occurred. Verify that you computer meets the system requirements on the product packaging. Restart your computer and try running Setup again. If the error happens again, see Help for customer support options. (Error code
 1603)" </p>
<p>I upgraded to Windows 10 again and reattempted to download MS Mouse and Keyboard Center. Same Message poped up.
</p>
<p>I currently have the mouse working connected to Bluetooth, however unable to utilize the configuration tools with the Mouse and Keyboard Center.</p>
<p>Any suggestions/solutions to this issue will be greatly appreciated.</p>

    <title>Language settings for Canada - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Language settings for Canada</h2>
                    <p>I am having trouble getting all of my Region / Location / Language settings to be Canada - English.</p>
<p>As you can see from the attached jpeg, Language shows as English (Canada), but when I checked on Region &gt; Administrative &gt; Copy Settings, it shows that my Current User&nbsp;Display Language is English (United Kingdom)!
</p>
<p>I suspect this error occurred because when I downloaded the English (Canada) Language Pack, I noticed that the file being downloaded was actually labelled as English (United Kingdom) - clearly a file path error by MS.</p>
<p>How can I get the correct English (Canada) Language Pack?</p>
<p>How do I report this problem to MS?</p>

            <p>Interesting. But the "Add language" in Control Panel Language setting offers many more English variants (Note that English (Canada) and English (US)&nbsp;are grayed out as having been already installed, but English (UK) is shown as an available option still to
 download.)</p>

            <p>I am having exactly the same problem on Windows 10 Pro - 64. Spent HOURS on chat with Microsoft "support" without any results. Just like David, the display language in Region/Administrative/Copy/Current User shows "English (United Kingdom)". I somehow did
 manage to get my Input Language to show as "English (Canada) - US" - this after 3 or 4 Microsoft reps kept changing things on my system. I also observed that the UK Language pack was installed automatically when I switched from US to Canada (because I wanted
 to get Cortana to be localized to Canada).</p>
<p>Interestingly the installed Languages ONLY show "English (Canada)"</p>
<p>I also tried to upgrade a Windows 8.1 system to Windows 10 and the "English (UK)" was installed on that system as well. (I rolled back to Windows 8.1)</p>

<h2>            Outlook slow over RDP</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>We use Outlook in our Company Office. When I connect from home with<br />
RDP and use Outlook 2013 for creating mails it is EXTREMELY slow to enter text.</p>
<p>You hit a key and the delay is over a second to see the character. This<br />
is frustrating. Why? Can it be fixed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(And please don't suggest using a local mail client at home. That is not an option.)</p>

            <p>While in a Remote Desktop session you execute your commands on the RD host. Keyboard processing speed is the same as if you were sitting in front of the host. It is what I have seen with countless RD sessions, regardless of the application. When delays occur
 it is invariably due to the transmission of screen data, e.g. with high-res pictures.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can think of two scenarios that would cause your problem. Both imply that you use Remote Desktop over a VPN;</p>
<ul>
<li>You launch Outlook on your home machine and get it to open a .PST file that is located on the RD host.</li><li>You launch Outlook on the RD host and get it to open a .PST file that is located on the home machine.</li></ul>

<h2>            Windows 7 Blue Screen Of Death Loop, Cannot log onto my Primary Hard Drive, Help needed please</h2>
                    Hi, <br />
<br />
I have the Blue screen of death problem after my system starts up, just before <a href="http://windows7news.com/forum/windows-7-troubleshooting/blue-screen-of-death-loop-on-windows-7/msg6485/#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
windows</a> loads up it occurs and the instantly restarts before i have a chance to read it, and then loops until i manually hold the power button down on my computer.<br />
<br />
I have tried repairing windows, and i have done a windows error check but they find no problems.
<br />
<br />
I have also tried using the Windows 7 disk to repair but it still finds nothing wrong.<br />
<br />
I am lucky i have 2 <a href="http://windows7news.com/forum/windows-7-troubleshooting/blue-screen-of-death-loop-on-windows-7/msg6485/#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
hard drives</a> as i am on my second drive at the moment, my primary drive has the problem and i cant even get into it as a result of the Blue Screen<br />
<br />
Any Help would be appreciated, Just to let you know i am not the best at computing
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwindows7news.com%2fforum%2fSmileys%2fdefault%2ftongue.gif" /> so further explanations may be needed

<br />
- I have just found what i think to be the error message:<br />
Bugcheck 74 Parameters = 0x2, 0xfffff88003d42b20, 0x2, 0xffffffffc000009a <br />
Registry is corrupt <br />

<p>Hey Daniel Humphry,</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Answers.</p>
<p>What changes have you done on your computer that could have resulted to Blue Screen of Death (BSOD)?</p>
<p>Please check if you can login to safe mode. This will help in determining if device drivers are causing Windows boot failures.</p>
<p><strong>Start your computer in safe mode<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Case 1: You are able to login to safe mode.</strong></p>
<p>In such case, it is highly possible that a device driver is causing this problem.</p>
<p>Go to device manager to disable device drivers.<br />
1.&nbsp;Go to start and type device manager.<br />
2.&nbsp;Select device manager from the control panel list.<br />
3.&nbsp;To disable a driver, right-click on the device and select properties. Go to driver tab and select disable.<br />
<br />
<strong>Disable the following devices (if present).<br />
</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Video Cards<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Sound Card&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Network Card&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. USB Devices and controller (Please don’t do this if you are using USB keyboard or Mouse or Wireless Keyboard or mouse)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e. CD and DVD&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f. Modems<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; g. Ports (serial and parallel)<br />
&nbsp;<br />
4.&nbsp;Reboot the computer into normal mode.<br />
5.&nbsp;If the computer successfully boots into normal mode, re-enable half of the device drivers that were disabled and reboot.<br />
6.&nbsp;Continue rebooting and re-enabling successively more devices until Windows no longer boots normally.<br />
7.&nbsp; One of the device drivers in the most recently re-enabled group of drivers is causing the problem.<br />
8.&nbsp;Boot to safe mode to remove the device driver for the particular device.<br />
<br />
9.&nbsp;To remove a device driver:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Go to device manager by following the steps 1 and 2.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. To remove a device driver, right-click on the device, select properties, go to driver tab and click uninstall.</p>
<p>Once this is done, you can boot to normal mode and check the driver for the device from the manufacturer’s website that is compatible with Windows 7.</p>
<p><strong>Case 2: You cannot boot to safe mode.</strong></p>
<p>The only option left here is to use to recovery tools to fix the no boot situation.<br />
<br />
<strong>Open system recovery options:<br />
</strong><br />
1.&nbsp;Remove all floppy disks, CDs, and DVDs from your computer, and then restart your computer using the computer's power button.
<br />
2.&nbsp;Do one of the following:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;If your computer has a single operating system installed, press and hold the F8 key as your computer restarts. You need to press F8 before the Windows logo appears. If the Windows logo appears, you need to try again by waiting until the Windows logon
 prompt appears, and then shutting down and restarting your computer.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;If your computer has more than one operating system, use the arrow keys to highlight the operating system you want to repair, and then press and hold F8.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;On the Advanced Boot Options screen, use the arrow keys to highlight Repair your computer, and then press Enter. (If Repair your computer isn't listed as an option, then your computer doesn't include preinstalled recovery options, or your network administrator
 has turned them off.)<br />
4.&nbsp;Select a keyboard layout, and then click Next.<br />
5.&nbsp;On the System Recovery Options menu, click a system restore tool to open it since startup repair couldn’t fix the issue.<br />
<br />
Detailed information on the recovery tools:<br />
<br />
<strong>What are the system recovery options in Windows 7?<br />

<p>Hi Howard112,</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Windows Vista Community site.</p>
<p>I would suggest you to create a password reset disk by following the instructions mentioned in the Microsoft Support KB Article: How to create and use a password reset disk in Windows Vista</p>
<p>(<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/930381" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/930381</a> )</p>
<p><strong>1. If I create and then use a password reset disk per the directions given, will I loose access to my encrypted files?</strong></p>
<p>If you reset your password using a password reset disk, there are no risks. If you use an administrator account to reset a password for another user, that user will lose access to their encrypted files, encrypted
 e‑mail messages, and stored passwords for websites or network resources. If the user doesn't have any of these things, or doesn't mind losing them, then using an administrator account to reset a password is a fast and easy way to recover from a forgotten password.</p>
<p>Reference Windows Help &amp; How-to Link:
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-GB/windows7/What-are-the-risks-of-resetting-a-password" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-GB/windows7/What-are-the-risks-of-resetting-a-password</a></p>
<p><strong>2. How is this better than just writing the password on a piece of paper and storing it in the place where I would have stored the password reset disk?</strong></p>
<p>There are a lot of advantages by using a password reset disk, with instances of losing the written document, privacy and security, secrecy. By using a password reset disk, you can avoid losing access to the
 files and to the information on your computer.</p>
<p>You can reset it using a password reset disk for your user account (or the password reset information stored on a USB flash drive).</p>
<p><strong>3. Do I need to create a new disk if I change my password?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, you need to create a fresh password reset disk when you change your password.</p>

<p>Hope this is helpful.</p>

    <title>SSD Drive not being recognized - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> praiselinny  say:</h3>
<h2>            SSD Drive not being recognized</h2>
                    <p>Hello. I recently reinstalled Windows after my laptop completely stopped working correctly (got the Automatic Repair loop and accidentally messed up Windows). Anyways, I got my laptop fixed and reinstalled Windows, but the only drive being recognized is
 my HDD (as the C: drive) and isn't recognizing my SSD drive (should be the D: drive).
</p>
<p>I looked up stuff online and most people said to check out Disk Management and my SSD drive is being recognized on there. It's being recognized as Disk 0 while my HDD is being recognized as Disk. In the bottom panel, tt says my SSD (Disk 0) has 1863 GB of
 unallocated memory and it says it's online. However, the only things showing up in the upper panel are the C: and System Reserve.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not quite sure how to get my laptop to recognize the D: drive (SSD). Also, many people online said to convert (?) the SSD to NTFS, but when I right-click the SSD in the bottom panel the only options I get is "Convert to Dynamic Disk" or "Convert to GPT
 Disk."</p>
<p>How would I go about getting my laptop to recognize the SSD? I mean, I could live with 118 GB on my HDD, but it kinda hurts me a little bit inside. I love games too much.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated! Also, if you need any more info, please let me know! Thanks :D<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/efe31800-e4c8-48e0-9e4f-e23f7ee00112?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/efe31800-e4c8-48e0-9e4f-e23f7ee00112?upload=true" /></a></p>

            Hi praiselinny 
<br />
<br />Right click that 'unallocated' space on your SSD rather than the tab at the left, do you get 'New - Simple Volume'
<br />
<br />If so, that is the option to choose, accept the default size, make sure the file system is NTFS and accept the Default Drive letter. Once that is done, you should have full access to that drive . . .       
        </p>

            Oh wow, it was right under my nose! Thanks so much for the quick response! My drive is perfectly fine and is showing up with all the space. Thank you for your help! :D

            When we do this solution, does this reformat the drive that we're currently trying to access? Or would it access the files that were previously in it?
