<p><span>Hi big pain,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a. Were you able to watch videos on CBS site earlier?
</span></p>
<p><span>b. Since when have you had this issue?
</span></p>
<p><span>c. Do you have any issues when viewing videos on other websites? Do you get the same error message on the other websites?</span></p>
<p><span>d. What are the troubleshooting steps that you’ve already performed?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you have any ad blocker (add-on) installed on Internet Explorer, you may try and disable that and check if the videos play fine without any issues.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To disable ad blocker,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Open Internet Explorer.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click
<strong>Tools, </strong>and select <strong>Manage Add-ons</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Disable any ad blocker from the available add-ons that you have installed.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps. Let us know if you need further assistance.</span></p>

<h2>            Splitting a table into separate cells</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone, I am attempting to create a drinking game involving cards to give to my sister on her birthday. I have completed all the cards (roughly 250) in word and sent them to the printing company. They are currently arranged in 2x2 tables, one table
 per page (4 cards per page). The printing company has asked for me to arrange them 1 card per page, but i cannot seem to unlink the tables so I can manipulate each cell individually and simply place each card on its own page. I have tried the "split cells"
 and the "split table" functions to no avail (unless i am using them incorrectly).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e5c00cb8-346c-4841-8919-2ee25374388c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e5c00cb8-346c-4841-8919-2ee25374388c?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Basically i want to take this page and make it into 4 pages with one cell per page. I would much prefer that then having to re-do 250 cards. I also have all the information in an excel sheet if i can find a way to make one cell per page using that.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is greatly appreciated! Thanks.</p>

<p>I am not sure if it will work on a Mac, but assuming that you have a separate table on each page, running a macro containing the following code would split each table into the four separate tables, one to a page.</p>

<h2>            Migrating from Mobile 6.x to Windows Phone 7</h2>
                    
<p>I recently bought 2 HTC HD7 with Windows Phone 7 (one for me and the other for my wife).</p>
<p>Being a Windows Mobile 6.1 user, I thought that I would just install MyPhone on the new phone, download my contacts, messages and etc and I would&nbsp;be god to go.</p>
<p>Unfortunately&nbsp;I realized that MyPhone is not available on Windows Phone 7.</p>
<p>Does anyone know when it will be available for WP7?</p>
<p>Are there any other ways to transfer content from my old 6.1 phone to the new 7?</p>
<p>I'll be glad for any help!</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

            I very much appreciate your reply but I think there is a slight misunderstanding. This user has actually never created a Hotmail or Outlook.com account. The hacker who hacked into her British Telecom account has created a Hotmail account with the first
 part of the E-mail address before the @ sign identical to her British Telecom address and using Hotmail as platform to pose in her place and try to scam people for money in regard to recent Philippine natural disaster. My colleague wanted to know if Microsoft
 could assist her to diactivate the accont of the hacker who pretend to be her. Based on the reading I did in the materials your proposed it looks like there is no solution for this type of scenario!!<br />

    <title>Excel opens slowly from File Explorer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lastgas  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel opens slowly from File Explorer</h2>
                    <p>There are other threads on this issue, but none of the answers there have helped me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is that attempting to start Excel from File Explorer by double-clicking on an spreadsheet is very slow, while just starting Excel from the Start Screen is fast, and opening a file from inside Excel is fast, and opening a file from File Explorer
 if Excel is already running is also fast.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some details:</p>
<ul>
<li>This happens with all Excel files (both xls and xlsx) including very simple ones</li><li>Windows 10</li><li>Superfetch is running</li><li>Other office files (e.g.) Word do not have this problem</li><li>I tried the registry Excel command line fix (changing /dde to "1%") with no improvement</li><li>Not &nbsp;all of my computers have the problem (see list)</li></ul>
<p>Computers with problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tablet. Came with Windows 8.1 and Office 2013. Upgraded to Windows 10</li><li>Tablet. Came with Windows 8.1. Installed Office 2010 and upgraded to Office 365, upgraded to Windows 10</li><li>Desktop. Came with Windows 8.1. Installed Office 365. Upgraded to Windows 10</li><li>Laptop. Came with Windows Vista, upgraded to Windows 7, Upgraded to Windows 8.1, Upgraded to Windows 10. Currently has Office 2007.</li></ul>
<p>The following systems do not have the problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>Desktop. Came with Windows 7. Installed Office 2010, upgraded to Office 365. Upgraded to Windows 10</li><li>Laptop. Came with Windows 7. Installed Office 2010, upgraded to Office 365. Upgraded to Windows 10</li></ul>
<p>I can see that the systems upgraded directly from Windows 7 to 10 don't have a problem, while those that arrived at Windows 10 via Windows 8.1 do. I also looked at the registry entries for Office on the various machines and they vary markedly. On one of
 the filing sysems, I used Procmon to watch the startup process (like 8,000 entries) and one thing I noticed is that it kept trying to open registry keys under HKCU\Software\Classes, which does not exist in that registry (although it does on another machine).</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I also observed from Procmon is that an Excel process is very slow to start. Once the Excel process shows up, it opens quickly. That is, the problem is NOT in Excel, but rather in whatever chain of events starts it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last time I saw a problem like this was very many years ago and it was caused by programs from multiple versions of Office on the same machine; however, at least one of the failing machines has never had another version of office.</p>

            1. You may login to Windows with a new user profile and see if it helps.<br />
<br />
2. Review the following thread - http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-excel/cannot-open-some-office-files-after-upgrading-from/c103ee49-2e87-4421-ad96-f433ec77ec54<br />

3. Zorvek (http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-excel/windows-10-and-microsoft-excel-2013/f886877d-b486-4d57-bd61-73e30b7ded81) has given following solution which you can try -<br />
Windows 10 is causing some issues with Office/Excel. Some of the issues are resolved by disabling a new function of the .net installation that comes with Windows 10 and Visual Studio 2015. This feature can be disabled with a registry entry.<br />
To create the entry, run PowerShell with administrator privileges (open the Start menu, enter PowerShell in find box, right-click on PowerShell and select ""Run as administrator"". Enter the following command to add the registry entry:<br />
Set-ItemProperty -Path HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\.NETFramework -Name useLegacyJit -Type DWord -Value 1<br />
You can copy the above line and paste it into PowerShell by clicking on the top left part of the PowerShell window title bar and selecting Edit-&gt;Paste. Press ENTER to run the command.<br />
<br />
4. Read the response of Try*3 &nbsp;(http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2007-excel/windows-10-excel-files-changed-to-read-only/cba3c358-21b5-472d-b5e2-f690f1b0a49b). He has provided a link which also has solutions for problems.<br />
<br />
5. If above don't, re-installation of office may solve your problem. Make sure that you have license keys ready before you attempt re-installation.<br />

            <p>I did try creating another user, and I found that the new user could open Excel files quickly. Still this probably isn't a solution for me because of the difficulty in switching users, plus there is no assurance that after I had the new user configured,
 it wouldn't slow down again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So back under my normal user, I tried starting Excel from cmd.exe followed by a file name argument. That opened very fast, as did adding the /dde switch to the command line.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a whim I tried starting with OneDrive not running. That resulted in an open three times slower than the slowest seen so far! Restarting OneDrive returned the open time to the usual slow value. Note that the file being opened is in c:\temp, not something
 that OneDrive should care about.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran Procmon64 parallel on the two machines where one was fast and one was slow. I couldn't tell much difference in their registry accesses and the command lines they fetched from the registry. All I could tell was that on one machine stuff related to .xlsx
 and Excel.exe just stopped happening for a few seconds multiple times in the process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The machine that opens Excel quickly is the older machine, the one that has had tons of software installed on it over the years, and was upgraded from Windows 7. The machine that opens Excel slow is hugely faster, has many times more RAM and not much software
 installed on it.</p>

<h2>            Mail merge - how do I print blank fields&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am using Word Starter 2010 to produce labels that I stick on to my Christmas card envelopes. Some records have full addresses, some just a name(for those delivered by hand).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, if I have, on the first line of the address block, Title, space, First Name, space, Last Name, second line contains Address Line 1, third line Address Line 2, then the details appear as one would expect. However, because I am a pedant, for those records
 with just a name that I populate into Address Line 2 in the address database, and the other fields in the same record(Title, First Name, Last Name) are blank, how do I get Address Line 2 to print as the third line still, instead of, as happens, on the first
 line.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to always print Address Line 2 as the third line of the block, even if the preceding lines contain blanks because mail merge seems to ignore &nbsp;completely blank lines.</p>

<p>Use the following field construction, using CTRL+F9 to insert each pair of field delimiters { } and pressing the ENTER key where the ¶ are located</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c1d83e7c-b038-4344-ad36-07233879a834?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c1d83e7c-b038-4344-ad36-07233879a834?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Note carefully that there are some quotation marks outside the { MERGEFIELD "field name" } fields and you must not omit them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you have the field construction looking exactly as it does above, press ALT+F9 to toggle off the display of the field codes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You wlll probably find it easier to set this up in a normal document and then copy and paste the field construction into your Envelope mail merge document.</p>

<p>That's only because you have Word's default 'suppress blank lines' activated for mailmerges. You can deactivate that via the Mailmerge Helper, if you add that to Word's QAT.</p>

<p>Thanks for the quick reponse. I have had the settings re-sent from my service provider abd the phone has identified my wireless broadband but wont connect. Any ideas why the phone would just reset itself for no reason? I was on the internet (via the wireless
 broadband at the time) and then it just disconnected from the internet and everything had gone. It has even deleted games that came as a default with the phone.</p>

<br />
and read this<br />
<br />
With regard to your enquiry, kindly be informed that to connect to a WLAN select Menu &gt; Settings &gt;Connectivity &gt; WLAN. Search for available wireless local area networks by selecting Search WLANs, choose the network you want to use from the list and select Connect.<br />
<br />
You can update the WLAN list by selecting Options &gt; Refresh list.<br />
Hidden WLANs do not broadcast their service set identifier (SSID) and they are marked as (Hidden network) in the list of available WLANs. You can only connect to a hidden network if you know its SSID.<br />
<br />
Depending on the WLAN access point security settings your device may first ask you to Enter network SSID and then Enter key. SSID and key are case sensitive.<br />
After successful connection to new WLAN, your device asks do you want to Save network for future use? Choose Yes if you want to add the WLAN to Saved WLANs list. You can also save connection later by selecting Options &gt; Save.<br />
When you save a hidden network, the SSID is shown on the list of available WLANs. You can change the name shown on the list of available WLANs by editing the Network name as described below.<br />
<br />
Select Menu &gt; Settings &gt;Connectivity &gt; WLAN &gt; Saved WLANs to see saved WLANs. Choose the WLAN from the list and select Options to manage, connect to and prioritize it:<br />
Connect — Connect to the WLAN manually.<br />
Remove from list — Remove the WLAN.<br />
Organize priority — Change the priorities of saved WLANs. The WLAN with the highest priority is listed first.<br />
Forward settings —Forward the settings of a saved WLAN. Enter the security code, phone number and select Send.<br />
Add new network —add a new WLAN and define the settings.<br />
<br />
If you want to edit WLAN parameters, choose the WLAN from the list and select Edit:<br />
Connection method — Ask first or Automatic to connect to available WLAN automatically.<br />
Network name — enter a name for the WLAN. The name doesn’t have to be the same as SSID.<br />
Network settings — define the WLAN settings:<br />
SSID – Edit the SSID of the WLAN.<br />
Security type – Select same security type which is used by your WLAN access point. Supported options are None, WEP, WPA-PSK and WPA2-PSK.<br />
Password – Edit the password (key) of your WLAN.<br />
Broadcast SSID – Select whether your WLAN SSID is broadcasted or not (hidden).<br />
Wireless handovers – Select are wireless handovers allowed or not.<br />
<br />
To disconnect the WLAN select Menu &gt; Settings &gt;Connectivity &gt; WLAN &gt; Search WLANs, choose the active connection and select Disonn.<br />
<br />
To modify Internet connection settings select Menu &gt; Settings &gt;Connectivity &gt; WLAN &gt; Internet connection &gt; Ask first or Do not ask.<br />
If you select Ask first, you are asked for the connection method every time you open an application which requires an Internet connection, such as Browser or Mail.<br />
If you select Do not ask, the device connects automatically to a saved WLAN if available, if saved WLAN isn’t available, GPRS is being used.<br />
<br />
Tip: To avoid unauthorized connections to your WLAN, it’s recommend that you will enable the security settings of your WLAN access point according to instructions of the manufacturer.<br />
<br />
Kindly be informed that the Nokia C3-00 has the following WLAN specs:<br />
<br />
WLAN Type: 802.11 b/g.<br />
WLAN MAx speed: 54 Mbps.<br />
UPnP : Not Available.<br />

<p>I also have a C3-00 that reset by itself just yesterday. I had a second prepaid sim card from different provider which I swapped in the phone. When I turned the phone back on everything was back to factory setting. My contacts, pictures, and messages were
 gone. Even the calculator. I tried to restore the factory settings, as what was adviced in some forums, but it didn't do anything to help me with the data that I've lost. This model is really frustrating. About two weeks before, I couldn't pull up my contact
 list. Whether I would use the hotkey, or the down button, or go through the menu. All I keep getting is the 'operation failed' error. Anyway, has a solution been given for the phone resetting by itself? Is it just a simple upgrade that's needed or is this
 model indeed a bust?</p>

<p><span><span>Hey Badolton,</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Here are some steps to take to troubleshoot both Internet Explorer and the installation of Adobe Flash Player:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If Internet Explorer is sluggish or crashes:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>This is usually caused by an add-on that is enabled but isn’t fully compatible with the version of Internet Explorer you are using (follow instructions

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If your Internet Explorer doesn’t play flash correctly:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Download and use (right click and Run as Administrator) the</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><a href="http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/141/tn_14157.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Uninstall

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If when you reinstall Adobe Flash Player it still doesn’t work in Internet Explorer:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Use the uninstall tool again</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Restart your computer</span></span></p>

    <title>Access SQL coding for IBM MOD 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bethp4150  say:</h3>
<h2>            Access SQL coding for IBM MOD 10</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to automatically generate a number where the first 10 digits are incremental and the 11th digit is calculated by the IBM Mod 10 formula.</p>
<p>
<span>
<span>
</span></p><p>The algorithm for calculating the "Mod-10" check digit is as follows: Note that, when counting the "position" of the digits,
</p>

<p><strong><span>IBM</span></strong></p>
<strong><span>
<p>counts the digit positions starting at the rightmost (units) position and counting right-to-left.
</p>
</span></strong><span>
<p>

</p><p><span>Also note that the positions to be counted DO NOT include the check digit</span></p>
<span>
<span>
<p>position itself</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Test number: 1006371953x where "x" is the check-digit to be calculated</p>
</span><strong><span>
<p>IBM Check Digit Calculation</p>
</span></strong><span>
<p>In this number, the IBM digits are: 1</p>
</span>
<p><span><span>st
</span></span><span>position: 3</span></p>
<span>
<span>
<p>2</p>
</span>
<p><span><span>nd
</span></span><span>position: 5</span></p>
<span>
<span>
<p>3</p>
</span>
<p><span><span>rd
</span></span><span>position: 9</span></p>
<span>
<span>
<p>. . .</p>
<p>9</p>
</span>
<p><span><span>th
</span></span><span>position: 0</span></p>
<span>
<span>
<p>10</p>
</span>
<p><span><span>th
</span></span><span>position: 1</span></p>
<span>
<span>
<p>For the process, add all of the even-position digits together. For the odd-position digits, multiply</p>
<p>each by 2, then add the DIGITS of the result together (not the VALUE of the x2 calculation).</p>
<p>Add the result of the odd-position digits to the result of the even-position digits. Find the next</p>
<p>multiple of 10 higher than this result, and subtract the result from that figure. The difference is</p>
<p>the check digit.</p>
<p>For the above example, this calculates a check digit of:</p>

<p><span>Hello
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Skype Community forum</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Can you confirm if what you mean is that, whenever you click on the compact view, instead of it being on the compact view where the contacts tab are separated from your messaging
 window it just goes to the full size?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If it is on a full size but separated already from your contacts tab, then you have already set your Skype into compact view, you just have to re-size your window by dragging
 from the corner and re-sizing it down.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this information helps but feel free to reply for any further question and clarification.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3> timklein  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to Deactivate Installation on Office 365 Home Account</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to deactivate 1 of my installations from the Office 365 My Account page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hit "Deactivate" and I get a popup window asking me to confirm that I really want to deactivate this installation. I select "deactivate" to continue but nothing happens. The popup goes away but this computer continues to take-up one of my 5 allowed installs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been through answer desk chat, had them call, was then forwarded to a series of different places (Office support, Office Commercial support by mistake, Office Home support, and even Office Mac support because I happened to mention that I attempted to
 access the webpage from a mac at one point to see if a different browser might help).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I doubt anyone here can help me, but can someone direct me to who the heck actually has access to my account info so that I can contact them and have one of my installs removed? Microsoft's support has become absolutely atrocious. This simple problem shouldn't
 take more than 5 minutes to resolve but I've now spend more than 2 1/2 hours dealing with all of these "Customer Support" people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>I am having exactly the same problem with Office 365 University. I just cannot deactivate one of the installs, no matter what I do. Microsoft support keeps redirected to other departments (accounting, for example) which know nothing of the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>InPrivate browsing does not help either. I need to make a presentation tomorrow and this is getting very frustrating. Microsoft should pay us for the work we do to make their software work as it is supposed to.</p>

            <p>I'm having the complete opposite problem.&nbsp; My 365 Office will not stay installed!! 6 times I have reloaded it and I am failing my classes because Microsoft plays the transfer game.&nbsp; They make you explain over and over what the issue is and transfer you without
 any notes to the account.&nbsp; I'm sorry but when you have called over 15 times, there should be notes on an account.&nbsp; They have this sh*^$%*&nbsp;oh, well- we are the only game in town so F you.&nbsp; I have tried the super, sticky, sugary sweet approach-OH thank you,
 thank you, you are the best ****-in hopes that someone, anyone gives a flying F about customer service! Or even hope someone has one shred of HUMAN COMPASSION-when someone is literally losing their mind and-&nbsp;is just on the verge of graduating or FLUNKING OUT
 and click...they hang up on you!!!&nbsp; I hope all those outsourced-$1.00 an hour jack offs BURN IN HELL.</p>

<p>
</p><p>You have discovered that the "Free support" is worth precisely what you paid for it, NADA!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry, I don't have any specific suggestions for any of your problems.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have a few generic suggestions for you to try.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader1">****************</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As so as you reach someone, ask them for a ticket number. That forces them to start logging your problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p class="contentHeader1">***************</p>
<p>
</p><p>DON'T use "phone support".&nbsp; Personally, I have found that the online chat support is slightly less frustrating.</p>
<div>
</strong><a href="http://answerdesk.microsoftstore.com/AnswerTech" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://answerdesk.microsoftstore.com/AnswerTech</strong></a><strong>
</strong></p>
<p>I recently used online chat support myself. I found it had several advantages over phone support, even though you still contact the same outsourced, support personnel:</p>
<ul>
<li>No ESL accent issues</li><li>Provides instant time stamped transcript</li><li>When you get transferred to the “right” person, they can review the history</li><li>If they don’t read history, you can copy / paste the past conversation to them, saving you having to repeat yourself</li><li>They are more likely to go off line to ask other people for help (good for you)</li><li>You don’t have to listen to “elevator muzak” when they are off line</li><li>You have 2 hands free to surf the web when they are not talking to you. </li></ul>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>For some reason, I found that waiting for online chat responses intrinsically <strong>
LESS</strong><span>&nbsp; </span>frustrating than listening to elevator muzak. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure to copy the text from the chat window and save it before closing the chat window. It is handy to have a timestamped copy of the conversation, if only to publish it on the internet ... &lt;evil grin&gt;</p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p class="contentHeader1">***********************</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Once you get your ticket number, immediately start asking to be transferred to a "supervisor".&nbsp; The front line support people are (barely) Ok for simple, common, repetitive problems.&nbsp; The problem the 3 of you have described are neither simple or common.&nbsp;
 Since your problem does not appear on their checklist, the "script monkeys" won't be able to help you .&nbsp; But they will insist on uselessly running your though the script, just to CYA.

<p>As an alternate approach, “<em>get a bigger stick</em>”. As single individuals we are pretty powerless. But there are various “media personalities” that can help ie radio/TV/Newspaper/Internet “ombudsmen”. They have large audiences and companies want to
 avoid bad press. When a well-known (loud mouth) media personality exposes bad customer service it can have a big, negative, long term effect on the company. So it is easier and cheaper, and better PR, to simply give the customer anything to get them to go
 away.</p>
<p>So, try to get one or more “reporters” to help you. </p>

            <p>Hi Paul </p>
<p>You are so correct. I have been trying for 5 days to get it straightened out. My computer shut down ,recycled it twice and tried to reinstall countless times. If you can reinstall another program, office should follow suite. Omni Tech support sucks, Microsoft
 partner. They kept trying to get me to pay for program again. $300 is hard for a broke student to find for a product already purchased. Omni Techs techs installed a program trying to fix the problem. Went thru3 techs and 2 supervisors trying to fix the problem,and
 to get the program they installed back off. They didn't remove the program they installed for nothing,wasted my time,and make Microsoft look like they don't care at all about the products they sale. Omni techs techs # 30,11,242 should be fired. If you have
 to con people out of there money for a product that is suppose to last 4 years,you should not be allowed to do business in any country. Microsoft get your parnters in check. They are screwing your clients bad. If you want to keep selling products and services,you
 need to provide what your selling. Its called false advertisement, and you can be sued.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, I wasn't even able to get them to start a ticket. Each Customer Service "area" insists that can only be done by "another" service area. Since I was working at my desk and had a speakerphone, I went ahead and worked through this "process" for
 over 6 hours this past weekend. The best answer I got was to cancel my service... of course, they suggested I cancel and then re-subscribe using a different email address... Lovely!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ended up in a continuous loop of service. First at "Technical Service", then to "Office 365 Service", then on to "Account Services". None of them actually have the ability to do anything except walk through their script, then when they can't find the solution,
 they forwarded me to the next department.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since my problem is universal; i.e. It happens on every browser (Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome &amp; Safari) and I've tried it on Mac OSX, Windows 7, Windows 8 &amp; Windows 8.1, I even let them forward me through their "Mac Service" at one point but ended
 up back in the same loop eventually. I let them access my system and try it themselves on one of the Windows machines, but the loop remained unbroken. They just forwarded me on to the next person in the chain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I asked to speak to supervisors but was never actually given to another person. The tech I was talking to would just put me on hold then come back to me with "what the supervisor said". I asked to have a ticket started but was told that since it wasn't "their
 service issue" they couldn't start one though they'd gladly forward me to the "right" area where a ticket could be started. I cycled through this loop at least 3 times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple of the interesting things I discovered along the way were that, according to each of the 3 areas, nobody at Microsoft Support has access to my account to make changes to it. I kept trying to get someone to delete the license for me and while they
 were each able to see how many licenses I had (and one of the areas could see which machine types/OS's they were), each area told me that only I can do it from the Office 365 account website. I find this highly doubtful; I'd imagine someone could easily access
 my account and kill it if I didn't pay my bill...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other thing I discovered is that notes don't pass from one service area to the next. I was able to get one service area to 3 way with me on the call with the next area, but once I moved to that next tech, the notes started over. None of the techs was
 aware that I'd already been through them and the next service area that they were about to forward me through.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One other interesting note that one of the techs gave me was a way to work around the 5 license limit. I suspect his info was erroneous (I haven't bothered to try it yet), but I found that especially troubling and shady. This whole problem started because
 I need to use my 5th license on a new laptop I bought, but I wasn't able to delete the license from the one that **** out on me. I paid for 5 licenses but am only able to use 4.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, the level of condescension from these incompetent **** is what finally settled me on my final course of action (I've switched office suites on all but one of the computers so far but that one will go soon and I'll be canceling my subscription).
 To watch one of their techs working on my machine doing EXACTLY what I'd been doing (after they'd basically told me I didn't know what I was doing, or in one case, I wasn't on the right website) was hilarious. When it finally dawned on them that it was the
 Microsoft account that had the problem... not me, not ALL of my computers, not the browser I was using, not my web connection, etc., well, that was priceless. One even tried to still tell me it was something on my system so I took back control and deleted
 one of the other licenses for him then reinitiated it... and yet, he still swore it was me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wouldn't waste my time with Microsoft Support, Answerdesk, phone support or anything else... they're not ever going to be able to solve your problem. Cancel your account and find somebody who provides a quality product and can support their customers.</p>

            <p>Ouch.&nbsp; That is one of the worse bad service tales I've seen.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately you got stuck with even more incompetent support than "usual".&nbsp; "Normally" asking to be transferred to a supervisor works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other people have confirmed that the "front line support" aka "script monkeys" do NOT have access to account information. That is why you have to keep insisting on reaching a 'supervisor', not another script monkey.&nbsp; SOME, not all, of the "supervisors" have
 the authority to cancel product keys and to issue you a new key. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately since you couldn't get anyone to start a trouble ticket it is no surprise there was no information being passed between support people. It is a real failure of MS support.&nbsp; The other suggestion I've given people is to use the 'online chat'
 / aka "answerdesk" support point of contact.&nbsp; I used the online chat once and found I preferred it to phone support. Here is a summary of the reasons I preferred it:</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<strong><span>Online chat</span> support: </strong><a href="http://answerdesk.microsoftstore.com/AnswerTech" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://answerdesk.microsoftstore.com/AnswerTech</strong></a><strong>
</strong>
<p>I recently used online chat support myself. I found it had several advantages over phone support, even though you still contact the same outsourced, support personnel:</p>
<ul>
<li>No ESL accent issues</li><li>Provides instant time stamped transcript</li><li>When you get transferred to the “right” person, they can review the history</li><li>If they don’t read history, you can copy / paste the past conversation to them, saving you having to repeat yourself</li><li>They are more likely to go off line to ask other people for help (good for you)</li><li>You don’t have to listen to “elevator muzak” when they are off line</li><li>You have 2 hands free to surf the web when they are not talking to you. </li></ul>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>For some reason, I found that waiting for online chat responses intrinsically <strong>
LESS</strong><span>&nbsp; </span>frustrating than listening to elevator muzak. </p>
<p>Make sure to copy the text from the chat window and save it before closing the chat window. It is handy to have a timestamped copy of the conversation, if only to publish it on the internet ... &lt;evil grin&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I understand why you are fed up with the non support you "got" (or didn't get).&nbsp; It is a common story for a small percentage of Office 365 users (or former users).

            <p>Thanks for the follow up. I actually read your reply to this effect in another thread before I tried to resolve the issue the first time and used Answerdesk on that first attempt to resolve my problem. I agree with your comments about some of the benefits
 (especially the one about the hold muzac... My wife actually walked in and slammed my office door at one point in my phone fiasco. She screamed something about it driving her crazy and that she was going to wring MY neck if she had to keep listening to it).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, the answers were no better there and I was transferred around to essentially the same groups. I didn't take it nearly as far that time; ending the call as I was about to begin my second cycle through the 3 circles of Microsoft Support he||.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One other thing I didn't mention was that in addition to asking for a supervisor on both methods, I asked the phone support several times about the escalation process. Normally, companies have some sort of next level technical support that an issue can be
 forwarded to when the first level is unable to solve a problem. I was told each time that there is no such thing with Microsoft's Support. This also seems dubious to me. I just can't believe there isn't some group somewhere that deals with difficult issues.
 It seemed to me that all these people cared about was getting the issue off their plate. I got the distinct feeling that each and every one of them closed their communication with me as a successful resolution in their system despite the fact that all they
 ever did was forward me to someone else. I suspect they are carefully monitored for successful resolution of problems and that their only goal is to get to the point where they can falsely claim that they achieved that. With the exception of 2 or maybe 3 of
 the 20 or so people I talked to, none of them seemed to have any care whatsoever about whether my problem was actually solved. It was just a matter of getting their script through to completion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a sad state of affairs at Microsoft Support. It's gotten to the point where they're at the same level as the support you get from places like Comcast or CenturyLink (both of whom I recently read were near the bottom of the rankings for customer satisfaction).
 I've also had to deal with both of them lately, and I can't believe I'm saying this, I think Comcast was actually quite a bit better than Microsoft (CenturyLink is still worse though... at least Microsoft never hung up on me multiple times). It never used
 to be like that.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I am really sorry that you still haven't resolved your problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There definitely is an escalation process, because many other people have reported being able to take advantage of it. That is, persistently asking to speak to a supervisor eventually (it may take hours &lt;SIGH!&gt; ) to be transferred to a second level of support
 that is more technically proficient and has more authority to get deeper into the MS systems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are still game here are a couple more options you can try:</p>

<strong>Get a “Bigger Stick” working for you – The Media</strong>

<p>As I’ve chronicled in recent weeks, my <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/228602/surviving_a_pc_meltdown_syncing_with_sugarsync_restoring_from_mozy.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>two HP desktops died a terrible death</span></a> within two weeks of each other. I learned from perusing various online forums that motherboard failure was to blame, and that the problem affected a large number of HP systems. (In my case, it was a Pegatron
 M2N78-LA motherboard in a Pavilion M9350F and Pavilion S5360F, but I’ve read reports of the same board having the same issue in other models.)</p>
<p>Both systems were out of warranty, meaning my options were limited: I could pay HP $300 per system for repairs, try replacing the motherboards myself, or cut bait and buy new machines. Needless to say, I wasn’t happy with any of these choices.</p>
<p>During my research into the problem, I discovered an HP Web page where you can write a letter to the CEO. So I did. I briefly and politely explained that while I understand hardware failures can happen, the loss of two HP desktops in two weeks was enough
 to keep me from ever buying another HP system. I didn’t threaten, I didn’t accuse, I didn’t make demands, and I didn’t resort to name-calling or foul language (much as I might have wanted to). I simply expressed my frustration and clicked Send, figuring that
 was the end of that.</p>
<p>The next day, I received a phone call from a member of HP’s “escalation” team, who apologized for the problems and turned me over to a case manager. Long story short: HP offered to repair both machines at their expense, including priority shipping to and
 from the repair depot. Knock me over with a feather!</p>
<p>Some friends have suggested that the recipient of my letter figured out “who I am” (namely, a tech blogger), hence the world-class treatment. I suppose that’s possible, but I find it unlikely that HP staffers have time to Google the name of every person
 who writes in. Rather, the optimist in me wants to believe that even big corporations are willing to do the right thing when it comes to customer service--though sometimes you have to appeal to a “higher power” to make that happen.</p>
<p>My advice to you: If you think you’ve gotten a raw deal on a product or service, and you’re not making any headway through the usual channels, a politely worded letter to the big boss might just do the trick.</p>

<p><strong>2013 03 13- Two free, full-blown alternatives to MS Office - Open Office / Libre Office</strong>
</p>
<p><a href="https://windowssecrets.com/newsletter/two-free-full-blown-alternatives-to-ms-office/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>https://windowssecrets.com/newsletter/two-free-full-blown-alternatives-to-ms-office/</strong></a><strong>

<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>As Microsoft’s Office has grown in size and complexity, more than a few users have wondered whether there’s a viable alternative — especially when it comes time to pay for an upgrade or new copy.</strong></p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt; After using both for a couple weeks, I didn’t notice any major features missing in either. Writer is a capable word processor that does pretty much everything Word can do and more. In fact, we picked Writer as the best word processor for
 Windows. If a word processor is all you really need, then Writer will do everything Word can do and more.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>If you’re new to spreadsheets or just a light user, Calc gets the job done. However, if you’re working in an environment where you’re sharing a lot of macros then you’re best off sticking with Excel. Both of them are easy to get started with, support
 the same file formats, and offer a pretty close selection of features.</p>
<p>….</p>
<p>LibreOffice’s Impress is a perfectly capable program, but if you’re working with people who usually use PowerPoint you might run into some compatibility issues still. If you’re just making presentations for your own purposes, then Impress should
 work for you.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Unlike the rest of the software in the suite, database software is really more about what you and your company use. Base has fantastic integration with MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Thunderbird, whereas Access integrates better with Outlook and Paradox.
 Both manage to do what they need to do well, so which you use really depends on the context you use it in.</p>
<p>….</p>
<p>For the most part, LibreOffice and Microsoft Office have the same suite of software with the exception of one thing: Outlook. LibreOffice doesn’t come packed with an email client, so if you need Outlook or an equivalent, you won’t find it here.
 The rest of the suite is pretty similar.</p>
<p>It’s pretty obvious that if money is tight, LibreOffice is the office suite for you. Even still, if Microsoft Office isn’t actually required at your work (especially with Outlook), LibreOffice has a lot to offer these days. LibreOffice also supports
<a href="http://extensions.libreoffice.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">extensions</a>, which means you can customize the look, features, and feel of the suite to suit your needs. Fortunately, the two office suites usually play nice together, so if you want to give LibreOffice
 a try for a few days you should be able to continue working with documents you’ve already created in Microsoft Office (though as stated above, you may run into a few small issues).</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have the exact same issue as TimKlein. Talked to the support (Sweden) for an hour or so and still no luck. Tried 5 different computers/phones with different browsers and inprivate or not and so on. This CLEARLY CANT be some problem the users have on thier
 machines but the problem lies at microsoft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The support atleast made a ticket about it and said that some with higher knowledge/access would call me. Guess ill have to wait to monday...</p>
<p>
</p><p>A tip though in the meantime you can use. Work with the online office. Atleast you can look at your files and such with it. Ill have to do that on monday when i have a presentaion and no office :)</p>

                    <p>B4 adding IE9 I could visit different sites which automatically created multiple tabs. Whenever I wanted to go to another open tab I clicked on it and there I was. Well, I can still do that when browsing but now when I close one tab they all close. B4 IE9
 only the selected tab closed. What happened? How do I stop this annoying event?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Does the issue persist if you run IE9 in no-Addons mode?</p>
<p>It appears that one of your Addons that worked with a previous IE version are no longer compatible with the more secure IE browser (wink)....</p>
<p>Check with the vendors of your toolbars for upgrades or just uninstall them...</p>

<p>Is there a one time solution?&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
Not likely.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, instead of just conventional IE add-ons I wouldn't be surprised if you found it is caused by something you would only be able to detect by using clean-boot troubleshooting.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, when IE7 beta came out&nbsp;someone found that some
 continually running device support software from nVidia was the cause of some related symptoms--the open in new tab command wasn't working correctly IIRC.</p>
<p>But I second the suggestion to test in No Add-ons mode first because it is so easy to do.&nbsp; E.g. one possibility you could discover that way is a crash in cleanup of a subordinate task taking down the main task and all the others with it.&nbsp;&nbsp; You should check
 in the Event log to see if there is an entry in there which could correlate with your problem symptom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck</p>

<br />1. Can you sign out and sign in again? 
<br />
<br />2. Make sure that you have latest version of Skype on your phone.

                    I have a Dell Axim X50v PDA&nbsp;running Windows Mobile 2003 Second Edition&nbsp;that I am syncing with Microsoft Outlook 2003 through Windows Mobile Device Center 6.1 software. I am also using Pocket Informant 2005 as my PIM for tasks, calender, contacts, etc.
 I don't connect to the internet through this device, just use it to keep track of appointments, contacts, tasks etc. The desktop I am syncing with is running Vista with all the updates. The problem I am having is that I cannot "check off" completed tasks in
 the PDA since I set this up. Whenever I try, the checkmark appears in the completed box for an instant, then disappears. Everything syncs OK,&nbsp;and I can mark it completed in Outlook on the desktop, but not the PDA. I ran a diagnostic on the PDA and everything
 came out fine.&nbsp;I did a&nbsp;hard reset on the PDA, wiping everything out and restoring it to factory settings, and the "check" stayed on the "completed"&nbsp;box of the task with a "clean" PDA, but as soon as I r

            How did you restore your programs to your device after the hard reset?&nbsp; If you restored from a backup file, then you also restored whatever was causing the problem and you'd need to avoid using the backup file altogether.&nbsp; Instead you should reinstall
 your applications and set everything up again from scratch.

            Hi Julie.<br />
<br />
Tried that. I had the PDA backed up on two different SD cards. One was from about a week ago before I started having the issue. Restored it from that. It is OK until I sync with the desktop. Then the problem starts again. I had Pocket Informant as the default
 PIM, and when I changed it to the PDA's default PIM, I get a message "No program memory available. Tap Start &gt; Settings &gt; System tab &gt; Memory, stop programs that did not automatically stop, and try again" Of course I did that to no avail. I've already spent
 5 hours experimenting with no luck/solution in sight.

            I am have been using an I Blue for a while. Fantastic battery with a sleep function when no bluetooth connection is present means a standby time of up to a month in my case without ever turning the unit off. The fast that it uses the BL-5C battery is also
 a big bonus as I have a collection of them so I never run out.<br />
<br />
It almost always gets a fix within a second and in my opinion way more accurate then the internal GPS receiver.<br />
<br />
Lastly it is small, looks great and doesn't cost a bundle.

            I bought the Nokia N95 8GB for its 'all in one device 'convenience.<br />
<br />
I bought an external Bluetooth GPS, not because the inernal was no good, or not accurate enough but because I did not want to destroy it with vibration and rain, strapped to the handlebars of my Yamaha XT225<br />
<br />
I want to create tracks (kml?)that map out the roads, lanes and footpaths of Cebu, Philippines using my Motorbike, in places the car could not go.<br />
<br />
I decided on the Wintec G-Rays2 (WBT-201). This is more than just a Bluetooth GPS, as it has a 'logger' function also (collecting up to 131,072 waypoints). It is also much quicker at acquisition than the internal GPS (34 seconds or if data is still in memory
 4-33 sec).<br />
<br />
Even in a car, the WBT-201 G-Rays2 unit, can be positioned on the dash, whilst from anywhere in the car, the N95 receives the NMEA0183 format data stream giving position, speed, altitude and time, together with estimated error and satellite status.<br />
<br />
'Sports Tracker' works very well with this for receiving the data stream 'live'. Once 'captured' it has many 'export' formats of the captured information. Test 'Tracks' of the same 'Route' using the internal GPS and another time the WBT-201, show the external
 unit to be more accurate. Having said that, the internal GPS is actually pretty good at capturing the same track.<br />
<br />
The only real 'negative' of the WBT-201, is the 'TMXTool' software (for configuring the settings, on the go, rather than connected to a PC), is for PPC, and not S60. However the 'TimeMachineX' software is OK for 'Windows' use.<br />
