                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>I will make this as short as possible.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Windows freezes at the logo screen, Freezes at driver list when i try to boot into safe mode. In general will not boot into a normal windows environment at all. &nbsp;I tried to use Recovery points with both the boot menu and using the disc to get to
 the repair your computer but it says an error has occured.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I've used every diag test i know to make sure the hardware is good and its all come back good won't bother listing all but HP diags passed, geek squad diags passed. Seagate hd diags passed memtest passed.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The system is Windows 7 Pro upgraded from windows vista. Worked for about 3 months before it happened.</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>AV = Norton Antivirus (without spyware protection) AS=Spysweeper (without av)... Regular scans run along with a modified version of Malware Bytes that does not require installing run when i was worried about it.</span></strong></p>
<p>I have the CD's however i believe the case with the product key is in one of 3 storage sheds spanning 3 states.</p>
<p>Even though i would like to be able to repair the computer i would much prefer having my primary laptop up and running again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to know. A. is there some way to repair it long enough for me to pull the key and reinstall or</p>
<p>B. Is there some way to retrieve the key using a linux boot disc in order to reinstall.</p>
<p>Repairing it i believe is the only option on this forum i figure ms would frown upon folks telling me how to pull a key with a linux live cd. I have tried all fixes i have been able to find with 0 results for better or worse.</p>
<p>*edit* I forgot i swapped out my av/as software with mse about a month after win7 was loaded and removed norton/spysweeper but continued running malware bytes. Also, i would be happy to post any additional info needed.</p>
<p>Also i have been avoiding this because im worried about wiping the drive and then finding out i needed the key, can i used the upgrade disc and reload the operating system without needing to input the key again?</p>

<p><span>Hi TomSenco,</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>What
 is the exact error message that you receive while you try to use repair option?</span></p>
<span>
<p><span>You may&nbsp;unplug any external devices, if any and check if the issue gets resolved.</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 1:</strong></span><span>
 Try booting into “Enable low-resolution video (640×480)" mode and see if the issue is resolved.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Follow these steps to do the same:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1.Remove all floppy disks, CDs, and DVDs from your computer,
 and then restart your computer by clicking the Start button , clicking the arrow next to the Shut Down button , and then clicking Restart.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2.Do one of the following:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>•If your computer has a single operating system installed,
 press and hold the F8 key as your computer restarts. You need to press F8 before the Windows logo appears. If the Windows logo appears, you'll need to try again by shutting down and restarting your computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>•If your computer has more than one operating system, use
 the arrow keys to highlight the operating system you want to start, and then press F8.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3.On the Advanced Boot Options screen, use the arrow keys
 to highlight Enable low-resolution video (640×480), and then press Enter.<br />
</span></span></p>

 need to input the product key for it if i use the disc to reload it.&nbsp;

<div>Hi <span>
TomSenco,</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>a. Did you check the link that I have given in my previous post?</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>Note that&nbsp;the data on the drive will not be lost if you&nbsp;are using the Upgrade Disc to reload the Operating system.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>Find the information in the link below which says:</span></div>
<div><span>
<p><span><strong>Note: Find your product key: </strong></span>You can find your product key on your computer or on the&nbsp;<strong>installation disc holder</strong>inside the
<span>Windows</span> package—or in a&nbsp;<strong>confirmation e‑mail</strong>if you purchased and downloaded
<span>Windows&nbsp;7</span> online. A product key sticker looks similar to this:</p>
<p>PRODUCT KEY: XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX</p>
<p>Since you are unable to find the product key, you may check for the Product Key in the installation disc holder or in the confirmation E-mail.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Incase
 you still did not find the Product Key, follow the suggestion given below:</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<div><span>If you do not have a Product Key, you may still go ahead and install Windows 7 without the Product Key. This type of Installation is known as "Keyless Installation".</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<p>Yes i did look at your link and as i said i had already tried all of those and it just locked up across the board.</p>
<p>Did you not fully read the post before replying again? I stated i did not have the case with me it got shuttled along to storage due to an error in logic on my part.</p>
<p>But it is a moot point now I have taken care of it in an acceptable (by my standards) way.</p>
<p>Loaded windows 7 as a new install so it left me with two copies of of win 7 on the machine.</p>
<p>Found a product key finder that let me direct it to another hive and it retrieved my original key</p>
<p>Wiped and restored using the key.</p>

            I&nbsp;have this exact same issue. I have the original install disk and it won't even let me reinstall from the boot DVD. It just passes that command by and goes to the hard drive installation. All options from the installed windows 7 just freeze.&nbsp; During safe
 mode, the last driver that loads before freezing is:
<p>
</p><p>\Drivers\classpnp.sys</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any ideas? before I go buy a Mac?</p>

<h2>            No sound in right side headphone after recent 12&#47;8 update.. hp spectre x360</h2>
                    <p>hello, I recently lost sound on the right side of my headphones (only headphones not device) situation, fell asleep listening to music on youtube, also while playing there was a windows update during that time 12/8. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling
 the driver Conexant isst audio, also updated the driver aswell.&nbsp; the device HP Spectre x360 13- 4116dx. the speakers play in stereo on the laptop but play in mono through headphones, I ve tried 3 sets of regular wired earbud style headphones. also they all
 perform correctly on other devices. when I go to the settings I can go to configure for stereo the regular speakers but I cannot configure the headphones, cant click it. any solutions for this issue? the sound has worked perfect for a year up until now, device
 is 1 year old?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks</p>

            thanks for the reply, I tried to do so but no there isn't a roll back option, I had tried that before I had uninstalled and reinstalled the driver. its very strange literally over night after I had close it turned it on the next day after the update&nbsp; and
 had mono sound through headphones.

<h2>            Brightness icon gone on OSD for brightness.</h2>
                    This might be a petty question but it annoys me, whenever I press the Brightness +/- keys on my laptop, the brightness icon isn't on the OSD, this started after I installed Windows 8.1, does anyone know of a fix?<br />

                    does windows 10 32-bit supports native UEFI install on desktop pc/laptop with processor intel corei3/5/7 or its amd equivalent? I mean windows 10 32-bit install in native uefi install without enabling csm/legacy bios mode.

            UEFI 2.0 support was added in Windows 8, so you're good to go w/ a native UEFI install of Windows 10 32-bit, if your system firmware supports it.

            <p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">So native UEFI install of Windows 10 32-bit is supported even on intel core i3/5/7 or its AMD equivalents processors?<br />
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>because I've asked in different forums and here's a quote of the answer I've got:</p>
<p><em><strong>"A 64-bit UEFI PC can only boot 64-bit versions of Windows. A 32-bit PC can only boot 32-bit versions of Windows. In some cases, while in legacy BIOS mode, you may be able to run 32-bit Windows on a 64-bit PC, assuming the manufacturer supports
</strong></em><strong><em>32-bit legacy BIOS mode on the PC.</em></strong></p>
<p><em><strong>I mean that unless you are using Atom-based tablets and SOC's with 32bit UEFI ROM's,your options will be A)Install Windows x64 (aka the Right option) and B)Install 32bit in BIOS mode(aka legacy mode)"</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>It's just so confusing because even <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh824898.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft's technet site</a>&nbsp;notes that:</p>
<p><strong><em>"</em></strong><span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)"><strong><em>While in UEFI mode, the Windows version must match the PC architecture. A 64-bit UEFI PC can only boot 64-bit versions of Windows. A 32-bit PC can only boot 32-bit versions of Windows. In
 some cases, while in legacy BIOS mode, you may be able to run 32-bit Windows on a 64-bit PC, assuming the manufacturer supports 32-bit legacy BIOS mode on the PC."</em></strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>So the way I understand it is that Native UEFI install of&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Windows 10 32-bit only works with mobile devices (</span><em><strong>Atom-based tablets)
</strong></em>and Desktop&nbsp;<em><strong>(SOC's)&nbsp;</strong></em><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">where in its processor are mobile processors Intel Atom based.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Otherwise, if you're using a&nbsp;</span><em><strong>64-bit&nbsp;</strong></em><strong>PC,</strong> which I assume means are the ones using the
<em>"real" </em>Desktop/laptop x64 processors (<strong>intel core i3/5/7 or its AMD equivalent)</strong>, then Native UEFI install of&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Windows 10 32-bit won't work with it and you have to use&nbsp;</span><em><strong>BIOS
 mode(aka legacy mode).</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>So, which is the case then? Does&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Windows 10 32-bit truly can install in&nbsp;<strong>Native UEFI mode</strong>&nbsp;(not CSM/legacy BIOS mode) even in Desktop PC/laptop with&nbsp;<strong>intel core i3/5/7 or its AMD
 equivalent</strong>&nbsp;based processors?</span></p>

            <p>An EFI install of Windows 10 32-bit can be performed on systems that are operating in 32-bit EFI mode, which isn't related to your make/model of processor. You'll have to consult your motherboard manufacturer/instructions to determine what version of EFI
 support your motherboard shipped with and if you can tweak it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Typically, newer devices ship with a 64-bit EFI without a toggle to change that. (Which means no native install of Windows 10 32-bit will be possible.) Some, however, ship with a CSM option that kicks in the older BIOS stuff, it'll work, but you don't want
 that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a reason you're trying to use a 32-bit copy of Windows 10?</p>

<h2>            Error code 0x87DD000F on Xbox One</h2>
                    <p>I get this error code quite often. I have my xbox one sign in set to no barriers and I am the only profile on the xbox. My OS is 10.0.17763.3065. I also have a kinect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I do a hard reset, it will always sign me in right away. However, when I turn it on in the morning or something, it will almost always give me this error. It doesn't matter if I turn the xbox on with a controller or a remote control. Sometimes, I can
 just turn the xbox off and back on, but most times, it requires a hard reset(hold power for 10 sec).&nbsp; Thoughts?</p>

<h2>            Marvell Libertas 802.11g&#47;b&#47;n Wireless Network Adapter for Windows 7</h2>
                    
<p>Hello I recently upgraded my desktop that ran Windows XP to Windows 7, and connected to my computer is a Marvell Libertas wireless network card. Now when I used my laptop to open an Internet connection to my desktop I downloaded the driver that was approved
 by Microsoft to use with the Network card. now when I go to the manage hardware program on my computer the network adapter has a code (10) The device won't start.&nbsp; Do&nbsp;you have any solution to my problem?&nbsp;I went to the manufacturers&nbsp;website; Marvell Semiconductors
 and I tried to find the driver but I couldn't find it.&nbsp;Also I was wondering if Microsoft had an update that would make the card compatible for windows 7.</p>

<p>original title: <span>DES...what is it?</span></p>
<p>My Windows 7 Pro 64-bit has an annoying boot-up problem.Frequently,during the boot-up process,while system is&nbsp;doing its sytem check thing it stops,and I get DES is turned off,turn on DES to continue,Press any key to continue.But,press any key does nothing
 at all!The only way to get Windows to boot-up after this is to shut off power remove motherboard battery,reset cmos jumper,then restart.Sometimes it tries to do a self recovery,other times it asks if I installed new hardware that may be the Windows shut down
 issue.But,its none of the above.I need to find out what DES is supposed to be so I can see if I need to change a setting or look for a conflict of some sort.Can't find any solution other than what I am doing resetting cmos and battery,which is getting rather
 old on a near daily basis often several times daily.Anyone know what is going on with a problem like this?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>DES stands for Dynamic Energy Saver and is a Gigabyte utility that apparently boosts power efficiency and was probably bundled with your motherboard software. You can access the program and enable it by going to Start &gt; All Programs &gt; Gigabyte &gt; Energy Saver.&nbsp;
 If you dont want to use the software, it can be uninstalled from Programs and Features.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p><span><strong>Hi</strong> n<strong>naed7777777,
</strong></span></p>
<p><span>a. What exactly happens when you try to use a Printer wirelessly?<br />
<br />
b. Do you get any error?<br />
<br />
If so, please provide the error code that would help us troubleshoot the issue.<br />
<br />
1. Try connecting your printer locally using the USB connection and make sure that the drivers are installed.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Once you have the printer operating condition then try to connect it wirelessly.</span></p>
<p><span>3. I also see from the HP specification that you would have received the setup guide.</span></p>
<p><span>4. You might want to have a look at the guide to setup your wireless printer.</span></p>
<p><span>You can also check out the below article that will give you information on how to connect a 'Wireless Printer':</span></p>

<p><span>However, you may try using the Print Troubleshooter that would diagnose the issue if any problems found.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Open the Printer troubleshooter by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Control Panel.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>2. In the search box, type troubleshooter, and then click Troubleshooting. Under Hardware and Sound, click Use a Printer.<br />
<br />
<strong>Access the below link to know more about Printer Troubleshooter:</strong></span></span></p>

<h2>            Not able to activate Windows 10 install nor go back to Win 7 predicament.</h2>
                    I have a HP Mini 110 (with no CD Drive) which came with Windows 7 starter installed and a product key sticker in the back.<br />
<br />
After successfully installing windows 10 on another HP Windows 7 laptop and being pleased with it I went to the Microsoft windows 10 media creation tool web page and copied the 32 bit installer onto a flash drive.<br />
<br />
Nowhere on the Microsoft page did it say this would only create a fresh install or that my Windows 7 product code would not work for the upgrade.<br />
<br />
My HP Mini 110 installed Windows 10 but did not transfer any of my applications.<br />
<br />
The installed code asked for my product code and I entered the one from the sticker on the back of the HP Mini and was told it was not a valid code and got the error message code 0xc004f050<br />
<br />
I tried to go back to Windows 7<br />
<br />
But "Go back to Windows 7" is not in the Recover page of Settings<br />
<br />
The directory windows.old is present but I do not know how to restore from it<br />
<br />
I do not know how to get back to a Windows 7 install, even if I lost my applications installed, which I rather not do.<br />
<br />
In fact I just spent several days at this and reinstalled a complex radio pan adapter application and I really do not want to do that again and would like to keep my Windows 10 install.<br />
<br />
I called Microsoft support and was told to either but a copy of Windows 10 to get a license key (which doesn't seem fair) or reinstall Windows 7 which I do not seem to be able to do at this point.<br />
<br />
I believe I used due diligence and followed all instructions presented to me and had no warning I would wind up in my present predicament.<br />
<br />
I believe and hope in all fairness Microsoft will help me activate Windows 10 and please issue me a valid product code.<br />
<br />

            <p>You are in trouble, unfortunately.&nbsp; The only way to upgrade to Windows 10 using the bootable USB flash drive or DVD is to open it within the Windows that you want to upgrade then run setup.exe.&nbsp; This information is sadly lacking in many posts on this forum
 and the Media Creation Tool should include dire warnings about booting from the bootable media.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can't go back to the previous operating system from a clean install of Windows 10. You need to reset your HP Mini 110 to factory or reinstate it from a saved disk image, then do the Windows 10 upgrade&nbsp;by running setup.exe from within Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think a lot of people are facing the same issue, hopefully Microsoft will do something about it.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
My sincere advice is a strict NO.<br />
<br />
I have put down some of the possible threats that I collected from various sites which aren't limited to only these. Take time and read through.</p>
<p><strong>Bandwidth Parasite</strong></p>
<p>In a "best" case scenario, all the intruder does is use the victim's broadband connection to get online without paying. Maybe just to surf the web, maybe to download pirated music or software. This does not cause any direct harm to the compromised network,
 but it can slow down Internet or network access for the victim, the legitimate user of the network, if an intruder leeches off his bandwidth. This could mean substantial additional ISP cost for the victim if the ISP meters used bandwidth and charges for actual
 usage. <br />
<strong><br />
Masking criminal activity</strong></p>
<p>An unauthorized user could abuse the victim's connection for malicious purposes like hacking, launching a DoS attack, or distributing illegal material. Since the intruder is a part of the private network and sits behind its gateway device, any traffic between
 him and the Internet will appear to be coming from the public IP address the ISP assigned to the victim. The ISP has no idea how many computers are behind the gateway, who they belong to, and what they are used for. If the criminal activity is discovered and
 investigated, the origin of the attack will be traced back to the victim's broadband account. It is a pretty safe bet that nobody wants to be accused of and go to jail for distributing child pornography or hacking into restricted company or government networks
 (just to mention a few examples) if the crime was in reality committed by a cracker from behind an innocent victim's network. Reviewing ISP's Terms of Service usually reveals a clause that not only allows the ISP to reveal customer information to the authorities
 to assist with legitimate criminal investigations, but also holds the customer responsible for any activities the connection is (ab)used for.</p>
<p><strong>Free access to private data</strong></p>
<p>A wireless network is also a direct backdoor into the victim's private network - literally. Instead of intruding from the public side of the gateway device, the intruder connects directly to the network on the private side of the gateway device, completely
 bypassing any hardware firewall between the private network and the broadband modem. Most people assume that since they are behind a gateway device with a built-in firewall their private network is safe, hence letting down their guard, sharing drives, and
 being generally careless. The intruder can completely take advantage of this by snooping around undisturbed and getting access to confidential data. This could be in form of personal information such as financial data, tax records, wills, and more that can
 be abused for identity theft for example, or in form of work-related information such as confidential specs, development information, trade secrets, and more that the victim has brought home from the office. By employing a sniffer an intruder can even sniff
 email or FTP user names and passwords because they are usually transmitted in cleartext, and use that information to gain unauthorized access to email accounts or web servers without the victim's knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>Backdoor into corporate networks</strong></p>
<p>In addition, a wireless network could also be an indirect backdoor into a corporate network. An intruder can specifically target an employee of a company whose confidential information is valuable to him for monetary or competitive reasons. If that employee
 establishes a VPN connection either permanently from his gateway or from a machine behind his gateway to the company network, the intruder can then piggyback on the VPN tunnel and gain unauthorized access to company resources, a serious security breach and
 every network administrator's nightmare.</p>
<p>That's why</p>
<p>By now the danger should be pretty clear: Unsecured wireless networks are unacceptable due to the extremely high risks involved. Yet there are countless unsecured wireless networks out there. A train ride through the Silicon Valley East Bay area revealed
 about 60 wireless networks, 40 of them wide open and insecure. A drive around a residential neighborhood covering just a few blocks revealed over 30 wireless networks, 20 of them wide open and insecure.
<br />
What is even scarier is that it does not take any skill to discover and gain unauthorized access to wireless networks. One does not have to be a programmer, Linux expert, or network specialist. All it takes is a laptop with a wireless network card, and some
 software (also available for Windows) that can be easily downloaded for free from the Internet. Armed with these basic tools anybody can drive around, detect open wireless networks, and connect to them. With a Linux machine, additional software, some advanced
 knowledge, and some time and patience it is even possible to break into wireless networks that use encryption.</p>

                    hello,
<div>whenever i try to delete a folder an error message pops up that i need permission from "S-1-5-21-1802859667-647903414-1863928812-35553"</div>
<div>i checked in the properties, the owner of C: drive is not me, its the same long number.. i checked through "cmd" using whoami /user and my sid is different to the sid i mentioned before... ive tried everything.. changed the owner through properties" security
 tab.. so many error messages popped up sayin "failed to enumerate object. access denied" etc and i kept clicking continue... in the end it just said " Unable to set new owner" ! .. ive even tried using cmd takeown commands.. i get success messages but when
 i try to delete the folder i get the same old message.. you need permission from "s-1-5 bla bla bla".. ive even tried refresh pc (pc settings), still having similar problems.</div>
<div>i am an administrator even then it doesnt let me change the owner of the C: drive. Is there anyway i can reset all the security settings?? its frustrating, please help.</div>
<div>thank you</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trying to do so, hack or otherwise, will make Window 8 very unstable and cause a lot of problems.</p>
<p>Best thing to do is to create a new admin user and login to that and see what happens.</p>

<p>The only way to correct this is to Restore, Reset or Reinstall Windows to correct all the permissions that have been broken.&nbsp; Back up your data before you do so.</p>

            So that you understand, you can take ownership of other drives or files buy not the C:drive.

<p>
</p><p>I would like to figure out how this virus was activated while no one was in the office. Yes the computers was on, my understaning is that this virus comes in mostly from Flash exploits etc. as Java had been removed. Is there any way to trace the exact infection
 method? Perhaps using system event logs?</p>

</p><p>Event viewer logs will not give you enough "granularity" to find out the entry point.&nbsp; There are literally dozens of ways.&nbsp; Unless you have the expertise to do a forensic post mortem your best bet is to lock down all access to the computer.&nbsp; Things like
 autoruns, auto windows updates, USB ports, DVD drives, Admin access for "normal" users.

            <p>I think If someone would give me some clues into the dozens of different way that I can try to figure this out, that I probably am more proficient than most average users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if there are dozens of way, then how about tossing me a bone or two?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am uninterested in learning how to lock down a computer. The files are gone. I don't normally take the time to try and figure out how and why someone got infected I usually just fix the problem and move on, seeing as this stuff never happens to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am aware that the current variations of CryptoLocker "crowti" going around are usually due to downloaded attachments in emails, or something the end user took part in to help it occur.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's bothering me about this one, is that Java was not installed, and flash was up to date. The PC was up to date. The anti-virus software detected and halted the first infection on Saturday evening according to the history log of Microsoft Security Essentials.
 At some point, the event logs determined that MS security crashed during the process, and a blue screen occurred.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was NO ONE in the office over the weekend. I would like to try and determine if this thing was on a timer, or was hiding and then went off, or was possibly an as yet unidentified Flash exploit that had yet to be patched.. That type of thing. Not really
 interested in any lectures on which security software suite is best either. It's too late for that discussion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm only interested in any possible methods I can use to try and determine how this thing got in, when no one was sitting at the terminal at the time. Unless of courses they are lying. Which is always possible. I can't check the email deleted items, or inbox
 because everything was encrypted accept thank god, the Quickbooks file which just happened to be open at the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am interested in learning. The only way to learn is to not pretend that I know everything there is to know from the start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if you do have any suggestions on using some more advanced tools to track this down, it would be appreciated. I am fairly proficient in Procmon and Autoruns, and am just studying the computer that I have at my disposal&nbsp; for now. I will be able to study
 it from a couple more days, and then I will need to wipe it clean and get it back to the customer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a working renamed copy of the virus itself, and I will set it off on an unconnected PC to study its method further.</p>

            <p>As ZigZag said Event Viewer logs are not likely to helpful for what you want to do. You should do a Google search on the malware name, bearing in mind the same malware can have many different names because security software providers do not collaborate over
 naming. Read the technical reports.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can submit suspicious files to your security provider and to Virus Total.<br />

            <p>Actually event viewer has been tremendously helpful. It showed me lots of things, including the fact that the machine blue screened during detection, it showed me when the virus changed the clock time on the computer so as to hide the date and time with
 which it was performing certain tasks. It showed me when Shadow copy was being turned off. It identified all kinds of times and file names of xyz.exe type files that were executing&nbsp;at what time.&nbsp;On and on and on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Helpful suggestions still welcome everyone else can pass on this... thanks.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I can explain these are some common scenarios how a computer gets infected.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">While browsing the Internet, an Internet advertisement or window appears that says your computer is infected or that a unique plug-in is required. If you accept it without knowing what it is then computer might get infected</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Another very common way computer gets infected with viruses and other spyware is by opening e-mail attachments. When a co-worker, friend, or family member open an e-mail sent from fake email addresses and even when not
 faked your acquaintance may unsuspectingly be forwarding you an infected file. When receiving an e-mail with an attachment, if the e-mail was not expected or from someone you don't know delete it.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Running a program or operating system that is not up-to-date with the latest updates can be a big security risk and can be a way your computer becomes infected.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">When you're downloading copyrighted music, movies, software etc. for free, often many of the files can contain viruses, spyware or malicious software. Make sure you're downloading the software from a reliable source and
 while installing it you're reading all prompts about what the program is installing on your computer.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If there is no antivirus software installed on your computer, it gives way for malicious software to get into the computer.</span></li></ol>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">When it comes to malicious software’s they are divided into different types and each one has different
</span>features, <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">way to execute and way to corrupt computers.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Virus:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> A virus is a form of malware that is capable of copying itself and spreading to other computers. Viruses often spread to other computers by attaching themselves to various
 programs and executing code when a user launches one of those infected programs the computer gets infected.</span></li><li><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Worm:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> A Worm spread over computer networks by exploiting operating system vulnerabilities. Worms typically cause harm to their host networks by consuming bandwidth and overloading
 web servers. Computer worms can also contain “payloads” that damage host computers.</span></li><li><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Malware:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> Computers that are infected with malware can exhibit any of the following symptoms like for example Increased CPU usage, slow computer or web browser speeds.</span></li><li><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Spyware:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> Spyware is a type of malware that functions by spying on user activity without their knowledge.

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">When it comes to computer infections it can happen in any way. It may execute anytime and infects your computer. I suggest you to ensure your computer is up to date making sure your windows and antivirus program are fully updated.

<p><span>Hi Donovan,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Have
 you made any recent changes on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 1</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>First I would suggest that you reset the monitor settings which you would find in the monitor menu.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Adjust your monitor's brightness and contrast</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Adjust-your-monitors-brightness-and-contrast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Adjust-your-monitors-brightness-and-contrast</a></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 2</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>It looks like that monitor display is damaged, I would suggest that you connect a different monitor to the computer and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 3</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists on the other computer as well then change the desktop theme and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Open
 Theme Settings by clicking the&nbsp;<strong>Start</strong> button, clicking &nbsp;<strong>Control Panel</strong>, clicking&nbsp;<strong>Appearance and Personalization</strong>, clicking<strong>&nbsp; Personalization</strong>, and then clicking &nbsp;<strong>Theme</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Under
 &nbsp;<strong>Theme</strong>, select the theme you want, and then click&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps!</span></p>

    <title>WIndows 10 Update and shutdown problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hamza waris  say:</h3>
<h2>            WIndows 10 Update and shutdown problem</h2>
                    I had not used my computer in two months and it required a Windows update. I Updated my computer, it said it updated. Now the only option I have to shutdown and restart is, Update and shutdown, Update and restart." These options do not go away even after
 multiple restarts, I would ignore the issue but for some reason all my steam games (csgo,PUBG, etc) are running at one frame per second. Does this have anything to do with the update or is this a separate issue. How do I remove the options to Update and Restart.

<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.
<br />
<br />If that does not work..
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Run these codes:
<br />Net Stop bits
<br />Net Stop wuauserv
<br />Net Stop appidsvc
<br />Net Stop cryptsvc
<br />Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.bak
<br />Ren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2 catroot2.bak
<br />Net Start bits
<br />Net Start wuauserv
