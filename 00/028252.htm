            I resolved this by chance when it also happened on my tablet. I stopped preview builds on that device and set them to resume in 5 days in advanced settings. The message said I wouldn't receive builds but was then of course right because I had stopped them
 in five days it reset and is now ok.

    <title>Set reply-to email address in outlook.com - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nick_200  say:</h3>
<h2>            Set reply-to email address in outlook.com</h2>
                    <p><span>I would like to set up my account so that when people reply to me, those messages go to a different email.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>While browsing Q&amp;A's in this community, I have found the following instructions multiple times when folks have the same issue:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Log in to your Microsoft account.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click the cog icon and "Mail more settings."<br />
3. Under "Writing email" click "Reply-to address."</span></p>
<p><span>4. Check if the email address is saved to "Other address."</span></p>
<p><span>5. If you can see the email address under the "Other address" delete or change it. You can also simply tick the "Current email address" and click "Save."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the cog icon I have represents "Mail Settings", and its list reads "Refresh", "Automatic Replies", "Display Settings", "Manage add-ins", "Connected Accounts", "Offline settings", "Change Theme" and "Options". Even under "Options", I can't find any
 configuration that allows you to set a reply-to address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help,</p>
<p>

            <p>Of course what he wanted and what I am asking are the same thing. I figured it out a little while ago. My email now comes from one address or any of my alias addresses and all reply back to the same address I chose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is the same thing he wanted to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mine was always selecting a different address for every reply... I wanted it to only reply back to one email address. So I changed the reply to address to the one I wanted them to go to and it works! The email I received from Microsoft about this thread
 came to the inbox, just as it should have done, following my changes!</p>

            <p>I also want to do the same thing as the original poster... just like Nick_200,
<span>I would like to set up my account so that when people reply to my outlook.com emails, those messages go to a different email address.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Any mail system I have ever seen (including outlook.com before the upgrade) have a simple "reply-to" option that can be set for the whole email account. Once set, all replies are sent to the specified address.</span></p>
<p><span>This used to be available in outlook.com by clicking the "Cog" icon and choosing
</span><span>"Mail more settings."<br />
-&gt; "Writing email" -&gt; "Reply-to address."</span><span>. </span></p>
<p><span>But apparently no longer.</span></p>
<p><span>@Ron Summer: Are you saying reply-to has been removed entirely from outlook.com</span><span>? There is no way to achieve this very basic functionality?<br />
</span></p>
<p>If, indeed, Microsoft has removed this very standard capability, I can only assume that this was explicitly done to make sure all outlook.com emails stay in outlook.com. Wow.</p>

<h2>            Windows update won&#39;t get 10565</h2>
                    <p>Hi Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been an Insider for a pretty long time and I haven't had too much trouble in the past with Insider stuff.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got a windows 10 VM which I use for testing our corporate applications on.</p>
<p>Currently the VM is on build 10240.</p>
<p>I have Insider updates switched on and set to the fast ring. I have rebooted several times and I have checked the associated registry values and the settings are correct. However windows update still says "your device is up to date". I've rebooted a couple
 of times but it hasn't helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why won't it find threshold 2?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assistance appreciated</p>
<p>

<br />
The TREND function is based on a linear regression model of the form y = m*x+b.&nbsp; Refer to details explained in the LINEST help page. [1]<br />
<br />
The GROWTH function is based on a linear regression model of the form ln(y) = x*ln(m)+ln(b).&nbsp; Refer to details explained in the LOGEST help page. [1]<br />
<br />
For more information about the "simple linear regression" method, refer to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_linear_regression" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_linear_regression</a>.<br />
<br />
It is important to note that the TREND and GROWTH functions are based on linear regression curves, which are derived from the actual data, but which usually do not fit the actual data exactly unless you have only two data points.<br />
<br />
http://answers.microsoft.com/message/4244a772-b7b3-48dc-9a01-adf730644c04?threadId=59b36c50-28f1-4317-b472-a2b4215916bb</a> for an example of how to compute the GROWTH coefficients without using LOGEST.&nbsp; Similar formulas can be derived for LINEST.<br />
<br />
The original posting needed the methods in order to implement them an SQL SRS product.&nbsp; I mention this in case you have a similar need.<br />
<br />
<br />
-----<br />
[1] I am not saying that the TREND and GROWTH functions actually use the LINEST and LOGEST functions or internal implemenations.&nbsp; I don't know whether or not they do.&nbsp; But the same concepts apply.<br />

<p>
</p><p><span>I’ve tried replicating this concern using the same version of the OneNote app. I’ve also scanned a sample handwriting via Office Lens from an iPhone, then inserted it in OneNote. I’ve tried selecting the
 handwriting from the scanned file and it didn’t work. It seems to be by design in OneNote that Lasso tool is able to select any ink strokes or handwriting that are created directly to the page itself of the OneNote app via ink. This means that if the handwriting
 is inside a file or a picture, Lasso tool may not be able to recognize it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Just to confirm, have you already tried using the
<strong>Draw with Mouse or Touch option</strong>? If you haven’t done this yet, you try to write using Draw and use a mouse or touch it instead. Then, once you’ve already written texts, you may select it by the Lasso Tool and select on Ink to Text. It should
 be converted to text accordingly.</span></p>

<p>That's correct. Scanned handwriting is pixel salad for OneNote. You need electronic ink for recognizable handwriting.</p>

<h2>            Power Pivot Chart Error &#34;The text string you entered is too long. Reduce the number of characters or cancel the entry.&#8221;</h2>
                    I have created a power pivot chart with a line chart of around 3000 data points charted on a date/time axis. I keep getting the error&nbsp;
<p class="contentStandard" style="margin-left: 6px">
"The text string you entered is too long. Reduce the number of characters or cancel the entry.”&nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="margin-left: 6px">
even though there are no long text labels on my pivot chart. Has anyone ever seen this or have any suggestions on how to debug? This chart works fine as a non pivot chart.</p>

 chart.</span></p>

<p><span>There may be many root causes in this issue. For further investigation, please use a new file and record a video showing the steps of creating the Pivot table. I’d like to create the same

<p>Hi Cliff,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am confused by what you mean by using a "New File". This file is a data model, the result of hours of work on queries and measures. Working in Windows 7, I do not think I have any tool that would allow me to create a video of my steps in any case.

    <title>Belle updates for all&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> twozero3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Belle updates for all&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>With the impending release of Nokia Belle, I was wondering if all Nokia phones natively running Anna will receive an update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not a single bug fix/firmware update has been made available for my E6 despite two firmware updates having been released in the time I've owned it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This doesn't exactly fill me with confidence when it comes to receiving the Belle update. Will all E6 receive the Belle update or just selected ones?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>To perhaps expand a little on the answers:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, Nokia will produce a Belle for the E6. However, that does not guarantee that your E6 will get the update. That is not something Nokia decides. It is your carrier you need to talk to. Once Nokia have produced the software, it is out of their hands. Individual
 phones will get the update when it has been approved by the corresponding carrier. This can differ between countries, and also differ inside a single country. It is based on the serial number of the phone.</p>

<p>Obviously they can't, which is because the system exist in the first place. You cannot make deals and arrangements with the carriers, and then provide a way for users to go around those deals. The carriers would be very upset, to say the least.</p>
<p>It is unfortunate, and even bad, for end users, but that's the power of the carriers...</p>

<p>Come on bro, that is not Nokia's fault...!!!<br />
I still remember when PR 2.0 was released, I updated my phones on the very first day but my friends who were using carrier contracts got them only recently...!!!!<br />
This is something the Service Providers should think about...!!!</p>

<p>I understand networks and carriers will want to approve firmware variants for carrier branded phones supplied directly to their customers and that may cause delays etc. but what about generic, sim free phones like my E6?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A generic phone uses the standard base firmware, no operator specific revisions, customisations or approvals required. In theory generic phones should be the first to get updates yet in this case there has been absolutely nothing and I know I'm not the only
 one. To me it defies logical explanation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>... and it still leaves me concerned as to whether my E6 will be overlooked when Belle is released for the chosen ones. There are clearly N8 owners concerned about the inconsistant ongoing product support their phones too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS. Have you read in the news today about Nokia making a €1 billion loss in the last year? Yikes!</p>
<p>Perhaps if Nokia hadn't sat on it's hands so much and dithered over commitment and development of Symbian they wouldn't be where they are right now.</p>

<p>Firstly EVERY phone is manufactured for a particular country, and it doenst matter whether or not the phone is branded or not. The phones have to work in that country no matter what. The firmware that is supplied for update has to comply with local telecommunications
 regulations. the regulations vary from country to country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The firmware has to be tested, if some of the carriers say it ok, then all phone from those carriers will get the update along with non-branded simfree phone. If none of the countries carriers say yes then NO-ONE gets it, not even the unbranded ones. It
 the carriers that have to make sure that the final product meets the rules of that country, so if 1 carriers says it ok, then theory is that it is fine as far as the regulations go and as such unbranded phones will be fine with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But if none of them confirm that is ok, it has to be assumed that something is wrong for that counrty, so nokia cannot supply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also as far as the financial loss you mentioned, just understand the phones are only a small part of what nokia does. Not only are they designing and selling phones, but also telecommunication equipment, satellite equipment along with a host of other companies
 they either own or are partners in. Nokia as a corporation are huge and have fingers in many pies so to speak. And whilst certainly 1 billion is alot it would need to be put in context, against the actual size of the business. If a business can lose 1 billion
 and still running, just imagine the actual size of it in the first place. And then when you compare that to something like Australian banks, which some of the strongest in the world financially, and some of the most profitable as well, and they only make around
 5 billion profit a year each.&nbsp; I think Nokia is not quite so bad in context, especially when you consider the economic situation in those parts of the world.</p>

<p>On that basis, would not every mobile network on earth have to approve firmware updates for every single device ever manufactured even if it is not sold in a particular country?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If none of the networks in the UK for example were to actually supply the E6 to it's own customers, does that mean any E6 bought independently in the UK will never receive an update? Why would the networks bother to review and approve firmware for a phone
 they do not sell or supply?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What if I buy my mobile telephone in the UK and then go on holiday or even move to another country and use the phone there? Surely the network operators in the other country haven't been approached by Nokia and asked to review and approve firmware for a
 device that may not even be officially sold there but it still uses their network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or the other way around, a person who lives in a country in which their phone model has received a firmware update then visits another country in which the same model of phone has not received the update but still uses their phone on the other country's
 network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A lot of slightly confusing if's and but's to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think the bottom line is, despite all the interest and hype, there appears to be no guarantee that everyone with a compatible phone will actually receive a Belle firmware update.</p>

<h2>            Why won&#39;t my contacts pull up when I am forwarding an email&#63;</h2>
                    When I am forwarding an email, I hit the Outlook down arrow, to "contacts" and error msg appears asking to "leave page."&nbsp;&nbsp; If I am on my mail page I can pull up contacts as directed however, when I forward mail and click the&nbsp;"to" box, I get a handful of
 most used contacts, but not the entire list, nor can I&nbsp;scroll this list.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I start&nbsp;typing the names, then they start to list those with similar letters, but nothing like the the old Hotmail.&nbsp;&nbsp; I should be able to start my forwarding email, and click people
 and have my contact list appear so that I can scroll thru&nbsp;it.&nbsp;

            <p>You almost have it. When you forward your email you don't go to People. That just takes you to the People page. The error message you get is warning you that if you do leave the page then anything you have written in the email will be lost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You do click on <strong>To</strong> and you should get a scrollable list of all of your contacts. Please note that some people have said they need to click on To a second time to get the full list, but for me it is only one click.</p>

<p>If clicking on To (either once or a second time) doesn't give you a scrollable list then please let me know. There are a couple of suggestions I can make that may fix it.</p>

            <p>Microsoft has been working with Apple from the early days of MacOS 10.7 (Lion). Through this partnership, many issues were addressed leading up to the Lion release. Microsoft will continue to work closely with Apple to address problems that may occur with
 Office for Mac 2008 and 2011 and Lion OS. </p>

            <p>Hello Vivian,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community! I understand that you are looking for features, like changing the background color or design of&nbsp;the message body, and adding an image in your signature, that will enable you to have a more&nbsp;customize look of your outgoing emails.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please be informed that the feature&nbsp;to change the background's design or color for your outgoing emails is not available. This might be a good suggestion so I suggest that you post it on our
<a href="https://feedback.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Feedback</a> page, to share it to the Product Group. They will review your suggestion and see if it can be considered for future releases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for appending an image of a cartoon character in your signature, you need to make sure that the
<span><font color="#000000">photo&nbsp;is published in the web and/or saved in your SkyDrive. Every email that you will send will have this image once the signature text has been saved. Here are the steps:</font></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><font color="#000000">Go to your <strong><span>Inbox</span></strong>. </font>
</span></li><li><span><font color="#000000">Click <strong><span>the </span></strong><strong><span>gear
</span></strong><strong><span>icon</span></strong> located on the upper right corner of the next to your Profile name and ten select
<strong><span>More mail settings</span></strong><strong><span>.</span></strong> </font>
</span></li><li><span><font color="#000000">Under <strong><span>Writing email</span></strong>, click
<strong><span>Message font and signature</span></strong>.</font></span></li><li><span><font color="#000000">Open another browser and visit the website with the image that you want to attach to your signature.</font></span></li><li><span><font color="#000000">Copy the image by right-clicking on it and selecting
<b><font>Copy</font></b>.</font></span></li><li><span><font color="#000000">On the signature page, type the information that you want to append to your outgoing messages and paste the picture in your signature window by pressing
<b><font>Ctrl + V</font></b> (wait for the image to load).</font></span></li><li><span><font color="#000000">Click <b><font>Save</font></b>. </font></span></li></ol>
<p><font color="#000000">I hope this helps. If you have clarifications, feel free to post back for further assistance.</font></p>

            I'm a little mystified as to what Anax' answer has to do with your problem :-)
<div><br />
<div>This issue is due to "corruption" of the internal code in the document. &nbsp;This corruption can take many forms, but bullets and numbering, tracked changes, and tables are the most likely suspects.</div>
<div><br />
<div>First, I suggest that you do a Maggie on the&nbsp;destination&nbsp;document, which will fix up many possible problems such as bullets and numbering and tracked changes.</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<p>The Maggie:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1. Create a new blank document in .docx format</p>
<p>2. Carefully select all of the text in the bad document EXCEPT the last</p>
<p>paragraph mark</p>
<p>3. Copy it.</p>
<p>4. Paste in the new document.</p>
<p>5. Save under a new file name and close all, then re-open.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This technique for de-corrupting is known as "Doing a 'Maggie'", after</p>
<p>Margaret Secara from the TECHWR-L mailing list, who first publicised the</p>
<p>technique.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>After you have done a Maggie, I suggest that you use Edit&gt;Paste Special&gt;Unformatted Text to paste from troublesome sources such as websites. &nbsp;That brings the text in but leaves behind any problem formatting that could cause issues.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

            <p>Something very similar happened to a friend on mine.&nbsp; On the 29th October (just two days after you posted this), his Hotmail account was used to send phishing emails to many of the friends &amp; family in his address book.&nbsp; His Microsoft account shows the IP
 address logged in from India.&nbsp; (So a spoofed email address is not the answer, never mind that they'd need access to his account to get his address book.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>He had two-step verification enabled, and used a long complex password, which was not used anywhere else (since he uses an *offline-only* password manager).&nbsp; He is very computer savvy, and anti-virus scans show nothing wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given your story is similar sounding AND similar timing, I'm wondering if someone has found a way to bypass the online security used by Outlook/Hotmail, perhaps allowed by the recent merging of Skype &amp; Microsoft accounts?&nbsp; (Although MS will doubtless deny
 this, until there is uncontestable proof otherwise.)</p>

<p>Hi, dohuk1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Nokia Support Discussions!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just to verify, does the screen go black immediately after dialing or receiving a call? If yes, make sure that the proximity sensor on the top of the screen is not covered by any screen protector or tape.&nbsp;<span>You can check this
 link:&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.nokia.com/ph-en/support/faq/?action=singleTopic&amp;topic=FA139001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nokia.com/ph-en/support/faq/?action=singleTopic&amp;topic=FA139001</a><span>&nbsp;to further isolate the issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If in any case that you're done trying the steps provided in the link, but still having the issue, we can try basic troubleshooting steps on your phone such as performing a hardware reset. To do that, press and hold the Power and Volume down keys at the
 same time for 10-15 seconds. Release and the phone will restart. No worries, this will not delete any personal data from the phone.&nbsp;<span>After this, try to make an outgoing call to see if it makes any difference.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the way, note that your system apps are also updated. Install the Lumia Pusher app published by&nbsp;Bùi Minh Đức&nbsp;from the Store.&nbsp;</p>

<div>Each table includes a field titled "Raw Material"</div>
<div>The same raw material is included in multiple records in each table.</div>

</div>
<div>How do I create a new join table that joins the "Raw Material" fields in both tables; creating a many-to-many relationship between the two imported tables?</div>

            <p>One way to approach this is to first create a "translation" table of synonyms:</p>
<p>tblSynonyms</p>
<p>MasterMaterial text(50) required PK</p>
<p>Synonym text(50) required PK</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fill it like this:</p>
<p>Iron&nbsp;&nbsp; Iron<br />
Iron&nbsp;&nbsp; Steel<br />
Iron&nbsp;&nbsp; Magnetite<br />
Iron&nbsp;&nbsp; Inox<br />
etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This table would allow you to populate a new field in each table called MasterMaterial. Then you can join on that field.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond this simple suggestion we would need to know much more about the nature of your project and what you intend to do with this data.</p>

            Hi Tom,
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for your very prompt reply. I understand your proposed solution.&nbsp;</div>
<div>To get to the complete solution, &nbsp;I can share an example Access database file with you that clearly illustrates the task to be accomplished. You can download it from my SkyDrive using this link:&nbsp;</div>
<div><a href="http://sdrv.ms/10ma9bQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://sdrv.ms/10ma9bQ</a></div>
<div>The table named Product includes a field named "Ingredient"</div>
<div>The table named DMFs includes a field named "Ingredient"</div>
<div><br />
<div>What I need to do is to create a many-to-many relationship between the Product and DMFs tables using the "Ingredient" field. In addition I need to build a translation table to point each synonym or spelling option to one single Ingredient name. Because
 of the volume of records I can't do it manually. If I could develop a script/routine that looked up and compared the Ingredient field in each table I could probably do it manually.</div>
<div><br />
<div>My challenges are&nbsp;</div>
<div>(1) neither Ingredient field is a primary key in one of the tables</div>
<div>(2) Multiple synonyms or different versions of spelling the same ingredient name appear throughout the Product and DMFs tables.&nbsp;</div>
<div>(3) I imported these data sets from an external source and need to work with what I've got.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Any guidance will be greatly appreciated.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks!</div>

            <p>A complete solution is beyond what this forum is for.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One possible avenue is to use Simil, which is an algorithm to allow for fuzzy string comparisons. I blogged about that here:
<a href="http://www.accessmvp.com/TomVanStiphout/Simil.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.accessmvp.com/TomVanStiphout/Simil.htm</a>&nbsp;It even talks about chemistry names :-)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking at the DMF table I could see how one could "regularize" the data by removing different spellings of "as manufactured in [location]". I saw several abbreviations and misspellings. This would be a semi-automatic phase. Regular expression processing
 may be helpful as well. RegEx is available after setting&nbsp;a reference to Microsoft VBScript Regular Expressions 5.5</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Depending on your exact needs, you could perhaps drop that phrase altogether and move it to a new field, and thus end up with far fewer ingredients to compare. I noticed the Product table doesn't have these phrases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Off the cuff I would say as a commercial project this would quickly take a few days to solve, and 100% cannot be the goal given automated procedures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interesting project. Good luck with it.</p>

            <p>I don't see how you could do so, even in principle! Leaving aside the name variants - where Access will be unable to help, and you'll need human intelligence to recognize that "Baking Soda" and "Sodium Bicarbonate" are synonyms - if it's a true many to many
 relationship, that relationship <em>simply does not exist</em> in the parent tables.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, if you have the classic school enrollment model, you have a table of Classes and a table of Students. Each Class has zero, one, or many Students; each student takes zero, one, or many Classes.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But there is NOTHING in the list of Classes or in the list of Students which would let you automagically create an Enrollments table, assigning Jim, Mary and Jose to Literature and Kathy, Hafez and Dan to Mathematics! That information must be obtained from
 the real world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Am I misunderstanding the question??</p>

<div><br />
<div>I'm far from an Access MVP so I'm not articulating well what I'm trying to do.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I expect to do a significant amount of manual matching of Ingredient names. I'm trying to set up a process that makes this most efficient and minimizes the potential for data entry errors.</div>
<div><br />
<div>What I envision is:&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Create a new table, "Ingredient", with one record for each of the unique ingredient names from the Product table.</li><li>Replace the Ingredient field in the Product table with the Ingredient ID from the new Ingredient table (The master list of Ingredients).</li><li>Add a new "Ingredient" field to the DMFs table and change the existing Ingredient field name to something like "Description"</li><li>Manually populate the new Ingredient field in the DMFs table with the appropriate Ingredient ID from the new table. But, do it from a lookup list from the Ingredient table.</li></ol>
<div>Step 2 and Step 4 are where I'm struggling.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>How do I automatically perform step 2?</li><li>How do I create a lookup list to pick from in step 4?</li></ul>

            The way I read it your need for a many to many relationship is temporary. You have two tables with an Ingredient field, but in those two tables, the field is not standardized. So you need to create a translation table. This table would look like this:
<div><br />
<div>tblIngredientTranslation</div>
<div>IngredientID</div>
<div>IngredientText</div>
<div><br />
<div>Now you have to populate that table with a list of the unique Ingredient text values from both tables. To do this, Create a union query (name qryIngredients):</div>
<div><br />
<div>SELECT DISTINCT Ingredients FROM Products</div>
<div><br />
<div>UNION SELECT DISTINCT Ingredients FROM DMFs;</div>
<div><br />
<div>The next step is to run an Append query:</div>
<div><br />
<div>INSERT INTO tblIngredientTranslation (IngredientText)&nbsp;</div>
<div>SELECT DISTINCT Ingredients FROM qryIngredients;</div>
<div><br />
<div>You also need a new Ingredients lookup table:</div>
<div>tluIngredient</div>
<div>IngredientID (PK Autonumber)</div>
<div>Ingredient</div>
<div><br />
<div>Next, you need to MANUALLY populate the IngredientID field in <span>
tblIngredientTranslation with the appropriate IngredientID. Now you have your translation table.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>The final steps will be to add the IngredientID field to the two tables and run Update queries matching on the current Ingredients field to the translation table and updating the IngredientsID field from the translation table.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Once this has been completed and verified, you can delete the Ingredietns fields int he two tables, as well as the union query and translation table.</span></div>
<div><br />

    <title>Anyone having problem with Skype iOS and bluetooth headphones&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Anyone having problem with Skype iOS and bluetooth headphones&#63; Bose Quietcomfort 35 disconnect when I receive a call</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I am using Bose QC35 headphones with a bluetooth connection to my iPhone 6S on the new Skype iOS app.</p>
<p>If I place a call the headphones stay connected to the Skype call and everything is lovely.</p>
<p>If I receive a call the bluetooth headphones can't pick up the sound and I&nbsp;don't think the mic works. If I press the speaker option button my phone switches between (smartphone)speaker and smartphone internal speaker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can&nbsp;I stop this happening? Where are the settings for the app?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've go to say: the new Skype iOS interface is awful. </p>
<p>If I wanted a snapchat&nbsp;experience, I'd use snapchat. I want a business-friendly VOIP service. I'll have to go and find one on the app store now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft: you've made a mistake with this update. Roll it back and offer customers a sensible business-friendly option (i.e. the old version) or a modern snap-chatty visual thing for kids (the new version.)</p>
<p>

</p><p>Thank you for the feedback and we appreciate every effort you put into this. Our developers are currently investigating known issues with the new Skype, since this is a new version being rolled out gradually, users may experience some issues from time to
 time. Also, some of the features and functionality of the old Skype may still not be incorporated on the new application so please stay tuned for future releases as our developers are working continuously to improve it. You may track change, improvements and
 known issues of the new Skype <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34713/faq-and-known-issues-with-the-new-skype?q=known+issue" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Have the developers solved this issue? I have bluetooth headset quality issues with Skype for Business on the IOS app. Every few calls I get warbling, basically the sound fades in&amp;out a few times a second, and the only way to solve it is to kill the app
 and re-start it. Restarting bluetooth or the headset itself doesn't solve the problem, only killing the app solves it.</p>
<p>I've isolated the issue to Skype and bluetooth. I have no sound issues when using speakerphone or wired headset. I'm using a Plantronics bluetooth but I doubt the issue is specific to the headset device.</p>

    <title>Outlook Rules MIgration - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook Rules MIgration</h2>
                    
<p>I just upgraded from Office 2013 to Office 365. It was incredibly simple but none of the rules in Outlook got migrated. I had several rules set up for my IMAP mail account, my only mail account, and none appear now in Outlook 365. How do I recover them?</p>

<p>hi chuck,</p>
<p>i understand you want to migrate the rules from the imap mail account to your office 365 account. since you were using the imap mail account before, the migration from imap server to exchange online can’t migrate the inbox rules along with the mailbox data.</p>
<p>given this situation, i’d like to confirm if you can still use the outlook client to access your imap email account. if yes, you can try to export the rules (<strong>file</strong> &gt;
<strong>info</strong> &gt; <strong>manage rules &amp; alerts</strong> &gt; <strong>options)</strong> and import them to your office 365 mailbox (your office 365 account needs to be configured in outlook client too).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=d63a2330-be75-4b0e-ad27-a509b72a365e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dd63a2330-be75-4b0e-ad27-a509b72a365e" /></a><br />
and if the previous imap account cannot be used anymore, it is not feasible to recover those rules and bring them to your office 365 mailbox. you need to manually create them again.</p>
<p>note: the rule in outlook is a client feature. if you run into any problem during the process, we recommend you contact our<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/forums/office/en-us/home?forum=outlook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> outlook client forum
</a>for a dedicated help. thanks for your understanding.</p>
