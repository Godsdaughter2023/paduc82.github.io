<h2>            Month view in Calendar for Windows 10 mobile</h2>
                    <p>I am part of the Windows Insider program and have installed Windows 10 Preview on my mobile device.</p>
<p>In Calendar, I cannot find an option to view week/month.</p>
<p>Also, I can only jump to one month in advance.</p>
<p>Is this a known issue and will it be corrected?</p>
<p>If not, it's pretty much useless to me.</p>

            Hi Jason,
<br />Please try these troubleshooting steps: 
<br />Start outlook In Safe Mode
<br />Open Outlook in safe mode and see if the error occurs.
<br />1. Close Outlook. 
<br />2. Press the windows key + R on the keyboard to open the Run window. 
<br />3. In Run window and type outlook /safe (space between 'outlook' and '/'.) 
<br />If you are able to work with Outlook without any problem then the issue is an add in. From what I am seeing on the error AVG anti virus is causing some issues with Outlook. Below are the sets to remove it from your addins
<br />1. Open Outlook, click on File - Options - Add-ins. 
<br />2. Under Manage select COM Add-ins. 
<br />3. Click on GO options beside Manage, uncheck the the AVG add-ins and click Ok. 
<br />4. Try to open Outlook and check if it works fine. 
<br />Then add the COM back in one by one to figure out which one is causing the problem. 
<br />Windows does come with it's own antivirus Windows Defender. If AVG keeps on giving you problems I would consider removing it and use the Windows Defender as the anti virus. 
<br />I hope this helps please let me know the outcome.. 
<br />Regards,
<br />Sam

<p>Existing contacts from other apps such as Facebook, Messenger and Skype (if you are using these apps) may have been synced and that's why they are showing duplicates on contacts. Log in to each one these apps and try to remove or delete it from there.</p>

<h2>            Excel version 15.27</h2>
                    I am using Excel version 15.27 on iMac. When formatting a cell with percentage 2 digits, and entering a minus figure e.g. -3.2, the value shown ist -320.00% i.e. 100x higher. Is this a program error or what can I do to get the right figure? Thanks for

            This is not logic. If I format a cell with percent and enter 4, then 4.00% is shown. If I enter -4 then -400% is shown.&nbsp;

<h2>            Quickly swapping columns and formatting tables.</h2>
                    <p>Hello </p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to do a project which took me a long time and I wonder if there was a quicker way of doing this.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
I had a very long table, where for example, column 4 and column 5 had to be swapped (see below).&nbsp; But to make things more complicated the table had also subtitles with merged cells.
<br />
I split all the Title columns to 5 columns, re-sized them, swapped columns and merged again all the titles columns (which took for ever!). &nbsp;<br />
Any suggestions would be welcome. <br />
<br />

<p>Hi&nbsp;Nickitta,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can swap the columns. However, we haven’t included an option to quickly swap columns and table formatting in Word 2016. You would have to manually merge the cells after swapping the columns because it wouldn’t retain the formatting you’ve already applied.
 One suggested workaround would be by using Excel 2016. Copy your table, paste it into an Excel sheet, swap the columns, copy the edited table, and paste it into Word.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We encourage you to submit a suggestion to our&nbsp;<strong><span><a href="https://word.uservoice.com/forums/304924-word-for-windows-desktop-application" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Word UserVoice</a></span></strong>. This way

</p><p>How does the picture look (OK beauty is in the eye of the beholder:) )&nbsp;?</p>
<p>Are you able to send in full HD 1080P?</p>
<p>How much load is it on the CPU&nbsp;when you send at different resolution (would be nice to know what CPU and general spec of the PC)?
</p>
<p>Anything else you noticed about it, driver bugs, software, unforeseen thing in general?</p>

<p>I already own a C920 witch is a great cam!&nbsp;&nbsp;but since the introduction of the NGC it is impossibly to get 1080P on Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second link:</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">Logitech Brio</span> </p>
<p>
</p><p>On the same site:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/hd-pro-webcam-c920?crid=34 They" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/hd-pro-webcam-c920?crid=34
</a></p>
<p>They &nbsp;state that 1080P is possibly with Skype. witch is clearly NOT true!!! (unless you "tweak" Skype) So lets say....... that I don't have total&nbsp;confidence&nbsp;&nbsp;in what they wright!</p>
<p>At the introduction of&nbsp;the Logitech C920 It was 1080P certified&nbsp;by Skype. but nowadays, it is extremely &nbsp;hard to even get 720P from it. By now, I more or less given up all hope that&nbsp;1080P with &nbsp;C920 will ever again&nbsp;be supported by NGC!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully it would be possibly to get 1080P&nbsp;on Skype with Brio, but I don't take anything for granted .....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>So therefore &nbsp;I would like to hear from someone that have firsthand experience with it.</p>

<p>While I do not own a Brio, I anticipate the same factors that decide 1080p on the C920, will apply to the Brio as well.&nbsp; Only ideal lighting conditions, Internet and settings that do not tax the camera and modify the uncompressed video stream, will allow
 1080p to exist.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe someone with a Brio or the non-Logitech equivalent will be able to share their experience</p>

    <title>Outlook 2013 stuck on Loading Profile, Mail Applet won&#39;t open for - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> d3matt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2013 stuck on Loading Profile, Mail Applet won&#39;t open for normal users</h2>
                    I have multiple users logging in to Citrix Desktop (Like remote desktop services), and on one of the servers I've had 2 different people call in telling me their outlook is stuck on Loading Profile. I cannot open the Mail applet with any non-administrator
 user on any of the Citrix servers, I have not tested on a desktop computer. When I try, it just shows up as a blank white icon instead of the normal icon. I disabled the problematic server and when they log into one of the others, their outlook starts working.
 Normally, I would start troubleshooting with the Mail applet by creating a new profile, but the Mail Applet won't open, as described above. No group policy changes have been applied to these users or servers that I am aware of (and nobody but me would be messing
 with group policy). I did apply some printer preferences via GPO to several test users, but none of the users having problems are in the test groups.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />

            I'll try that tonight when the users in question are offline, in the meantime do you have any idea why the mail applet seems to have forgotten its own existence? I've read that a blank white icon can mean that the user was denied access, but I'm unsure
 of how I can check or fix that, because as far as I'm aware there is no group policy restricting access to control panel applets. What else could cause that?<br />

<h2>            Can&#39;t open an Excel file with Macros, Read-Only format Mac</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have an excel file for work that contains macros. Whenever I enable macros, it then only allows me to open it in "Read-Only" format. I just downloaded the Office 365 Personal today because I was told by a tech that it would properly open macros. So as
 far as I know, it is the most updated version of Office 2016. I am running a Macbook Pro on El Capitan 10.11.1. Does anyone know of anyway to open this properly?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The contact support I did talk to couldn't resolve it and sent me to "Professional Support" who said I would have to pay for a Business 365 just so I could get "Business Support" and they could hopefully fix my issue. Not sure what kind of lame support that
 is, but they recommend that I come on here to see if my question could get resolved. It was also the only free resolution they provided...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thank you.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b552b8eb-e2be-4aea-9857-f8da5102c510" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b552b8eb-e2be-4aea-9857-f8da5102c510" /></a></p>

            Among the content that Excel 2016 for Mac does not support is the popular Power tools, such as PowerPivot, PowerView, PowerMap and the data model. If your workbook contains any of these things you will get that message. There are some other things not
 supported, but the list of unsupported features is getting smaller.

            The problem is probably the content of the macros. If the author of the macro did not take the Mac into account, this is one possible result. You will have to contact the macro's author to make sure it will work properly on a Mac.<br />

<h2>            &#91;Bug&#93; Groove for W10 Mobile is not adding&#47;displaying newly copied music to its database from WMP12 sync</h2>
                    <p><strong>[Bug] Groove is not adding/displaying newly added music from WMP12 sync.&nbsp;
</strong><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 Mobile Groove 3.6.1537.0 / 10:49 PM 12/11/2015</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have ~33,000 songs on an external 128GB SD card on a Lumia 950XL, when I add new music via autoplaylist sync from Win10's WMP12 to the phone's 32GB internal storage, those files are physically on the device (per file explorer)&nbsp;but Groove does not kick
 off its 'find music' routines and they never show in the UI.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally it does not start its file change listening / interrogation routines when your autosync or you regularly *delete* songs.&nbsp; This has happened on my SD card *and* internal storage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please fix or provide an option to re-start the music search.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Failing that, provide an option to reset the entire music database to force the re-interrogation.&nbsp; You have my permission to search the logs of the device to help find a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: I did a hard reset trying to fix this and said 'no' to removing content on the SD card.&nbsp; On fresh start after hard reset Groove did its proper interrogation and found the 33K songs on the SD card, but new songs added after that fact
 to the internal or SD card storage do not show up and there has been no 'adding your music' notification in days.</p>

            <p>I would like to add that the exact same thing has happened to me however the songs were stored on the internal storage rather than my 128GB SD Card. I've manually deleted the songs using my PC however the catalogue does not update and when you manually sync
 I receive the error unable to Sync.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the additional data point. :-)&nbsp; Seems like this Groove file system change detection is rife with defects.</p>
<p>I also see the problem as you describe on my internal storage too; I tried to troubleshoot it by putting files there as well on sync or even manually copying them over.</p>

            <p>It continues to be a problem at least on production branch, not sure of Redstone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I broke down and removed my 128GB SD card did a hard reset; filled up the internal 32GB of the Lumia 950XL and for a week it's been successfully&nbsp;adding content on the internal storage via WMP sync.&nbsp; Will see if it's smart enough to remove entries now that
 the week autoplaylist sync will start removing them from the file system shortly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They need to get this working with large SD cards.&nbsp; I may try a 64GB card next to see if that makes a difference. :(</p>

            <p>The same issue applies to a 735 with 128GB SD card. The music is on the card, (can see either with Explorer or Tag Editor), but does not appear in Groove.&nbsp; Update was slow, but I think complete on XBOX but appears to have stalled completely on Groove.&nbsp; 100s
 of albums yet to appear.<br />
Is there a button / command to rescan the phone and re-catalogue?</p>
<p>Syncing via the Window Phone&nbsp;Program on the PC (running Windows 10) also stalls.&nbsp; Original Sync (in XBOX) worked, but then failed on subsequent uses and on Groove.&nbsp; Can copy music onto phone / SD card via Media Player.&nbsp; It the suffers the issue above, so
 as I can't see it in Groove, can't play it.</p>
<p>The IPod Classic is no longer made, so I can't revert to that solution.</p>

            I have a Lumia 930 &amp; 1520 displaying this annoying issue, it also happens with my friends Lumia 950. Nothing to do with the way your Music files are added to the device - I have 102GB of WMA files to add, this is done with an Anker USB 3 Card Reader to
 minimise bottle necks - groove is not updating the database, I've only seen it Sync once. It would be really good just to get the Apps functioning correctly and heaven forbid the one at Redmond who suggests ditching an app and write a new one, with different
 bugs.

<p>I just wanted to follow up on the issues I had w/ Groove for Windows 10 Mobile failing to properly update the UI when I had music added or removed (typically via WMP sync of autoplaylists). This is with large numbers of songs (10,000+) on external SD card
 and internal storage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to have cleared up somewhere in the last few rounds of Groove updates. I'm on the release preview ring, not Redstone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had previously had success w/ removing my 128GB Sandisc SD card and gone internal only. When that worked for a month or so with the Groove UI finding my changes and giving me the toast messages that it adding/removing the music, I decided to put the SD
 card back in and load it up with songs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's still working thankfully, and knock on wood.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Groove</strong>: 3.6.23303</p>
<p><strong>Windows 10 Mobile</strong>: 10.0.10586.456</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now Groove team: Please add <strong>wireless sync of autoplaylists </strong>ala WMP, I want to sync songs added in the last X days, or by genre in the last X days etc. Like WMP allows. And do this
<strong>syncing wirelessly</strong>. :) Thanks -</p>

            I'm also having this issue with my Lumia 640 xl with 16gb sd card. I have 300 songs in the sd card.Earlier when i was signed in to the groove app, all the songs in the sd card disappeared in groove music and as soon as i signed out i found all my songs
 right in the app. To fix this i took backup of all my sd card files on my pc. Formatted the card. But the issue got worse. Now even when i was signed out of the app my songs didn't reappear. It sucks. Gonna reset my phone 😭😭

            <p>This is the fix that worked for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Backup your phone.</p>
<p>Format your SD Card</p>
<p>Factory Reset your Phone</p>
<p>Connect your Phone back to your Microsoft Account</p>
<p>Make your Phone is fully up to date</p>
<p>Download/Update your Apps</p>
<p>Restart Phone</p>
<p>Add Music to your SD card</p>
<p>Start Groove</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since doing this, all has worked 100%, it seems the only way to delete a dodgy database is to reset the phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this works for you too...</p>

<p>Steps that helped me on Lumia 950XL (Insider preview release)&nbsp;:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Stop running Groove instance</p>
<p>- Remove back cover&nbsp;while keep phone turned on</p>
<p>- Settings&nbsp;-&gt; Storage&nbsp;-&gt; SDCard -&gt; Remove -&gt; Confirm</p>
<p>- Remove SD card from its slot</p>
<p>- Put the SD card back into its slot</p>
<p>- Start Groove and point to songs view</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then Groove started to search for newly added music on my SD Card</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps ;-)</p>

    <title>Lumia 730 GPS&#47;Location Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> abhisheke730  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 730 GPS&#47;Location Issue</h2>
                    my LUMIA 730 does not detect my location properly. I have offline maps installed. But even with/without data connection turned "on" and LOCATION turned ON obviously, gps doesnt work. Sometimes it do detect the location (while standing still), but its within
 1Km or 2Km location, but we cant use navigation as the pointer in Here <br />
<br />
Drive+ does not move at this precision(within 1km or 2km).<br />
<br />
While travelling (~ while moving) it never catched my position (i travel a lot and i have been trying this for the last 6 months).<br />
<br />
I downloaded Hardware Test app and it shows my L730&nbsp; <strong>GPS SOURCE as : Cellular</strong> (and Altitude : zero)<br />
But in my friends Lumia 520 it shows <strong>GPS SOURCE as : Satellite </strong>(and Altitude : some value )<br />
<br />
Inorder to check whether it was due to the signal unavailability, i tried GPS on my LUMIA 730 and my friends LUMIA 520 simultaneously. L520 (that too without mobile data turned on) catched location precisely within 10 seconds, but in L730 (even with data turned
 on) it shows "Finding your location" for a long period and then pops up "Cannot find your location".<br />
<br />
About 2 times when i kept location turned on it catched my location in about 7 minutes while standing still. But its not practical,&nbsp; i cannot park my car,get out in space and wait for for 7-10 minutes&nbsp; to catch my location,and at the same time L520 did it in
 15-20 seconds in moving car.<br />
<br />
I contacted nokia care and they reinstalled the software. But the problem continues.<br />
I made a small research online and found there were a lot others facing same problem with L730, and i think 90% of the people are not aware of this issue with their phone.<br />
<br />
I<strong> guess the phone is not trying to connect with the SATELLITE, and it stays with the cellular location info</strong>.<br />
<br />
I dont know whether it is a hardware or software issue, but microsoft do need to do something ASAP as lot of the customers are facing this problem that too with no "possible solutions" till now.<br />
<br />
So people, <strong>i kindly request everyone facing this issue to respond and let MICROSOFT notice this issue</strong>.<br />
<br />
Come ON Microsoft please do something about this...i have spend my hard earned money to buy this phone and its upto you to make me feel worth it...

            <p>Hi Harshal Gharat,</p>
<p>No my friend, I haven't found any stable solution yet. Try turning off "Automatic Update of Date and time " option from settings. This works some time but not always.</p>
<p>
</p><p>TIP : First try in open space till you get a satellite fix before you enter you car incase you need navigation because once you are inside your car and moving its virtually impossible to get a fix. But once you get satellite fix you can simply move into
 and the phone keeps up the signal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is really annoying and Microsoft should immediately provide us with a solution.</p>
<p>Thanks..</p>

            <p>Hi Abhishek,</p>
<p>I tried an app called Hardware Tests from store on my Lumia 730 and tested my GPS hardware with my data connection off and under open sky conditions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For first few tries it showed my source to be cellular but later it was able to identify the source as satellite.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Being a spatial technologist I am more concerned about features like GPS and maps. Another interesting thing was the Here maps itself has location inaccuracies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got my location coordinates when my source was Satellite and I tried those coordinates in Google Earth and it took me where I was actually standing. The same coordinates when tried on here maps, they didnt took me to the location where I was standing.
 so there is a room for the possibility that our reference i.e. Here maps might be wrong!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel this must be an issue that the device doesn't try to connect to Satellite and sticks with cellular network when locating user position.</p>
<p>Here are screen grabs which shows cellular and satellite as source.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, do post in case you come across any fix for this. I'll also be looking for a fix and post whenever possible.</p>

            <p>Hi Harshal,</p>
<p>I too had tried that app before. But I'm not sure about the here maps being wrong. If that's the case then all the windows phone should exhibit the similar issue. I sister owns a L520 and its navigation is perfect.
</p>
<p>But as you stated above the main cause is that the phone sticks on to the cellular data and does not switch to satellite. Sadly no one, even Nokia care people in my region doesn't know the exact reason and believe me they didn't even recognised it as an
 issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you consulted with Nokia care.</p>
<p>Please do post if you found anything.</p>

            <p>Hi Abhishek,</p>
<p>I didn't consult with Nokia care so far but have few additional things observed and thought of sharing with you.</p>
<p>Earlier this month I had a flight journey and during the same I tried GPS on my Lumia 730 using Hardware Tests and found that GPS was working absolutely fine.</p>
<p>I think based on our observation we are correct in conclusion that this device prefers cellular network over satellite signal.</p>
<p>You can verify this fact by turning off your Wi-Fi and putting your device in flight mode, you will notice that your device is now listening to satellite signals.</p>
<p>I think if at all we get a settings which would allow us to set GPS source as satellite, we will be through. This setting is there for Android devices</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hi Abhishek,</p>
<p>Its only last week I got a replacement from Flipkart for Lumia 730. I got a new L730 and its GPS is working like a charm.
</p>
<p>However I have observed certain things which seem to be necessary when you wish to expect your GPS to work perfectly. I have following observations, try those things at your end and let me know if you get results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are various situations when GPS on L730 works flawlessly. Initially I was disappointed to see that GPS from my replaced L730 is also non working but after a couple of days I explored a few things which are necessary for GPS to work accurately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. You have enabled your location services along with wifi/data for a longer period of time/all the time.</p>
<p>You will get a quick fix even if you turn off your wifi/data.</p>
<p>2. If your wi-fi/data are off but location is always on/ on for an hour or two you should get a fix in maximum three minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case I get a GPS fix in few seconds if only my location services are turned on for half an hour before I get out of the building for a GPS fix but in case I have wi-fi/data and location off for a long time and I turn on only location to get a fix,
 it takes maximum three minutes that too If I keep my L730 near my window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give a try as I have described and let me know if things work for you. Also I would like to know what is your device's hardware revision number, mine is 3.0.0.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good Luck!</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>Happy to find that you found somewhat a solution. My device is still the same and I gave up using navigation as I cannot get a fix when iam in need. Sometime after a lot of tries in open sky it fixes , but its not at all reliable while travelling. :(</p>

</p><p>By the way my device hardware revision number is 1.0.0.0 . Does this mean something ?</p>

<p>Abhishek,</p>
<p>Hardware revision might be a factor behind your problem. Revision 1.0.0.0 means your device was purchased soon after the release of L730. Over a period of time the phone hardware gets upgraded for different issue fixes and GPS fix might be one of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if your gps hardware had issue from the beginning then it will continue to be so.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Yes, my phone does show source as satellite in Hardware Tests app. A GPS fix based on satellites is independent of cellular operator so you need not&nbsp;worry about it. The phone&nbsp;which I replaced had Hardware revision 3.0.0.1 and I believe it should not be a
 problem.</p>
<p>To check if your GPS is&nbsp;working fine I recommend to use an app called <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-in/store/app/gpsinfo/54ecee48-ce2a-e011-854c-00237de2db9e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="GPS Info">
GPS Info</a>, my experience&nbsp;with this app is better than Hardware Tests since GPSInfo constantly tries to get a fix&nbsp;with satellite system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After much experimenting&nbsp;with this GPS stuff I have found two methods&nbsp;which surely gives a GPS fix on Lumia 730 (Provided your GPS hardware is not faulty), try these on your device and let me know if it works for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method #1 (Locks GPS in few seconds)</p>
<p>1. Keep your location services on for a longer period of time (say always on)</p>
<p>2. Keep your data/wi-fi connection on side by side.</p>
<p>3. Come out of your building, turn data/wifi off and launch GPSInfo, you should get an immediate fix.</p>
<p>4. Once you get a fix you can launch Here Drive+ and start navigation</p>
<p>I have also observed that once you get &nbsp;fix it is not dropped so easily, I tried this during my bike trip keeping my device in my pocket.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method#2(Locks GPS in 5-10 Minutes)</p>
<p>1. Keep your location services on for a period of time (say 1-2 hours)</p>
<p>(Currently I am experimenting on this timing)</p>
<p>2. Make sure your data/wi-fi connection is always off.</p>
<p>3. Come out of your building and launch GPSInfo, you should get an a fix in 5-10 (May be lesser than this time) minutes. In my case it takes maximum 3 minutes even if I keep my device at my window )</p>
<p>4. Once you get a fix you can launch Here Drive+ and start navigation</p>
<p>
</p><p>So give this a try and make sure to post your findings so others facing this issue will also be helped.</p>

<h2>            Find my phone stopped working</h2>
                    My daughter's phone is an Alcatel OneTouch W10 device.&nbsp; The "Find phone on a map" feature has worked flawlessly for nearly a year, but has recently stopped working.&nbsp; It works neither when I'm logged in to locate the phone with a child account, nor when
 we log in wither her own account.&nbsp; There have been no updates or even app installations lately, so that is not the issue.&nbsp; I've checked the settings to ensure the correct options are activated, and everything looks fine.&nbsp; Any suggestions?

            <p>Hi Anju ARsvindran,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on the Forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand you are having issues with syncing your Gmail and Facebook accounts on your Windows Phone.
</p>
<p>You may try to do soft reset by pressing and holding volume down and power buttons until the phone restarts.</p>
<p>You may also try to remove the accounts and set them up again</p>

<h2>            Make my autotext entries live and shareable</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to figure I way I can share auto text entries with the rest of my faculty. Ideally this would be automatically updateable for everyone as I make changes to them . I can already share documents via Word online so one thought was to have my autotext
 entries fed onto the page of a shared document but I would have no idea if that is possible without copying and pasting manually.&nbsp;</p>

<p>AutoText entries are stored in templates. By default, they are stored in the Normal template, Normal.dotm. Only AutoText entries stored in Normal.dotm will generate AutoComplete tips, but they can be stored in any template.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can create a special template that users can load as an add-in: if the template is stored in Word's Startup folder, it will be loaded at startup, and AutoText entries in the template will be available to all documents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If users want to be able to take advantage of AutoComplete, they can move the AutoText entries from the add-in to Normal.dotm using the
<strong>Building Blocks Organizer</strong>. Select any entry, click on <strong>Edit Properties</strong>, and, in the
<strong>Save in</strong> dropdown, change the location from the add-in to Normal.dotm.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks that you came to use to inform us some people have the same email address that of yours as you received their personal emails.
<font>I apologize for the inconvenience. Let me go ahead and see how I will help resolve your issue.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to inform you that your Outlook.com account is a unique email account and that Outlook.com doesn't create same email account for different users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a possibility that these people whom you're suspecting of having the same email account might have mistakenly given out your email address. I suggest that you write back to the senders of the emails you received and inform them that you're not the
 intended recipient.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have other questions about Outlook.com, we look forward to hearing them from you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Thank you for your reply, which does seem to make sense. At least for one of the people using my email address.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the other person has opened a face-book account using my email address and I am receiving his emails that relate to his account.

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are factors to consider should you receive the error "<strong>The message cant be sent because your mailbox is full</strong>" when sending emails in<strong> Outlook.com</strong>. One of those factors is the number emails on your

Inbox </strong>folders. To troubleshoot the issue, we suggest following the troubleshoot steps provided by

            Hi NoICon66,<br />
<br />
When you click on a link from different websites, on some websites the page opens in the same windows and on some it opens either on a new tab or a new window. So basically its the website specific. For example, You click on the link from this website, the
 link would open on the same windows unless I change it from my end to open in a new window when you click on the link provided by me.<br />
<br />
You may also make changes on your Internet Explorer to change the settings.<br />
<br />
<strong>Perform the steps given below.</strong> <br />
<br />
Internet Explorer &gt;&gt; Tools &gt;&gt; Internet Options &gt;&gt; Tabs settings(Change how webpages are displayed) &gt;&gt; uncheck "Enable Tabbed Browsing" and Under Open Links form other programs, Check " The current tab or window".<br />
<br />
This should resolve your issue<br />
<br />

<p>
</p><p><span>The program installed without any problem and works OK, but . . . every time I reboot the computer and launch Office I need to re- put in the license key.
</span></p>
<p><span>This is what happens:</span></p>

</p><p><span>First of all I get the message as in attached screen grab “grab1”</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I click repair now then after about 5 seconds the program closes.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When I reopen it I get the message as in attached screen grab “grab2”</span></p>

</p><p><span>When I click on OK it takes me to the screen where I can either log in with Hotmail account or put in license key. Despite being associated with my Hotmail account it will not accept this as a login and requires the license key. The program then opens
 and will be ok until the next time I start the computer, then I have to go through this process yet again.</span></p>
<p><span>Things I have tried:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A repair through the control panel – change – repair (this seemed like a complete reinstall)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Deleting my Hotmail account from office and re adding it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>None of these seem to work, can anybody help please?</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community. </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This is an issue related to the Activation of Office 2013. Office 2013 has not been activated properly on your computer and thus prompts you to enter the Product Key and activate every time you need to use Office 2013 after a reboot. This issue may
 also occur if there is a change in geographical region. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In order to resolve this issue let’s try these steps as detailed below. </span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>First restart your computer. After restart try the following steps. </span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We will now be opening one of your Office application in the Administrator Mode and we will try activating Office this way. Please follow these steps to open the Word application in Administrator mode and activate Office 2013:
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>To run the Word application as an administrator, do the following:</span></span></p>
<p><span>From your Windows Explorer: Browse to the location <strong>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office 15\ClientX86\Root\Office15</strong> or
<strong>C:\Program Files (x86) \Microsoft Office 15\ ClientX64\Root\Office15</strong>.
</span></p>
<p><span>Right click on <strong>winword </strong>or <strong>winword.exe</strong> and then click on ‘<strong>Run as Administrator</strong>’.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The Word application will open as normal (in Administrator Mode).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may be prompted to activate Office 2013 again and an Activation Wizard window may pop up. Follow the onscreen steps to activate Office 2013; use the sign-in option (if shown on screen – sign-in with your Microsoft Account Credentials) or the Product
 Key option. In case you do not see the Activation Wizard popping up then close Word and reopen it to check if it still prompts you to activate.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Once it has accepted your Microsoft Account Credentials or Product Key close all open windows and restart your computer. After restart try opening Office 2013 applications again and check if you are still being prompted to activate Office 2013.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try the above steps and let us know if you need any further assistance. </span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

<h2>            Powerpoint for Mac - page size automatically set to widescreen</h2>
                    
<p>Hi<br />
Whenever I open a .ppt / .pptx on my Mac, the page size automatically flips to widescreen, and I have to resize everything. Has anyone else experienced this behaviour, and do you know of a fix?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

    <title>When installing MSE, error code&#58; 0x80070643, error log&#58; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            When installing MSE, error code&#58; 0x80070643, error log&#58; looking for APPCOMPAT database entry with product code.</h2>
                    
<p>I am trying to install Microsoft Security Essential on Win XP with SP2.&nbsp; I created a log on installation (see at the end). I got error: looking for APPCOMPAT database entry with product code...; no matching product code found in the database.<br />
MSCOREE not loaded, loading copy from system 32. <br />
<br />
I used mssefullinstall-x86fre-en-us-xp.exe file to install. I have Installer 3.1 on my computer; I had uninstalled all the other antivirus software; I have "desktop" dir in all the users' accounts.<br />
&nbsp;I installed MSE successfully on two other computers even other antivirus software were running on them.&nbsp; I also tried to copy MSE dir and extracted setup file from another computer to install on my computer, but it didn't work.<br />
I don't know what is wrong with the APPCOMPAT database and what this error means.&nbsp; How to correct this error? &nbsp; Any help is appreciated.<br />
Thanks.</p>

<p>I used Windows Installer 4.5.&nbsp; I removed security software installed; I checked registry to see any reference to any such software.&nbsp; Still I am getting the same error.</p>
<p>What is the exact meaning of the error: "looking for APPCOMPAT database entry with product code...; no matching product code found in the database"?&nbsp; Which product is it referring to? If we knew that, then it could help to figure out the problem.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
