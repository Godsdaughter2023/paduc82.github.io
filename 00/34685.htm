<li>Longest played that I know for sure 22 hours 33minutes for Metal Gear Solid 4.
</li><li>3-5 hours on weeknights and average about 1 hour during the week. </li><li>Basically everything since the NES. PC a new build for every major Direct X API change so 7,8,9,10, and 11.
</li><li>At this point PC is just to costly for gaming and not as fun. I am glad not having to patch games, hunt down strange bugs, and all the other headaches that come with a lot of PC gaming. I will most likely buy Microsofts next console unless there is a major
 change. Will buy a new PC, but not explicitly for gaming and development like I have in the past.

<p>2. Depends, right now I'm kinda bored with gaming, but somewhere between 10-30 hours during the week.</p>

<p>hmm! the first could easily go to either morrowind or oblivion. i've played both many times for around 20 odd hours. i can never set out with a goal and complete it, you always get side tracked especially if you don't use any fast travel.</p>
<p>the average i spend on a game at a time i would say is around 6-8 hours.</p>
<p>i'm only 24 but my first console was a hand me down commodore, then went on to megadrive/snes, saturn (there were already 2 ps1's in the house), dreamcast (greatest console ever R.i.P.), xbox and finally 360 and ps3. the ps3 i've recently sold as i hadn't
 turned it on in over a year. i mainly used it for media but my laptop does everything better.</p>
<p>in that time i also had almost every iteration of the gameboy except of course for the different kinds of ds they brought out. only had 2 pc's in that time which weren't very good but allowed me to play the like of diablo, halflife and black and white.</p>
<p>i've been gaming for as far back as i can remember, i think its too late for me to stop now. it's a hobby that i've love for years so, like many, its kind of depressing to see the way its heading but, i'll stick with it until it becomes as dried up as the
 movie industry.</p>

    <title>Trouble with downloads stopping on an external hard drive&#63; Maybe - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> squeaky peat  say:</h3>
<h2>            Trouble with downloads stopping on an external hard drive&#63; Maybe try this</h2>
                    
<p>This won't fix the problem for everyone I'm sure but give it a try. First I'll give you way too much background information, then highlight the solution at the end ;)</p>
<p>So for the past few months&nbsp;I'd get the "Installation Stopped" error whenever I tried to download a game or app to my external drive.
<strong>The drive was functioning because I could still play games off it and I could even transfer games from the internal to external drive</strong>. Just downloads would not happen. And
<strong>a game would become unplayable if an update was available because the update would not download</strong>.</p>
<p>Also, <strong>once a download stopped it would not resume. Which is very odd.</strong></p>
<p>Soooooo I reformatted the drive, did a factory reset on the console, I did everything I could think of.</p>
<p>I even spent two hours online with 2 "tech support" guys that were pretty much useless. The first guy, after an hour of giving him information with no suggestions, finally said that nothing is wrong with the Xbox or external hard drive but that it is impossible
 to download games directly to an external hard drive. That you were required to download them to the internal then transfer them to the external.</p>
<p>This is when I requested to be escalated to his supervisor. This guy didn't help either. I kinda knew he'd be as good as the first when he started asking if it was an official Xbox&nbsp;external hard drive&nbsp;&nbsp;(which doesn't exist for Xbox One) or a 3rd party one.
 His best effort was sending me a link on how to manage storage on Xbox One.</p>
<p><span><strong>The solution?</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>I changed what USB port the external hard drive was plugged into. It didn't occur to me that the port was the culprit because it still functioned for playing games and even file transfers. But something is going
 on with this port. Or at least it is on my console.</strong></span></p>

<h2>            Bluetooth headphones won&#39;t connect since Windows 8.1 update</h2>
                    <p>My bluetooth headphones, model IAHB64, haven't been able to connect since my laptop updated from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1. &nbsp;They have been able to connect to other devices, and used to connect to my laptop very quickly before the update. I have tried installing
 and uninstalling it. Now, when I go to PC Settings -&gt; PC and Devices -&gt; Bluetooth, my headphones will not even show up when my headphones and laptop are searching for devices to pair with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an IAHB64 Bluetooth Operations icon that I have pinned to my taskbar. I used to be able to click "Connect" from there, then tell my headphones to look for devices to connect to, and they would connect quickly and without hassle. I have not been able
 to successfully do this since the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked into it a lot and have tried a few different things. The only thing I haven't tried is refreshing my PC (to go back to Windows 8), because I don't want to have to reinstall all of the programs that would be removed from the PC. &nbsp;Any help would
 be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            <p><span>Hi EWF,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you so much for posting your query on this forum. You have reached the right place and I will try my best to assist you with this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I understand that you are using iLive IAHB64 Bluetooth Headset on the computer and after updating to Windows 8.1, you are unable to connect the headset with the computer via Bluetooth.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This issue seems to be due to the incompatibility of the Bluetooth drivers with the Windows 8.1 Operating System on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to try uninstalling and reinstalling the drivers in the Windows 8 or 7 compatibility mode and check if that resolves the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span>Uninstall and Reinstall the Drivers in the Compatibility Mode</span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span><span>Step 1: Uninstall the Device Drivers</span></span></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></em></strong></p>
<p><span><span>a) Press “<strong><em>Windows Logo</em></strong>” + “<strong><em>X</em></strong>” keys on the keyboard.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b) Click on “<strong><em>Device Manager</em></strong>” from that list.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c) Search for the Bluetooth device from the device list, right click on it and then select “<strong><em>Uninstall</em></strong>”. On the un-installation window, if you have an option: “<strong><em>Delete
 the driver software for this device</em></strong>” you may select that and then remove the corrupted drivers from the computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>d) Follow the on-screen instructions to complete it and the restart the computer if prompted.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>After the restart, please open the
<strong><em>Device Manager</em></strong> again and then click on the “<strong><em>Scan for hardware changes</em></strong>” button. Check if Windows 8.1 detects the Bluetooth device and installs an appropriate driver automatically. If the issue still persists,
 then try the next step. </span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span><span>Step 2: Check Windows Updates for the latest drivers.</span></span></em></strong></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Check in Windows updates if any driver updates are available. If so, install the same and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a) Press “<strong><em>Windows Logo</em></strong>” + “<strong><em>W</em></strong>” keys from the keyboard.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b) Type “<strong><em>Updates</em></strong>” in the search bar and click on the icon “<strong><em>Windows Update</em></strong>” from the search result.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c) On the “<strong><em>Windows Update</em></strong>” window, click on the link: “<strong><em>Check for updates</em></strong>” from the left hand side of the window to receive a fresh list of updates.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>d) If the updates are available, then install all the updates listed there.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>If Windows Update does not offer the latest Windows 8.1 driver, then try the next step.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span><span>Step 3: Install the Drivers in the Compatibility Mode</span></span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may download the driver setup file from the manufacturer’s website and the save it on the desktop of the computer. After the download is complete, install the driver in the compatibility mode and
 check if that resolves the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To install any drivers/apps in the compatibility mode, you may refer to this article:</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Random BSOD at boot</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I have apparently random BDOD at system startup. It sometimes go away after a few reboots and come back again. If I do a system restaure is goes away for a few reboots</p>
<p>
</p><p>But also the BSOD error message seems to be totally random it can be : </p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;- Winload.efi is Missing or Contains Errors</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Something like : An important device is disconnected</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Other things that I didnt write down</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is dxdiag and driverview info : https://1drv.ms/f/s!AiMwSoa9-3rMav6ZsovOJmjmf9U</p>
<p>My motherboard is : ASUSTeK COMPUTER INC.&nbsp; H97M-E</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried to fix the MBR with bootrec and bcdboot. It solved the problem and booted, but next morning the BSOD was still here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no clue about what's happening, thanks a lot</p>

<p>Hey thanks for your answer. I don't think this is coming from the drive as it is still available in the bios but I will try to change the sata cable.

    <title>Deals with Gold - Burnout Paradise - Wrong region &#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Deals with Gold - Burnout Paradise - Wrong region &#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have several games installed from disc and download that I've been playing without issue since installed. 2 days ago, I bought Burnout Paradise from the Deals with Gold page and the transaction was fine. It downloaded fine and when I tried to play it,
 after a short time loading it said my console is the wrong region. This is quite puzzling considering my region hasn't changed and all my other games work without issue. This is the first game I bought from Deals with Gold and the only one I have a problem
 with.</p>
<p>Account region: US<br />
Physical region: US<br />
Internet Service Provider (ISP): COMCAST</p>
<p>If I had known I couldn't play this game, I would not have chosen to have spent money on it. Can this be resolved or can I be refunded?</p>

<p>No first did you buy the console out of region ? Please check the back of the console to see if it is ntsc or pal</p>
<p>FYI console region is hardcoded into the console and cannot be changed</p>
<p>Basically for a us region game you need a ntsc console</p>
<p>Very few games check for the console region but when they do its not avoidable</p>

<p>It is NTSC and it was bought in the US.</p>
<p>I once had a disc of Perfect Dark Zero in ntsc format and that too gave the same wrong region error.</p>
<p>Nothing else ever. This has to be something weird.</p>

<h2>            ez vinyl&#47;tape converter problems</h2>
                    
<p>I'm trying to convert my old lp's with a new Ion Powerplay LP usb turntable with mixmeister software EZ Vinyl/tape converter. First I can't hear the music as I'm recording and I've went into the sounds on the control panel to make sure my soundcard is on
 and it is. Second the automatic separation feature that recoeds the individual songs doesn't separate all of them. Some of the songs are recorder together and there is no separation. In the instructions it states the software is for windows xp or vista. Does
 this mean it won't work on windows 7 and I have to download a newer version for 7?</p>

<p><span><span>Hi&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>idcreek,</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Yes, if the program manual states that it works only on Windows XP and Windows Vista then, it is not compatible with windows 7.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>You may download the latest version of the program from the link below</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>If your computer is having problems
 recording sound, try using the Recording Audio troubleshooter to fix the problem. It checks for common issues, such as making sure that both a working sound card and a recording device are installed on your computer.<br />
<br />

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the issue still persists, you may want to contact the program manufacturer for more specialized assistance.</span></span></p>

    <title>Microsoft Expression Web 4 will not install on windows 8 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microsoft Expression Web 4 will not install on windows 8</h2>
                    Downloaded the latest Expression web 4 free version got as far as the window that asked for permission (the one with the beep)&nbsp;to change the computer. When I gave permission nothing happened. Then I went through it again but saved the web-trial-en.exe
 file and double clicked. Same result. I then right clicked on the file and tried compatibility trouble-shooter - again nothing. Any Help. Did the same for my windows 7 laptop and all extracted out and running perfectly.

    <title>Repeated Windows Updates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chrisc..  say:</h3>
<h2>            Repeated Windows Updates</h2>
                    <p>Hello Technically Savvy Friends,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you wish to skip to the meat without my potato and veggies, where we are now will be
<strong>bold</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Long Story:</strong></p>
<p>I am at my wits end with my PC. I've had an issue with Windows Update for quite some time. When I first got my PC in January/February 2014 I was a bit younger and dumber; thought I was a computer wiz, disabled Windows updates thinking I didn't need them.
 Fast forward a few months I noticed Windows Movie Maker refused to run. Did some research and a good fixed seemed to be update the machine. This was my first encounter with a situation where the machine couldn't run a program due to not being updated.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I attempted to turn on windows updates, access denied please contact the system administrator. I was and am the only user account on the PC and the administrator, I did some researching on that, tried a few things, eventually gave up on it. Swing into late
 2015/early 2016 I ran into the issue again, for Media Player. This time after doing some more research I found the solution was to change the switch in regedit, I don't remember which switch, or whether it was 0 or 1 but Windows update turned on! I was finally
 able to update, everything seemed fine, it did the updates, Media Player worked, life was good so I left auto update on.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple months later I started noticing that Starcraft 2 and Heroes of the Storm would not launch. I tried reinstalling them, repairing them eventually giving up again as these are not games I play every day. At the beginning of this month I decided to
 tackle this problem head on with Blizzard and open a ticket. They had me do many things, from uninstalling a bunch of my drivers and reinstalling to reinstalling the games, attempting windowed mode, reverting the game to dx9, and updating Windows. Throughout
 this process I provided them dxdiag's and msinfo's as we made the changes. I noticed while doing this that 3 updates continued to show up available for install every time I checked for updates, even though I already installed them. Blizzard had received msinfo's
 since and made no further mention of the updates so I assumed it was a non-issue and proceeded with the troubleshooting. My ticket with Blizzard came to an end when I reached the maximum number of responses allowed in a ticket. The next reply's from Blizzard
 are public here:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://us.battle.net/forums/en/heroes/topic/20753486642</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically; someone finally actually asks me for the games crash logs (who would think something useful might be there???) and they determined the game is not finding Windows files it needs to run.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Putting 2 and 2 together I assume fixing my update issue will fix my gaming issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Where we are now:</strong></p>
<p>Automatic updates is ON</p>
<p>My Installed updates shows "No updates are installed on this computer."</p>
<p>My update history Shows the same 3 updates repeatedly being installed with Status "Succeeded" every time I boot the PC since March 9th (date I started troubleshooting with blizzard)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 3 updates are KB3063843, KB2990967, and KB2538242.</p>
<p>Also on March 9th KB890830, KB2993928, KB3193713, 2 INTEL - System 10.1.1.38 updates, a Realtek Semiconductor Corp. 6.0.1.8051, all updated and installed "Succeeded" but have not been repeatedly available for download like the other 3. This concerns me only
 because my Installed updates shows "No updates are installed on this computer"</p>
<p>I also do not appear to have an update history prior to March 9th.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run the Windows Update Troubleshooter, 3 times today alone, and each time it tells me:</p>
<p>The troubleshooter made some changes to your system. Try attempting the task you were trying to do before.</p>
<p>Problems found</p>
<p>- Service registration is missing or corrupt - Fixed - Green Check mark</p>
<p>- Problems installing recent updates - Fixed - Green Check mark</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I proceed to have the exact same difficulty. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to fix the issue without simply reinstalling windows as that's a whole other can of worms as my computer came with windows so I don't have a disk and don't know enough about all that yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: I'd also like to state I've been searching this issue vigorously and seem to only find people who have the issue back 5-7 years with Windows 7. I also saw a lot of "That didn't fix my issues" in those threads and I'm really hoping someone can help.
 Thank you so much for your time.</p>

    <title>Skype audio quality in Version 8 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> radiocam  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype audio quality in Version 8</h2>
                    <p>Hi.<br />
I am most definitely with the community group that want Skype 7 .x to be retained - but I have just one very specific issue with the new versions - and I am hoping that this will be recognized and corrected:</p>
<p>
</p><p>As part of a volunteer activity I run sessions over the phone&nbsp; (a teleconference) for groups of blind and housebound people across Australia.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I need to use my PC during these sessions and I found Skype perfect for this, using a headset and using my Skype subscription to dial, set up and run the conference call.&nbsp; Effectively it is using Skype as a VOIP phone .<br />
<br />
Before Version 8 the audio quality has always been excellent. This is critical to me as most of my group members are elderly, have difficulty hearing and could be on phones that do not have great audio quality.<br />
<br />
The first time I upgraded and used V8 to call them, they unanimously told me that I sounded like I "was in a tunnel" and muffled. I could hear this myself on the Skype echo test number.<br />
I have tried flipping between versions a couple of times to confirm this, with the same result each time.<br />
I don't have much confidence that this will be corrected and am most disappointed at how easily (callously?) MS can kill a wonderful product.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any thoughts about how I can improve the audio quality?<br />
(It is not the mike and hardware I use - I have not changed it - and anyway I tried a few different headsets when testing the problem).<br />
<br />
Thanks.</p>

            Hello Radiocam<br /><br />I'm a fellow Community member here to help. I'm sorry to hear you're facing this difficulty. I know that it is extremely frustrating.<br /><br />You are correct that Skype 8 is not fully functional. It is still under development and is lacking many of the features and functionality that users have come to know and expect.<br /><br />while I personally am not aware of a solution for the issue that you are currently facing. I can tell you that Microsoft has decided to provide support for classic Skype for the foreseeable future until Skype 8 can be brought up to full functionality and features.<br /><br />If you are interested in classic Skype it can be gotten here<br /><br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a><br /><br />in the meantime, although there is not yet an ETA, it is expected that in the very near future Microsoft will begin rapidly releasing updates for Skype 8 that will fe

<p>Thanks Dadof 5,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you are right and they address the audio quality.</p>
<p><br />
MS don't have a great track record of listening to user feedback in accessibility issues anyway, so I won't hold my breath on this. I doubt they see a group of blind people as having any value to their business.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks for the link. It's frustrating fighting a constant battle to keep Skype from updating, and I have a V7 installer on hand in case Skype updates without my accepting (which happens occasionally).<br />
I am looking at other options anyway.<br />
<br />
Cheers, thanks for your quick reply.<br />

    <title>Empty folders on C drive in Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bob is interested  say:</h3>
<h2>            Empty folders on C drive in Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>I have several folders that I can't access and can't delete.&nbsp; Looking at its properties says it has 0 bytes.&nbsp; Keeps on saying I need Admin privileges&nbsp; but I'm the Admin.&nbsp; The title of the folders are random letters and numbers.&nbsp; Are they install folders
 left over?&nbsp; How do I delete them?&nbsp; I wonder how many more will be created and discarded.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to delete it it says I need permission from "S-1-5-21...and a long number" to make changes to this folder.&nbsp; ???&nbsp; Its empty!</p>

            You need to seize ownership of your folders then give yourself full access rights - see here:<br />

<p>I've done the right click/Take Ownership thing to no avail.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I've tried to change the Security settings to no avail.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would love to know why Microsoft makes this so absolutely tortuous.&nbsp; How about right click something and set the security/ownership level.&nbsp; Bam.&nbsp; Done.&nbsp; But no.&nbsp; We have to wade through incomprehensible menus.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So besides those 2 things I've done, is there anything else I can do?&nbsp; I think I have done what is suggested in those two links.&nbsp; Please correct me if I'm wrong so I can re-immerse myself in this digital quagmire.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And under Owners in the Security settings why am I seeing 6 items?</p>
<p>Everyone</p>
<p>CREATOR OWNER</p>
<p>SYSTEM</p>
<p>Account Unknown (S-1-5-21-.............................)</p>
<p>Administrators (my username-PC\Administrators)</p>
<p>Users (my username-PC\Users)</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is only 1 user on this machine!&nbsp; You'd think we should be seeing that username and Administrator.&nbsp; But no.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You'd think "Everyone" would encompass everyone.&nbsp; But no.&nbsp; This is software designed by people who apparently haven't learned basic language skills.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And of course when I try to change things under CREATOR OWNER I get the inevitable error message:&nbsp; Access is denied for many files.&nbsp; ???&nbsp; Of course to make this more aggravating Microsoft elects not to put a "Apply to similar files" option so you have to
 keep authorizing it to Continue.&nbsp; You may have to do this thousands of times for a large drive.&nbsp; Isn't that a design perk.&nbsp; To think people are well paid to design this.&nbsp; Boggles the mind.&nbsp; A monkey would have more cerebral logic.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I must have hit it hundreds of times and then accidentally hit it too soon and it activated the Cancel button.&nbsp; I start again.&nbsp; Of course it has forgotten what I've done and we're at the beginning.&nbsp; Whoever designed this should never
 be let anywhere near a computer.&nbsp; This is ineptitude at the highest level.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm noticing every one of the very folders I'm trying to delete is coming up as "Access is Denied".&nbsp; This seems totally futile.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suppose if I connected this drive to another machine the same thing would happen or is there a way of overriding these demented restrictions Microsoft has plagued us with?&nbsp; Surely there must be software that can ignore these barriers to folder freedom.&nbsp;

<p>You can use the administrator's way to get rid of these folders. It works like so, assuming that the folders reside in C:\.</p>
<ol>
<li>Log on under an admin account.</li><li>Create a destop shortcut for cmd.exe.</li><li>Right-click this shortcut, then left-click <em>Run as administrator.</em></li><li>Accept the challenge. You will get a black console screen.</li><li>Type these commands and press Enter after each:<br />
mode&nbsp; con&nbsp; lines=50<br />
cd&nbsp; \<br />
md&nbsp; Junk<br />
(The next command should look like so:<br />
<strong>move&nbsp; NameOfUnwantedFolder&nbsp; Junk</strong><br />
You start by typing&nbsp;<em>move</em> plus space bar, then press the Tab key until the unwanted folder name appears. Press the space bar again, then type&nbsp;<em>junk</em> and press Enter.)<br />
(Repeat this process for all other unwanted folders. Be careful not to move system folders!)<br />
rd&nbsp; /s&nbsp; /q&nbsp; Junk</li></ol>
<p>The last command is irreversible.</p>
<p>If the above still fails, repeat it in Safe Mode.</p>
<p>If it still fails then your files might be encrypted.<br />

            I wonder if the problem may be that the problem folders are actually on G drive and that is where my operating system is.&nbsp; I don't have an Administrator account - just my own account under Users.&nbsp; Does this mean I need to activate the Admin account somehow?&nbsp;
 When I see it under User Accounts it says my username then Administrator.&nbsp; ???

<p>It looks like the only account with admin privileges is the Administrator account. Is it active? This command will tell you:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>net&nbsp; user&nbsp; administrator</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>How and when did your day-to-day account get demoted? It had admin privileges when it was created! You might be able to promote it while in Safe Mode, loggin on as Administrator with a blank password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fact that your problem folders are on drive G: is irrelevant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is normal for you to be in the folder C:\Windows\System32. This command will get you back to the root:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>cd&nbsp; \</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you were in the System32 folder, what makes you think that your system is installed on drive G:!</p>

<p>When some programs (including Microsoft programs) install things, it may create a temporary folder consisting of 20-30 random letters and numbers or random&nbsp; numbers and letters in the root drive of the volume with the most free space.<br />
<br />
This explains why sometimes the folders are on your C drive or on some might be on another drive - which one has the most free space?<br />
<br />
For example you may see a folder on your C or D (or other) volume similar to:<br />
<br />
D:\9470bb12e8a4f3447657236478e41c5<br />
<br />
There may be other folders and files under that main temporary folder such as amd64 and i386.<br />
<br />
These should normally be removed when the installation is complete, but sometimes they are not - especially if the installation fails.&nbsp; They are harmless but annoying.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may think something is wrong when there is not or be afraid the files are really needed.&nbsp; To avoid confusion you can delete the temporary folders.</p>
<p><br />
If your installation failed or the installation does not delete the randomly named folder when it completes running and you run the installation again, the installation again will make another randomly named folder.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes you will see several folders like this and they can all be deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may be able to identify the installation (for curiosity) by looking at some of the folder contents and decide if that installation was okay, just delete the files/folders.&nbsp; If the installation did not work&nbsp;properly for some reason, running the installation
 again will just create a new randomly named temporary folder so the old temporary folder is really of no use.<br />
<br />
Sometimes the folders are stubborn to delete.&nbsp; Even if you are an Administrator on the system you may get a "sharing violation", "access denied", "being used" or similar type message when trying to remove the&nbsp;temporary folders.&nbsp; Installations sometimes use
 different permissions than a regular user with Administrator group might have.<br />
<br />
There are many methods to try to remove the folders and some involve third party programs to install or changing certain Windows settings that may compromise your system security if you don't change them back when you are done.<br />
<br />
Booting your system in Safe Mode (pressing the F8 key repeatedly right before Windows tries to load) is a good first method to try and remove the folders since it doesn't involve making any changes to&nbsp;your system configuration or downloading any third party
 programs.<br />
<br />
"If none of the above work a popular third party tool called Unlocker" is helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make a System Restore point before installing Unlocker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unlocker can be downloaded from here:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/iobit_unlocker.html<br />
<br />
You may need to use Internet Explorer to get Unlocker to download properly.<br />
<br />
Do not be tempted to download any other software that promises some miracle on your system.&nbsp; Just download the correct Unlocker for your system (either 32 bit or 64 bit).<br />
<br />
Pay attention when installing Unlocker since it wants to add a bunch of options, addons, shortcuts, and other extras you don't need, for example:<br />
<br />
UNcheck the box to install the Babylon Toolbar and click Next<br />
UNcheck the box to Check for Unlocker updates<br />
UNcheck the box to install the Unlocker Assistant<br />
<br />
DO check the box to install the Explorer Shell extension (you are going to need that)<br />
<br />
Click Install, you do not need to reboot.<br />
<br />
The reason you need to add the Explorer Shell Extension is so when you right click on the offending folder, you will have an Unlocker option to choose.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Explorer Shell Extensions help make up the right click menu when you look at a file or folder.<br />
<br />
Right click one of the offending folders and choose Unlocker, then choose the Action (that would be delete) and click OK and you should see a Success&nbsp;message and the folder should be gone.<br />
<br />
I would just install Unlocker long enough to clean up those leftovers and then, I then generally use Add/Remove Programs to uninstall Unlocker and all parts of it.&nbsp; You can always&nbsp;install it again some other day if you need to.<br />
<br />
Unlocker can be uninstalled when you are finished using it.<br />
<br />
Reboot when you are finished to be sure the annoying folders are really gone.<br />
