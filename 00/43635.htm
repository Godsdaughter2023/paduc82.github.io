<h2>            Application &#40;Voice Recorder&#41; Opens then Closes&#63;&#63;&#33;</h2>
                    I am so baffled that every application seems to open normally but Voice Recorder. When I click on it from the task bar or from a desktop icon, it will pop up for a few seconds then seemingly close. I've used it quite frequently in the past and I'm not
 sure why it's now not working. What do I do to keep it open?

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Fonts and Colors Not Displaying Correctly</h2>
                    <p>I'm not used to Windows 8 at all, and now I'm having all sorts of problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first, I only had font errors. I believe this is because I installed a lot of fonts at once on my computer for work. Now, when I turn my computer on, all text on my computer changes to symbols. My font in Chrome, Firefox, etc. has changed to Helvetica.
 I have tried to restore font settings, and I've reinstalled the Windows 8 default fonts, but that is only a temporary solution until I turn off my computer and turn it on again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning, I'm having color display errors on top of the font problems. Everything that should be black is bright blue, and other color tints are wrong. What should I do?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's first of all,&nbsp;diagnose if there is any corruption in Windows files and check. To do so, I would suggest you to run System File Checker tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Press <strong>Windows</strong> key + <strong>X</strong> and click
<strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Type the following command and press <strong>Enter</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>sfc /scannow</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> Do not close this Command Prompt window until the verification is 100% complete. The scan results will be shown after this process is finished.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If there are no errors and you still face the issue, try to create a new user account to test and check if it's working fine in the new user account. To do so, you may click on the link below and follow the steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Press <strong>Windows</strong> key + <strong>R</strong> to open
<strong>RUN</strong> box</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Under <strong>How will this person sign-in</strong> windows, click the option at the bottom
<strong>Sign in without a Microsoft account (not recommended)</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>On the next window click <strong>Local Account
</strong>at the bottom</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Choose a user name (use password if you want to or you can leave the password section blank as it is just to test)</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Click <strong>Next</strong> and then click <strong>
Finish</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>As you click Finish, the previous <strong>User Accounts
</strong>window remains on the screen</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Select newly created user and click <strong>Properties</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Click <strong>Group Membership </strong>tab</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Click to select <strong>Administrator</strong> and click
<strong>Other</strong> and select <strong>Administrator </strong>from drop-down menu</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Click <strong>Apply</strong> and then click <strong>
OK</strong></span></span></p>

<h2>            0x82d40007</h2>
                    Hello, we receive the following message when we try to play a game. ' To play this, the owner needs to sign in. Alternatively, guests can play if the owner makes this their home Xbox ( 0x8240007).' This message doesn't appear when we try to play other
 games. My profile is set to automatically sign on when the Xbox is turned on so we're confused as to why it's showing that the owner needs to sign on. Thank you!

            <p>As the error message states, do you actually&nbsp;own the game? This appears an error for a digital title, and the system isn't seeing the currently signed-in account as the one that bought the game. If someone was&nbsp;gamesharing this game with you by setting your Xbox as their "<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/games/game-setup/my-home-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Home Xbox</a>", maybe they have recently changed their account password. You will need to have them sign on to your Xbox with their updated password, if this is the case.</p><p><br /></p><p>If you are indeed the owner of the game, then this could be a minor problem with profiles and licensing.

                    I want to run turbo c++ or turbo c in my windows 7 pc with the help of windows xp mode. But when I try to run turbo C++ a message displays as "The video device failed to initialize for fullscreen mode. Choose 'Close' to terminate the application". Why
 can't I run turbo C++ in fullscreen? I'm a student and want to work with graphics mode. So without being running in fullscreen I cannot run the necessary graphics C files

<h3> davenisbett  say:</h3>
<h2>            Admin rights lost after windows 10 update</h2>
                    <p>My Laptop did a windows 10 update overnight on 1st/2nd June and now whenever I try to do something that requires Administrator rights I get "<span>file system error (-1073741571). Everything works fine in Safe Mode but not in normal mode. I have
 tried restore to a restore point, SFC, DSIM and a Clean Boot (disabling all the non-Microsoft services and start-ups) but the problem continues.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I asked for help from Microsoft support and they have just advised to do a fresh reinstall of Windows 10. which would be a pain.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I am not very knowledgeable on this stuff but given that administrator tasks work ok in Safe Mode I would have thought there would be some way to track what is different in normal mode and identify the issue..</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would appreciate any suggestions on how I might be able to repair this situation without doing a complete re-install of Windows and any thoughts on what is different from Safe Mode to Normal mode that I may be missing.</span></p>

            Hi Dave.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Try this:  
<br />
<br />Right click Start button to open Run box, copy and paste in netplwiz, press Enter.
<br />
<br />Highlight your account, then click Properties, then Group Membership tab.  click on Administrator, then Apply, OK, restart PC.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help then try this: <a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/fix-lost-administrative-rights-in-windows-10#comment-334148" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.kapilarya.com/fix-lost-administrati...</a>
<br />
<br />If nothing helps try creating a new Local Admin Account to sign into to see if it works:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a-new-local-user-account-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a...</a>
<br />
<br />If you can't get the rights to do this then use whichever method works here to enable the hidden Built-in Administrator to be used only in emergencies:  <a href="http://www.top-password.com/blog/4-ways-to-enable-built-in-administrator-account-on-windows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.top-password.com/blog/4-ways-to-enab...</a>.  
<br />
<br />Sign into Hidden Admin account, set up new Local Admin Account, sign into it, move your files over, set it up, hide the Hidden Admin Account, when ready delete the old account in Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family and Other Users.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi Greg</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your quick reply and suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since my initial posting I have been told that the laptop (a Lenovo Flex 2 Pro-15) has not been tested for the Windows version 1803 and no drivers produced for it.&nbsp; I don't know if that could be behind the problem we are having but I have had a similar problem
 with another Lenovo laptop some months ago so it makes me suspicious.&nbsp; The laptop is 3 years old and I am surprised if Lenovo have given up on it already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought it would be worth trying to undo the 1803 version upgrade by using the "go back to previous version"&nbsp; option on the Updates &amp; Security setting page but that doesn't appear to work.&nbsp; We just get a revolving cursor for a few seconds and then nothing
 more happens.&nbsp; Disappointing.&nbsp; I don't know if there is any other way to achieve that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried your first suggestion using Newplwiz which it allowed me to do but the problem remains. We still get&nbsp;<span>file system error (-1073741571) when trying to run the command prompt in admin mode.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't understand the second suggestion involving loading Hive and am concerned about messing with the registry if I don't understand what is happening.&nbsp; If maybe you could explain what those steps are doing then I could feel more confident to do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks again for your input.</p>
<p>rgds</p>
<p>Dave</p>

            I. Wonder if there is a significance to the fact that the command prompt with administration rights works OK in Safe Mode therefore something must be causing the problem during the full boot?

            Dave, that could be account corruption which we see a lot in Windows 10, unlike WIndows 7 where it hardly showed up at all.
<br />
<br />A way to test this is to create a new Local Admin Account and check if the problem persists:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a-new-local-user-account-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a...</a>
<br />
<br />If not then you can move your files over, when ready delete the old account in Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family and Other Users.  If it's a MS Account you can convert the new account then in Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; My Info.

            I'm going to recommend you reinstall the last version the worked for you.  Older version media here:  <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>
<br />Burn to DVD  or create bootable 8+gb flash stick installer using this tool installed to Windows:  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56485" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/detail...</a>
<br />
<br />Then follow the illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want to try first with the latest ISO since you're going to wipe the drive anyway (to get it cleanest) then often that will correct things.  At least you'll know for sure if it can run on that PC.  But there is likely a reason Lenovo isn't supporting latest version on a 3 year old PC.  This is becoming a problem for folks.  
<br />
<br />If you go back to the old version you can hide newer versions using Hide Updates tool or a Metered Connection:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want to continue trying to fix things then I wouldn't worry about messing it up because you're most likely going to need to reinstall anyway.  All the fixes for your stated issues are in the thread.  Ask back any questions.

<p>Thank you so much Greg for your input and advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just managed to get the rollback to previous version of Windows (version 1709) to work by starting it from Safe Mode and the problems seem to be resolved - hurrah.&nbsp; I have run the programme to temporarily block the offending upgrade (version 1803)
 from running and it hasn't even shown up as pending..... well not yet anyway.&nbsp; I will set&nbsp; Metered Connection and run my PC for a while to check all OK.&nbsp; I'll try to stay with version 1709 for now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again and fingers crossed.</p>

<h3> sambul71  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Update Error 0x80072ee2</h2>
                    <p>I had Windows 64-bit SP1 running Windows Update Client 7.6.7600.256 without any issues. After the new Windows Update Client 7.6.7600.320 was recently installed, no more updates via MS Update Server: error 0x80072ee2 (internet timeout).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know there're many threads about this and similar update errors, including advices to use Update Troubleshooter, Update Audit (Readiness) package, add MS Update sites to Firewall or switch FW/AV off, delete certain registry keys, run TDSSKiller, switch
 to Autoupdates, reset network, run System Checker etc. After using all that, including Windows upgrade via Install DVD - nothing really worked for most users and me, not much specifics in the logs either, apart from one typical forum answer: "the problem mysteriously
 disappeared". This simply means, MS fixed the issue on their end.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>I run SFC / Scannow, that fixed some issues not related to updates. Then switched the service
<em>Windows Modules Installe</em>r from <em>Manual</em> to <em>Automatic</em> and
<em>Started</em> it. Rebooted, checked again for updates - and it works!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it doesn't work for you - enable <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2545723/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>Debug Level Windows Installer &amp; Update logs</strong></a> to get more error details. "Temporary connection-related errors" if endlessly repeated means in practice "I don't know why it fails".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interesting part is - neither <em>Windows Update Troubleshooter</em>, no <em>Windows Update Audit (Readiness)&nbsp;Tool</em> switch that service back to Automatic Startup, and therefore couldn't fix the issue despite marking&nbsp;it as Fixed or "No problems found".
 I still wonder, what update switched that service to Manual startup - probably <em>
Windows Update Client 7.6.7600.320</em> install?</p>

<h2>            Text-to-speech not working and Cortana isn&#39;t talking</h2>
                    <p>I installed Windows 10 Education N recently&nbsp;and noticed that Cortana doesn't talk. She gives me answers only in written format. The region and language are both set to English UK. I checked text-to-speech in the Settings app and the Preview button does nothing,
 however, the Preview Voice button for text-to-speech in Control Panel works properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Found a solution myself, because I was trying to fix my computer not being able to read my phone's memory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed the Windows 10 Media Feature Pack. It didn't come with the N version of Windows, so I had to download and install it myself.</p>

    <title>Where is a good Win7 Services.msc guide&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bob is interested  say:</h3>
<h2>            Where is a good Win7 Services.msc guide&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Like any thinking person I don't want unnecessary crud running in the background if not needed.&nbsp; I love a lean machine.&nbsp; So i need a guide that explains what each and every service does so I can determine if I need it running now or in the future if things
 change.&nbsp; I've gone through website after website and they're all the same so far.&nbsp; They copy and paste the legaleze from Microsoft as the description.&nbsp; That is useless.&nbsp; I need a thinking enthusiast's guide.&nbsp; Like if I don't have a wireless LAN connected I
 probably don't need anything related to wireless running.&nbsp; If I don't care what time it is I don't need&nbsp; Windows Time.&nbsp; If I don't need remote "help" I won't need anything that involves someone else having control over my computer (Remote whatever).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Make sense?&nbsp; How about some recommendations from websites that aren't so gutless.&nbsp; Something that actually has some point.&nbsp; I cannot understand why people keep putting out their guides when they do nothing different from all the other useless guides out
 there.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Bill, did you even read my post?&nbsp; Did I not say I wanted a guide that has real explanations?&nbsp; Black Viper has NOTHING of the sort.&nbsp; They have just the description from Microsoft.&nbsp; What good is that?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is their page on Active X Installer, the first service on their list.&nbsp; Choose Windows 7 from the top tabs.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>http://www.blackviper.com/windows-services/activex-installer-axinstsv</p>
<p>See?&nbsp; The only description is the "Default Description".&nbsp; Here's what it says:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Provides User Account Control validation for the installation of ActiveX controls from the Internet and enables management of ActiveX control installation based on Group Policy settings. This service is started on demand and if disabled the installation
 of ActiveX controls will behave according to default browser settings."</p>
<p>The typical Windows user doesn't know what Active X even does and almost nobody has ever used Group Policy.&nbsp; So nothing here has any relevance to them.&nbsp; It is totally and completely useless to at least 95% of Windows users.&nbsp; Probably about 98%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We need to understand exactly what the service does so we can ascertain if we need it for our usage.&nbsp; Not some generalized drivel prepared by lawyers from Microsoft.&nbsp; Services.msc is a fantastic tool that almost no users ever use and this is the reason so
 many people upgrade hardware unnecessarily thinking their older stuff isn't up to the task when all the while all they had&nbsp; to do was stop 20 or more things from running in the background they don't need or want.&nbsp; But the individual services in Services.msc
 are also very poorly described by Microsoft both in the program and online.&nbsp; That is why so few people use it.&nbsp; Bad communication.&nbsp; Wow....a techie with less than stellar communication; what a surprise.&nbsp; This is also a reason many people leave Windows for
 Apple.&nbsp; They are making a huge mistake not realizing that by managing their computer better this wouldn't be necessary or even remotely desirable.&nbsp; I meet so many Apple people that switched that can't give any valid reason for doing so when asked.&nbsp; Help people
 manage well and you keep them a valued customer for a lifetime.&nbsp; That's smart business.&nbsp; Microsoft is not thinking like a customer.&nbsp;

<h2>            HP Slimline 260-P020il</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>My-Self is Dinesh. I have purchased a Desktop &nbsp;as mentioned in subject line with free DOS. Now the problem is from the vary first day , I am trying to install Win-10 Home Edition or Professional in this machine but got no success. So I have registered a
 complain in HP customer care, after some days they sent their engineer, he checked the system and tried to install Win-10, but got no success. After some days, he cam back and again checked the system by replacing parts such as motherboard,hard disk,RAM and
 bios Cell also, but got no success. So he take back the system in service center but their they also go no success. Every time we are getting a Blue Dump.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now HP is saying that the issue is in the Operating System and not with the hardware. But as per my experience , this machine is not compatible to Win-10. I have ask them to show me running win-10 at any other system of same configuration, but they are denying.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per HP System is compatible to Win-10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you pls guide me about the actual problem may be.</p>

<p>Which version of Windows 10 are you trying to install, 1607 or 1703? Its possible you need to install a specific version of Windows 10.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 - Acer Revo RL70 - No HDMI Audio device at all - High Definition Audio Controller issue</h2>
                    Hi everyone,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Am really stumped at the moment and looked through here a fair but as well as the old GoogleÂ® but have been unable to find a solution so far.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm using an Acer Revo RL 70 which uses a Radeon HD 6320 card. After a lot of installing and uninstalling AMD drivers (including trying to update drivers manually) and getting nowhere I thought I'd try the Realtek AMD drivers which a lot of people in forums
 suggested. Ran the installer and it says it can't find any device that's compatible. Whenever I run the AMD Catalyst Driver setups it never states/offers HDMI audio as an option to select/install?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Also in the Device manager, High Definition Audio Controller has an exclamation mark next to it saying the device cannot start (Error Code 10). I also never have any HDMI/AMDm device of sorts showing in playback devices. Only SPDIF and normal audio out.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm getting picture to my TV fine and when I was using Openelec it all worked fine with audio so it's not the TV or hardware failure just to rule that out.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Then what I finally tried doing was disabling audio in the BIOS and loaded Windows and it doesn't show any audio devices but still shows&nbsp;High Definition Audio Controller with an exclamation mark. How/why is this happening? It's obviously not part of the
 video card or it wouldn't have shown anything like the others devices now aren't available.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm very confused and furstrated at not being able to get this to work and hoping another RL70 out there might have this all working fine and to find out how they did it? Or to just get any suggestions from any kind enough to help/offer some advice.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks for your time in reading this and look forward to some replies/suggestions hopefully :)</div>
                </div>

            I have resolved the issue and audio works fine now in Windows 8.1!
<div><br />
<div>The Acer Revo RL70 comes in two flavours - one with Linux and one with Windows and it seems they each have their own BIOS!</div>
<div><br />
<div>I was on a BIOS for Linux.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The procedure I did was download the following BIOS files from:</div>
<div><a href="http://www.acer.co.uk/ac/en/GB/content/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.acer.co.uk/ac/en/GB/content/drivers</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>Find the Revo RL70 and click BIOS.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>You will see 4 options. I downloaded the two:</div>

I think you'd be ok with just updating straight away to the PO1.A2 but I did the PO1.A1L first and then the PO1.A2.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Only after flashing to PO1.A2 did I suddenly get sound working (I had already installed the official RL 70 Drivers for audio and video)</div>
<div><br />
<div>I got so frsutrated with this so thought I'd share to save someone else the hassle!</div>

            <p>So that actually never worked. Was a coincidence and after a clean install I lost it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now have the fix!</p>
<p>
I had something similiar where I had noticed no matter which driver I installed it would always show "High Definition Audio Controller" with an exclamation mark and it was driving me crazy as couldn't get HDMI to be recognised for audio - only video (ie extend
 or mirror displays worked fine).<br />
<br />
I have now worked out it's def a driver conflict between what appears to be Microsoft's standard driver for audio (that comes with Windows 8 via online driver collection) and realtek or amd drivers (when you try to install either of them).<br />
<br />
I finally had a eureka moment this weekend and started a new install of Windows 8.1 BUT this is what I did:<br />
1. I disabled the onboard sound via the BIOS<br />
2. I went through the windows setup but on setup I chose customize settings rather than express settings - in here you need to ensure (for now) that it won't try and find/download and install drivers via windows update so turn this off for now<br />
3. Now when I finished the rest of the setup and got into Windows I simply downloaded the realtek AMD driver from: http://www.realtek.com.tw/downloads/down...Down=false<br />
Select "ATI HDMI Audio Device" (2.70) and run and install this.&nbsp;<br />
4. Restart your PC and you will have the HDMI audio working now. I tested this with the AMD Catalyst Drivers too and it did work ok too but I'd read in a few places it was better to use the Realtek driver as it was better(?).<br />
<br />
I have tested and DTS and Dolby Digital definitely work fine (all my amp can support - it's old!).<br />
<br />
Anyways it is all working fine and I know if I ever need to rebuild or anything that I can confidently get it working fine.

            <p>I've FINALLY found a solution on my Windows 10 Pro Asus laptop, but it may also work for 8.1 and 7, since I believe the procedure is the same.</p>
<p>After eight months of having this issue, I've finally managed to fix the problem and the audio is smoother than ever! Like you all, I've been told the same in every single website, "get into the Device Manager and try to update the driver", or to Uninstall/Reinstall
 the High Definition Audio Device, but this does not solve the issue nor it removes the yellow exclamation mark on the Device Manager. The trick that finally worked (at least for me, and I'm pretty sure it'll work for everyone) was:</p>
<p>1. Find the reference of your Intel HD Graphics card -Which in my case is 4400 and I believe this is the most common reference so most of you might have the same- on the intel website, and download the zip file not the exe -you get both options- then unzip
 it. (Make sure you donwload the lastest driver, for your OS, I found mine here https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/81496/Intel-HD-Graphics-4600-for-4th-Generation-Intel-Core-Processors use one of the first 3 results, those that say "lastest", read the
 text under each option and then you pick if Windows 7, 8.1 or 10)</p>
<p>2. Go to the Device Manager by clicking the right mouse button on the start button, or find your way to ir trough the Control Panel, then on the Sound -and others- drivers section find the one with the yellow-exclamation-marked</p>
<p>High Definition Audio Device.</p>
<p>3. Double click it, then go to Properties&gt;Update Driver but here's the trick, here you go for the search on your own pc option, not the search on internet one, and on the directory text you search and change whatever is there for the folder we just unzipped,
 wherever it is, and click on the search on sub-folders option, then you type Next, and THE EXCLAMATION MARK IS GONE! But also you may notice that the High Definition Audio Device name was changed for something like "Intel Audio for Displays" or something like
 that -I've every name in spanish since I'm in Colombia- and the issue is gone.</p>
<p>4. It seems that this doesn't make the audio switch -from the speakers to HDMI, being it a TV por example- automatically so you'll have to do it manually but still, YOU'LL GET SOUND BUDDY! so here's what we gotta do to switch it manually:</p>
<p>5. Go to Control Panel&gt;Audio Device Manager&gt;Playback </p>
<p>6. Right click on the TV -It usually shows the name of the TV- and click on Set as Defaulf, and you'll suddenly hear Paul McCartney's voice breaking the ethernal silence that ruled for so many time, well at least that's how it was for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>LINK:</p>
<p>https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/81496/Intel-HD-Graphics-4600-for-4th-Generation-Intel-Core-Processors</p>
<p>
</p><p>
By the way it may also simply work by installing the exe but this fixes the isolated audio problem, keeping your video card's driver intact and therefore your settings.</p>

    <title>Xbox one controller not connecting after battery dies - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dino yoshi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox one controller not connecting after battery dies</h2>
                    So I have an issue with my xbox one when the controller runs out of battery power and the message "please reconnect your controller" appears. Turning on a second fully charged controller and pairing it to the console doesn't allow me to cot mine my cod
 ghosts game although when you push the centre controller xbox button it brings up the option to shut down the console or the controller. The only way to get the controller to pair is to turn off the console and power it back on again. Very odd. Microsoft tech
 support have looked it as an issue but has anyone else had this issue and resolved it? Thanks

<p>I noticed the same thing. &nbsp;I have 2 controllers. &nbsp;If I am playing CoD and one controller dies, if I turn the second controller on, the game is not responsive and continues to say "olease reconnect controller". &nbsp;I had to frantically run and get new batteries
 to put back in the first controller to continue playing. &nbsp;I could not believe they have designed it this way. &nbsp;The second controller had fully charged batteries and work on the dashboard but DO NOT work in the game!</p>
<p>I don't know if this affects other games but I tested it again on CoD and it happened again. &nbsp;I believe it has to do something with the controllers being tied to profiles. &nbsp;Not sure though, that's the only thing I can think of. &nbsp;Or its just **** design (more
 likely).</p>
<p>This is one of the perks of having 2 controllers. &nbsp;If one dies, you quickly can use the other one. &nbsp;WTF Microsoft!</p>
<p>I loved the 360, but the dislikes I'm having with the Xbox One is getting worse by the day!</p>

<p>If the second control could control your COD hero any time, a friend handling the second controller could mess you up. You would both be playing the same guy. The control of your COD guy has to be linked to one controller or fights would erupt.</p>

<p>Very true MGreenway regarding swapping the batteries but still a silly issue as it should give you the option to sync another controller with the game/profile in use. &nbsp;I agree there may be issues around someone else using a 2nd controller and impacting gameplay
 but the 360 managed to sync up a controller and continue play and since Microsoft are selling us the next generation of gaming I would expect this to have the option as well. &nbsp;All new consoles have teething issues but this is a big flaw as well as the poor
 response of the dashboard and difficulty locating some messages, as well as the 4 weeks battlefield 4 wouldn't allow online gaming (although down to the software house/etc) and does paint Microsoft not in a positive light in my book. The 360 is currently a
 more user friendly console and perhaps Microsoft should focus more on the dashboard and other niggling issues. &nbsp;Personally I would have preferred to wait a bit instead of getting day 1 release as I'm not that impressed with the overall console compared to
 the 360 launch. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Also Cod Ghosts is the 2nd worst Cod game after black ops 2, talk about serious camping! &nbsp;Spoils the game and very boring. &nbsp; Why can't they make decent cod games for multiplayer anymore since MW2 and MW3? &nbsp;I think cod has had it's day now and so far nothing
 can beat battlefield 3 &amp; 4 for multiplayer FPS. </p>

<p>I understand that two controllers cannot control one guy but if I am playing alone and my controller dies, the second controller should automatically take over the first player when turned on. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The 360 does this and it makes sense and is very useful</p>

<p>I hate this also, I want same setup like 360. I tried to replace the dead batteries on the dead controller but got locked out of system totally and I had to do complete restart to get controllers to work again. I sure hope they fix this issue.</p>

<h2>            Error&#58; &#34;Win32 dll&#34; After i installed the latest nvidia driver. </h2>
                    
<p>My specs:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Windows Vista Home Premium 64-bit</p>
<p>- 4GB ram</p>
<p>- Core 2 Duo E8400</p>
<p>- Geforce 260GTX</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've installed and activated my Windows Vista along with service pack 2. I've downloaded and installed all the latest drivers from my motherboard website.</p>
<p>Problem: I downloaded the latest nvidia driver for my graphics card and once i reboot my windows displays error message saying "win32 dll" is not working and my bottom task bar is full of that message. Also my pc is extremely slow. I somehow make it to "system
 restore point" i restore to another restore point.</p>
<p>Once my pc finished restoring to a different point, my pc is working fine. So i installed an older version for my graphics driver and it worked fine. Reboot and stills works fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Question; What is wrong with my pc? is it my graphics card, driver, something that i didn't do, and how do i fix the problem?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thank you for your help</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Corrupted profile data associated with the game and availability of updates for the game are two of the primary factors that we have to take into consideration when troubleshooting issues with launching a game on Windows 10. Here are troubleshooting solutions
 that you may perform to resolve this concern:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Solution 1: Run troubleshooter</em></p>
<p>The Windows apps troubleshooter can help resolve issues with apps and games downloaded from the Windows Store. In addition, we also suggest running the
<strong>Program Compatibility Troubleshooter</strong> to help diagnose and resolve compatibility issues encountered when running games on Windows 10. Refer to the following links for the steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/69e76f90-d54c-44cf-9851-c2d1542790db/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Run the troubleshooter for Windows apps</a></li><li><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/15078/windows-make-older-programs-compatible" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Make older programs compatible with this version of Windows</a></li></ul>
<p><em>Solution 2: Check for game update</em></p>
<p>If you've downloaded the game from the Windows Store, kindly search if there are updates available for the game. As for the steps, see
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/b5e4e2e4-cc9d-47ef-8782-7a1c81e735ef/check-for-updates-for-apps-and-games-from-windows-store" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Check for updates for apps and games from Windows Store</a>. </p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Solution 3: Reset the game from the <strong>Settings</strong> menu.</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Click<strong> Start </strong>and click <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>System</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Apps &amp; features</strong>.</li><li>Find the game and click <strong>Advanced options</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Reset</strong>.</li><li>Restart your device so that the changes can take effect. Launch the game and check if you'll encounter the same issue.â€‹â€‹</li></ol>
<p>Resetting the game from the <strong>Settings</strong> menu can help restore corrupted game installation files.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Solution 4: Delete Temporary files</em></p>
<p>Temporary files are automatically deleted after exiting an application or a game. However, restarting your computer without exiting an active Windows session won't delete temporary files. These files may cause issues running games on Windows 10. To resolve
 this, we suggest that you perform the following steps on how to remove temporary files:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Open the <strong>Start</strong> menu and select
<strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>System</strong> &gt; <strong>Storage</strong>.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Under <strong>Storage</strong>, select
<strong>This PC</strong> &gt; <strong>Temporary files</strong>.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Under <strong>Temporary files</strong>, select
<strong>Delete temporary files</strong> &gt; <strong>Yes, I'm sure</strong>. </span>
</li><li><span>Restart your device so that the changes can take effect. Launch the game and check if the same instance occurs.
</span></li></ol>
<p><span>Keep us updated with the progress. We'd be glad to further assist you.</span></p>
<p>

<h2>            0xc000000f &#92;Boot&#92;BCD - During Clean Win7 Install</h2>
                    <p>I was doing a clean install of Windows 7 on my laptop last night.&nbsp; During its first normal reset, it reset and displayed this error:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows Boot Manager</p>
<p><br />
Windows failed to start. A recent hardware or software chance miht be the cause. To fix the problem:</p>
<p><br />
1. Insert your windows installation disc and restart your computer.<br />
2. Choose your language settings and click "Next."<br />
3. Click "Repair your computer."<br />
<br />
Status: 0xc000000f<br />
<br />
Info: An error occurred while attepting to read the boot configuration data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>None of my F keys do anything and the Windows installation disk IS inserted but not being read i guess.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the best course of action?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>

            <p>Hi <strong>Daniel,</strong> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community forums and thank you for posting the question. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It looks like you are unable to perform clean installation of Windows 7 and getting an error&nbsp;code "0xc000000f".

<h2>            Need Win 7 Driver for Radio Shack USB to Serial Cable</h2>
                    I have Radio Shack USB to Serial Cable 26-183.&nbsp; It came with&nbsp;CD-ROM to install drivers for Win XP.&nbsp; It does not work with Win 7.&nbsp; I even tried to install in Win XP compatiblity mode but that didn't work (I think that may work for software programs but
 not hardware drivers).&nbsp; Anyhow, does anyone have info on how I can get this cable to work with my Win 7 computer?

    <title>CD drive &#34;not found&#34; through Remote Desktop connection - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> carlsor  say:</h3>
<h2>            CD drive &#34;not found&#34; through Remote Desktop connection</h2>
                    
<p>I have a newly assembled media computer for playing music from ripped CDs and internet music streaming into my HiFi system.&nbsp; There is no room for a monitor and keyboard in my Stereo equipment cabinet so I want to control the computer from a laptop using
 Remote Desktop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This works quite well except that if I put a music CD into the media computer - the drive cannot be seen if it is controlled by the laptop using Remote Desktop.&nbsp; If I locally log into to the media computer the music CD can be seen, played, ripped, etc.</p>
<p>What configuration do I need to change?&nbsp; Is this a Windows 7 bug?....Thanks</p>
