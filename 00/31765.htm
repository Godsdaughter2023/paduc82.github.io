<h2>            Windows 10 Search &#40;Indexing&#41; Network Share</h2>
                    <p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After upgrading my old Windows 7 Enterprise X64 to Windows 10 Enterprise (LTSB), I lost the ability to search the network drives. With my old Windows 7 setup, I was able to include shared folders in my "Libraries", and this would automatically "index" all
 those shared folders, files and even the contents of files. It would take seconds to find what I am looking for in thousands of files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After upgrading to Windows 10, we lost that feature. I am very disappointed the way that Explorer is designed in Windows 10. The search function is only looking for local files and the internet!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what I've done so far;</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Make sure that "Windows Search" service is running and the indexing is functional.</p>
<p>- Enable "Libraries" in Windows 10. (As they decided to disable it by default! Why?? It was a beautiful technology and now we need to use "favorites" ??)</p>
<p>- Make sure that the source of shared folders (file servers) are all indexed properly.</p>
<p>- Add shared folders under "libraries"</p>
<p>- Reset/rebuild indexing</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am out of ideas and this is really a big deal for my day to day tasks. I don't want to install another 3rd party search tool on my workstation &amp; I don't want to go back to Windows 7.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I admit it, even tough it's not at a level that I thought it would be, Windows 10 makes a great operating system. :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance to all.</p>

 &nbsp;. This problem occurs with a fresh install of Windows 7 64 bit and has been happening since Windows 7 beta. This error does not occur under the following circumstances:<br />
<br />
-Any other OS, including Windows 7 32-bit<br />
-Wireless NIC unplugged, or otherwise disabled<br />
<br />
I usually notice the error to trigger much more frequently when downloading files, but it has also been known to occur while the computer is idle. As advised on this post&nbsp;<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/fi-FI/w7hardware/thread/f09c904a-2910-4629-937c-e8ded17f02a1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>
 &nbsp;I have tried running the computer in safe mode and turning off all non essential services, but the problem still persists. Also I have tried flushdns with no success.</span>

Limit how many programs load at startup
<div>
<p>Many programs are designed to load automatically when <span>Windows</span> starts. Software manufacturers often set their programs to open in the background, where you can’t see them running, so they’ll open right away when you click their icons. That's
 helpful for programs you use a lot, but for programs you rarely or never use, this wastes precious memory and slows down the time it takes
<span>Windows</span> to finish loading.</p>
<p>Decide for yourself if you want a program to load at startup.</p>
<p>But how can you tell what programs load automatically at startup? Sometimes this is obvious, because the program will add an icon to the notification area on the taskbar, where you can see it running. Look there and see if there are any programs running
 that you don’t want to load automatically. Position your mouse over each icon to see the program name. Be sure to click the Show hidden icons button so you don’t miss any icons.</p>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres2.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2fWindows%2520Vista%2fMain%2f7%2f7%2f7704e102-acb8-40b0-b28e-0bbcba515daf%2f7704e102-acb8-40b0-b28e-0bbcba515daf.png" /><span>The
 Show hidden icons button in the notification area</span></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even after you check the notification area, you might still have missed some programs that load automatically at startup. You can find and disable them using
<span>Windows</span> Defender.</p>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres2.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2fWindows%2520Vista%2fMain%2fb%2f4%2fb4e845e9-ee8c-44e2-970d-a19b929eb81b%2fb4e845e9-ee8c-44e2-970d-a19b929eb81b.png" /><span>The
 Software Explorer screen in <span>Windows</span> Defender shows which programs automatically start when you launch
<span>Windows</span></span></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you’re unsure about whether a program should open automatically at startup, you can try disabling it, restarting your computer, and then using the program. If that causes any problems with the program, you can go back and re-enable it to start automatically.</p>
<p>For instructions how to use <span>Windows</span> Defender to check for programs that open automatically, see
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Stop-a-program-from-running-automatically-when-Windows-starts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

Note
<p>Some people prefer to manage which programs load at startup using the System Configuration tool. For more information, see

<p><span>This utility, which has the most comprehensive knowledge of auto-starting locations of any startup monitor, shows you what programs are configured to run during system
 bootup or login, and shows you the entries in the order Windows processes them. These programs include ones in your startup folder, Run, RunOnce, and other Registry keys. You can configure
<em><span>Autoruns</span></em> to show other locations, including Explorer shell extensions, toolbars, browser helper objects, Winlogon notifications, auto-start services, and much more.
<em><span>Autoruns</span></em> goes way beyond the MSConfig utility bundled with Windows Me and XP.</span></p>

<h2>            Batch resize Photos with Windows 10</h2>
                    Hello. Is there a way of resizing multiple photos at the same time using any of the Windows 10 picture apps or programs? This was easy in Windows 7 but I cannot find a means of doing it with Windows 10? Doing them one by one is painfully slow so I hope
 there is a quick means of batch resize. Thank you for your help.

            <p>In the Xbox App, you need to go to Game DVR then hit "Shared" to take the view off "On this PC". Can you see the clip there?</p>
<p>If not, you can on your console upload the full clip using Upload Studio which will upload it both to Game DVR again but also OneDrive (if you tick the box), then you could download it from either place and upload to YouTube. It's a workaround but at least it would work.</p>

<h2>            Surface Pen skipping &#38; Eraser not working</h2>
                    <p>I noticed these problems a few days ago. Recently my Surface pen has been skipping - leaving gaps in the lines that I draw. My eraser also won't work at all and the cursor for it does not show up, but I can still bring up One Note by clicking it. Could my
 pen's battery be dying? I've had this Surface Book since 2015 and I've never replaced the battery or the pen tip.</p>
<p>*update: I just checked my pen's battery and it's at 24%.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When Surface Pens encounter this kind of concern, it could be caused by either software or hardware issues. Let's try and resolve this by following these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Check for Windows updates.</p>
<p>2. Restart your Surface.</p>
<p>3. Re-seat the Surface Pen's tip.</p>
<p>4. Re-seat the AAAA battery in the Pen.</p>
<p>5. Replace the AAAA battery.</p>
<p>6. Test inking in a known good app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The steps above should enable you to write using the Surface Pen without issues. Keep us updated with the results.</p>

<p>original title: Windows 7 Operating System Error</p>
<p>I've got windows 7 home premium on a pretty much brand new laptop (had it about a month) and i got up this morning to check my e-mail...and there waiting for me was a black screen with a whole bunch of technical jargon and the words "operating system not
 found".&nbsp; I shut down, went into safe mode, everything seemed fine, and restarted...and still everything seems fine. There has to be a reason this happened, but by antivirus program can't find anything, I haven't changed my daily routine online, i haven't downloaded
 anything questionable... I'm not the most computer savvy person in the world, so can someone help?</p>

<p>It could have been a glitch or you might have an intermittent problem with your hard disk. If this was my machine then I would download and run the disk diagnostic program that its manufacturer has on his home site. If you cannot readily find out the brand
 then you can use the script below. Here is how to use it:</p>
<p>1. Right-click an empty spot on your desktop, then left-click New, then click Text Document.<br />
2. Name it disk.vbs. Make sure to overwrite the .txt extension.<br />
3. Right-click it again, then click Edit.<br />
4. Copy and past the code below into this file.<br />
5. Save and close it.<br />
6. Double-click it. You will see its various parameters.</p>
<p>Set objWMIService = GetObject("winmgmts:\\.\root\CIMV2") <br />
Set colItems = objWMIService.ExecQuery( _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "SELECT * FROM Win32_DiskDrive",,48) <br />
For Each objItem in colItems <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sReply = sReply &amp; vbLF &amp; "Manufacturer: " &amp; objItem.Caption<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sReply = sReply &amp; vbLF &amp; "Size:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " &amp; int(objItem.Size / 1000 / 1000 / 1000) &amp; " GBytes"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sReply = sReply &amp; vbLF &amp; "Partitions:&nbsp;&nbsp; " &amp; objItem.Partitions<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sReply = sReply &amp; vbLF &amp; "Sectors:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " &amp; FormatNumber(objItem.TotalSectors, 0, 0, 0, -1)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sReply = sReply &amp; vbLF &amp; "Heads:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " &amp; objItem.TotalHeads<br />

    <title>Duplicate D&#58;&#92; drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shanen17  say:</h3>
<h2>            Duplicate D&#58;&#92; drive</h2>
                    <p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have a problem where I accidentally created a duplicate of my D:\ drive. This is not the same issue of Windows 10 duplicating display names for which there is a registry fix. I have tried this and it does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's basically what happened:</p>
<p>I have an SSD (C:\) and an HDD (D:\). The SSD is rather small so I am trying to reserve it only for things that I want to be there. i.e. I have moved temp files, tmp, internet history, and downloads all to my HDD. I didn't move the Videos, Music, etc files
 before because I hadn't used them. Today I was going to end up using my Videos folder, so I wanted this on my HDD instead of my SSD. I made one small mistake in relocating this folder to my HDD and this is where the problem lies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I right clicked on Videos -&gt; properties -&gt; location -&gt; Move. The problem is that at this stage I hadn't created a Videos folder on my D:\ drive. So in the field of where to move the folder, instead of being D:\Videos, it was just D:\.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This resulted in a duplicate of my D:\ drive. One is normal like it always had been (DATA (D:) the other just has D:\ but the icon is that of the videos folder. This folder contains everything that is on my D:\ drive and if I delete something from one, it
 deletes it from the other.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3a471e5f-af35-43ef-9585-756291ab5f03" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3a471e5f-af35-43ef-9585-756291ab5f03" /></a></p>
<p>I am not able to move this folder or restore its default location. I was able to get back the Videos folder through a fix I found elsewhere. If I open the properties for the D:\ drive (with the videos icon) it comes up as if I clicked on the properties of
 the DATA (D:) drive.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f9675111-90d2-48fa-b067-938bd644bdc5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f9675111-90d2-48fa-b067-938bd644bdc5" /></a></p>
<p>Also, if I open the properties of the DATA (D:) drive and go to location and click restore default, it thinks that the default location is C:\Users\...\Videos which obviously should not be the case. Basically these two "drives" seem to be linked together
 now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This isn't a HUGE problem, but it is very frustrating and annoying and I was hoping that someone might be able to help me. I am not very experienced with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for any help.</p>

            <p>Hi Rakesh,<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I go ahead with the format, I just wanted to ask a quick question. I am very familiar with formatting drives in terms of reinstalling Windows (XP, Vista, Windows 7), but as I mentioned, I am not very familiar with Windows 10. Also, I have never done
 this on a computer with two drives installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So just to clarify so that I do not make a mistake, if I format the HDD, this will not affect my SSD, which contains my operating system, correct? And second, in order to format the HDD in Windows 10, I
<span>Open Computer Management by clicking the <span>
Start</span> button, clicking <span>Control Panel</span>, clicking <span>
System and Security</span>, clicking <span>Administrative Tools</span>, and then double-clicking
<span>Computer Management</span>.</span>&nbsp;Then in the left pane, under
<span>Storage</span>, click <span>Disk Management</span>. Then right-click the volume that I want to format, and then click
<span>Format</span>. Correct? Should I perform a quick format?</p>
<p>
</p><p>While we're briefly on the topic of Disk Management, when I open it, I notice a Recovery Partition listed (alongside my SSD). The size of this partition is 499MB, but it indicates that it is 100% free. Is this going to cause a problem creating
 a recovery USB drive? I have only had the laptop for a couple of weeks and this is how it came to me, but I have not yet had the chance to create recovery media as I did not have a large enough USB drive. I have opened up the create recovery media area to
 determine the size of USB key I would need (16GB), but I have not yet tried to go through the process. I just picked up a large enough USB drive yesterday.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance</p>
        </p>

            <p>So my issue appears to be fixed and I did not end up having to format my D:\ drive.<br />
<br />
What I did was click on the File Properties for the D:\ (with the Videos icon), not the one that is my DATA (D: ) which is the proper one, clicked on restore default location, said NO to the merge, then another window came up (which I think I might have said
 Yes to originally, which could be the original source of my problem - I know, this problem is a result of user error<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.tenforums.com%2fimages%2fsmilies%2f011.gif" />) and I said Yes (after fully reading
 it and understanding it this time. The second message is as follows (please ignore the name and the fact that it's to OneDrive, I obtained the picture from

Access Denied - moving Pictures folder to default or other locations - Windows 10 Forums</a> but the rest of the wording is what I saw).<br />

<br />
This seemed to disconnect (or what ever the heck was happening) the two listed D: drives. DATA (D: ) is normal. I still had D:\ with the videos icon kicking around. I made attempts to include this in the C:\User\...\Videos folder and then ended up with sub
 folders. Not EXACTLY sure where in the process of what I did fixed it, but at one point I closed the File Explorer window and when I reopened it everything was back to normal.<br />
<br />
Normal DATA (D: ), Normal Videos folder in the proper location and no subfolder, and no random D:\ drive with the Videos icon. Did a full shut down and restart and everything is looking as it should!<br />
<br />
No formatting of the D: drive either, so that's a bonus!<br />
</p>
<p>Thanks for the suggestion though, it was definitely my next step if I wasn't able to fix it otherwise.</p>

<p>thank&nbsp;you for the hint. But to be honest, we have 1 more tablet and 3 laptops&nbsp;connected to the same 2,4 GHz only WLAN&nbsp;and the only device with WLAN-problems in combination with USB3 devices is the Surface. Seems&nbsp;that it has&nbsp;a very suboptimal placing inside
 :) </p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way... the article from intel with all the tips about shielding the devices and good antenna placing is from 2012, the first Surface Pro&nbsp;4 was builded 2015....</p>

            <div>there is a PowerPoint deck on the web from the Surface Supportability team that</div>
<div>specifically points to the same issue from Ignite 2016. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>there is a single slide that states:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Symptoms</div>
<div>Wireless stops working when USB 3.0 device is connected</div>
<div>Wireless performance is lower than expected</div>
<div>Cause</div>
<div>All electrical devices can generate RF. Commonly reported with external USB</div>
<div>devices (especially hard drives) that are poorly shielded&nbsp;</div>
<div>Related to USB 3.0 and 2.4GHz interference outlined in Intel Whitepaper</div>
<div>Desense is the algorithm that checks to ensure we can transmit without impacting</div>
<div>other wireless equipment</div>
<div>Algorithm can be mandated by a government agency</div>
<div>Seen more in Europe where they have aggressive algorithm for all devices</div>
<div>manufactured since 2015. Etsi.org. EN 300 328</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>And yes, not all devices have this issue. The reports I have seen are from SP4</div>
<div>and Surface Book owners. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;and the only device with WLAN-problems in combination with USB3 devices is the Surface. Seems that it has a very suboptimal placing inside</div>

<h2>            Can not backup system in Windows 7</h2>
                    I just did a clean installation of Windows 7 Home Premium and found that I can not get Backup and Restore to create a system image. I get no error messages and the process looks perfectly normal. I get the message that the backup was successful, but when
 I go to either of the external drives I've tried, all I get is a correctly labelled but empty backup folder. I've had no luck on Google, but I found that I do not have the registry key
<div>[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{B98A2BEA-7D42-4558-8BD1-832F41BAC6FD}, which seems to figure into what little I did find. Does any of this ring a bell for anybody out there?&nbsp;</div>

</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for posting the question. I understand
 that you cannot do backup and restore on Windows 7.<span><font>&nbsp;
</font></span>Let me help you with the issue.</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">1.What is the make and model of the computer?</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">2.Which security software is installed?</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">3.How may external drives are connected to the computer?</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">4.What are the steps you have performed on the computer?</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">In order to troubleshoot this issue, let us try these methods:</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">Method 1.</font></span></p>
<p><b><span><font color="#000000">I would suggest you to right click the backup folders and check for the folder
 size in the properties window.</font></span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">Method 2.</font></span></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><b><span>You may also check if the folders are hidden. If the folders are hidden then
 you may unhide the folders and then try backing up the data. You may use the steps below to unhide the folders –</span></b></font><span><br />
<font color="#000000">1. Press the Alt key on the keyboard in any Windows Explorer window to bring up the toolbar.<br />
2. Click Tools, then Folder Options and then the View tab. <br />
3. Then choose 'Show hidden files and folders'. After click OK, they should appear with the other folders.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">Method 3.</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">I would suggest you to perform SFC scan and check if that helps. The
<b><font>SFC /scannow</font></b> command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.</font></span></p>

<h2>            Getting Blue Screen errors and two beeping noises</h2>
                    <div><strong>BSOD and two beeps</strong> </div>
<hr />
<div>So just until recently I have been hearing two beeps from my speakers. It would not happen during start up of the computer but random times. So basically a couple time every hour or so. The beep is two quick beep beep noise. I recently had a bsod yesterday
 but I came back from the bathroom and computer restarted so I didn't get a chance to take a look of what was said on screen. I had the minidump file but after I ran the driververifier and perfmonreport the mini dump file disappeared. I want to verify that
 the beeps come only from my speaker and not the computer itself. <br />
<br />
Now before I came here I did a bunch of research and tried to troubleshoot it myself. The only thing in device manager that has a question mark is bitdefender and I contacted them and they said this was normal. I also looked up on the web and found that 2 quick
 beeps was sign of ram issue. So I conducted ram tests and it states my ram was ok. After that I decided to pull off my ram and reconfigure them too see if something was loose and checked all other wires on my computer and reconnected it just in case something
 was loose. Same for my usb cables.<br />
<br />
I'm a hardcore gamer so after all those test I was thinking it might be cpu temperature. I download a couple of temperature programs and one temperature program from my motherboard. Everything was in the green, all my fans are working fine and cpu water cooling
 working with no problems at all. I feel like this is a hardware issue but not too sure what is causing it. I even ran hard drive test. I come to this site because this is my last solution before sending it to a shop.
<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
P.S&gt; Will reddit out a pizza if my problem is fixed ^^<br />
<br />
Thank You <br />
<br />
P.S&gt; attached are the reports requested in posting instructions<br />
<br />
I have the driververifier and perfmonreport but I do not see a upload button <br />
how can I upload these files so someone can take a look? thanks<br />

            OK, first, the next time you get a BSOD - immediately shut down the system and open the case.&nbsp; Grab hold of the metal of the case with one hand (to ground out static discharge) and then feel around with the other hand (DO NOT TOUCH anything!!! You can
 get severe burns doing this!!!).&nbsp; Just feel around close to each component and see if anything seems very hot to you.&nbsp; What you're looking for is a component that's not covered by the liquid cooling - but is overheating anyway.&nbsp; If it's overheating, you'll
 feel the heat as you get close to it - so be very, very careful!!!<br />
<br />
Next, these are the reports that I need.&nbsp; Please upload them to the Public area of a SkyDrive account:&nbsp;

<h2>            Xbox one timezone</h2>
                    Ok, hello everyone. I ak going to try and explain this issue the best that I am having. So basically I began disconnecting from xbox live two months ago and it has not stopped since, until i &nbsp;bought i wireless repeater which i am wired to. But i noticed
 that I was still lagging like crazy. I do not know what or why i did but when i set my xbox one hour back the lag went away, one hour forward it came back. I had already tried EVERYTHING to fix the disconnects from new router changing firewalls, changing cable
 plugs, upnpn portforwarding, calling isp, calling xbox. STILL no solution but I know its something with xbox compatibility with charter in my area. This is all the explainin i really need to do so of anyone has any UNCOMMON solutions please put them down below
 thx

<h2>            Contact emails going to old email address</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I changed my email address about 2 months ago, and despite updating my address in the 'Contact Preferences on Xbox.com, I just noticed that I'm still receiving them in my old inbox.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>I wouldn't be too bothered, but they're regarding adding MS Points to my account and Xbox Rewards statements. If the 'Contact Preferences' doesn't affect this, how can I make sure these 'important' emails go to my new inbox?<br />
<br />
</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

 I went through the steps on my Xbox 360 to change the account my unused Gamertag is linked to (I just created a throwaway 3rd Microsoft account) but it wouldn't let and sent me here&nbsp;https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/errors/error-code-0X8015402d which

<p>Hi Joey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Each gamertag can only be attached to a specifcc Microsoft account. The feature that allows a gamertag to be moved or switched to another Microsoft account is already removed from Xbox 360. At the moment, you can only change your gamertag to a new one. See

How to change your Xbox gamertag</a>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you want to change the email address on your account you are required to use an email that has no gamertag attached to it. You may refer to this

            You won't be able to do anything with the old Windows XP installation, what you should do is take ownership of the files and folders on the drive and copy over your personal files from the Documents and Settings folder on the external hard disk to the
 respective folders in Windows 7 such as Documents, Pictures, Music, Videos etc..<br />

After doing this for the User account located on the 200 GB drive, you should be able to browse your older account folder and copy any important files you need over to the Windows 7 drive.<br />

</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2: </strong>If issue doesn’t persists in safe mode, I would suggest you to perform Clean Boot to fix the issue. Clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.

<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: </strong></p>
<p>I would also suggest you to run the Microsoft Safety scanner and check if it helps:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong> I would suggest you to run System File Checker tool (SFC.exe) and check if it helps. The System File Checker tool (SFC.exe) scans for missing or corrupted system files and repairs them.</p>

<h2>            TV MESSAGE - Resolution not supported. Change the resolution of the external device.</h2>
                    Since I did a Windows 10 update a little time ago, I can't use my TV with an HDMI cable via my new laptop - it worked without problems prior the update. The cable and TV are OK because my other laptop works just fine with them. I have changed the resolution
 on my new laptop, but without success and I have done a factory reset on my TV, but all to no avail . Do you have any suggestions?

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This error usually happens when your TV is not capable of rendering the video output resolution given by the PC.
<strong>TV Monitor T28D310ES </strong>only supports <strong>1366x768</strong> resolution. Kindly try changing the resolution in
<strong>Intel HD Graphics Control Panel a</strong>gain and set it to<strong> 1366 x 768</strong>,
<strong>1280 x 720</strong> or anything lower. If that didn't work, kindly try changing the resolution on the
<strong>Display settings</strong> itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how things go.</p>
<p>

<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
I found myself in the same situation, had the same problem after windows update and when i connect my Laptop to Samsung TV.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Solution was to go into Intel Graphics Control Panel and change the resolution to 1600 x 900 ( i checked them one by one from highest, this was the first that showed something) since changing the resolution in Windows Display Settings didn't change anything.<br />
</p>
<p>Perhaps driver update would fix this, but i am sure that latest windows 10 update caused this.</p>

<h2>            How internet connection speed can be shown Win10 Home HP notebook&#63;</h2>
                    I had Windows 95 and XP in others computers I had before this HP Notebook with Windows 10 Home. Except in Win. 10, I had the connection speed available at the task bar. What happened with Win10? Does anybody knows what I'm doing wrong? Or is just that

            Its been like this since Windows Vista, over 10 years ago. But you can find your connection speed :
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: control
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Open Network and Sharing Center
<br />
<br />Under View your active networks, click the connections link to view the speed.

<p>Thanks for your response to my surprise of Windows 10 not having a speed connection indication in the task bar. I already knew how to check that but it only shows my personal or home Wi-Fi speed to connect with my computer, not the actual Internet service
 speed I want to know all the time while I'm surfing the web. That should be so simple to program and provide as a nice and useful app for be visible at the task bar. I jut thought it had to be ready inside and ready to turn it on or at least ready to be send
 as an automatic update. </p>
<p>I have been using those download speed test web pages "I think" I can trust and must of them ask your e-mail and all they want to get something from you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an Electrical Engineer that knows about programming, electrical design, electronic design, and many other usual stuff common to our profession, I believe it has to pass through the mind of some Microsoft engineer to make it happened soon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you and God bless you for your response.&nbsp; That is what it makes some people deserve the best.</p>
<p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 automatically select user at logon screen</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>I have problem with a personalized Windows 7 I have created with 5 different accounts (this image is used for course purposes, every account is used for a specific course).</p>
<p>When Windows starts, at the Welcome Screen the first user (in alphabetical order) is select automatically, instead of shown me all the users available on PC.</p>
<p>So if I have to change from the automatically selected account to another account I have to click on "Switch user" than select the correct user then type the password for log in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way to show all the user? I mean, is there&nbsp;a way that the user isn't been selected at Welcome Screen?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for any kind of help</p>

            If&nbsp;you want to use your Anti-virus to scan your computer &gt; Click Start &gt; Programs &gt; your Anti-virus &gt; when it opens, click on the Scan your Computer&nbsp;Option.<br />
<br />
Or try these Programs:<br />
<p><span><br />
Download, install, update and scan with each of the two programs below to check for/remove Malware/spyware.</span></p>
<p><span>If necessary, do all the above work in
<strong>Safe Mode with Networking.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>To get into
<strong>Safe Mode with Networking</strong>, tap F8 right at Power On / Startup, and use UP arrow key to get to
<strong>Safe Mode with Networking</strong> from list of options, then hit ENTER.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Read all info below before starting:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Malwarebytes is as the name says, a Malware Remover!</span></p>
<p><span>Download the Free Version from the link above.</span></p>
<p><span>Download, install, update and scan once a fortnight.
<br />
<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to use Malwarebytes after it is installed:</span></span><span><br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;Open Malwarebytes &gt; Click on the Update Tab&nbsp; across the top&gt; get the latest updates.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;On the <strong><span>Scanner</span></strong> tab, make sure the the
<strong><span>Perform&nbsp;full scan</span></strong> option is selected and then click on the
<strong><span>Scan</span></strong> button to start scanning your computer
<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;MBAM will now start scanning your computer for malware. This process can take quite a while.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp;When the scan is finished a message box will appear<br />
<br />
5.&nbsp;You should click on the OK button to close the message box and continue with the Malware<strong><span>
</span></strong>removal process.<br />
<br />
6.&nbsp;You will now be back at the main Scanner screen. At this point you should click on the
<strong><span>Show Results</span></strong> button.<br />
<br />
7.&nbsp;A screen displaying all the malware that the program found will be shown<br />
<br />
8.&nbsp;You should now click on the <strong><span>Remove Selected</span></strong> button to remove all the listed malware. MBAM will now delete all of the files and registry keys and add them to the programs quarantine. When removing
 the files, MBAM may require a reboot in order to remove some of them. If it displays a message stating that it needs to reboot, please allow it to do so. Once your computer has rebooted, and you are logged in, please continue with the rest of the steps.<br />
<br />
9.&nbsp;When MBAM has finished removing the malware, it will open the scan log and display it in Notepad. Review the log as desired, and then close the Notepad window.<br />
<br />
10.&nbsp;You can now exit the MBAM program.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Spybot Search &amp; Destroy 1.6.2 is a very good, FREE Anti-Spyware Program.</span></p>

<p><span>Update it, and scan your System once a fortnight.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Important re: Safe Mode</span></span></p>
<p><span>If you happen to find a problem that you can’t uninstall / delete, reboot the computer, and go into Safe Mode.</span></p>
<p><span>To get into Safe Mode, tap F8 right at Power On / Startup, and use UP arrow key to get to Safe Mode from list of options, then hit ENTER.</span></p>
<p><span>RESCAN your computer with your Anti-Virus, Malwarebytes and Spybot S &amp; D while in Safe Mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>If unable to install above Programs in Normal Mode:</span></span></p>
<p><span>Sometimes Trojans, Viruses, Malware, etc stop you installing and/or updating Programs to remove them.</span></p>
<p><span>If that happens, reboot into Safe Mode with Networking (from F8 list of Startup Options), and install, update and scan from there</span><span><span>.
<br />
<br />

Cheers.</span></span></p>
