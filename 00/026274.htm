<h2>            Office lens for windows takes too long to upload scanned files to onedrive</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Microsoft lumia 950. I use the office lens application&nbsp;quite often. It works perfect on iPhone, but for windows 10 phone, it takes hours for a scanned file to be uploaded to OneDrive and OneNote.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This should work even better on Microsoft's products, but ridiculously it does not (and works perfectly on iOS).</p>

<h2>            MP3 File Does Not Show Up on Device</h2>
                    <p>I have a Nokia Lumina 630. I just use it as a MP3 player. I copied over my music from One Drive, but doesn't show all of the songs. I can't edit the metadata on the songs that don't show up. I go into the music folder on the phone, and it shows the files
 are there, but they wont show in Groove. I even tried downloading a third party mp3 player, still no luck. Any idea on what to do? I cant even set any album art through any means.&nbsp;</p>

            I'm just guessing it is a file type that is different and is not compatible with your device. Are you sure it is an MP3 file?

    <title>Nokia 6210 Navigator vibrate and contacts not showing issues - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Nokia 6210 Navigator vibrate and contacts not showing issues</h2>
                    
<p>Hey there</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My nokia just happens to be within the 12 month warranty! But before I take it in I'd like to see if anyone knows what the problem could be and if it is supported by the warranty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. I think it has been a while now that the vibrate doesn't work. I've been missing a lot of calls and texts but I just assumed I wasn't paying attention. I confirmed the other day that vibrate does not work which makes silent mode pretty useless. And yes
 I have checked that it is turned on in the settings :P</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; This happened literally in between text messages. I was texting my friend and all was normal then the next text I received showed as a phone number, not as the contact name. It has been happening since. It also doesn't show contact name in sent messages
 if I use the reply function. The only time it shows the name is when I write out a message and manually add in the contact from my list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Very annoying to look through all my contacts to see who texted me!</p>

<p>the contacts issue is normally a duplicate contact so check this 1st</p>
<p>now check how many text is on phone its no adviseable to stores say over 1500 text</p>
<p>try a soft reset the code is *#7370# security code 12345 back up user data such as contacts</p>
<p>try updating the firmware if not done so already</p>
<p>give these a go before you do anything else</p>

<blockquote><strong><em>There isn't a gear icon top right on Explorer 11. All I see is - (hide) and X (close).</em></strong></blockquote>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It seems that you're only getting Internet Explorer Immersive App. I would suggest you to follow the steps below to get the options as mentioned in the earlier post:&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>On the idle desktop screen: </p>
<ul>
<li>Press the Windows key + R (both at the same time.)<br />
</li><li>In the box, type "inetcpl.cpl" (without quotes.)<br />
</li></ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Now you can follow the steps from the earlier post. It will help you for good!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good Luck. </p>

            <p>I did not realize that Internet Explorer could be opened in two ways; from the Start screen, which is where I was having the problem, or from the Desktop, which is where I always work. I opened Tools on the Desktop version and found three choices under the
 Internet Options/Programs tab:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let Internet Explorer decide"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Always in Internet Explorer"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Always in Internet Explorer on the desktop"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mine was set on "Let Internet Explorer decide", probably as the default. I set it to&nbsp;"Always in Internet Explorer on the desktop"&nbsp;and checked the box below "Open Internet Tiles on the desktop" and now it works as I want.&nbsp;Thanks to the_Anshul for that lead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had already looked at split screen, but it does not work the same way as tiles, which I prefer. Thanks for the help and the suggestions.</p>

</p><p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for stopping by the Microsoft Band Community. Glad you’ve asked this question. I will do my very best to provide you with an answer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The Android platform allows more variation in the way the operating system is implemented on a particular phone than either Windows Phone or Apple. Android 4.3 – 4.4 and
<em>Bluetooth</em> support is required, but your phone’s manufacturer can install the operating system without the features the Microsoft Health app requires.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Here’s an easy way to check: Use your phone to open the Play Store, and search for Microsoft Health. If you don’t see it, your phone doesn’t support it. If you do see it, you can download it for free.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you’re buying a new phone, check with your mobile operator.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For more info about supported phones, see&nbsp;</span><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-band/en-us/support/hardware/system-requirements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">system requirements for Microsoft Band</a></span><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I hope you find the information provided to be helpful.</span></p>

<h2>            Is it available for Windows 10 build 14393 Single Language users to upgrade their editions to Windows 10 Enterprise&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm looking forward to receiving build 14910 in the Insider Fast ring tomorrow, but my current Insider Program Setting is Slow ring and it can't be changed in build 14905 that I'd like to go back to Windows 10 build 14393 Enterprise. "Roll back to the previous
 build" is not available in Settings and I haven't backed up anything about build 14393 yet. What I own is only a DVD Installation Media (build 14393 Single Language). After make a&nbsp;clean install, I desire to upgrade to Enterprise Edition. How do I perform that?
 Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi Guaumma,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You seem to be confusing Home, Pro, Enterprise editions with Slow Ring and Fast Ring. The two are unrelated and in order to keep your Activation (License) you must stick to the version you purchased. I am not sure whether choosing a 'Single language' install
 is allowed in regards to this. Do you have a special reason for choosing this? </p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case:</p>
<p><em>a) Check your Activation state: It should say 'Activated' with 'digital license', if not you will probably do a Clean Install again. (of build 14393)</em></p>
<p>b) Do make a backup, no matter what. When running Insider builds that's more or less a requirement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All-in-all, what you are saying is impossible, AFAIK: You indeed get kicked back to 'Slow' when doing a Clean Install of 14905, in fact I am in the same situation on one of my machines, but either you have 14905 installation media or you got there by upgrading
 from 14393.xx which is only possible when you had it set to 'Fast' and that setting should have been 'ported' to 14905. Well, it did that on my upgraded system(s).</p>
<p>
</p><p>As to getting the next Fast Ring Insider build, I agree with what others have posted here. Time will tell how MS is going to resolve this. I am lucky in that I have another machine on 14905, Fast ring, so once the new build is installed on that machine,
 I will be able to create installation media from that. Should you also have such a 'second' machine AND the fix will not be released as a KB, please let me know and I will help you do the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Stephen</p>

<h2>            one drive missing files</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>

<p>I synced, few weeks ago, some files on my mac thru safari . Right now I can see them. i installed the onedrive app on a pc and after the login, the files were missing. In the pc It seems to be the first time I use the onedrive service, there is the "help
 steps" to upload files and the "files folder" is empty. I used to see the files I previously had uploaded on the iphone outlook app but after the installation on the pc, the app logged out from my account. When I log in again the app behaves just like the
 pc onedrive version: brand new, without files. I double checked again on my mac and the files are still there thru safari log in. I use lastpass as password manager so I thought it was making different logins with different accounts but I only have 1 username
 and 1 password!.<br />
Right now using the same username and password on three different devices (mac, iphone, pc) gives me two different outputs: one with the files (doing the login thru safari) and two without the files (doing the login on my phone and my pc).</p>

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>My understanding is that the files can be seen via browser (Safari), and can’t be seen in synced folder on PC and in Outlook app for iPhone. If there is any misunderstandings, please let me know.</p>
<p>It seems that the issue starts from PC sync client. So let’s first focus on this.<br />
For OneDrive for Business on PC, I’d like to confirm the following information:<br />
1. Are you syncing SharePoint libraries or your personal OneDrive for Business library?<br />
2. What is your OneDrive for Business version using on your PC? <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; To check it, for<strong> legacy OneDrive for Business sync client</strong>, open Task Manager &gt; right click on OneDrive for Business icon &gt; Properties &gt; Details.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; For <strong>OneDrive for Business Next Generation Sync Client</strong>, right click on OneDrive icon in system tray &gt; settings &gt; about.<br />
3. Are all the files not visible in local synced folder? Or only some of them?<br />
4. Try<strong> Fix it too</strong>l via <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3038627" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3038627</a>.<br />
5. Try creating a new file in the synced folder created by OneDrive for Business sync client and check via browser if the file shows in your SharePoint/OneDrive for Business library.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, can you share the account information with us for troubleshooting? To protect your privacy, I have sent you a private message asking for the information. You can go to this link to access to the Private Message:

<h2>            Windows Updates Failed Or Requires Restart</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 Build 10130.&nbsp; Yesterday, June 11th, there were 6 updates offered.&nbsp; 4 are now showing "failed to install" and one (Flash Player) shows "successfully installed".&nbsp; If my memory is correct the "failed to install" initially showed "requires a restart"
 even after the computer was rebooted.&nbsp; Checking windows updates in the control panel programs indicates they were installed.&nbsp; Were they installed or not?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is Windows 10 really going to be ready for public release on July 29th.&nbsp; This particular build is fraught with blue screens and other niggling issues that would be a real disaster if released worldwide.&nbsp; I've tried to post most of the issues in the feedback
 program but sometimes the blue screen errors go away before I have a chance to write down what the indicated error is.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is the only Windows Topics selection I'm offered "Upgrade Reservation"?&nbsp; This post has nothing to do with the reservation but I have no other alternatives and current operating system does not include Windows 10.&nbsp;
</p>

            <p>Tried the manual download link and it opened with my default browser Firefox.&nbsp; Wouldn't let me download anything and advised if I wanted to use the page I had to use Internet Explorer.&nbsp; Tried the new Edge browser and all I got was a page advising me to use
 the start menu to access Windows Update.&nbsp; Opened Internet Explorer and got to the page but it had message that I needed to install an add on if I wanted to download anything.&nbsp; Clicked through the OK's to install the add on and got another message that it wouldn't
 work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm seriously beginning to wonder if Microsoft will be able to get this whole Windows 10 thing working well enough for release.&nbsp; Just went through a WerFault.exe application error and subsequent blue screen Critical Process Died and resultant reboot.&nbsp; These
 things seemingly happen randomly and for no particular reason.&nbsp; I have enough problems now and don't want to mess in the registry so I guess I'll never really know if the updates installed correctly or not.&nbsp; Yeah, I know.&nbsp; It's still beta :).</p>

<p>
</p><p>Renaming the pst file itself won't change what shows in the &lt;Nav&gt; pane. Also, you can't import from a PST file that's open in Outlook. If the PST file is open, you'll need to "copy" the items from the OLD pst file to the appropriate folders in the target
 PST file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your question about how to change what shows in the Nav Pane --&gt; right click on the root of the PST file you want to show with a different name --&gt; click &lt;Data File Properties&gt;</p>

    <title>Link to BackEnd with UNC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lungta  say:</h3>
<h2>            Link to BackEnd with UNC</h2>
                    
<p><span>Hi, hope someone can clarify this for me.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We're running Access 2003 on XP machines</span></p>
<p><span>Split db, front end on each PC, shared back end on server</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Problem is that this shared network drive is called different letters in different locations -<span>&nbsp;</span>users here link to P:\ and users in another city link
 to Q:\ for the same back end. Testing and implementation are stupidly complicated. Plus, we're getting some upgrades lately that install local Q drives on the computers, causing connection problems.<span>&nbsp;
</span>We want to stop having to specify drive letters to link this database, just use the UNC path somehow to link to BE.<span>&nbsp;</span>i.e.,
</span></p>
<p><span><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">\\someserver-file-1\somedrive\AutoDatabase\Cars.mdb</span><span>&nbsp;</span>instead of
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">P:\somedrive\AutoDatabase\Cars.mdb</span> and&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Q:\somedrive\...</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>BE Path is known, is not in the same directory as FE, and won't move for a long time.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I tried Albert Kallal's posted example for "<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Is it possible to put a Runtime split Microsoft Access...</span>" but it fails due to
 no Microsoft Access 14.0 in the library.<span>&nbsp;</span>None of our users will have 14.0.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The solution on the MVP site would probably work but seems like a lot of extra code we don't need.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Does anyone know of a simplified way to use UNC to link FE/BE in vba?<span>&nbsp;</span>Macro in a pinch, but prefer vba if possible.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Also, where would it get called from if it's vba?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Any assistance is very much appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Lungta</span></p>

            I vote with Danny. In your production front end, use Linked Table Manager. Select all the tables linked to the back end and check off the always prompt box. Then hit the link button. The File&gt;Open dialog will open up and you want to select the Network
 icon to then select the server and share and file. This will save the links using UNC. Then you can distribute your front end.

<h2>            Adding a domain to Office 365 Business</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've set up a new Office 365 plan for a business I run with two other Directors and have run into a couple of problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've confirmed that we own our domain by inputting the DNS settings into our domain settings, as well as the TXT settings for Office 365 to work properly. However, when I go onto the Business Essentials Setup page, Step 4 'Connect Domain' is still red (the
 circle) and there is a never-ending loading icon. I simply cannot do anything more, as far as I'm aware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated!<br />
<br />
Thanks,</p>
<p>

<p>Thank you for the provided screenshot. In the screenshot, we can see that the active one is the NVidia. If that's the case, try making the Intel the primary display. Follow the steps below on how to make it the primary display:
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click on the desktop and select <strong>Intel Graphics Settings</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Display </strong>and click <strong>Multiple Displays</strong> from the left-pane.</li><li>Under <strong>Select Display Mode</strong>, select either <strong>Extended Desktop</strong> or
<strong>Clone Displays</strong>. </li><li>Click the drop-down arrow for <strong>Primary Display </strong>then select the display you want to use. The secondary display will auto-populate the other device.
</li><li>Click <strong>Apply </strong>then <strong>OK</strong> to apply changes.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>After following the steps above, check if the second monitor will now work and the same BitLocker recovery error will still occur.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give us an update with the outcome so we can provide further assistance. </p>

            <span>Hi Anne, thanks for the tip, this indirectly resolved my issue! When I checked, there was no Intel Graphics Settings with the latest driver from Microsoft! When I tried installing ORIGINAL driver from the manufacturer, it warned me that
 the latest driver is already installed. I went ahead and replaced the latest driver with one from 2015. After the reboot the menu was there, settings and the second monitor came to live! Thanks again for your help!&nbsp;</span>

<h2>            How do I restore all items to my phone after a master reset</h2>
                    I am wondering how to restore items to my phone using msmyphone? I had to do a master reset and was thinking... if I simply tried to synch with the myphone site it will wipe out what I have&nbsp;on the site&nbsp;now because my phone current (after the reset) is
 blank. I dont want to loose my data on the site.<br />
Thanks,<br />

            This is&nbsp;a key backup and restore scenario supported by MyPhone. You just need to install MyPhone (or if you're on WM 6.5, it should already be there), enter the same LiveID credentials you used before and sync to restore the saved items to your phone.<br />

            So if I try to synch with my phone being empty now it is not going to overwrite the info on the site &amp; make all my contacts &amp; calneder info disappear? It says on the myphone website that the phone is always has priority. I took that to mean it would if
 I synched while it was empty it could wipe out all of my data saved on the site. Its not a new phone its the same phone just had to be reset.<br />

Thanks for any help you can lend!<br />

<br />
After you hard-reset your phone, it's a new phone to the server. So use the same Live ID and do a sync, you will get your saved items back. If after the sync, you manually deleted everything in your phone and sync'ed again, that would wipe out your data on
 the web. They're different scenarios.<br />

            One thing you might notice is that if you were syncing some folders where default windows mobile files exists, e.g. "My Pictures" folder containing a few default sample picture files, then you&nbsp;might have duplicates after you sync.

            As of today I can relate my experience with restoring data using Windows MyPhone. My T-Mobile Dash (Windows Mobile 6) kept crashing so I did the equivalent of a hard reset. THE DOWNLOAD I downloaded MyPhone after having had to search for the right page.
 It's not with the Windows Mobile downloads I could access on my default bookmarks. The download was done while traveling on the freeway (I wasn't driving) and may have taken 20 minutes to the end of installation. THE RESTORATION Not seeing an option for restoring
 data, I went ahead and pressed "Synch". It began a long arduous journey to uploading all the changes. About 15 minutes later it began to download all the missing files. I have numerous pictures and ringtones, and this is not a 3G phone. Towards the end of
 30 to 45 minutes, I noticed there was a hardly any memory left on my phone. There is a little notice that invites us to use the phone while the Synch runs in the backround, but I wouldn't advise it on older phones. I ended up with an e

    <title>Microsoft Access 2013 Command Button Sizing Issue - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microsoft Access 2013 Command Button Sizing Issue</h2>
                    I am new to the computer world taking my second semester of classes at a local college. Taking a Microsoft Access Database class this term. Having an issue with assigning a command button to a form and the command button isn't sizing properly. The blue
 background that should fit in the text box as the command button is over sized. I have a new Dell XPS 9350 with High Res touch screen and have read it's to do with scale and magnification format settings but nothing i do corrects the problem. I must have the
 ability to use this software to pass this course. My professor hasn't seen anything like it. Dell told me it's a software issue, and after waiting on hold with Microsoft today for 2hrs being switched from one dept to another I'm desperate!!&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a299f06d-c263-481b-8eca-5c76a766e91e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a299f06d-c263-481b-8eca-5c76a766e91e" /></a>

            <p>Did you create the form using the wizard - that is, you selected a Table or Query, then clicked Create - Forms - Form? If so, then your form was created with the Layout methodology, and that can cause some odd behavior when working in Design view. Most experienced
 devs remove the layout. If you want to do that. select the "table" holding all of your controls, and then in the Form Design Tools ribbon click Arrange - Table - Remove Layout. This will remove the "table", but will leave your controls and such on the form,
 and you should be able to arrange and size your controls as desired.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also right-click on the table layout, and select Layout - Remove Layout:</p>

            Hey Scott, thanks for responding. The form was created by selecting a blank form and adding the tables from the Field List. This is Chapter 4, Pause &amp; Practice 4-2 in the Access 2013 textbook. The assignment requires you go through specific steps showing
 screen shots along the way. To your suggestion of building through Design View, we tried that to. I have found some mention of this problem on Youtube and a couple other blog pgs. Their solution was to adjust screen text size, but this doesn't solve the problem
 for my laptop. Maybe the HiDef screen of the dell 9530 is part of the problem. This problem does not exist with my old Toshiba with Windows 7, command buttons work fine or with school computers using windows 7. I don't know if it is specific to my laptop,
 if windows 10 is part of the problem, or what but with as much as this Dell laptop cost having this problem is so frustrating!!

<p>Well first let me say I don't have much respect for your textbook. In 20 years of developing Access apps I have never created a form in that manner. Mostly, I use the Form Wizard to build the foundation of the form. And I would never create a form by adding
 multiple tables from a field list. I do not recommend creating a form using multiple tables. If you need to work with multiple tables, then create subforms from the related tables and then embed them on your main form.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the unlikely event it makes sense to use multiple tables without subforms, then first create a query to make sure the data works.Then create your form from the query.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But that doesn't deal with your question. My question to you is&nbsp;when you try to size the command button&nbsp;do the other controls also change size? If so then your controls are grouped and need to be ungrouped as Scott McD suggested. If that is not the case,
 then I suspect your form is corrupted and I would delete it and start again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            There are times when i share your opinion about my text book, although i know the purpose is the learn all parts of the database software even if using blank for isn't the best way it's still a part of the program. So, i have isolated the problem to my
 laptop by building the form and applying command buttons with command button wizard, on my Dell the blue back ground of the buttons are over-sized as i described. I then close the form and email it to my other (old) laptop and the form opens and operates normally
 and are sized the way they should be. Something with my Dell is an issue. Graphics? Screen resolution? Scaling? Something i don't get is why text setting on the laptop are recommended at 250%. &nbsp;Does the high resolution have an effect on some programs that
 it needs to be altered that much? I've read it's an issue with HiDef . I suppose i would't have bought this computer had i know it would be a problem. Thanks for you're input, not sure what to do about it at this point!

            <p>I do my main development work on a HiDef monitor (with two other monitors, and one of those is HiDef) and don't have this issue (running Win10 with Office 2013 at the moment). I've run all versions from A97 up on this monitor. I've never run on a TouchScreen,
 but I'd be surprised if that were the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note too that Access formats many things based on the Printer you have setup on the machine. You might try changing to a different printer and see where that leads.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your video hardware and settings could have an effect, but I assume you've made sure they're updated, and you've tried fiddling with settings and such (not much you can do about the video card, of course).</p>
<p>
</p><p>FWIW: I've been building Access apps for about 20 years as well, and I have NEVER used the Form Wizard to create a form, except for testing and proof of concept where I knew I would just be deleting it afterwards. I find the Form Wizard to create as much
 work as it "saves", and I've found that the method you describe - create a blank form, and drag your controls on to that form - to be my preferred method. Takes a bit longer, perhaps, but I don't have to undo many of the things the Wizard does (like use the
 Layout setup, for example). I do agree that in most cases, a form shouldn't really be based on multiple tables, and that you would instead use a form/subform sort of setup for that need.</p>

            <p>Hi Steven,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you try the following and report back:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">
&nbsp;In Windows 10, close everything , right-click the Desktop, and then select Display Settings.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">
- The Settings dialog should open and the “Display” tab should be showing on the left side.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">
- There is a slider that says “Change the size of text, apps, and other items” on this dialog. It will probably be set at 125% (or higher) which is the default.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">
- Move the slider to the far left so it is at 100% and then click Apply at the bottom.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">
- Sign out and then sign back in or restart the machine to have the changes take effect.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">
- Recheck the size of the command button on the form.</p>

            <p>To: Scottgem</p>
<p>
</p><p>The recommended setting for "Change the size of text, apps, and other items" is 250%. When you adjust it smaller, say 125% and apply everything displaying on the screen gets so small you can't read it including the task bar, BUT... it doesn't effect the
 desktop short cut icons. It's the strangest thing. My roomate who is pretty computer literate doesn't understand it. We played with this all night Saturday night trying to figure it out to no avail. I am just starting my path to a career with computers so
 understanding the details how this all works as well as the terminology is a little beyond me, but i'm learning fast.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For others who had this issue with the command button, the solution was to simply adjust the size of text %, and problem solved. Not for my computer though. A Dell tech is coming over to replace a piece of molding below the screen, I will ask him about this
 as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And again to both of you, Scottgem and Scott McDaniel i am grateful for your suggestions. I'll update with any comment from the tech.</p>

            I GOT IT RESOLVED!!!!! It was a simple fix that i just missed. Sometime lessons come with simple solutions. It was a simple adjustment between screen resolution and scale that i thought we had done, but honestly i didn't know any better. NOW I DO! Thank
 the computer Gods!!

I have already contacted Microsoft customer service and there support did not help.&nbsp;<font color="#444444"><span>&nbsp;I have tried&nbsp;answering&nbsp;the recover account questions,
 but the problem is i haven't used the email to send any messages to anybody for about 4 months now I can't remember the mails i have sent from 4 months. I have tried to do the alternative email. But the that account is inactive and i have lost the password
 to that account. I have tried to recover my alternative email password but i have no emails sent on that account so i can not use the recover options. And that accounts alternative email is unknown.&nbsp;</span></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Inconsistent opening of WPS files by Word 2016</h2>
                    Just upgrading from Microsoft Works to Office 365 and Word 2016. On one Win7 machine I can open my WPS files just fine, work with them, convert them to new format, etc. On a Win10 I can open them, but not as a word processor document, just the screen with
 the encoding options. On a second Win7 machine Word 16 doesn't even recognize the WPS extension, even on the default programs list. I'm admittedly not a sophisticated or enthusiastic Microsoft product user, so I'd appreciate any help I can get.&nbsp;

    <title>Nokia Lumia 800 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> feryalfianw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia Lumia 800</h2>
                    
<p>Hi All!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, this post is about Nokia Lumia 800 (kinda lame since the new ones are already rolled out of the box).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, let's get started. I am the owner of Nokia Lumia 800 for 10 months now. And from all those 10 months, I've seen a lot to know exactly what kind of phone is this one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Okay, here are what I thought the great feature (the pros) of Nokia Lumia 800 (sorted from the greatest):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. A BEAUTIFUL design. (really, I personally think it's by far the most beautiful phone I've ever seen even until now)</p>
<p>2. A whole new level of integration of all my contacts to social media and all of those emails. (even android can't do these integration as smoothly let alone apple)</p>
<p>3. A typical Nokia brilliance (clear black display surely gives the phone a Huge advantage towards it's display, Nokia drive/map in par or even better than Google maps on android not to mention the Map from Apple)</p>
<p>4. A fast responding Care Center (for no reason, my phone stop working like 2 months ago -we'll get to that later- , I brought it to the nearest nokia care center and within 2 weeks, my phone is back on track and nothing was charged since I am still in my
 warranty period)</p>
<p>5. Live tiles instead of icons (I know the compliments actually should go to the OS provider -Microsoft-, but still, thumbs up) and since the next update 7.8 will allow us to modify the size of the tiles, so yeah!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But again, of course I am not here only to wrote those. There are of course a downside to this phone, here are those "not so great quality" (the conts) sorted from the least annoying:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Lack of apps; I know it's not fair to compare the number of apps in Windows phone 7 to android or Iphone since they came out first, microsoft, or in this case, Nokia were too late to release their new phone/OS and the market were already almost fully
 grabbed by android and apple. But what I want to mark here is, the variety of apps in the market are not so wide, I mean there are like thousands of apps with the same function, and when I am looking for a certain function (such as live data transfer monitor),
 it's not even there, not even one.</p>
<p>2. Inflexibility; yes, that's a word with a thousand meaning here, the unability for the phone to serve as a mass storage thus making file management not only hard but impossible, transfering music / video so the other apps can use them as well, also not
 in the list of things that work for this phone (zune sucks.).</p>
<p>3. If you read my pros list no 4, you must have been able to guess it. It's the dead for no reason, apparently, this was not happening to myself only (try google it -or bing it, whatever-), this problem has become one of the most common situation for the
 owner of the early lumia species. I mean, why is that?</p>
<p>4. Ok, here is the most annoying feature of Nokia Lumia 800 (and probably only happen in this "used to be so expensive" phone), the internet connection. Yes, you read that right. In case you didn't notice, the internet connection just went off after sometimes.
 If you are having a situation of &nbsp;"I really want to punch someone in the face right now", try not to surf the internet using this phone, otherwise you will end up having a black eye. This problem will accelerate your aggressivity to light speed. And also,
 this problem stop the internet sharing from working every now and then. I have surfed the forum for the solutions, and none of the solutions works (incl. setting the APN **bleep** and stuff). Some people in the forum says it works but then again I doubt it
 since the number that says it works is like 1 against 20 to those that say it doesn't work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Actually the unability of sending files through bluetooth (it's a shame) is also in the conts list, but since it's going to be available in the next update, I could care less.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And also I am very worried that since the windows phone 8 euphoria we are having right now, Nokia might just forget about the windows phone 7 users resulting those conts list (excl. no 2 since I see no way it can be fixed in anyway) I have for this phone
 never resolved. Let's face it, we (<span>the windows phone 7 users) are giving no more revenue to Nokia, from their point of view, we are just a burden now. Hopefully they didn't think that way</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So that's all for this post now, sorry for the long post. I really hope the next update will resolve some of the problem thus giving me a more enjoyable experience using the Lumias.</p>

            Hello there.<br />
1. I however, have all apps that I needed on the Windows Phone Store. I do not need millions of apps that I am not even bother using it. But then, if the app that you want to find is a necessary, unfortunately, I can't say anything about it, since the developers
 are yet to develop some apps.<br />
And I may misunderstood of what you said, but what do you mean of Live Data Transfer Monitor? Is it the app where you can track of how much you're using your data connection for a month?<br />
<br />
2. In my opinion, sync with Zune is so easy and fun. Every time I have new files on my phone and wanted to transfer it to my PC, I can easily connect it to my PC and it will automatically syncing the files to my PC. However, the vice versa is the different
 story for me. Especially when I have a lot of folders.<br />
<br />
3. I can't say anything about this since I am using the 710 instead of 800. And I don't have such issue on my phone.<br />
<br />
4. I thought it was only me! I am glad that I am not the only one.<br />
I remember I have to reset my phone to use the internet connection. That was a hassle and I found it annoying. Fortunately, I removed the Network Setup once I reset my phone. Since then, I don't have an issue anymore on my Lumia. :)<br />
<br />
And anyway, I hope the Lumia 620 would be out soon since some issues that were on my Lumia 710 is fixed on WP8.

<p>1. I want to be able to know if my phone is actually transmitting/receiving data at the moment and also the speed. I don't think that apps is available (yet).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Well, simple, I want to be able to play any song I download directly from my phone, I want to be able to manage my files in the phone, I want to be able to set my song as a ringtone and many more. I am sure that's all are pretty standard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Yeah, try to google it. It happens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. The most frustating feature of my phone, make it looks completely idiotic. And also I don't think nokia is going to take any action with this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hoping the next nokia lumia with win 8 will fix the issues? No, just no, I want nokia to fix the problem in my phone, not forcing me to buy a new one.&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. The way Windows Phone works the kind of app you are looking for is not easy if at all possible to do. But what other apps do you need/use? There is data monitoring available from Nokia, just not live.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. This is not possible with WP7.x If it is a requirement for you you have the wrong phone. IMO you own a phone, not a storage device. Again, if this is so crucial to you, get a phone that does what you need it to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. I can see it's not nice when a phone breaks. But it happens.. Nokia Care should be able to deal with it..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. I have no issue with my network at all. Cellular is always there, Wi-Fi does disconnect when under lockscreen and not connected to a charger, but there's an app for that..</p>

<p>1. Acceptable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. A phone but not a mass storage? Really?. Sorry, but since this is a "smart" phone it should at least be able to do that. How could nokia compete with android if it keeps making excuses like this? They learnt it very well that the win phone 8 is now equipped
 with that capability. I want mine to be fixed, because when I bought it, this phone was a high end. I expect perfection from it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Nokia care did that just fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. May I know what your phone is? Because if it's not lumia 800, then it's quite irrelevant don't you think?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My impression of your overall answer is that "I got the wrong phone", surely Nokia didn't say anything like "it's not the phone for you" when they massively advertised the product right?</p>

<p>&nbsp;2. Yes WP8 has the ability to store data for other purposes, this is one of teh big things I would agree.. I was trying to say that for me that is noce to have, but trivial. I carry a 64GB USB stick wherever I go and have a lot of stuff on SkyDrive as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Yes, I do own a Lumia 800, obviously I would not be able to coimment the way I did before. I use my phone in Ireland (3), UK (GiffGaff), The Netherlands and USA (both T-Mobile) and have not had any issues with data connections in any of these regions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Obviously Nokia would not say 'if you need mass storage' or 'if you do not want to use live sync of contacts' that Windows Phone is not your phone OS. No one would advertise like that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Windows Phone I have access to 25 GB (now 7GB) &nbsp;of storage on Skydrive, the whole concept revolves around using the cloud which makes perfect sense IMO..</p>

<p>Sorry for being a bit harsh, but you do realize that SkyDrive needs internet connection to access your files right? Meaning more money to be paid to your provider. And also given that the internet connection in this phone is absolutely unstable (yes, they
 are. Try google it and see how many people are ranting it out), I could imagine how it could be a big pain.</p>

<p>Well, around here I have unlimited internet for €20/month so there's no issue for me here.. I can't help the fact many carriers seem to feel they can still rip you off on data. Phones like these really are much cheaper bought outright and by using a local
 PAYGO carrier offering cheap internet</p>

<p>That's what I was expecting, but the application is nowhere to be found. The installer says it was installed successfully after sending it over from the PC via Bluetooth. And the App. Manager says that the "Reorganiser Uninstaller" is installed on the E:
 device, but the icon does not appear.</p>

<p>What do you suggest?</p>

<p>The memory reorganiser itself appears in Applications folder (where all your apps are when you enter the menu page by pressing the silver button ) tap iit it does its stuff then 'self removes'. It can be re used at a later date to gain a bit more C :smileyhappy:</p>

<p>Funniest thing, application will just not appear! Tried all the above, even installing the .sisx file with PC Suite's applications manager. Installer says all went ok, the app even lists on the phone's and PC Suite's App managers, but no icon appears.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Guess I'll have to do the reorganizing by hand. This is so weird.....</p>

<h2>            Synchronisation error - Support code&#58; 80072f17</h2>
                    Hi all,<br />
<br />
I have a HTC S710&nbsp;smartphone running WM6. ActiveSync&nbsp;used to work like a dream (touch wood), and&nbsp;synced via Microsoft Exchange.<br />
<br />
When I would attach the USB cable to my&nbsp;laptop, in some or other manner&nbsp;the synchronisation would also continue (although I synchronised manually).<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I recently returned from leave. Although remote synchronisation works fine, the moment I attach the smartphone to the USB cable, I get the following error.
<br />
<br />
<u>"Synchronisation could not be completed. Try again later.<br />
Support code: 80072f17."<br />
</u><br />
I read on the net that this somehow relates to certificates that are invalid? I am definitely not technically advanced, so if someone can assist I will really appreciate it as it is very irritating to unplug my phone from the USB cable in order to synchronise.

            Are you able to access your Exchange account through OWA with your computer's browser? If yes, do that and click Tools &gt; Internet options in IE. Click the Content tab and Certificates button. Locate the certificate under one of the tabs and export it as
