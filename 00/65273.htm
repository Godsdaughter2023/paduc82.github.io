    <title>Update installation error 80070006 Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Update installation error 80070006 Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Because Windows update was consuming 25% of my cpu, and doing nothing (and the troubleshooter reported possible database error), I ran the windows update reset script
<strong>WuReset.bat</strong> from the post by Sumit Dhiman on http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows-update-complete-reset-in.html, as suggested in another post on this forum.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But this ran with errors! After "successfully reset the Winsock Catalog" (listed twice) this script reported System error 1290 has occured. There is then a long mesage about incompatible SID type setting and comments about restricted services can only coexist
 with other restricted services. The script ends with "Windows Update service was started successfully."</p>
<p>
</p><p>The script seemes to have successfully fixed my problem with very high windows update cpu usage. But when I tried to re-run troubleshooter I now get "a problem is preventing troubleshooter from starting" and when I try to run Windows update it reports error
 0x80070006. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Windows 10 on an Acer laptop using Defender with no other virus protection&nbsp; (except Malwarebytes run regularly to check for anything that got through Defender).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you please suggest how I can fix this Windows 10 Update error?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Update your system to the creators update manually- It should do 2 purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make your system up to date.</li><li>Sort this windows update issue.</li></ol>
<p>Creators update is the latest stable build for Windows 10 released on 11th April and I hope this should solve your WU issue as well.</p>
<p>Use Media creation tool or the upgrade assistant to upgrade your system to the creators update.</p>

            Terminology - Integrated graphics does not have dedicated VRAM. VRAM (Video RAM) is found only on
<p>dedicated graphics cards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently some laptops do not have an option to dedicate a specific amount of system RAM for graphics.</p>
<p>If there is nothing in<em> BIOS - Advanced Options</em> - <em>North Bridge</em>&nbsp; such as
<em>'Share memory</em>' (the location and term used</p>
<p>in my AsRock BIOS) then you are stuck with the automated RAM allocation provided by DELL.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- While 'auto' should allocate more RAM when a game requires it, I found this did not happen when testing</p>
<p>GTA4 with HD400 graphics for another thread on these forums. </p>
<p>The game only 'saw' 64MB with BIOS set to 'Auto', but when I set BIOS to allocate 1024MB the
</p>
<p>game was able to access 1024 MB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- You may need to inquire at DELL support/forums for details about your particular model to verify if there</p>
<p>is some other option. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I found these -</p>
<p><em>"Video Card memory for DELL Inspiron 15 N5010 cannot be increased."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"The 32M is not your video RAM - it's a fixed frame buffer. &nbsp;The system will allocate video RAM as needed - there's no way to manually change the Z-buffer or the allocation."</em></p>
<p>

<h2>            Controller&#38;&#35;39&#59;s right stick &#38;quot&#59;moving&#38;quot&#59; up by itself</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, my controller's right stick is moving up by itself for some reason. For example the camera keeps moving up in Battlefield 4. it also happens in other games like GTA 5 and Rainbow Six Siege. Even when using Microsoft Edge it scrolls up on pages. It is
 really annoying. Is there a way to fix this without buying a new controller? Thanks.</p>

<p>You will probably need to send it in for repair/replacement if under warranty or simply purchase a new controller. &nbsp;You can try updating the controller and see if it helps but as I stated before it is typically time for repair or replacement.</p>

                    <div>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A week ago i upgraded 8.1 to Windows 10 Insider Preview, at first i got problems with drivers, i lost all Ethernet drivers and wifi driver, but somehow i managed it with reseting PC. So i lost all softwares and everything was moved to Windows.old folder.
 Ok that wouldnt be a problem, but then i gues i did a big mistake by deleting completely all that was in that Windows.old folder. Because now when i turn on my PC i only got blue screen with this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Your PC/Device needs to be repaired.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The digital signature for this file couldnt be verified.</strong></p>
<p><strong>File: windows\system32\boot\winload.exe</strong></p>
<p><strong>Error code: 0xc0000428</strong></p>
<strong>You’ll need to use recovery tools. if you dont have any installation media (like a disc or USB device), contact your PC administrator, or PC/Device manufacture.</strong>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>When I try to reset PC like before it stops at 38% and shows that reset cant be done. Also tried to reinstal windows from USB but somehow i cant! And when i unplug USB and turn on PC at first i got blue screen with some text and
<strong>CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED</strong> and then it&nbsp; shows some automatic repair and advanced options, well i tried all of then, but nothing works for me! :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should say that im not the expert in all these PC stuffs! I really hope that some one could help me with some usefull advice!!!</p>

            <p><span>Hi,<br />
<br />
Thank you for being a part of Windows 10 Technical Preview testing.<br />
<br />
Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue?<br />
<br />
The issue could be due to the Build corrupted. I would suggest you to download Build 10162 from the following link, create ISO and install. Once you install Build 10162, Microsoft have released the latest Build 10166, I would suggest you to upgrade to the latest
 Build. <br />
<br />
</span><strong><span>Download Windows 10 Insider Preview ISO July Update

    <title>Windows 10 broken after Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> felixweber1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 broken after Update</h2>
                    <p>For half a year or so every time Windows updated, something didn't work aftwerwards.</p>
<p>Last December, after a Windows Update, the colors were really weird and everything was slow and buggy.</p>
<p>I managed to find the Reset Update Option ( I am not sure if that is the real name, it basically uninstalled the last update so I could use the older version) and everything was fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About a month later it forced me to do the Update again, this time it no longer recognized my speaker and something was wrong with the GPU ( I only got 2 FPS in League of Legends, where I normally would have 200 or so).
</p>
<p>Again, I uninstalled the update and used the older version and everything was fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, It forced me to update again, this time after the update:</p>
<p>-It doesn't recognize my speaker again</p>
<p>-I get really bad FPS in all games</p>
<p>-The computer is slower</p>
<p>-Half of the Apps on my Desktop and my Task Bar are gone</p>
<p>- Some folders are located in other places (e.g. Origin and Origin Games so it doesn't see the games on ther Computer anymore)</p>
<p>-And I CAN'T OPEN THE SETTINGS, THE CONTROL PANEL and many other System Settings</p>
<p>-&gt; I can't uninstall the Update and I have no idea what to do</p>
<p>
</p><p>I watched some Videos and read some discussions about what to do (delete ApplicationManifest from ImmersiveControlPanel: it's not even there, Do the troubleshooter for WIndows Update: nothing happened), but nothing worked.</p>
<p>If I try to open the settings over Windows+R, It says that the file I'm searching isn't even there.</p>
<p>I have no idea what to do. PLEASE HELP!</p>

<p>To be honest, given the situation where it is likely carrying forward some corruption from the past that is making ever future update have issues, I would do this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1)&nbsp; Copy all your files to a USB stick (or even better, store them in OneDrive, Drop Box, Google Drive, etc.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2)&nbsp; Download the latest version of Windows directly from the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows 10 Download page</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3)&nbsp; Clean-Install Windows 10 directly from that, so you have a perfect/pristine functioning system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4)&nbsp; Reinstall your favorite browser/apps/etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>All in all, it should take about 2 hours.&nbsp; But it'll be a lot easier than days/weeks of headaches.</p>

<p>Wow thanks for that very fast reply, I didn't expect that.</p>
<p>I don't know how installing a 'new' Windows works, I just download it from there and then hit 'Install' and I get a new Windows on my Computer and all my personal data ( which I put on a stick before) is deleted?</p>

<p>Pretty much.&nbsp; Here's the gist of it.&nbsp; That site has a tool that lets you make your own "Windows installer drive" (it can be a USB 'thumb drive stick' or a CD).&nbsp; I prefer USB but that's because most of my computers don't have disc drives.&nbsp; You just need a
 USB stick that can hold at least 8 GB of data (they cost about $8 dollars at Walmart if you don't have one).</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Run that tool and it puts all the installer files on the USB drive.</li><li>Plug the drive into the troubled computer and boot up from the USB stick, choosing to install when prompted.</li><li>When it asks what drive to install Windows onto, I like to delete all the listed partitions until nothing is left except for "Unallocated space", then click "Next".&nbsp; Windows will create all the drive partition setup automatically and install (takes about
 15 minutes).</li><li>Then you'll get the setup part where it asks you to choose your time zone and wifi settings, and you're done (well, except for reinstalling your favorite other things like browsers or whatever).</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>This makes the computer basically "factory fresh" and just like you took it out of the box, ready to use and should be in perfect working order.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use a lot of experimental software so I tend to go through these steps more than a regular person would, and I keep all my important files in OneDrive so that they are already available as soon as I login to the restored computer (plus it syncs those files
 to my other computers).</p>

<p>Ok thank you very much I think I understand :D</p>
<p>I just have two more questions to step #2: Do I have to delete all my stuff first? Does it automatically start booting when I stick it in or do I have to do something?</p>
<p>Oh, a question about the Windows Tool you mentioned, there are 2 options:</p>
<p>Install Fall Creator Update or</p>
<p>Install Windows 10.</p>
<p>I have to choose Install Windows 10, right?</p>

<p>I would say use the Fall Creator.&nbsp; That's the version that was released in September 2017 (so it has a version number of 1709).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The next major update is coming in a few weeks, version 1803 (which means "2018, March").</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You don't have to delete anything ahead of time, since step 3 in my previous reply (when you remove existing hard drive partitions) will take care of that all at once and remove everything.</p>

            Yeah the marketing team loves to come up with cute names for them like "Fall Creators Update" (since they loaded a ton of updates that they think creative-type people would like), but us geeks tend to just go by the number to keep it simple.&nbsp; I don't think
 anyone even knows what this March's update name will be yet.&nbsp; Some people are already calling it "Spring Creator update", and other people south of the equator are irritated because it's not spring time in Australia anyway, but I honestly just disregard those
 marketing things anyway.

<p>So sorry, I sent you the wrong link.&nbsp; Well not wrong, but more advanced.</p>
<p><br />
The correct page is this one:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows 10 Media Creation Tool</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Run the tool on that page, and it will put all the install files onto a USB stick for you (note it does erase the stick before it does this, so don't store any files on the thumb drive you want to keep).</p>

    <title>Aero snapping betwen multiple monitors - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> &#35;pensum  say:</h3>
<h2>            Aero snapping betwen multiple monitors</h2>
                    <p>I have read multiple threads about this issue and it looks like Microsoft could not care less about Windows 10 users. These said threads are as old as 2015 and the issue is still not fixed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Long story short, I am using Windows Areo Snapping feature but when I want to move any window to my second monitor, Areo snap thinks I want to snap the window to the side of my first monitor. A simple fix as ''hold window for one second to snap'' instead
 of having the users to drag the windows with their mouse as fast as possible to snap. You guys know it's not a hardware issue or software updates. This problem exists only in Windows 10. This problem is the tool itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And before you try to direct me on how to disable it, that is not what I need. I want to snap my windows and use the feature, but it's outraging that I have to move the mouse as fast as possible while dragging a window between my dual monitors. I am an advanced
 user and currently a programming student and even I know it should be an easy fix. So I ask you, in 2019, Microsoft, fix it!</p>

            Hi Sebastien.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I've read through your problem and only want to be sure:  You are using Extend Monitors, correct?  And I'm sure you've seen to it you have the very latest and/or best Display driver which governs this feature and especially Dual Monitors.  
<br />
<br /> If you want to report this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback. They will not even see it here. This is a tech forums staffed mostly by volunteers trying to help others with your problems.
<br />
<br />If you want to post back a Share link from your Feedback here others who see this thread can vote it up and add to it. If you are an Insider I can also vote it up with my MVP badge and track the issue for you.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />

    <title>Surface Pro 4 Plugged in but not charging - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface Pro 4 Plugged in but not charging</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Surface Pro 4 was purchased in February of 2016, and other than a few minor glitches works perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently though the battery is not accepting a charge, it says it is plugged in and not charging.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My theory is that when my computer did its automatic updates somehow there was a glitch and since then it doesn't work.</p>
<p>(I came to this conclusion because a couple weeks prior during an automatic update it deleted my wifi driver and I had to have it taken in to be fixed)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried deleting the drivers and re installing them, and completed all recent updates. When that didn't fix the problem I did a complete recovery of my system, backed up all my files and started fresh. That still didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on how to get this fixed or other avenues I can try before I take it into the Microsoft store?</p>
                </div>

<p>It's a bit late to respond... but the only thing that somewhat works for me is to just unplug it and plug it back in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mine has the issue that you've described (I think). For me, mine is almost always on the charger at home. Just today for example I turned my pro 4 on after it being plugged in since Saturday (Tuesday now) and it's at 6% battery. I just took it off the factory
 charger and immediately put it back in and its slowly charging.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My theory is that for some reason once its fully charged it stops charging so as not to damage the battery, but then does not reinitiate charging as the battery drains until it detects its plugged in again. Now that I think about it, I'm going to test this
 by getting an outlet with a timer and set it to cut power once per day and see if it will stay charged like that.</p>

            Per this page, it looks like Windows 98 is the oldest version that supports DirectX 9.

<p>Hi Andrew,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I would need to ask few questions so I can isolate your concern properly. Kindly answer the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Did you get a specific error message?</li><li>What are the troubleshooting steps you have done so far?</li><li>What's the current build of your computer? Press Windows key + R and then type winver.</li><li>Did you try to run a full system scan using your anti-virus? Can you tell us the result?</li><li>Does your SD card has a write protection?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, you may try these troubleshooting steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 1: Run the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter. Open Settings&gt; Update &amp; Security&gt; Troubleshoot&gt; Hardware and Devices&gt; Run the troubleshooter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 2:&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">Check SD Card in Disk Management.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">Open Disk Management.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">Your SD card will appear as a removable disk.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">Check if it has a drive letter.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">If it does not show anything, </span><span>right click the SD card and then select “Change Drive Letter and Paths”.</span></li><li><span>Click “Add” and select a drive letter, then click “OK”.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">Step 3: Update SD card driver.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">Open Device manager.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">Find your SD card and right click it.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">Select Properties.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">Click the driver tab and then select Update Driver.</span></li></ol>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">&nbsp;Note: You may need to use a keyboard and mouse to connect to your laptop to perform the said steps if it does not allow on tablet mode.</span></p>

            I get code 10. SD storage class controller. Operation failed. The requested operation was unsuccessful on Intel SD host controller. I have done the driver update but windows has determined that the best driver for the device is already installed.

<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows may find the best driver is already installed. But just to be sure, please contact your device manufacturer so they can give you the best driver applicable for your tablet.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
As I understand you are facing a Blue screen error on the computer, and you are unable to read the instructions shown on the screen.</p>
<p><br />
In order to understand the issue better please provide some additional information.</p>
<p><br />
1. When do you receive the blue screen error?</p>
<p><br />
2. What was the recent hardware or software change made to the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p><br />
3. What is the make and model number of the computer?</p>
<p><br />
4. Does the PC immediately restart after the boot?</p>
<p><br />
Please provide the necessary information to receive accurate troubleshooting steps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p>Unplug all external devices except mouse and keyboard then try to boot. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the step fails then try,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Windows hangs or freezes</em></strong></p>

            <p>Also, it may help to look at the minidump files from the crashes with a debugger.</p>
<p>Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via Windows Live SkyDrive or similar site?</p>
<p>The following link has information on using Windows Live SkyDrive:</p>
<p><a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65</a></p>
<p>If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop</p>
<p>Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time.<br />

            <p>Just to clarify: the question here IS NOT what caused the BSOD, but what the programmers were smoking when designing such a kind of unreadable BSOD and how that unreadably small font can be avoided and the info be displayed in a readable font size!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Problem to discuss here starts to exist from that point in time when the BSOD-managing software (that one that collects the information AFTER the real crash) has found out what the crash could have caused (long long after the crash itself), and it ends
 at that point in time when that information is written to the screen in an unreadably small font; i.e. the&nbsp;issue in the system is at the point when the information with the reason is "written" onto the BSOD and that BSOD is given to the screen to be displayed.
 In that process of "having got the information with the appropriate word, writing it onto a BSOD template and sending that template to the graphicscard for displaying it onto the screen". That's the range of the issue here – and not the cause of the BSOD itself!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is an issue by itself to create a design for a BSOD that is not readable on EVERY monitor display possible (as long as anything can be given to the monitor to be displayd and as long as the display is still displaying it)! A BSOD of "old fashioned" Windows
 comes in 80x24 characters and would even be readable on a line printer. Btw: the BSOD is given out&nbsp;in 640x480 VGA size!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What did the programmers think when they had designed a BSOD that delivers such an unreadable font? And how can that be avoided so that the info gets readable?&nbsp;That's the question here – and not what was causing the BSOD; that's another issue (to come to
 later on)!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First solution to find here is how the info line can be displayed in a readable form – and only if that is done (and not before), a second step would be looking after the source of the BSOD. As&nbsp;it is reproduceable here for the moment, it can be used for
 testing&nbsp;several options you might offer how to improve the&nbsp;design of the BSOD&nbsp;and specially that too small info line!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now to the BSOD itself: the BSOD is 100% reproduceable here: the only thing that has to be done to get it is refreshing the Windows Experience Information Index, then it ALWAYS shoots a BSOD reproduceably; WEI so far never did end and rate that PC so far!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The hardware here is a GA-8I915P Duo Motherboard with P4 3.2GHz Processor (640), 80GB HD, NVidia GF6200TC, Philips 150S Display, and 1GB of RAM (what is declared to fulfill the system requirements for the 32bit-OS; the Winows 8 Upgrade Assistant only reports
 three "non-issues":&nbsp;for playing DVD, a DVD-Player would be needed, Secure-Boot&nbsp;would not be&nbsp;possible with that PC,&nbsp; and for SNAP a bigger Display&nbsp;would be&nbsp;needed. All other mentioned items (incl.&nbsp;Graphics card and AV cards*)&nbsp;are reported fully compatible!
 *There are three additional PCI-Cards installed (all from pinnacle): a DVB-S, an analog TV and a FireWire, and all reported fully compatible! But I would not wonder if the crash could be caused by shared memory ...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Btw: that same BSOD (caused by WEI) also occurred&nbsp;on different hardware (Phenom 9750) where&nbsp;all the first attempts were ending also&nbsp;in a BSOD. Only about the fifth or sixth try for updating the WEI&nbsp;was successfully finished; before ALWAYS got a BSOD (same
 style as here); and that other PC also got the same too small unreadable font in the BSOD. The other PC now can run the WEI without issue; the PC here does not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And something more:&nbsp;at the first attempt to reboot after&nbsp;every&nbsp;BSOD occurred under the described circumstances, the BIOS hangs at disk recognition – when pressing reset again the PC starts normally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS: immediate reboot is disabled in the system settings (otherwise I would not have got enough time to photograph the BSOD design)! Btw: the photo is as clear that you can see the single pixels – and notice that the letters are far too small! It is a 640x480-screensize
 blown up to the 1024x768 of the monitor; but also looking at it on a different&nbsp;monitor that keeps the native resolution it's as badly readable as it is here.</p>

            <p>Although I can't agree with the vehemence of the reply above, I agree that this particular question -- and the one I have as well -- is not "how do I fix my BSOD" but rather "is there a way for me to be able to read the text of the error message".</p>
<p>The reason I'd like to read the error message is that I'm not exactly unversed in the dark arts of Windows but I'm at a loss when essentially Windows tells me: "something went wrong".</p>
<p>I've already looked up instructions for reading minidump files, etc. but would like to avoid that if I can.</p>
<p>I would just -- please -- like to read the error message that Windows is trying to show me.</p>
<p>But it seems that style triumphed over substance in the BSOD and the font for the most important part of the error message is too small to read.</p>
<p>- Is there a way to make the BSOD readable?</p>
<p>- Failing that, is there a way to see what caused the crash on the next reboot?</p>
<p>- Is there a lot in the Event Viewer? I couldn't find one?</p>
<p>- Can someone can help elicit more information from a ?SYSTEM?THREAD?EXCEPTION ?C??? C??.SYS", which is all I'm capable of reading of my error message?</p>
<p>In the past, I was able to get much farther in repairing Windows on my own. With Windows 8, I've only found forum posts that immediately ask me to upload my minidmp files and to wait for a solution.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any help you may have!</p>

Thanks for the nirsoft-link with&nbsp;very&nbsp;useful&nbsp;tools (I know and&nbsp;use for years) ... :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But please do not change topic here! Topic her is NOT what caused any kind of BSOD; topic here is what caused THAT UNREADABLE SMALL FONT ON THE BLUE-SCREEN!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking for the further information in the&nbsp;log-files&nbsp;is a second step. First step is analysing only the information that is presented on the BSOD; and if that information is in an unreadble font, something with the BSOD ITSELF is wrong (that was created
 BETWEEN SYSTEM-FAULT AND DISPLAYING THE BLUE-SCREEN! That's topic here – not the cause of the BSOD!</p>

            I am also having the problem of being unable to read the most important piece of information on the blue screen because someone wasn't thinking when they redesigned the blue screen code.&nbsp; This needs to be fixed.&nbsp; It sounds like it can only be fixed by
 Microsoft's Programmers, since no one has, thus far, posted a cure for the unreadable font.

            I would like to add yet another vote for making the BSOD readable&nbsp;(and in particular the bottom line of text that actually has some useful information - unlike the rest of the screen). I am amazed that with the effort invested in changing the BSOD screen
 to graphical format it was allowed to ship in such an unusable state.

<h2>            XBOX music gamertag change.</h2>
                    
<p>I went to xbox.xom to buy some music and when I used my email to log on it came up with Xaveus Young as the login person, so I clicked on it and it says it is my gamer ID. Ok, so must have been one of my kids that set it up or from long ago....but I will
 just change it. I click on change ID and in true Microsoft fashion, the change ID page does what? nothing, it just gives you a link to info on how to change the ID in xbox 360...ok great, well except for one small issue, I don't have an xbox, I listen to music
 on a computer.</p>
<p>So now what?</p>
<p>On Google you click change account name and it comes up with a box that you input a new name and submit and it changes it....does Microsoft have anything like this?</p>

<p>Yes, that is the page that just has a link to instructions on how to change your gamerid in xbox 360....which I do not have.</p>
<p>I don't think it can be done....I have been searching all day and have found over 700 posts so far on it, with people having the same issue...and no one had a solution except for just cancel and go with google or Itunes for music.</p>
<p>Really wanted to stay with Microsoft, but if they cannot even get simple database programming right I wonder if the service is any good.</p>
<p>Have you EVER in your life heard of not being able to simply change a username....lol</p>
<p>Personally I think it is because Microsoft just wants to shuck the xbox and could care less about customer service :P</p>
<p>Thank you for your help though...</p>

<p>I've heard of many services not allowing a person to change their user name, Sony's PlayStation Network is one clear example. &nbsp;iTunes has no "username" to speak of either, their accounts are simply an e-mail address.<br />
<br />
Gamertags are just what they seem to be a "tag" used by gamers to differentiate themselves from one another. &nbsp;Clearly someone who had access to your account has access to an Xbox to set up the customized avatar and gamertag. &nbsp;If the tag wasn't changed it'd
 be something along the lines of "UnrelentingCuddle291253" or "OverbearingKitten460234" and not "Xaveus Young" which coincidentally is the exact username of someone who actively plays EVE Online and has been a member of that game for approximately two years.
 &nbsp;The EVE Online avatar also matches your Xbox LIVE avatar quite well.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, if you did get access to a gaming console to change your gamertag then you'd also have to pay $9.99 plus applicable taxes.<br />

<p>I expect it's more because the gamertag doesn't really matter unless you're on the console. &nbsp;It's starting to matter a LITTLE more now with Windows 8, but if all you do is listen to music then it's really not important. &nbsp;That being said I will agree that
 if they are moving forward with integration of their services then they should have an option on the website or computer to change the gamertag.</p>
<p>Visage is correct through, if you want a different ID on PSN you need to make a new account.</p>

<p>To make a new account, then I need to tie it to a different email....this email is used to log on to all of my devices, so now I have to change all those devices.</p>
<p>Yes my kid created the name, on a computer not an xbox by the way. But not sure what that has to do with the question of how to change it.</p>
<p>But in true Microsoft fashion there seems to be no answer. I also just found out that in order to use the xbox music app on android I have to pay 9.99 a month...lol...just to play the music I already bought!
</p>
<p>Bought some music on Google Play and guess what it did...downloaded what is called an mp3 to my devices all at once.</p>
<p>Also they have an automated system, what that does is when you change your username or ANY account info, the server automatically goes into the database and changes what is called the table reference....so that way no human has to be instructed to do it,
 whereby incurring no cost. Microsoft should look into that, you do however need a developer that has a high enough skill level or you could just farm it out to a company that does. Just a thought.</p>
<p>I will just use Google....Thanks for trying to help.</p>

<p>If you buy mp3s from Xbox Music then you can transfer them to the phone without trouble. &nbsp;Downloading purchases may be added to the app on Android at some point, but it's a new app so the functionality isn't all there yet.</p>
<p>Back in the day gamertags that were used were permanently consumed, that is likely the reason why it costs money, to prevent people from simply burning through every decent gamertag in short order. &nbsp;They are recycled now, eventually, but there's little motivation
 to remove the price.</p>

<h2>            skype doesnt not ring</h2>
                    <p>My son has tried to call me various times but skype does not ring at my end. Nor when I call him does he hear ringing. When I call, I do hear skype ringing at my end and the same when he calls me but neither can hear on the other end. I have checked everything
 i can think of. any suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: we were both sitting in front of our computers,, and they were wide awake at the time we tested. It does show a call was being made made but no sound and that is the only way we know a call was attempted.

            <p>Hi GaryFloyd,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the current design of Windows Family Safety, we cannot delete the activity report for the child. The reason behind this is so you will&nbsp;be able to check the browsing history of the child&nbsp;all over&nbsp;or other activities in the computer and design a much
 better settings for the child using Windows Family Safety. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hello, SyrianLeague,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Studies have been conducted on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typography#Readability_and_legibility" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
readability and legibility</a> of all caps text. Some 20th century scientific testing indicates that all caps text is less legible and less readable than lower case text.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Colin_Wheildon_(Typographer)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Colin Wheildon</a> stated that there is an "apparent consensus" that lower case text is more legible.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_caps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_caps</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another rule is to avoid typing in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_caps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
all caps</a> or grossly enlarging script for emphasis, which is considered to be the equivalent of shouting or yelling.

<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Yes, 4 GBs of RAM is sufficient to run either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Ultimately, depending on the applications you are using, you might need more over time.
<br />
<br />Applications such as Chrome web browser user a lot of resources, but for every day web browsing, word processing, listening music, email, it should be sufficient.

</p><blockquote>is 4GB ram enough for windows 10 after update. my dell laptop became quite slow
</blockquote>
<p>Most users have more RAM than they they need. Their computers are not slow because they lack RAM, but rather because they have too much software running in the background, or their computers are not properly setup, or they have been attacked by malware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The truth is: The amount of RAM you need is determined by the software you install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 by itself will work well with as little as 2 GB of RAM, but you're surely going to install additional software, which will require additional RAM. You have to take that software into account when computing how much RAM you should have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your calculation should be based on the amount recommended by the software developers, which you can easily find on the developers' websites:</p>
<p>
</p><p>amount recommended for Windows 10</p>
<p>amount recommended for program #1</p>
<p>amount recommended for program #2</p>
<p>etc.</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------</p>
<p>total recommended amount of RAM</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should round up to the nearest gigabyte, then add a little more to take into account software you may install in the future. RAM is always installed in multiples of 2, i.e., 2 GB, 4 GB, 6, 8, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is how you determine how much RAM your computer should have. Anything else is a guess or a 'rule of thumb.'</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regardless of any calculation, the most RAM you can use with 32-bit Windows is 4 GB.</p>

<p>Enough for Windows? Yes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Enough for you? Maybe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How much RAM you should have for good performance mostly depends on what programs you run and how big are the files you open with them. To take two extreme examples, if all you do is play solitaire, 4GB is more than enough, but if you regularly edit large
 video files, 8GB or even more would be desirable.</p>

            Hi davidcollins_825,
<br />
<br />If you are seeing transparency effects, these can be changed in Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Toggling the slider to on/off under the Transparency effects sub-heading (underneath the More options heading)
<br />
<br />If this isn't what you are talking about, could you please elaborate and/or post a screenshot?
<br />
<br />Looking forward to your response,
<br />Nathan       
        </p>

            Right click the desktop, Pick settings.<br />
It may also be the Display adapter in Device Manager.
