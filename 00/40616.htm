<h2>            Windows 10 - Stuck on &#34;This won&#39;t take long&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I think my idea of "won't take long" might be different!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an ASUS K53T laptop that was running Windows 7 Home which I have upgraded to Windows 10.&nbsp; I used the automatic, free upgrade available via Windows Update.&nbsp; After learning more about troubleshooting than I ever wanted to, I am desperate to get to either
 my old Windows 7 configuration or a reasonably solid Windows 10.&nbsp; Both of my efforts have hit the same roadblock.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tried "Go back to Windows 7" or "Reset This PC" to re-install Windows 10, I get the following:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Getting things ready - This won't take long.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then that's all.&nbsp; I can wait hours watching the dots spin around and eventually have to hit &lt;Cancel&gt; (which works).&nbsp; Then I try something else in my ever-decreasing hopes of rescuing this laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried all of the following, plus many other things:<br />
- SFC /SCANNOW<br />
- CHKDSK<br />
- DISM /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth<br />
- Uninstalling virtually everything that did not come standard with the machine, except for MS-Office and Chrome.<br />
- Creating a new account with Administrator rights to work from<br />
- Running the utility from Safe Mode (when I'm lucky enough to coax it into booting into Safe Mode)<br />
- Turning off wireless and running a cable across the house to the router<br />
- Windows Defender scan<br />
- Windows Update (never finishes - this is one of several reasons I'm trying a clean install)<br />
- Lots and lots of beer (this was no help at all, if you're interested in trying this approach)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've run out of my own ideas&nbsp;ideas and Google results to try so I'm breaking down and posting this.&nbsp; Any suggestions would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hello Annu,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the quick reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already resolved several other post-upgrade issues but the remaining ones that are making me want to reinstall Windows 10 are:<br />
- The computer never wakes up after sleeping.&nbsp; I need to power it off and on.<br />
- Unless I mess with the boot options, it will not reboot cleanly.&nbsp; It will say "Restarting" with the spinning dots but never get beyond that.&nbsp; (For some reason, selecting "No GUI boot", "Boot log" and "OS boot information" on the MSCONFIG Boot tab seems to
 work around this issue.)<br />
- I've heard Windows 10 boots VERY fast but my experience does not match.&nbsp; After the initial blue logo displays, the screen goes blank for quite a while (maybe 1 or 2 minutes) before I see the login screen.&nbsp; (Maybe that's normal and my expectations are too
 high but a blank screen does not increase confidence.)<br />
- Frequent DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE messages in the Windows System Event Log.<br />
- None of my USB thumb drives work.&nbsp; For the ones with a light, the light comes on but they do not appear in File Explorer.<br />
- Windows Update does not progress beyond "Checking for updates"</p>
<p><br />
I will attempt the repair from DVD option you are recommending, but before doing so I have a couple of licensing/activation questions I'm hoping you can help with please:<br />
- Since I got here by upgrading from an OEM version of Windows 7 to Windows 10, will there be any questions about license keys or activation keys or anything like that?&nbsp; If so, I assume I will need to record these details BEFORE I start anything.<br />
- I am willing to do a full re-format/reinstall from the DVD image but again, I'm not sure what I will need to know or preserve in order to ensure I will still be licensed after the dust settles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions before I end up with an unlicensed installation would be appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steve</p>

            <p>I hope this long-winded story might save somebody else some of the time-consuming frustration that I have been through.&nbsp; I'm replying to my own post here in case anybody else out there runs into a similar problem and is also uncertain about the licensing
 implications that I asked about above but did not receive a response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, I did attempt the Startup Repair options in an attempt to repair the installation from media.&nbsp; There are different ways of getting to the Startup Repair options and none of them were successful.&nbsp; At first, I was a little&nbsp;optimistic because it did
 seem to be able to complete a lot more work than I could see from the "Reset this PC" options but again, it ran into an error after which it could not proceed.&nbsp; The SRTTRAIL.TXT file said "Boot manager is missing or corrupt".&nbsp; I tried a few more suggestions
 I found online (e.g. "Bootrec /Rebuild BCD") but with no better luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, I gave up all hope of proceeding with my "upgraded" installation so I went with the full re-format/re-install from the media I had created.&nbsp; Again, I hit a wall.&nbsp; I was booting from the DVD I had just burned and verified and after it got part-way in,
 it said "A media driver your computer needs is missing.&nbsp; This could be a DVD, USB, or Hard Disk driver."&nbsp; I had no idea where to look especially since it appeared to be booting from the DVD no problem, writing to the hard drive no problem, and not using any
 USB ports at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>More Googling....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somebody somewhere had an article suggesting that I&nbsp;put the Windows 10 ISO on a USB thumb drive instead of a DVD.&nbsp; I have no idea why this is different, but it actually worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a couple of hours, I had a completely&nbsp;clean install of Windows 10, no question marks in Device Manager, no strange behaviors, nothing odd in the Event Logs, and decent performance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further to my licensing question in a previous post,&nbsp;I skipped the steps&nbsp;where I was prompted to enter a product key and was pleasantly surprised (my first pleasant surprise since I started on this adventure) to see that Windows was successfully activated.&nbsp;
 I can&nbsp;only guess that since the upgrade was able to get far enough to activate my&nbsp;system, the re-install was smart enough to recognize I was coming from the same system and it retained its activation.&nbsp; This is just a guess though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All in all, way too much&nbsp;troubleshooting and&nbsp;the free&nbsp;"upgrade" was not really what I would call a success,&nbsp;but I do have a Windows 10 system that is now working well.&nbsp; If I'm able to mark my own post as the "Answer", I will do so, but I'm not sure if this
 forum will let me do that.</p>

<p>I have the same problem and I've tried that already. It gets to about 6% then displays that it's undoing changes, then it gives me the generic "Windows encountered a problem and couldn't reset your computer"</p>
<p>Then it gives me the option restart or go into a bunch of options that don't help.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 custom shortcut not working In desktop</h2>
                    <p>hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a small but annoying problem that I have been ignoring since the beginning of 2018!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have created custom shortcuts e.g. control+ F1, F2 etc. to launch different programs.</p>
<p>When I start or restart my computer and I am at the desktop screen [wallpaper screen] and no programs running, none of the custom shortcuts work!</p>
<p>
</p><p>However when I start ANY program e.g. notepad Firefox or file Explorer, the custom shortcuts works flawlessly!</p>
<p>
</p><p>After closing all programs and returning to desktop, the shortcuts stops working again!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope I managed to explain my problem clearly.&nbsp; And I hope there is a solution out there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<h2>            New Windows Update crashes my internet</h2>
                    I just installed the latest update and now my internet crashes within 10 seconds of getting on. I am running win7 sp2 64 bit and am trying to get on the internet with Chrome. I tried uninstalling the update and it did not fix it. I tried restoring to a
 point 3 times and it will not restore properly. Can anyone help me? My machine is a Dell.&nbsp;

 have to wait for&nbsp;Google to post an update.&nbsp; Chrome works for about 10 seconds, then it crashes.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know how to get into safe mode, but not sure what you mean by networking.&nbsp;It there a way to select it when safe mode boots up?&nbsp; I haven't had use safe mode for over 3 years.</p>

    <title>New Windows Install Limiting Download Speed to 5 mbs on Ethernet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> luke cypert  say:</h3>
<h2>            New Windows Install Limiting Download Speed to 5 mbs on Ethernet</h2>
                    <div>
<p>After struggling with the Windows Store and constantly having failed downloads, very irregular download speeds, and just your everyday Windows Store issues... I decided to reset my Windows installation. The new installation
<strong>will not download anything faster than 5.2 mbs</strong>. I'm running on a
<strong>wired network</strong> with the previous Windows installation (hours before)<strong> working fine for months.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I've tried at least the following</strong> (and in various combinations):</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Resetting network</li><li>Resetting Router/Modem (one unit. Unplugging, pressing reset button etc)</li><li>Updating LAN driver</li><li>Uninstalling the LAN driver and using the Windows Default</li><li>Disabling Windows Defender (no other antivirus running)</li><li>Disabling Windows Firewall</li><li>Testing in Safe Mode with Networking</li><li>Changing the network to metered and unmetered. </li><li>Changing the Speed &amp; Duplex setting from Auto to 1 gbs</li><li>Disabling QoS</li><li>Running various CMD commands found in any number of support forums (such as: ipconfig/flushdns, netsh int reset all, netsh winsock reset etc)</li><li>And everything else I can find online</li></ul>
</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p><em>Does anyone else have ideas? </em></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>I just reset Windows and started trying to download stuff, and that's it. When the network was limited I updated the LAN driver from the MSI website (I have an MSI mainboard), and when that didn't work I started trying all the random stuff above.
<strong>Resetting the modem did once give me temporary higher speeds... Does that grantee that it's a modem issue?&nbsp;</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>I should mention that <strong>all downloads are limited</strong> whether I'm downloading through Windows Store, Chrome, Edge, Adobe Creative Cloud Installer and Steam.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><br />
Also cool, I still <strong>canNOT</strong> download stuff from the Windows Store. Fun times in Windows land.&nbsp;<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that it is your actual internet connection that has a problem... Either the ISP's router, or your modem\router... I have had similar problems in the past with both issues...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most recently my download speed was running at 1\2 normal speed... Resetting the actual ISP provided modem\router by physically unplugging it from the wall for 30 seconds or so resolved the problem...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Turning off the power button on the modem\router did not help...</p>
<p>
</p><p>On other occasions, I simply needed to contact the ISP, after which they informed me that they had found issues with THEIR router equipment after my complaint..</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing you could check is to go to "Delivery Optimization" and click on the "Advanced" near the bottom... There are settings there that could possibly throttle certain types of activity...</p>

            Hi Luke.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />  I'll give you everything else possible to try in order of priority so that hopefully something works: 
<br />
<br />Right click the network icon in System Tray at bottom right end of task bar to Troubleshoot Problems.   
<br />
<br />Try powering off modem  PC and then restarting in that order with 1 minute in between each.
<br />
<br />Try all of these steps:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/how-to-reset-network-settings-to-default-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.kapilarya.com/how-to-reset-network-...</a>
<br />
<br />Update your network adapter drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page using the full model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If you have the latest network driver then try on it's Driver tab also to Roll Back, or Uninstall and then restart PC to reinstall the driver.  Try also all older drivers from Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick list working backwards.
<br />
<br />If you're using a router try plugging into the Modem.  You're also entitled to tech Support from your IP provider to get the speeds you pay for, which is included in your bill. 
<br /> 
<br />Another option is you could replace the wireless adapter with an inexpensive USB nano adapter like this one:  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df_B06XSFPDFX5388318/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;creative=394997&amp;creativeASIN=B06XSFPDFX&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=198076677096&amp;hvpos=1o1&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=17389337054377542194&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9012017&amp;hvtargid=pla-373873511931" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df...</a> 
<br />
<br />You can also go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />Remember also that a Reset is NOT  a Clean Install, which wipes the drive to keep from building up a disk junkyard and includes all of the optimizations which work best in  Windows 10 if you follow the gold standard install here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br /> I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />
<br />If you receive a popup asking if this solved your problem please ignore it, as it will remove my ability to help you and others may also not help.  Please wait until after the issue is resolved to answer the popup or mark your question answered to help others.

Yeah I need to get in touch with my ISP. My modem and router (one unit) were supplied by them.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I've looked at the settings on the router's web interface, but haven't noticed anything that will help. EDIT: I reset the modem to factory, but no change in the speed on this machine.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Delivery optimization just seems to be related to Windows downloads (and maybe Windows store and apps downloaded though the Windows store), so that wouldn't impact things like Chrome, Steam and Creative Cloud, right?

            I read everything you tried, and as I said I was giving you all steps so you could have the full list.
<br />
<br />
I also said I'd continue to work with you until the problem is resolved, just as I have a hundred thousand others in the past ten years daily in forums. Every single person who's worked closely with me has gotten their problem solved.&nbsp; I am also a senior Moderator
 and MVP here and therefore have unlimited resources to draw on.<br />
<br />
So did you want my help or not? I was just getting started. Any particular reason why you'd reply to someone reaching out to help you with a snide response instead of the results for new steps I'd given?
<br />

<p>Honestly it sounded like a bot response since I'd tried almost everything listed and I'm not using wifi.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
But let's walk through the high points of your post.<br />
<br />
"<span>Right click the network icon in System Tray at bottom right end of task bar to Troubleshoot Problems."<br />
Of course no errors are detected.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
"</span><span>Try powering off modem PC and then restarting in that order with 1 minute in between each."<br />
I did mention that I have reset my modem. I've updated my post with more details. I always try many combinations of everything. So powering things off, pressing reset buttons, unplugging, resetting factory settings...&nbsp;<br />
<br />
"</span><span>Try all of these steps"<br />
I listed that I've tried essentially all of those.<br />
<br />
"</span><span>Update your network adapter drivers..."</span></p>
<p><span>I noted that I've tried Windows default drivers as well as the most current from the motherboard manufacturer. I'll also say that I have totally uninstalled the network adapter and let Windows rediscover it. And of
 course I do the proper system restarts when working with rolling back, upgrading and uninstalling&nbsp;drivers.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
"</span><span>If you're using a router try plugging into the Modem"<br />
So, networking is not something I do. But my internet is with Cox Cable. They provided me with a modem/router (I guess that's what you call it) that the cable connects to. That provides wifi but my system I'm working on is hardlined in via some powerline adapters&nbsp;that
 I've used for several years in various&nbsp;houses with various ISPs.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
"</span><span>Another option is you could replace the wireless adapter with an inexpensive USB nano adapter like this one"<br />
This was one of the reasons that I thought you didn't read my post since I said in the title and first paragraph that I'm on a wired network.<br />
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>"</span><span>Remember also that a Reset is NOT a Clean Install"<br />
I always tinker with all the system settings on any system I set up, that includes registry editing. So I thought the best way to make sure I didn't mess up some setting somewhere was to do a reset. System settings, registry, services etc should be back to
 default. Since my downloads weren't throttled&nbsp;before, but were after, I assume that some setting needs to be changed to fix this. I just haven't&nbsp;found it yet.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Lastly, it is interesting that Windows Store will not download apps still. And of course I've done WSReset.exe, I've uninstalled the store, logged out, cleared cache so on and so forth.&nbsp;</span><span><br />
</span><br />
Thanks for any help you can offer.&nbsp;</p>

            When I post a list of steps I don't remove the ones you say you've already tried, because thousands of others see and need the complete list.  This is the world's largest tech forums with millions of daily views.
<br />
<br />Resetting WIndows is not like resetting a phone.  
<br />
<br />What we have found is that in Windows 10 everything depends on the quality of the underlying install, the same reason enthusiasts have never run Factory or Upgrade installs because they know there would be endless issues. 
<br />
<br /> For example there have been zero return problems by those who follow the gold standard Clean Install here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  It is better and faster than any previous version of Windows, and a better install than any amount of money could buy.  So when you get time I'd study over that to see if it's something I can help you do.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes... The Delivery Optimization only applies to Windows Updates, and possibly the Store...</p>
<p>It would not have any bearing on anything else...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had circumstances in which my ISP initially claimed that there "Should Not be A Problem" with my internet service as a result of their line test... Which was probably accurate...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that the line test was not testing bandwidth... Just the actual connection...</p>
<p>
</p><p>On multiple occasions I was later contacted by the local ISP technician, who reported to me that his line tests found a problem with the companies router\switching equipment... Sometimes locally, and other times as much as 100 miles away...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Out of all of the internet connection\speed issues over the years, I can not remember any that were due to my computer... Either a bad modem\router in my home, or switching equipment at some other location...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should mention an example... A local college switched their service to the ISP I had been using... The ISP even installed new switching equipment to handle the load... Regardless, my connection slowed badly...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The local technician explained to me that they had ended up with some of their circuitry being at 95% capacity, and resulted in the slowdown... I was sharing with too many people basically... It took over a year to get fully back up to speed...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could in fact have a problem with your computer... With Windows or hardware... But my personal experience involves confirming there is not a problem with the ISP's equipment before I start tearing my own stuff apart...</p>

            Many Dell systems have been having the situation you are seeing but I do not know if MSI is in the same position.&nbsp; There is a utility called SmartByte, which can restrict bandwidth.&nbsp; It is meant to help when streaming media but it can restrict the normal
 operations,&nbsp; so you might check if you have it installed.<br />

            <p>Hi Alan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the edition of Windows 7 installed in your system?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand you want to have the same wallpaper applied across all user accounts on your system. To do so, you might have to edit the corresponding group policy for which you have Windows 7 Professional, Ultimate or Enterprise installed in your system.
 Refer to the following steps if you have the stated editions.</p>
<p><br />
1. Go to the "Start Menu" and type "Run" into the search bar. Proceed to type in "gpedit.msc" into the space provided. Click "OK."</p>
<p><br />
2. Click "User Configuration" under "User Policy." Click "Administrative Templates".</p>
<p><br />
3. Click "Desktop" and then "Desktop Wallpaper." Click "Enabled."</p>
<p><br />
4. Enter in the location source of your desired Wallpaper next to "Name." For example, you will write in the name of your wallpaper file in between the parentheses at the end of the source of C:\Windows\web\wallpaper\(Your Wallpaper Name Goes Here).</p>
<p><br />
5. Click "Apply" to save your settings and "OK" to exit out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Do let us know if you need any further assistance, we will be glad to assist you.</p>

<span><span>All programs, except for an occasional tiny one) have many references to<span>&nbsp;</span>where they are located, in the registry

<br />
There are some third-party utilities, such as the freeware COA2.exe, which<span>&nbsp;</span>purport to search out all these entries and update them, but in my<span>&nbsp;</span>experience these are all

<p>
</p><p>Once again, Sniper Fury has just started a contest, already at least 3 people already have over 7 million or so hits. Seems a lot of hacks get into this game, and I am wondering why the security isn't better or why the game isn't monitored closer for the
 cheaters.</p>
<p>Maybe joining this game is a mistake, because I am now worried that with all of the hacks, they might be able to get acess to my own computer&nbsp;</p>

            Notepad doesn't have margins, other than maybe width of the window size. &nbsp; Drag the edge of the window resize to what fits &amp; normally it reopens the same width/height.

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>the only way that is closes to closing an xbox live account is by closing the Microsoft Account itself.</p>
<p>Which I assume you don't want to do, so the best alternative is to move that xbox live account to another Microsoft Account (and close that one) This will free up the Microsoft Account and should allow you to use it to upgrade your daughters offline profile to an xbox live account.</p>
<p>The steps on how to move a xbox live account to another Microsoft Account can be found here: </p>
<p><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/manage-gamertag-and-profile/switch-gamertag-to-different-microsoft-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../switch-gamertag-to-different-microsoft-account</a> Be aware that this may take 30 days before you can perform the steps</p>
<p>The steps on how to upgrade an offline profile to an online profile can be found here: </p>
<p><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/manage-gamertag-and-profile/offline-profile-to-gamertag" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../offline-profile-to-gamertag</a></p>
<p>That should allow you to upgrade her offline profile, but like I mentioned it may take 30 days to complete, since moving an xbox live account to another MS account can only be done after the profile has been on the console for at least 30 days.</p>

<h3> jared_p  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Bootlog&#58; Not loaded hal.inf &#38; cpu.inf</h2>
                    Good afternoon. I'm currently on Windows 10 Enterprise x64, build 17134 (I believe the latest).<br />
<br />
Recently, I had an issue with my PC freezing up and then proceeding to fail to boot properly a number of times, before I started up in safe mode, rebooted from the settings menu option, and have since got my PC back in working order. I'm not entirely sure what
 caused these freezes, but I do have my ntbtlog bootlog .txt file, and I'd appreciate if I could get someone with a bit more expertise on this subject to help me understand what caused my recent boot issues, and what I should do to prevent it in the future.<br />
<br />
Here is a pastebin link to my ntbtlog following my failure to boot;&nbsp;https://pastebin.com/AxDfnqWZ<br />
<br />
I believe that the log is indicating that my CPU is failing, but I've come here for answers from someone with more knowledge than I have.<br />
<br />
My PC Specs:<br />
Intel Core i5-4460 3.2Ghz<br />
8GB RAM<br />
Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 6GB<br />
Windows 10 Enterprise x64 Build 17134<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any assistance.

<h2>            asus elan touch pad not working in windows 8</h2>
                    <p>I installed Windows 8 in my recently purchased ASUS X53E notebook to overcome the bugs in Windows 7 which I could not seem to fix.&nbsp; Once&nbsp;I installed Win 8 the system seemed stable but several issues are creating problems for me.&nbsp; I cannot seem to get any
 of the ASUS Win 8&nbsp;downloads to install&nbsp;since&nbsp;Win 8 says they don't work with Win 8.&nbsp; The most important one is the Elan touch pad which is now being operated by a PS-2 driver because Win 8 removed the Elan drivers.&nbsp; I tried to install both of the drivers offered
 for the touch pad but neither would install.&nbsp; I tried deleting the PS2 driver but Win 8 will not allow it to be removed, it just puts it right back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I need to be able to have the proper driver so I can turn off the touchpad when I am using the mouse, typically CTRL F-9 but now CTRL F9 does nothing.&nbsp; When the Elan driver was installed I could turn off my touchpad and turn it on easily.</p>

            <p>Hello Mohammed,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to try to boot the system in safe mode and check if&nbsp;the issue is reproduced. If not, then clean boot the computer and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em><span>Step 1:</span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>Safe mode is a diagnostic mode in which you are logged in with only necessary minimal services and drivers enabled. Check if the issue is reproduced.</span></p>

</span></em></strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em><span>Step 2:</span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To answer your query, you can definitely cast your photos by clicking the share button on the photo viewer apps.

</p>
<p>Ok..</p>
<p>

            <p>To cast video and music files to your TV, just right click the file that you want to play in
<strong>File Explorer</strong> then select <strong>Cast to Device</strong>. Please be reminded though that this option is currently not available in Groove and Music &amp; TV apps.</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>Could you please&nbsp;confirm you really use the MS Wireless Display Adapter when you use

<h2>            Windows could not format a partition on disk 0. Error Code&#58; 0x80070057 </h2>
                    
<p>Hey guys.</p>
<p>This is a completely new computer build...here are the specs:</p>
<p>Intel Core i7-920 2.66Ghz 8M LGA1366 CPU <br />
ASUS P6T SE Intel X58 Socket LGA1366 Motherboard <br />
WD Caviar Green 1TB 64MB/SATA-3G <br />
Corsair Hydro H50 CPU Liquid Cooler <br />
Patriot Gaming 6144MB PC12800 DDR3 1600MHz (3x2GB)<br />
Samsung 22X DVDRW SATA OEM<br />
Cooler Master Silent Pro M850 Modular 850W PSU<br />
XFX Radeon HD 5870 1GB DDR5 PCIe Dual DVI, HDMI<br />
Microsoft Windows 7 Home Premium 64bit DVD OEM<br />
NZXT Zero 2 Craft Series Full-T Case</p>
<p>Sorry for the detail of the build, but I figured I give ya'll as much detail as possible. I've built one computer using these specs and Windows 7 Home Premium 64bit installed beautifully.</p>
<p>For the second computer, I'm having problems...I did the same exact thing I did with the first computer and when I'm installing Windows 7 and get to the point where its Copying Windows Files, I get an error:</p>
<p>Windows could not format a partition on disk 0. Error Code: 0x80070057</p>
<p>I deleted the partition and did it again...same error...I deleted the partition again, select New, format that partition and get the same error...</p>
<p>I replaced the SATA cords, I used different SATA port configurations...some times I can't even see the hard drive when I'm prompted to select a drive to format until I restart numerous times</p>
<p>BIOS sees the HDD just fine. I've looked all over the internet for answer, such as using FDISK from Win95 or installing an older Win OS then upgrading it to Windows 7, but I don't have those readily available.</p>
<p>Could it be the HDD that is causing the problem? Would a quick solution be to get a new HDD and see if that works? Could I try taking this "faulty" HDD and try to install Win 7 on the computer that is working?</p>

<p>Is this a WD Green "EARS" drive? If so try another hard drive that not an EARS drive and see if the problem is resolved.</p>
