            <p>So from the Asha user manual you can:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Copy contacts or pictures from your old phone </strong></em></p>
<p><em>Want to copy your content from your previous compatible Nokia phone and start using your new phone quickly? You can copy, for example, contacts, calendar entries, and pictures to your new phone, free of charge.</em><br />
<em>1 Activate Bluetooth in both phones. Select Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Connectivity &gt; Bluetooth and On.
</em></p>
<p><em>2 Select Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Sync and backup. </em></p>
<p><em>3 Select Phone switch &gt; Copy to this. </em></p>
<p><em>4 Select the content to copy and Done. </em></p>
<p><em>5 Select your previous phone from the list. </em></p>
<p><em>6 If the other phone requires a passcode, enter the passcode. The passcode, which you can define yourself, must be entered in both phones. The passcode in some phones is fixed. For details, see the user guide of the other phone. The passcode is valid
 only for the current connection. </em></p>
<p><em>7 If prompted, allow connection and copying requests.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>You could also use Nokia Suite on your PC to get your contacts on your Asha</p>

<h2>            cascading combo box help for newbie</h2>
                    <p>I am extremely new to Access and am trying to create a form that will filter data through a series of combo boxes. &nbsp;My combo boxes are called cbofiscalyear, cbostate, cbolocid, and cbograntnumber. &nbsp;All of the combo boxes are related to Qry Fiscal Grant Tracking.
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked at several posts on here but I am still unable to get any of my filters to work properly, I think I might be messing up different data types as well as what to put in the rowsource and afterupdate event? &nbsp;I'm really lost on this subject, is
 anyone able to help?</p>

            <p>Hi Sarah,</p>
<p>First, creating a filter is different from cascading combos. Here is an example of creating filters:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.allenbrowne.com/ser-62.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm guessing here that Fiscalyear, state, cid and grantnumber are separate values in the record that do not relate to each other except as attributes of a record. Cascading combos are used when you want to drill down to the value you are actually going to
 store. A prime example of cascading combos is car models. Before you there are dozens of car models across manufacturers. So you need to drill down to a list of models to choose from. First you select a manufacturer, then you select a year, then you select
 a make and finally you select the model. The only thing stored is the ModelID.&nbsp;</p>

            </span>
            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>The sql is:&nbsp;</p>
<p>SELECT [Tbl Go Memo].[Fiscal Year], [Tbl Go Memo].State, [Tbl Worksite Locations].[CITY NAME], [Tbl Go Memo].[Loc ID], [Tbl Go Memo].[Grant Number], [Tbl Go Memo].[Standard Description], [Tbl Go Memo].[Fed Total], [Tbl Fiscal Grant Tracking].[Programmed
 Date], [Tbl Fiscal Grant Tracking].[OST Release Date], [Tbl Fiscal Grant Tracking].[Edited to 610], [Tbl Fiscal Grant Tracking].[Reserved and Routed], [Tbl Fiscal Grant Tracking].[Grant Mailed], [Tbl Fiscal Grant Tracking].[Target Exec Date], [Tbl Fiscal Grant
 Tracking].[Executed Date], [Tbl Fiscal Grant Tracking].[Original Received], [Tbl Fiscal Grant Tracking].[Hierarchy Updated]<br />
FROM [Tbl Fiscal Grant Tracking] INNER JOIN ([Tbl Go Memo] INNER JOIN [Tbl Worksite Locations] ON [Tbl Go Memo].[Loc ID] = [Tbl Worksite Locations].[Loc ID]) ON [Tbl Fiscal Grant Tracking].[Grant Number] = [Tbl Go Memo].[Grant Number];<br />
</p>
<p>-Im trying to allow the user to filter based off of these combo boxes to drill down to specific grant information they want to see. &nbsp;The fiscal year would be the first step, then they would filter off the state (only want to show which states had a grant
 in that fiscal year), then would want to filter loc id (this is a code for each city within that state), then the last filter would be the grant number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully all that made sense!</p>

            <p>Again, Cascading combos are not what you want. But have you looked at Split forms? In a split form, besides the single record form view, you get a datasheet view. In the datasheet view you can use datasheet filtering to "drill down". So you could pull down
 the arrow on the Fiscalyear column and select a Fiscal Year. Then go to the state column and select a state, then to the LocID column to select the City and finally, select from the list of grant numbers. This is an effective technique for drilling down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what you describe, you want to filter by FY, State and Location, only then do want to select a grant number. If you already know the grant number, (which I'm guessing is unique) then all you would need to do is select that.</p>

            <p>I do actually have it as a split form however most users do not want to see it in the datasheet format (I actually prefer the datasheet view). &nbsp;So it sounds like I need to use multiple filters. &nbsp;How would I be able to filter my selection off of the previous
 selection? &nbsp;I was able to do the filter by fiscal year using:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Private Sub cbofiscalyear_AfterUpdate()</p>
<p>Me.Filter = "[Fiscal Year] = " &amp; Me.cbofiscalyear</p>
<p>DoCmd.RunCommand acCmdApplyFilterSort</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>-How would I then make the State combo box only give me the selections from that fiscal year (then filter farther to location id then grant number)</p>
<p>
</p><p>-There would be occasions we would only want to filter by fiscal year, state, location id, and not by grant number. &nbsp;The user might want to be able to see all the grant numbers for a particular location not just 1 grant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you guys so much for all your help on this. &nbsp;I am very new to Access and it is a HUGE learning curve!</p>

            <p>You'll find an example of the use of correlated combo boxes for drilling down through a hierarchy in ComboDemo.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
Note that if you are using an earlier version of Access you might find that the colour of some form objects such as buttons shows incorrectly and you will need to&nbsp; amend the form design accordingly. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link copy its text (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
In this little demo file the combo boxes relate to a tree-structured hierarchy, whereas in your case I'm assuming that will not be so, as I would guess there is a many-to-many relationship type between fiscal years and states.&nbsp; In essence this does not make
 a difference to the methodology, but it means the correlation between the combo boxes would not be a simple one of a restriction on a column in a single table RowSource of a States combo box by referencing the Fiscal Years combo box.&nbsp; In your case the RowSource
 query would need to include not only a States table, but also whatever table models the relationship type between States and Fiscal Years and the restriction would be on a FiscalYear or similar column in the latter.<br />
<br />
In my demo the rows returned are restricted by the use of a query which references the combo boxes as parameters.&nbsp; Each combo box allows an 'All ….' selection to be made, represented by a zero in the bound column, in addition to selecting a specific items from
 the list, so entry into the hierarchy at any level is possible.&nbsp; This is reflected in the form's query, which is:<br />
<br />
SELECT Counties.County, Districts.District, Parishes.Parish, Locations.Location, Parishes.ParishID
</p>
<p>FROM ((Counties INNER JOIN Districts ON Counties.CountyID = Districts.CountyID)
<br />
INNER JOIN Parishes ON Districts.DistrictID = Parishes.DistrictID) <br />
INNER JOIN Locations ON Parishes.ParishID = Locations.ParishID <br />
WHERE (((Counties.CountyID)=[Forms]![frmDrillDown]![cboGotoCounty])<br />
AND ((Districts.DistrictID)=[Forms]![frmDrillDown]![cboGotoDistrict]) <br />
AND ((Parishes.ParishID)=[Forms]![frmDrillDown]![cboGotoParish])) <br />
OR (((Districts.DistrictID)=[Forms]![frmDrillDown]![cboGotoDistrict]) <br />
AND ((Parishes.ParishID)=[Forms]![frmDrillDown]![cboGotoParish]) <br />
AND (([Forms]![frmDrillDown]![cboGotoCounty])=0)) <br />
OR (((Counties.CountyID)=[Forms]![frmDrillDown]![cboGotoCounty]) <br />
AND ((Parishes.ParishID)=[Forms]![frmDrillDown]![cboGotoParish]) <br />
AND (([Forms]![frmDrillDown]![cboGotoDistrict])=0)) <br />
OR (((Parishes.ParishID)=[Forms]![frmDrillDown]![cboGotoParish]) <br />
AND (([Forms]![frmDrillDown]![cboGotoCounty])=0) <br />
AND (([Forms]![frmDrillDown]![cboGotoDistrict])=0)) <br />
OR (((Counties.CountyID)=[Forms]![frmDrillDown]![cboGotoCounty]) <br />
AND ((Districts.DistrictID)=[Forms]![frmDrillDown]![cboGotoDistrict]) <br />
AND (([Forms]![frmDrillDown]![cboGotoParish])=0)) <br />
OR (((Districts.DistrictID)=[Forms]![frmDrillDown]![cboGotoDistrict]) <br />
AND (([Forms]![frmDrillDown]![cboGotoCounty])=0) <br />
AND (([Forms]![frmDrillDown]![cboGotoParish])=0)) <br />
OR (((Counties.CountyID)=[Forms]![frmDrillDown]![cboGotoCounty]) <br />
AND (([Forms]![frmDrillDown]![cboGotoDistrict])=0) <br />
AND (([Forms]![frmDrillDown]![cboGotoParish])=0)) <br />
OR ((([Forms]![frmDrillDown]![cboGotoCounty])=0) <br />
AND (([Forms]![frmDrillDown]![cboGotoDistrict])=0) <br />
AND (([Forms]![frmDrillDown]![cboGotoParish])=0)) <br />
ORDER BY Counties.County, Districts.District, Parishes.Parish;<br />
<br />
It is then simply a case of requerying the form when a selection is made in each combo box.<br />
<br />
While the underlying logic behind a query like that above is actually quite simple, it does take care to put it together.&nbsp; The parentheses are very important as these force the OR and AND operations to evaluate independently of each other.&nbsp; It's a big ask for
 somebody new to Access to attempt this and, while I cannot but admire you for trying, I do wonder whether you are quite far enough up that learning curve just yet.&nbsp; In particular, I'm not convinced from the SQL statement to posted earlier that your database
 has a correctly structured logical model in the form of a set of normalized related tables which would enable you to correlate the combo boxes.&nbsp; For instance, the fact that you have columns for Loc Id and State in a single referencing table, Tbl Go Memo, points
 to redundancy, as the former determines the latter via intervening levels in the hierarchical relationship between locations and states.&nbsp; The key feature of my demo is that it is based on a set of correctly normalized tables in which there is no redundancy
 of the sort which appears to be evident in yours.&nbsp; The elimination of redundancy through normalization is of course very important in itself, protecting the integrity of the database by the elimination of the risk of update anomalies, but it is also the basis
 for the building of a coherent interface which allows for the sort of functionality which you are attempting.<br />

            <p>Personally I dislike datasheet view as well. But I very much like Datasheet filtering (available only in datasheet view) especially when it comes to progressively filtering a dataset to drill down to a single (or small group of) records. Trying to produce
 the same effect that datasheet filtering gives you in code would require a significant amount of coding. Again, you don't have a situation of cascading combos, you are trying to drill down to a limited number of records by progressively ADDING to a filter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now if you want to apply a combination of filters by selecting a value in one or more of your combos, that's a bit easier. The link I posted earlier will help with that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my opinion its a matter of training. If you demonstrate to your users how easy it is to use Datasheet filtering and how powerful the feature is, I think you will win people over. As I said, I don't like datasheet view either. But a split form offers a
 really nice compromise to allowing the user to see the data in a form view, but use the datasheet for filtering and searching.</p>

<p>If it is occurring&nbsp; on only <strong>one</strong> website, the problem is most likely with the website and not with your system or programs or anything you are doing.&nbsp; One possibility is that the website can only accept pictures that are certain file types
 and rejects all others - then it's a matter of finding the file type(s) the web site will accept (and unless the website provides instructions, the only way is trial and error with as many different types as you can create or convert).&nbsp; Another possibility
 is that it needs you to have some form or java update - but if it doesn't identify what you need it's difficult to figure out what might help (there are quite a few options and we don't want&nbsp;to intall all of them when we aren't even sure if that will resolve
 the problem).&nbsp;If that website has some support section, go there to see if you can find any answers or perhaps some way to contact technical support (phone, chat, e-mail, whatever) to see if they can assist you or explain the limitations or upload requirements.</p>
<p>If you have this problem on more than one site (meaning several, many, or most sites), then post back with more details (including some examples of websites where you have the problem) and we'll check your system further for potential problems.</p>
<p>If you want to test, try signing up for Skydrive <a href="http://windowslive.com/Online/SkyDrive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windowslive.com/Online/SkyDrive</a>&nbsp;and see if you can upload pictures there (as it is a Microsoft product and site and tied to your Live ID (which got you into this forum), it should definitely accept pictures (but keep them reasonably sized - don't
 pick some huge file - and try the same file type that wasn't working on the other site)).&nbsp; This is a good thing to have available (I signed up as soon as I heard about it and now use it to transfer files when required - especially since this forum doesn't
 allow that feature) and will probably come in handy for you more than just in this situation.&nbsp; If it works, your system is working and the problem is with that site or those specific sites. If not, then you possibly (make that probably)&nbsp;do have some type of
 system or IE or connection problem that we need to address more thoroughly.</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Which
 version of Internet Explorer (IE) is installed on your computer?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Which
 antivirus or firewall is installed on the computer?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Which
 is the website that you are trying to upload pictures to?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You should be able to upload pictures to websites using Internet Explorer just fine unless something is preventing you from doing so. Try these
 steps to fix the issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may also try disabling the add-ons and check if you still get the same error. For more information on add-ons please visit the link given below:</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If Internet Explorer (No add-ons) help you upload pictures, follow these steps to recover the ability to use Internet Explorer.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Now all add-ons are disabled in Internet Explorer, next step is to enable them one by one.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Open

<p><span><span><span>i)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Open
 Internet Explorer</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you are able to upload pictures without any issues, the add-on you enabled wasn’t causing the problem. Repeat the Manage Add-on process for the
 next disabled add-on. Once you receive the error you were receiving, you will need to go back and disable/uninstall/update the last add-on you enabled.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;Reset Internet Explorer settings to its installation default.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;Resetting Internet Explorer's settings is not reversible. After a reset, all previous settings are lost and cannot be recovered.</span></span></p>

    <title>Word character styles that end in &#34;Char&#34; or &#34;Char - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> r. keith howard  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word character styles that end in &#34;Char&#34; or &#34;Char Char&#34; or &#34;Char Char Char&#34;, etc</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>The following helpful tip from Cindy Meister discusses these annoying character styles and how to get rid of them:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Removing "Char" styles from a document</p>
<p><a href="http://homepage.swissonline.ch/cindymeister/MyFavTip.htm#CharStyl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://homepage.swissonline.ch/cindymeister/MyFavTip.htm#CharStyl</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Sadly, I cannot get this code to work in 2013. I experience a COM exception problem when running similar code in VB.Net. I believe the article relates to a much older version of Word, so I wonder if it is still relevant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore, before spending too much time trying to fix this problem with her approach, I thought I would try the following&nbsp;different approach:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Create a "Char Char" etc style manually. Then delete it manually and see if the related paragraph style remains intact. If it does, my problem is solved, because we can easily write code to iterate through a document and delete all "Char Char" etc styles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sadly, however, I cannot figure out how to create a&nbsp;"Char Char" etc style manually. Can anyone walk me through how to do this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keith</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. Sorry for not bringing up my actual question until the very last paragraph, but I thought the background context would be helpful to the reader.</p>

            The article (by Cindy Meister) that you have already seen, at <a href="http://homepage.swissonline.ch/cindymeister/MyFavTip.htm#CharStyl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://homepage.swissonline.ch/cindymeister/MyFavTip.htm#CharStyl</a>, does explain how the "char char" styles get created.<br />
<br />
I seem to recall that the fix Microsoft released was, at least in part, about hiding the "char char" styles from view...

<h2>            Word 2013 - Footer Not Printing &#47; Page Numbering Incorrect</h2>
                    <p>I am working on&nbsp;a technical manual for my organisation.</p>
<p>This manual has many sections, with appropriate page and section breaks.</p>
<p>The footer is the same for all sections, with exception for the page numbering which is 'Section 1:1 of 2; Section 5:6 of 7'&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The footer on the final section is causing problems. It won't print with the current set-up that I want. If I double-click into it to edit, and select 'Link to previous', it prints, but the page numbering is 'Section 12: 1 of 1, Section 12: 2 of 2 etc'.
 I need it the page numbering to be consecutive.</p>

<p>
</p><p>It is unusual that installing Outlook in your phone would drain the battery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the issue is device specific, I suggest you to contact the device manufacturer for assistance, they will be better suited to guide you with this.</p>

            <p>Hello Diane</p>
<p>If the questionaire was a attached file (Word doc, etc) that you saved to you computer, once you open and edit (add your answers), save the file (give it a new name if needed). Go back into your email program, reply to the email that had the questionaire,
 attach the file that you filled out and saved and then send the email.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you did not save the file, but just opened from email, it would be saved in a temporary location, if you saved the file by just clicking save. Might be located here: /Users/<i>YourUsername</i>/Documents/Microsoft User Data/Saved Attachments, but I am
 not 100% sure.</p>
<p>I found this article: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/268323" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Storage locations for Entourage user data</a>&nbsp;but it doesn't really discuss where the file is stored when opening from the email.
</p>
<p>It is best to always save the attachement to your computer before doing any editing to that file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>
<p>Thanks...</p>

                    <p>I want to save an email with full information (to/from/date/subject + text) as a PDF in OneDrive. I cannot work out how to print/save to PDF from the Outlook App on my ipad. Any ideas? It is only the email I am after, not attachments.</p>

<h3> paulsoldera  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office Applications constantly &#39;flashing&#39; on screen</h2>
                    
<p>I have an issue where all open Office 2016 applications are 'flashing' every 8-10 seconds when using them. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I've searched other forums and have isolated the problem to the default printer settings. &nbsp;I have a wifi printer on my network and when I change the default printer for every open Office 2016 application to 'print to pdf' the flashing stops.</p>
<p>There is not a current update for my printer driver (I am on the latest). &nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you think this is something that is caused by the printer driver, or the way Office 2016 handles wifi printers on the network? &nbsp;Are there any steps I can take to solve the issue other than changing the default printer?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Switched to IE10 Now can&#39;t upload or attach documents to Volunteer2</h2>
                    <p>I downloaded IE10 for the spellcheck feature but now I can't upload to our volunteer management program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I get the error message: "Upload failed. The file was rejected by the server. Possible reasons include the file was too large or of the wrong type."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The file was definitely not too big and it was a jpg. (Accepted format)&nbsp;All documents/images get the same error.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clearing cache</li><li>Disabling add-ons</li><li>Re-setting IE</li><li>Clearing SSL</li></ul>
<p>I <em>can</em> reply to comments on forums (Haven't tried attachments) and&nbsp;can send&nbsp;attachments in Hotmail.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Returning to an older version of IE or Chrome eliminates the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help with this would be most appreciated as I need the spell-check feature AND&nbsp;the ability&nbsp;to uploads docs and images but I really don't want to switch to Chrome.</p>

<h2>            Sparkline data range</h2>
                    I was tinkering with sparklines yesterday and discovered a downside to the whole thing.&nbsp; It seems that if you don't have a congruent dataset (A2:A10) but instead an incongruent dataset (A2,A4,A6,A8,A10) it doesn't like you anymore.&nbsp; Mind you I have the
 Beta version of Office 2010.&nbsp; Was this fixed in the released version or was this by design or is it just lame that way?

            I think it's just made that way.<br />
If you could hide the cells that you don't want included (A3, A5 etc) then you could base the sparkline on A2:A10 and use the option not to show data in hidden rows.&nbsp; Otherwise I guess you need to make a range containing cells linked to the alternate cells
 in your original range and build the sparkline from the new range which could be on a hidden sheet.

    <title>Nokia Data Dongle CS-10 x64 Driver - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikexx---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia Data Dongle CS-10 x64 Driver</h2>
                    
<p>I have Windows 7, 64 bit and the driver accompanying the CS-10 doesn't support Windows x64.&nbsp; Some contributors to a topic some time ago said that the x64 driver for the CS-15 also worked for the CS-10.&nbsp; However I can't see any support drivers on the Nokia
 site for either of these two units.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone help with sourcing these Windows x64 drivers?</p>

<p>Can someone suggest how long I should wait before escalating this problem?</p>

<p>I got this reply!.................................<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you for contacting Nokia Careline.<br />
<br />
You have stated in your email that you are unable to see any support drivers on Nokia websites for your Nokia Internet Stick CS-10. Kindly be informed that Nokia has already discontinued manufacturing of this accessory. In connection to this, the compatible
 drivers for the Nokia Internet Stick CS-10 are no longer available in Nokia websites.<br />
<br />
In order for us to help you on this matter, we recommend visiting the point of purchase of your internet stick and ask for its compatible drivers for Windows 7 64 bit. We also suggest searching and downloading its drivers from third-party websites.<br />
<br />
We seek for your kind consideration on this matter.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your continuous support on Nokia products and services. Should you need further assistance, please feel free to contact us again.<br />
<br />
For updates and more information about Nokia, please feel free to check our website. Kindly refer to the link below:<br />

<p>.................................................................................................................</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1&nbsp; So in short, I am told to go to my point of sale regarding drivers.&nbsp; In this case they cannot help and do not have access to any drivers that Nokia might have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2&nbsp; I am told to go to 3rd party websites.&nbsp; I have tried in earnest to find these drivers and have failed so far.&nbsp; I note that supoort didn't even hint at websites where these might be hidden.&nbsp; I find it quite offensive I should try dubious sites with agendas
 of enticing me to download trojans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3&nbsp; I have checked the website in question which I have already said is devoid of any support or drivers for the CS-10.</p>

<p>I now get 2 emails, one saying that the drivers are shipped with the Windows 7 operating system, and another saying that the drivers will install with autorun enabled.&nbsp; I can't believe the answers:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1&nbsp; Windows 7 64 bit does not ship with CS-10 64 bit drivers!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2&nbsp; The setup files and drivers on the flash area of the dongle are most certainly 32 bit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia are going&nbsp;downhill &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>

<p>You're not alone! I'm not looking for a driver to a 64-bit system (for now), but have been wanting to find at least &nbsp;driver update. On the old computer internet has disconnected itself after 5 minutes of work (2 years I have not used this modem) on a new
 PC occasionally stops all traffic that really irritates me :)......I was disappointed in the product from Nokia and more in its support. The modem should be discarded and not buy anything else from Nokia.... Funny, but saw a lot in sales and also for the exorbitant
 prices, we must somehow inform future unfortunate owners that they face....</p>

<p>I'm actually quite shocked at Nokia's response.&nbsp; This issue has been going on for more than 3 weeks and I'm no further to a solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have had Tier 3 replies which I had hoped would be of a higher standard than a poor Indian call centre.&nbsp; I don't know the significance with a Tier 3 reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been told to go to third part wbsites without being told which ones I should use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm then given a link to a file purporting to be a 64 bit driver, but was really a spam-like page for PC generic driver updating software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After giving full details of the dongle, ie serial and IMEI number I'm now being offered the opportunity of visiting a Nokia Care centre to have the dongle re-Flashed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm now asking for an assurance if these files are any different to the 32 bit files already Flashed onto the dongle, and why they can't just send the files to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each email I get from Nokia invites me to look on the Nokia website for support, which for the CS-10 is non-existant.&nbsp; A representative even had the gall to say it was no longer supported on the website because it was obsolete.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I used to have confidence in Nokia, and historically all my phones for the past 15 years have been Nokia.&nbsp; When my current phone contract ends or needs replacement I feel obliged to look at the market again, where I typically base my purchases on support.</p>

<p>I was given a set of files with a set of python scripts, a few exe files but no obvious 64 bit drivers.&nbsp; An ISO file was corrupted but even it's directory didn't suggest the existance of any 64 bit drivers.&nbsp; It appears that Icera actually made the dongle
 or at least wrote the software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have since sent 2 emails, which get the normal cursory acknowledgement but no replies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions, apart from steer clear of Nokia products?</p>

<p>Another week has gone and apparently the "higher level department" can't say how long they can provide any feedback, and therefore no chance of a solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia is becoming to suck.&nbsp; I have always bought Nokia phones in the pas, and Nokia devices when it comes to mobile connection, but never, ever again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There seems no will whatsoever to actually provide support of any kind, apart from being fobbed off at every email to customer service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't want much, just a driver, is that too much to ask?</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>yes, same behaviour on Chrome and Firefox (Edge and IE is not an option for my organization), two different computers,</p>
<p>I do not know if anyone else is affected, we've just started rolling out Yammer as a corporate social network; I have heard from no one else yet,</p>
<p>if you mean outside my organizations Ethernet/Wi fi, then yes, I get this also at home; if you mean outside my organizations Yammer-network, then yes, this simply happens when I go to yammer.com.</p>
<p>I can access Yammer without problems if</p>
<p>1) going to yammer.com (or yammer.com/myorganization) from a "fresh" browser,</p>
<p>2) if clicking on the Yammer logo in the Office 365 toolbar that goes directy to my organizations network (SSO enabled),</p>
<p>3) without problems through Yammer embed in Sharepoint team site,</p>
<p>4) and when I tried right now, I could access Yammer in a way corresponding to option "b" in my first post - that is, I had no problem this time.</p>

            <p>Hi, I had the same issue try this only if your current office build is 7870.2020 and higher.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open a command (CMD as Admin) prompt and run the following commands in order: </p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em> cd %programfiles%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\ClickToRun</em></li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;officec2rclient.exe /update user updateversion=16.0.7571.2109</em></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Then open Outlook and click on File, Office account and set Update Options to Disable Updates</p>
<p>
</p><p>Add an appointment on your calendar for a month or more out to remind you to re-enable updates ( on that time a new build should work )
</p>

    <title>Having issues running HBO GO on my new computer - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Having issues running HBO GO on my new computer</h2>
                    I am not extremely tech-savvy, but I recently bought my first laptop and have been trying to learn to deal with the whole Windows 8 - not a huge fan. &nbsp;I cannot seem to load HBO GO - it used to say my browser or flash player needed to be updated, but now
 I have updated both and sometimes HBO Go will work perfectly, other times the website remains completely blank.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have seen other posts where people say it was an IE issue but was hoping it would be fixed on 8.1 - which I have. &nbsp;Do I need to download another browser to watch HBO GO?</div>
                </div>

    <title>Updating to Belle - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kasmax  say:</h3>
<h2>            Updating to Belle</h2>
                    
<p>Hi Guys</p>
<p>I need some advice please. i have&nbsp; five nokia e7 phones. three of them have symbian belle, and i left two of them with symbian anna. just to let you know that the reason i left two with anna is that i like some features of anna which are no longer in belle.
 but i know that belle has many new features that anna doesnt have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i have recently noticed that sometimes nokia suite doesnt find updates.</p>
<p>so my question is that until how long we are able to update from anna to belle with nokia suite. the advice im seeking is that if i know that from tomorrow if no longer able to update to belle ie. nokia stops this support then i may update tonight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>so what the expert guys here say, can i keep my two phones with anna for now and i will be able to update later say after few months? or i should updatenow as it may stop soon?</p>
<p>so really what is the best decission.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<p>I did not notice very significant difference. however i have noticed that sometimes the belle is slow in response eg when scrolling the menu or when scrolling a webpage, and also sometimes delay of response when tap on a app or menu. as i said not all the
 times but ocassionally. and when i use the anna it does not do the things mentioned above.</p>

<p>Try to check if the phone memory still has enough free space. You may check it by going to Menu&gt; Office&gt; Files. It is advisable to maintain at least 50mb of free space for optimal usage. Otherwise, you may use the Nokia Software Recovery Tool to have a clean
 slate.</p>

<h2>            Office 2013 Working fine Except for Word and OneNote</h2>
                    I have been having this problem no matter how many times I repair or re-install office. Every office app works perfectly except Word and OneNote. Word will only open in safe mode, but all the add-ins are off. Any other time it just says "not responding".
 OneNote wont open at all no matter what I do. When the preview first came out I had no problems with any of it, but the problem first arose when I updated the preview. Now Im running a final version from my school and the same problem pops up. I dont know
 what else to do besides refresh my PC.&nbsp;

            If Word only works in Safe mode, then apparently there is an addon that you are not aware of.&nbsp; Here are some trouble shooting techniques that may help you identify the specific problem.<br />
<br />
<b>Trouble Shoot Word problems that occur when you start or use Word 2010, 2007, 2003, or 2002
</b>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/921541" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/921541</span></a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></span><span><span>2003-2010<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=820919" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=820919</a><span><span> -2002-2003
<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><b>NOTE:
</b>part of this procedure is disabling addins. If you want to take a shortcut, check to see if you have a BlueTooth device driver or addin, ie “send to Bluetooth”, installed. Disabling BlueTooth is rapidly moving to the top of my Office trouble shooting process.
 Blue Tooth drivers have been identified as the cause of problems with many different “random” symptoms. If you have BlueTooth, disable it in control panel, device manager and possibly as an addin in Office apps.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It’s not that I think there is anything inherently bad with Blue Tooth. The problem is with the people writing the drivers.<br />
<br />
</p>
<b>Don’t Assume ANYTHING!</b>
<p>Don’t assume some part of the trouble shooting processes listed below doesn’t apply to you. Often there are things going on in the background that you just aren’t aware of. For example, when installing software it is all too easy to have
 an unwanted app installed if you don’t carefully read every screen. <br />

<b>Uninstall Recent Software</b>
<p>At this point, you have also think about any software or plugins that you may have installed on your computer. Annoyingly, this problem with Word can be caused by a program that is completely unrelated to Word!</p>
<p>Did you recently install some new hardware? A printer, scanner, label machine, web cam, tablet, etc? Have you installed any software? If so, uninstall it and see if the problem goes away.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The following Skype links are an example of this issue<br />

<p>Starting in March 2012, "Skype click to Call" has been causing problems File Open problems, and Copy/Paste problems in Office Apps.
</p>
<p>The quick test for this problem is to close all open browsers. If the problem goes away it is probably Skype.</p>
<p>March 30 – MS has released an update to Skype that fixes the problem. Go to the Skype site, download and install the newest version ofc the program.<br />

<p>For anyone reading this, I figured out the problem after surfing the web for the past 3-4 weeks. Painful process. I have a paid version of Advanced SystemCare Pro, v5.2.0. 3-4 weeks ago, while scanning through it's vast offerings, I came
 across a feature I could activate called "Smart RAM". I turned it on and checked the 5 boxes it offers in the settings. The last of those 5 is "Clean Clipboard". I unchecked this box a few minutes ago and it fixed my issues. I now have no problems with copy/paste.
 Info only, it case it helps anyone.</p>

<p>&lt;snip&gt;<span>&nbsp; </span>Hi, I recently came across this problem in MS Word 2007 where after I type or hit any key on my keyboard while in the Word window, I can no longer highlight text with my mouse (by clicking once at the beginning
 of the text and dragging the mouse to the end of the text portion that I want to highlight). I have found that if I click out of the Word window and press any key on the keyboard, this seems to resolve the problem and I can finally highlight with my mouse.
 However, as soon as I type anything in the Word window again, highlighting with the mouse no longer works. Clicking on any key again within the Word window does not resolve the issue- I have to push a key outside the Word window in order to resolve the problem.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>&lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt; Hi, I just figured out the problem. I had installed the Synergy program 1.5 weeks ago and by uninstalling it the problem appears to be resolved. Thank you both for your time and help. &nbsp;&lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt; I had the same problem, i ran windword in safe mode successfully and disabled ABBYY FineReader 9.0 and the problem was solved as well, all is fine now and office is awesome!!&lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt; <span>
I ran my old Word 2010 and removed the ABBYY add-in. I didn't have to disable the whole program. I also did the "Quick Repair" and the "Online Repair" of Office 2013 Preview, but I'm pretty sure it was the add-in removal that made the difference.
</span>&lt;/snip</p>

<p>Alright, well, I found the answer to this final issue: I only needed to disable the Bluetooth add-in on Options. I have no idea why that would have been the problem, but I found it as a suggested fix

here</a>. Now every single thing opens quickly and without error. </p>
<p>Thanks for all your help everyone.</p>
<p>As a recap:</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>My Office 2010 was a Click-to-Run version</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Word suddenly giving me messages about "Downloading the Required Feature," freezing up, slowing down...</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Ultimately had to uninstall Office</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Reinstalled it from the Microsoft website with my product key, choosing the 64-bit version instead of the Click-to-Run version</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Installed all new updates from Windows Updates</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Restarted computer</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Word working quickly with no messages, but became unresponsive when trying to open old files</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Went to File-&gt;Options-&gt;Add-Ins-&gt;Go-&gt; and unchecked Bluetooth.</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Everything seems to be back to normal, if not better than before.</p>

<p>
My problem is if I copy text from a web site or from Excel, Access etc into Word all I get is a black spot.</p>
<p>
I have tried a repair install and checking all the settings against my laptop - where this function works properly.
</p>
<p>The problem is caused by a defective Bluetooth add-in for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, turn off the Com Addin.</p>
<p><b><span>Additional Notes:</span></b></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>The defective Bluetooth add-in is usually installed by a Bluetooth driver. (In my case - Intel Centrino Wireless Bluetooth 3.0 + High Speed Adaptor (v1.1))</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Updating your Bluetooth driver (or reverting to an older version) may also resolve the problem.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Unfortunately simply disabling the add-in through the Word options may result in a 3 second freeze when loading Word 2007. (If this is a problem, changing to a different bluetooth driver version may be the better option)</span></p>
<p><b><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></b><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>Oddly enough, this ended up being the cause of my problem. I had an older print driver installed on my Win7 machine and once I removed that driver, Word started working without any problems!</p>
<p>You can delete individual printer drivers by going into the registry. Note that simply going to Printers and Faxes and deleting a printer there does not delete the printer driver.</p>
<p>Follow <strong><span>Step 3</span></strong> in my previous post about a printer error to remove the printer drivers:</p>

<span>Here is a truely Off-the-wall solution that is in the same class as bad RAM and bad Video Cards</span></p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt; My problem turned out to be related to the WYSE thin clients we were using to connect to the Win 2008 R2 Terminal servers.&nbsp; The software that allows/enhances use of dual screens called WYSE TXC Multi-Display v1.2.1.7 was causing
 the applications to crash (including IE 9 32bit).&nbsp; Once this software was disabled - The errors stopped.</p>
<p>I have a feeling this software doesn't like Windows Server 2008 R2.&nbsp; It was being used successfully on Server 2003.&nbsp; I have seen a&nbsp; few other posts on Google for people searching for an updated version without success. &lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<b>Starting point when Word does something unexpected</b>
<p>As a general rule, when something seems to be going wrong, or at least not the way you want it to go, in Word, any version, go to Tools and then Options and study all the settings on all the tabs. You may even find some settings that
 you want to try that have nothing to do with the current problem.</p>
<p>When I was teaching Word and other Microsoft Office programs at a private business college, I had three rules:</p>
<p><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Always check Tools Options</p>
<p><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>When in doubt, right-click on something</p>
<p><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>If you're wondering how to set up a special kind of material in a document, consider whether Word tables are suitable. The placement officer of the school came to me several times and asked how I thought she should set something up. Each time
 the answer was, "I'd use a Word table." By the fifth time she had stopped asking--she got the point.</p>

Note doing a simple uninstall of office often does not help because it leaves "bits and pieces" of configuration information behind. Using method 2 in the following tip does a better job of uninstalling everything<br />
