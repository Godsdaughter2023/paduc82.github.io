    <title>This is one of the worst purchasing experiences ever&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            This is one of the worst purchasing experiences ever&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I am running a 2 person consulting firm, &nbsp;with my partner, Ken.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the last 12 months or so we have got by using Godaddy http mail, my Apple Mail client and Kens Outlook. We use a pool of 4 subcontractors. We give them email addresses with a limited amount of storage and tell them to configure their mail clients to
 download everything from the server so they dont run out of space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are at a point where Ken and I need to better coordinate sales, marketing and client communications. I have been conducting trials of various CRM systems, Salesforce, PipeDrive and on Dec5, Dynamics 365. When I signed up for a trial of Dynamics 365 it
 did ask me to create a TXT record in the DNS of my domain. I did NOT do this as at the time my sole interest was in reviewing the functionality of Dynamics and not in integrating it with our website or email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We decided Dynamics was not for us at this stage, but we wanted to continue to transition to Sharepoint/Exchange/Skype with the Office 365 Business Premium</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to start this process by purchasing a subscription for Office 365 Business Premium. I got to step 3 where it asks to create a new business identity. I entered my domain name and the message that came back was ""Sorry, exampledomain.com is already
 a part of an Office 365 organization. Enter a different domain.""</p>
<p>
</p><p>Realizing the dynamics trial subscription might be part of the problem I eventually after multiple false trails found out how to buy office from within my dynamics trial account (remember we do NOT want to buy dynamics...) I initiated the purchase and got
 this message "" </p>
<div>You already have a subscription through work </div>
<div>Your organization manages your use of *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. If you want to sign up for Office 365 Business Premium, sign out of your work account and create a new account that you manage on your own.
<p>""</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I called support who could not help me but said they could transfer me to someone who could. after waiting on the phone for a long period of time, the line just hung up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I called again, went through the same process with a different person - re-explaining my problem and again, after hanging on for a long time the line just hung up.<br />
<br />
All I want to do is regain control of my domain within the microsoft ecosystem and purchase a subscription for office 365 business premium. How does one do that? can I speak to a KNOWLEDGEABLE human in a REASONABLE time frame?</p>

<h2>            Multiple version of same file</h2>
                    <p>I use onedrive for business within my team to save all sort of work files. sometime when the team updates the file with new information, the file saves as another version and does not overwrite the existing file. this creates an issue as we have to delete
 the duplicate file manually to make sure that we have only 1 version of the file at any given point. this does not happen all the time but it does seem to happen quite often. below is a screenshot of the issue.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>N97 critiques - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> greengreen---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            N97 critiques</h2>
                    
<p>Hi again,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ok, this is my second post regarding N97. The reviews of N97 are actually rather negative, especially when compared to pre or iPhone 3S, but I wonder if this is apple fanboism or are there serious issues with the phone. The so much criticised left hand side
 space on the keyboard I think is underserved, because if you type with your thumbs, the space should be close to a thumb so it is dumb to have exactly the same layout as a normal keyboard where you type with full hands). Nevertheless, before buying the phone,
 I'd like to hear owners' opinion about other issues (non-owners please refrain):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) The touchscreen sensitivity. Is the resistive rather capactiive touchscreen really that much worse?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>b) The speed and response time of phone slow, is phone sluggish?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>c) UI clunky, i.e. no multitouch, counterintutiive? (In computers I am very opinionated about this, I rather have a system that I need to learn how to use, if I can use it efficiently afterwards. That's why I use xmonad and hate aqua. But it can also be
 hard to use and useless.).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>d) top row of keyboard to close to the edge</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>e) screen angle. Actually, I don't get this. I would have though that if you type on keyboard while holding the phone in your hands the ideal position of the screen should be parallel to keyboard, aka g1. The tilted screen would be useful only if you put
 the phone on the table, but you don't actually ever do this. So, do you actually ever find yourself thinking that the screen angle is not ideal?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks so much for your time!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A) I'm finding the screens sensitivity to be perfect so far.&nbsp; I've never had to tell it twice to do the same thing.&nbsp; Both screen technologies have their advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>B) Not at all sluggish, it is very fast which is impressive for early firmware.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>C) Not found it to be at all clunky and everything is where I expect it to be, but I am an experienced symbian user. The menus and homescreen contents can be customised to your tastes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>D) Thats a hard one to say as it all depends on how you use it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>E) For me the angle is ideal whether in the hand or on a table but it depends on how you use it.</p>

<p>a) The touchscreen sensitivity. Is the resistive rather capactiive touchscreen really that much worse?</p>
<p>Not at all, once you get used to it, it is not that much worse...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>b) The speed and response time of phone slow, is phone sluggish?</p>
<p>Normally no, however during typing with or without T9 on and any other typing language other than English chosen it gets sluggish, and very much so. But if you select English the problem goes away...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>c) UI clunky, i.e. no multitouch, counterintutiive? (In computers I am very opinionated about this, I rather have a system that I need to learn how to use, if I can use it efficiently afterwards. That's why I use xmonad and hate aqua. But it can also be

<p>Actually it lets you find out new things every day...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>d) top row of keyboard to close to the edge</p>
<p>No I do not think so...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>e) screen angle. Actually, I don't get this. I would have though that if you type on keyboard while holding the phone in your hands the ideal position of the screen should be parallel to keyboard, aka g1. The tilted screen would be useful only if you put
 the phone on the table, but you don't actually ever do this. So, do you actually ever find yourself thinking that the screen angle is not ideal?</p>
<p>No I think that is ideal too, because during typing you do kind of need that angle IMO...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a lot of problems I am reading about N97 and people talking about returning the phone for a full refund and Nokia should be ashamed and so on and so on, but I am just surprised. Maybe I am just lucky, maybe their expectations are so high, I do
 not know. Being owners of different more than 30 until now, the latest 10 being smartphones I think this phone is really nice. However, I can only say apart from the touch screen I believe N95 8GB was the best phone up until now and N97 did not raise the bar
 too high like N958GB did whe it came out. By the way N97 does not have 3D accelarator which is a bad thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers...</p>

<p>My opinions based on experience with my N97:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A:&nbsp; Touchscreen works fine.&nbsp; I don't miss the capacitive screen from when I had an iPhone at all.&nbsp; Each has its own advantages and disadvantages but multitouch is certainly not the be-all and end-all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>B:&nbsp; Phone responsiveness is fine.&nbsp; No problems here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>C:&nbsp; Interface works the same as the other S60s.&nbsp; Once you've used it you'll soon become accustomed to it.&nbsp; It's easy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;D:&nbsp; No problems with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>E: The angle is perfect for my use.&nbsp; I did find your comment odd though.&nbsp; If you don't yet own the N97 how would you know you would never use it on a table?&nbsp; I often use it sat on a table and the angle of the screen makes it viewable.&nbsp; The N900 doesn't have
 the angled screen, but it does have a flip-out stand on the rear that enables you to have a tilt if you want the handset to stand alone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have doubts, go and try one at a local dealer.&nbsp; If you think it's for you then you can get one.&nbsp; If you still have doubt, wait until something else comes out.</p>

    <title>Remote SIM mode 16 digits Opel Insigna - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Remote SIM mode 16 digits Opel Insigna</h2>
                    
<p>Hello everybody,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have E65 and I try make it fully functional with my car Opel/Vauxhall Insignia with integrated phone car kit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Communication is fine, but phone book is not synchronized.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know I have to have Remote SIM mode set to "on", so I do it this way. There is written in the mobile help that Remote SIM mode is functional only with 16 digits length blueetooth passcode, but my car device can provide only 4 digits for bluetooth pairing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this reason of the problem ? Or there is another "thing" I dont know about it ? Can I change my firmware to "not check full 16 digits of bluetooth passcode for Remote SIM mode" ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried another types of mobile, that is possible for me to change to it (E51, E66, E71, Samsung Omnia). The only type that can transfer phone book into the car device was Nokia E71.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Thanx
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The question you asked is an FAQ</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The phone book syncs do not work correctly on SIM Access devices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To resolve your phone book problem, the answer can be found here:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#0034ff">/discussions/board/message?board.id=topfaq&amp;thread.id=97</font></p>
<p><font color="#0034ff">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p>As for Remote SIM Paring, this normally has to be initiated from the Car itself, you normally have to search for handsets with the car, and then when its found provided you have the SIM Access switched on the car will offer a 16 digit passcode for you to
 pair your handset to the car.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The car will then progress the connection and "Activating Remote SIM Mode" will appear on the handsets display, after a few moments the signal on the handset will disappear and be replaced with the words "Remote SIM" and the functions are swapped to the
 car. If your SIM has a PIN then you will need to enter it into the cars MMI system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remote SIM only works with a 16 Digit code. If you enter 4 digits then it would appear that Hands free mode is being used not Remote SIM.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two are different systems, remote SIM allows the car to handle the cellular connection not the handset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>First of all, thanks for responding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I cannot connect my Nokia E65 to my Opel Vectra UHC unit with phonebook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Steps I have done:</p>
<p>1) disconnect all connections (in UHC and E65)</p>
<p>2) input 16 digits code in the UHC==&gt; This a problem, because the UHC is limitit to 15 digits!!</p>
<p>3) install "download contacts on my E65 and run it (he shows the screen "process" and that isnot gone)</p>
<p>4) set the E65 in the bluetooth menu to external sim</p>
<p>5) search from UHC to devices, he found my Nokia E65&nbsp;</p>
<p>6) after input the same 15 digits(!!) code there is connection</p>
<p>7) but no phonebook :-(</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help...</p>

<p>Depending on the number of contacts it will take several minutes and <strong>upto an hour</strong> to copy them into the car.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally you <strong>MUST</strong> have the software running before you pair the handset to the car, if you don't it wont work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So to recap:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Delete Pairing from the Car and the Phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Install the 810 or 616 downloader.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Start the 810 or 616 downloader.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pair the phone to the car, searching from the&nbsp;car side for the handset</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enter the code that the car gives you into the handset when it requests to pair</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>WAIT</strong>&nbsp;up to an hour&nbsp;to check the contacts. If after this time it doesn't have the contacts then&nbsp;there is an incompatibility in either the phone or the car.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This morning I have a loan Audi A4 2010 model year and I did this, this morning with my E71 and the contacts are all in place.</p>

<h3> dougbonnett  say:</h3>
<h2>            Calender wont synch with Outlook android app and Outlook 2016</h2>
                    <p>So I have a multitude of devices, (desktop, laptop, surface pro3, and a couple android phones). I have just upgraded everything to windows 10, and office 2016.&nbsp; I have one Microsoft account and have it setup on all my devices.&nbsp; Downloaded the mobile android
 version of outlook on my phone.</p>
<p>I have managed to set the email side of things without a problem, I'm happy there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But now I am trying to create one calandar that syncs with all my stuff.&nbsp; I am running the full office version on my laptop and Surface pro and want to be able to open outlook 2016, add an event to my calendar and have it update my outlook.com calendar,
 or the other way around - update something on my phone (which updates outlook.com calendar) and have that sync to the rest of my devices when connected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen posts of various work arounds and things like that but I would hope that Microsoft figured this out with Windows 10 / office 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anybody got this to work?</p>

<h3> pizzaboy192  say:</h3>
<h2>            9926&#58; Micrphone visible, does not pick up audio&#59; Worked on clean install until reboot.</h2>
                    <p>Running build 9926 upgraded from last build, upgraded from 8.1, using HP Probook 6475b.</p>
<p>Previous build microphone was working properly. After upgrade microphone has failed working. It appears in the list of recording devices, but does not show any activity when testing the microphone by tapping on the microphone directly or speaking directly
 to it.</p>
<p>I did a full clean install yesterday to test the fix of switching UEFI from Native to Legacy to fix the AMD chipset issue, and that install was working properly upon reboot with full microphone working and no issues, even Hey Cortana was working as expected.
 I swapped my disks out and upgraded my main install, and the microphone issue appeared. Upon switching disks back to the test hard disk, the microphone on the test disk was acting the same as my primary, displaying as "there" but not picking up any sound.</p>
<p>I've tried the following:</p>
<p>Uninstall hardware from device manager, </p>
<p>Installing OEM drivers from HP (IDT Audio)<br />
Uninstalling and reinstalling,</p>
<p>Running the troubleshooter</p>
<p>Editing the registry while it is offline to delete all references to the microphone in HKLM/SOFTWARE/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/MMDevices/Audio/Capture,
</p>
<p>Deleting the whole /Capture key from the registry,</p>
<p>Doing a new clean install (Works for the first boot, fails after a reboot with Hey Cortana enabled)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure what's going on. Any suggestions? I'm not super in need of a working microphone right now, but it'd be nice eventually to have it work again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit (17:41CST): Paired a Bluetooth headset to my laptop. Microphone there works. Seems to be only internal microphone that is failing. At least I have a workaround until this gets fixed. Assuming it's related to the UEFI issues from earlier.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>While doing reboots, I suspected something might be wrong with my UEFI settings on my laptop and discovered that this latest build causes corruption in the UEFI settings. Some of this corruption ends up with issues in AMD based display drivers, and it looks
 like a bit of the settings corruption toggled the microphone off at some point. Enabling the microphone in UEFI and booting into my test build made the microphone work (Initially it was not working on a fresh install.) but it somehow toggled off the wifi in
 the UEFI settings upon reboot. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon booting into my normal install (Swapping disks in the laptop) I was able to get the microphone by "Disabling" (It was marked as enabled in the UEFI, but not working), booting into Windows, and then re-enabling the microphone in UEFI on a second reboot.
 I'll keep my eyes on the settings for the next week to see what else breaks. A little concerning that it's editing UEFI settings randomly.</p>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Yes, it it is. In fact, it quite much the norm.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The reason for this of course is that if you take an existing application with years of code (which in most cases is likely to be DAO), then if you migrate the tables to&nbsp;SQL server you can well keep&nbsp;all of your forms, reports and
 existing code. In fact, the vast majority of the code and forms and reports will not have to be rewritten when you do this. Thus, it makes&nbsp;little sense to rewrite lots of code&nbsp;that is running fine, and you've already paid to create and maintain that code over
 many years.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>So in access land, in addition to the above the issue of taking existing applications&nbsp;and being able to continue to use that DAO code when you link the tables to SQL server,&nbsp;most access developers by nature are more familiar with
 DAO code. And,&nbsp;likely the vast majority of the library code one has will also be DAO.</div>

<div>If you are familiar with ADO, or&nbsp;are you starting a project&nbsp;from scratch, and you plan to use SQL server, then I think ado is a great choice.&nbsp; However if you're going to build an application that's
 going to run split with an jet back end, then perhaps down the road&nbsp;move that backend data to SQL server, then it's a bit more of a tossup as to which is a better choice.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>About&nbsp;half of my applications I write in access are designed using DAO and in fact run with an&nbsp;SQL server back end.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>From a&nbsp;performance scalability point of view, using DAO or ADO not really going to give you any significant gains in performance. It's really going to come down to other issues such as do you have existing DAO code. While ADO is
 much being superseded by ADO.NET, we see that the DAO and JET (now called ACE data engine) is receiving new features. (such as off line tables from SharePoint).</div>

<h2>            Snipping Tool</h2>
                    Snip will not send to alternate email. I really enjoy Snipping Tool. I have two email profiles. When I open Snip cut my screen picture go file, send to, email recipient. Outlook opens with the From default outgoing address and the snip in the body of email.
 That is sent and received perfectly. If I do the same process but change the From Outgoing address to my other Outgoing address the snip remains in the body of the email, but does not show on the receiving end nor in my sent folder, properly, it is blank ,no
 picture. I have tried changing my default sending email account, but that does not change the issue. If I go file, send to Email Recipient (as attachment) No problems either way. I'm Running Office 2016, Windows 8.1 Fully updated to date.

            Now this is different. If I change to Alternate Email account, then go to Format text, change to Rich text, then back to HTML, send. It works perfect and all good. Whats going on here?? This never used to happen, when I was on previous version of Office.
 Are you able to replicate this issue?

<h2>            Function to calculate increase&#47;decrease of a number in relation to other</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I need to calculate increase/decrease of a number in relation to other I use a manual formula in Excel: (a/b-1)*100.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>For instance: how much was the decrease in sales considering last month 12 and this month 10?</div>
<div>The "basic" formula: =(10/12-1)*100 = -16.6%</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there any function or automatic way to make this calculate in Excel?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance,</div>
<div>Cadu</div>
<div><br />

            <p>You could create your own User Defined Function (<strong>UDF</strong>) to perform the calculation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
User Defined Functions (UDFs) are very easy to install and use:</p>
<p>1. ALT-F11&nbsp; brings up the VBE window<br />
2. ALT-I<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ALT-M opens a fresh module<br />
3. paste the stuff in and close the VBE window</p>
<p>If you save the workbook, the UDF will be saved with it.</p>
<p>To remove the UDF:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. bring up the VBE window as above<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. clear the code out<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. close the VBE window</p>
<p>To use the UDF from Excel:</p>
<p>=myfunction(A1)</p>
<p>To learn more about macros in general, see:</p>

<br />
If you want a percentage result, the better way to do that is with the following "basic" formula:<br />
<br />
=10/12 - 1<br />
<br />
formatted as Percentage with 1 decimal place.<br />
<br />
If you multiply by 100, you no longer have percentage per se (i.e. -0.166...), but the number -16.6... which you are interpreting as a percentage.<br />

&nbsp;the web is ABSOLUTELY FULL of hits on this problem and there does not seem to be a good solution.&nbsp; I have copied the disk to my HD and tried install from there, same result.&nbsp; I have followed many of the 'fixes' that others have posted.&nbsp; nothing works.<br />
<br />
does anyone out there know how to resolve this issue?<br />
thank you<br />

<h2>            Bottom of Words Not Printing</h2>
                    <p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/967bca9f-0d6f-4d27-bb65-8d76fc8a8b11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/967bca9f-0d6f-4d27-bb65-8d76fc8a8b11" /></a></p>
<p>In this photo (sorry it's sideways) the whole part of the word shows on the screen in Word but the bottom part of some words is cut off when I printed. I have several fonts with this issue. It happens regardless of the printer I use. It also happens when
 I convert the document to PDF or try to use a text box. Any ideas on how to correct this issue?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Go into Home tab &gt; Paragraph group &gt; Dialog launcher button &gt; Paragraph dialog &gt; Indents and spacing tab.&nbsp; My guess is that you have the "Line Spacing" set to "Exactly" and some pt value.&nbsp; Try changing it to "Single" (or "Double").

            <p>Yes, I can see where the 1.08 setting might cause problems. But double should have fixed it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mention "trouble fonts"... Actually, that suggests to me that maybe it is the font that cannot handle large sizes.&nbsp; How does the text look printed at 12 pt, and 24 pt in the trouble font? How about trying the same thing, 3 sizes, with "known good" fonts,
 like good old Times New Roman and Arial, at the same size.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use the same text to make the comparisons easier to compare. </p>

            <p>If the problem is limited to "decorative" fonts, it is likely that you must use fixed Line Spacing with those fonts.

            This screen cap tends to confirm my suspicion that the problem is in the Font design itself. Your script font shows the problem while the "plain" font (Arial, or Calibri?) appears to work correctly.

            I would conclude the same thing if it were limited to just this font, however I have several fonts in which the same things happens regardless of the size of the font or the line spacing.&nbsp;

            The problem occurs even when I have the font set to double spaced.&nbsp;If the problem were line spacing the missing parts of the word would show up on the screen. This occurs with multiple fonts that I have and they look fine on the screen and in print preview.&nbsp;The
 problem occurs when I print, either to an actual printer or to PDF.

            Based on your screen shots, the problem doesn't seem to affect all fonts, though. That means it could be a font issue, or an issue with the printer driver.

            <p>The problem that I would be concerned about is that the text looks fine in Print Preview. Print Preview should provide an accurate representation of what will print using the currently selected printer. If that's not the case, then perhaps updating the printer
 driver is in order.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I notice you have mentioned using multiple line spacing, but I don't think you have confirmed the results using Exactly line spacing at some amount considerably greater than the nominal point size. I doubt that that would help, either, but it's worth a try.</p>

<h2>            unable to install 10576 from 10532 resolution</h2>
                    <p>I had a friend who is a windows insider like myself and was not able to upgrade to the newest build from 10532.</p>
<p>According to support personal the build was operating fine and had no issues. </p>
<p>He has tried many days to resolve the issue where he could not upgrade to build 10576 I took his pc to my home and found many internal issues with the computer software he was running. I repaired the issues he was having and upgraded him first to 10547 then
 to 10576 with no further issues. dism.exe was unable to resolve these issues, and sfc /scan did not find any errors. I resolved this by clearing out his update history and then removing the windows~bt file from his system allowing me to install from iso the
 10547 windows insider.</p>
<p>This is a fun thing to do as I like helping people with there issues.</p>
<p>anyone wanting me to try to assist ask and I will give it my best.......</p>

<p>When I first got the 2 Vista computers I installed Excel from my disk and they worked fine.&nbsp;&nbsp; About 2 years later the Excel on my Vista&nbsp; Desktop, started displaying number wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I type in a whole number&nbsp; ie 38 it displays it as .38 unless I type
 it in 38.(with the period after it).</p>
<p>I tried to correct it by doing the following:</p>
<p>- I went into format and made sure the decimal setting was set for 2 decimals</p>
<p>- I did a Registry clean</p>
<p>- I did a full uninstalled with CCleaner of&nbsp; Excel and then did another Registry clean</p>
<p>- Reinstalled Excel</p>
<p>- It still didn't work</p>
<p>- I installed Excel on my old Excel computer to see if there was a problem with the disk, and it works fine on it.</p>
<p>So I can't figure out what else to do.&nbsp; It's a pain working on it with this problem.</p>
<p>I don't know what else to do.</p>
<p>Thanks for any help you can give me</p>
<p>Gail</p>

            You need to wait till you get the Update KB3062095 and KB3061161&nbsp; these updates will solve a lot of known issues from early build 10074 installs...so Check for Updates on a daily basis..and do manual checks too.*john

<h2>            Layout changes completely when opened in excel for Mac</h2>
                    We are already using a report layout in excel for many years on windows machines. Now we starting to work with Apple Mac's. As I open a report on my Mac in excel 2016 the layout completely changes. What was on one worksheet is now on two, etc. The mac
 has identical printer installed as Windows, Page layout is same, margins same. But the whole layout has changed.

    <title>Hotmail IMAP being too erratic in Mac Mail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> arshadj  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hotmail IMAP being too erratic in Mac Mail</h2>
                    <p><span style="color: rgba(38, 38, 38, 1)">Hello!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(38, 38, 38, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(38, 38, 38, 1)">I have a MacBook Pro running Mountain Lion OS, with a Mac Mail 6.6 (1510) client. &nbsp;I have 7 email accounts set up on it, with 2 Gmail IMAPs, 4 POP3 accounts from various
 providers, and one @hotmail.com account, which was until a few days ago set up for POP3 (leave email on Server).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(38, 38, 38, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(38, 38, 38, 1)">I was thrilled to hear that Outlook.com has finally got IMAP available for email clients like Mac Mail, so I immediately deleted the Hotmail POP account in Mail (through
 System Preferences -&gt; Mail, Contacts &amp; Calendars) and then set up my Mail app to&nbsp;access&nbsp;Hotmail via IMAP as per your instructions elsewhere. &nbsp;That's when the problems began..</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(38, 38, 38, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(38, 38, 38, 1)">My Hotmail Inbox has 3-4 sub-folders in it. &nbsp;It started synchronizing all my folders, and got all the folders into Mail, except the Inbox. &nbsp;(The sub-folders showed under
 the Mailbox name as click-to-expand arrows, and had mail in them, only to disappear on their own in 10 minutes)&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(38, 38, 38, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(38, 38, 38, 1)">So I thought I did something wrong, and deleted this account as well, restarted the Mac and again set up the account - it downloaded more than 2500 messages (including sent,
 deleted, etc.), but didn't display them in the Mailbox. &nbsp;This time, the Mailbox Inbox had no sub-folders, but the sub-folders appeared as individual folders along with Junk, Deleted, Sent, etc below.&nbsp; However, when I restarted the Mail app - SUCCESS! &nbsp;It showed
 all the folders, including the Inbox. &nbsp;It then worked fine for 3-4 days whilst the Mac was on standby and Mail was not closed.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(38, 38, 38, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(38, 38, 38, 1)">Sending as well as receiving was working well, except&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(38, 38, 38, 1)">I had the well-documented problem of mails
 deleted from Mac Mail app inbox not deleting from the Outlook.com server.&nbsp; (Any updates on this front?)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(38, 38, 38, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(38, 38, 38, 1)">But then, when I restarted the Mac today and launched the Mail app, again the Hotmail Mailbox is showing as empty. No amount or restarting the Mail app is bringing the mails
 back to show in the Mailbox.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(38, 38, 38, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(38, 38, 38, 1)">Should I go back to POP? &nbsp;Am I doing something wrong? &nbsp;All the other accounts setup in the Mail app are working perfectly.
</span></p>

            No, mate, nothing. &nbsp;But my problem has sorted itself out on its own! &nbsp;One fine day, when I restarted Mail, I got all my mails showing in the Inbox.
<div>But I still have the extremely annoying problem where whenever I delete a mail in my Hotmail Inbox, the mail doesn't get deleted on the Hotmail server, and I have to login online and then delete the emails manually. &nbsp;I guess this is happening to all users
 of IMAP Hotmail / Outlook on Mail.app.</div>
<div>I wouldn't keep any hopes of these guys giving any solutions. &nbsp;They are great at going round in circles (replies by PM, "escalating" the queries, and asking everyone to start their own thread instead of going ahead and sorting out the issues.</div>

    <title>AVG tuneup can&#39;t be uninstalled - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lesleyk46  say:</h3>
<h2>            AVG tuneup can&#39;t be uninstalled</h2>
                    I think my computer may be infected with something disguised as AVG PC tuneup. I have had AVG for a while and I had accidentally clicked one of their ads to install AVG tuneup. I uninstalled it as it just made my computer slower and it was uninstalled
 just fine. It was gone for a while and then i noticed it was reinstalled. I tried to uninstall it using control panel and I thought it worked but it just kept coming back on my computer. I have switched to avast thinking that if I uninstall AVG it self it
 would help but it didn't AVG PC tuneup is still on my computer. I have searched the web to find answers how to get rid of it and came to this site that said to go to the avg folder and click on the
<strong>UninstallManager.exe. </strong>A window pops up and says the free trial has expired and doesn't give my any option to uninstall, i close the pop up and click uninstallmanager.exe again and same pop up comes back. It says I need to register and it has
 a button to click if I already have a product key. I have tried to stop AVG PC tuneup using the task manager before and it didn't work it would either not stop or just start again in a few seconds. After doing a scan with Avast no viruses have shown up on
 my computer. Do I need to use a different program or contact AVG directy? I really do not want anything to do with AVG after this. Also have AVG has been uninstalled theres still a background process showing up in task manager called AVG services process.

            Hello,
<br />This is Dasiel, a Microsoft Community fellow willing to assist you. 
<br />If you are not 100% sure that the email you have received is from Microsoft, please do not do what it is asking to do. Usually you are required to update your password or credential as you log in to your account, not from an email, so this could be a fake email. You can report it to the following

            Hello BarbaraSwenson, <br />
<br />
I understand that you are feeling very concerned after you have received notice ostensibly from Microsoft to change your credentials. Fret not, I am here to help you with this.
<br />
<br />
Where did you find the emails from? Junk Mail? If so, leave them where they belong to by the algorithms that determined they are scams/spam.
<br />
<br />
Can I clarify: What is the emails' sender address? Are they from <strong>@accountprotection.microsoft.com</strong> or clearly official domains?
<br />
<br />
Do not interact with the email, but hover your mouse over… do you see valid URLs? Like microsoft.com instead of m1cr0s0ft.com?
<br />

    <title>Bluetooth headsets broken in 10049&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jhoff80  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluetooth headsets broken in 10049&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I realize that this also could be a driver thing, so I should point out that I'm using a Surface Pro 2, and therefore the Marvell Avastar Bluetooth adapter and have all drivers up to date in Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, since updating to 10049, I cannot make any Bluetooth headsets work properly.&nbsp; The headset connects and shows both PLT_Legend Hands-Free and PLT_Legend Stereo in the Playback devices section of the Sound Control Panel.&nbsp; However, only the stereo one
 ever connects.&nbsp; I am unable to make the HandsFree one connect, which&nbsp;also means that the microphone is always completely disabled.&nbsp; I even tried going into the legacy "Devices and Printers" control panel, selecting the headset's properties, and disabling the
 "Audio Sink" / A2DP option under Services.&nbsp; After doing that, the headset cannot connect at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Being unable to make the microphone work pretty much defeats the purpose of a Bluetooth headset.&nbsp; I've been able to see similar results with a Jawbone headset (I believe the "Icon") and a no-name one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anyone else seeing similar issues?&nbsp; Or maybe more importantly, has anyone had success using a Bluetooth headset including the microphone?</p>

            I am running build 10130 and am experiencing this exact problem. I have tried running the win 8.1 driver from my bluetooth manufacture too but that just crashes windows.
