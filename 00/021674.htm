            If I understand you correctly, it sounds like the [field product name] column is a foreign key column in a referencing table whose value is a long integer number in the hidden bound column of a combo box when viewed in the table's datasheet.&nbsp; This will
 be the case if you've used the <em>'lookup field'</em> wizard when designing the table.<br />
<br />
A report should be based on a query which joins the current table to the referenced
<em>'products'&nbsp;</em> table, and the text product name column from the referenced table returned in the query.&nbsp; You will then be able to concatenate a literal string expression with the value of this column instead of the foreign key column from the referencing
 table.<br />
<br />
For future reference, the <em>'lookup field'</em> wizard is deprecated by most experienced MS Access developers, and should be avoided like the plague.&nbsp; For reasons why see:<br />

    <title>Activating Windows Insider Build &#40;Fast Ring&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Activating Windows Insider Build &#40;Fast Ring&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello all!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was enrolled in the Windows Insider Program since day one, and all the way to release, however due to having a bit of bad-luck (my motherboard was hit with what I can only guess was lightning) I have had to reinstall Windows Insider Preview and start from
 scratch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My issue is I know the activation servers were disabled for the release build that was issued a few weeks before launch, but we (as Insiders) were told the activation would be re-enabled after the next major build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've reinstalled, and upgraded to the latest Fast Ring build (Build 10532) but it still refuses to let me activate with any of the keys provided here by Microsoft reps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything I can do to stay in the Insider Program at this point?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Alas, Microsoft&nbsp;regards a new motherboard&nbsp;to be&nbsp;a different computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should recover your system to Windows 7/8.1 then upgrade to Windows 10 via the normal route.&nbsp; I don't think you can become an insider again because Microsoft is not accepting 'New' insiders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After following this procedure you will have&nbsp;an activated copy of Windows 10 (unless you didn't have a genuine copy of Windows installed in the first place).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            OneNote mobile speach recording and text transcription in a new note</h2>
                    <p>I'm looking to record speech into OneNote Mobile and get it transcribed in the same note.&nbsp; I saw an article here:
<a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-ways-to-use-microsoft-onenote-on-windows-phone-8/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-ways-to-use-microsoft-onenote-on-windows-phone-8/</a>&nbsp; that stated this could be accomplished in OneNote.&nbsp; I've yet to see it actually done in a video or on my personal Windows Phone.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Is this a real production feature or just a pipe dream</p>

            <p>I can't get a recording made within OneNote to transcribe, but I can get a note transcribed if I initiate it from the speech interface. By that I mean hold down the Windows (home) button, until you get the speech input prompt, say "Note buy milk and eggs"
 and that recording, minus the 'Note', and the transcription, will be applied to a new note.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Not sure why that does not seem to be possible from within OneNote, or why the article seems to mis-represent the capability. The inset picture associated with the capability does show this happening from the speech input access from the home button. Note
 the saving to OneNote in the screen shot on the left.</p>

<h2>            what to do if my phone is stolen</h2>
                    I live in Egypt and my phone was stolen, I want to know if my personal data and accounts will be erased from the phone if I selected the erase option from the "find my phone" service even if my phone is turned off and no internet on it with the sim card
 deactivated. will it erase as soon as it is&nbsp;opened??.&nbsp;I went to the ISP and asked them to&nbsp;turn off&nbsp;my sim.

            Sure. When you will click "Erase" option, the data stored on your phone will be deleted even if you have no internet connection, SIM card. When the theif would turn on the phone there will be no data of yours in phone left but SD Card would may still be
 usable. Your Microsoft Account controls your whole phone not SD Card. But are you sure that you've turned on "Find My Phone" setting on your phone before it was not stolen?

            I think I&nbsp;did something with&nbsp;the "find my phone" option&nbsp;before&nbsp;the phone&nbsp;was stolen but Iam not sure if I really turned it on or not. isn't there a way to know if it was turned on or not? and for the&nbsp;SD Card, I remember I turned on the device encryption
 but I just pressed on it and it was&nbsp;turned on with no&nbsp;other&nbsp;sign of it being turned on. I also locked the&nbsp;phone beside erasing it and put a message hoping that&nbsp;it&nbsp;would&nbsp;be seen if the phone was&nbsp;turned on by someone else to call me. thanks for your concern

            <p>Hi, <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/c6d1eff9-0f88-468f-ab8a-ff2b289c264a" title="Ray_12345">
Ray_12345</a>. Try removing the battery. After few seconds, put it back into the phone and power it on. Also, try starting your phone in Safe Mode. In Safe Mode, only a few essential system processes are allowed to run. This allows you to see if a recently
 installed application is preventing your phone from starting properly. See the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Power on your phone.<br />
2. When you hear the startup tone and Nokia logo starts flashing, press and hold the volume down button until the phone starts up.<br />
3. If the phone is started in safe mode you will see the <strong>Safe</strong> text in the bottom left corner of the screen.<br />
4. Once you have removed the offending application, power off your phone and back on to restart it in normal mode.</p>
<p>

            That checkbox causes an \f switch to be added to the field and will result in the inclusion and incrementation of footnote, endnote, or comment numbers.

    <title>Outlook and focused inbox bug - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kevin_titot  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook and focused inbox bug</h2>
                    <p>I've found a bug with Outlook 365 (Office 365 ProPlus desktop apps) and focused inbox, I've been able to replicate this with different versions of Outlook 365 and across multiple clients I support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a search / sort sequence of the inbox Outlook will hide certain emails that it would consider "other" when focused inbox is turned on, though it is doing this when focused is off, hiding emails completely. The only way I can get them to show again
 is by turning focused inbox on and then off again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The odd sequence is as followed:</p>
<p>- Focused inbox turned off</p>
<p>- With the inbox selected do a normal email search using the search bar</p>
<p>- Once you have searched, sort the emails by name or to or from etc..</p>
<p>- After the above has been completed, clear the search field and sort the emails by date again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found after this sequence, any email that Outlook focused inbox would consider to be "other" is now not visible and hidden from the inbox, though as noted focused inbox is turned off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To allow the emails to be visible again you need to toggle focused inbox on which will allow you to see them in the "other" tab and then toggle it off which brings them back into inbox "All" tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried updating to the latest version of Office 365 from the online portal and recreating email profiles, however as it is happening for multiple clients of mine across any email account I test with, I think this is indeed a bug within Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Kevin</p>

<p>Hi Kevin,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to post your experience about Outlook using.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Based on your description, I tried to reproduce your steps and check the results. But I cannot reproduce it in the end.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I tried following steps:</span></p>
<p><span>1. <strong>Turn off</strong> <strong>Shown Focus Inbox</strong>; </span>
</p>
<p><span>2. Do a normal <strong>search</strong> in the <strong>Inbox</strong>; </span>
</p>
<p><span>3. <strong>Sort</strong> the search results by name or etc.; </span></p>
<p><span>4. <strong>Re-sort</strong> the results <strong>by date</strong>. </span>
</p>
<p><span>If the above steps are not right, please correct me.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Since we have turned off the Focus box, the result we got was just the consequence matched our search condition, so the other emails that unmatched search condition will not show up in the result. It’s just as your noticed “’other’ is not visible and
 hidden from the <strong>Inbox</strong>”.</span>To return to normal view, I closed search, then all the emails were displayed normal in
<strong>Inbox</strong>. And after I turned on <strong>Show Focus Inbox</strong> the emails also displayed normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If it’s convenient, would you mind offering me some screenshots to help me understanding the dilemma you encountered in case that I misunderstood your concern?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>By the way, here’s my testing environment: Windows 10, Outlook (Version 1906 Build 11727.20224 Click-to-Run)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regards,</span></p>
<p><span>Shawn</span></p>

<p>Hi Shawn,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just re-read my post and slightly altered the steps I've done:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Once you have searched, sort the emails by name or to or from etc..<br />
- After the above has been completed, clear the search field and sort the emails by date again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The emails that would generally be "other" are hidden once the search field is cleared and you then change the sort back to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<p>Hi Kevin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your clarity on it. I did the test as your suggested steps again, however, I cannot find that emails would be hidden or missed. If it's convenient, may you offer me some screenshots on your reproduce? It can help me understand you better so that
 I can make a further analysis on your concern.</p>

<p>Hi Shawn,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've made a quick video to demonstrate, I've used my personal email account with Outlook version 1905 Build 11629.20246 however I have been able to reproduce the same issue on many different builds across many computers and clients.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://youtu.be/REMOVED</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some context:</p>
<p>I demonstrate an inbox with random emails,</p>
<p>Turn on focused inbox to show you what Outlook considers to be focused and other,</p>
<p>Turn off focused inbox to demonstrate reproducing the bug,</p>
<p>You will see the emails that would be considered "other" be removed from view, only being returned once focused is toggled on then off again.</p>

<p>Hi Shawn,<br />
<br />
I am investigating this issue too and can repeat on several accounts that I tested. We have Exchange 2010 and Outlook 365 on prem...&nbsp; &nbsp;we do not have Focused mailbox options.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
Basically the steps are</p>
<p>1. run a search</p>
<p>2. sort the results by a field by clicking the field name on the top of the list (e.g. Date Received)</p>
<p>3. clear the search box by clicking X... and the full inbox is displayed</p>
<p>4. sort the inbox by clicking on the field name at the top of the list (e.g. Date Received)</p>
<p>5. the sort results in either an empty inbox of all messages from on sender</p>
<p>6. click away from the Inbox to another folder and back to the Inbox again results in all messages being displayed again</p>
<p>
</p><p>Comments....&nbsp; </p>
<p>the sorting at 2 above is not always necessary</p>
<p>this only happens on the InBox and not other folders that I tested (but I have not tested all folders)<br />
I am using Outlook 365 Version 1808 - build 10730-20370 32 bit on Windows 2016 server through Citrix with Office 365&nbsp;<br />
I am aware that there are updates to Outlook that may need to be applied if this issue has been fixed.<br />
As it is an unusual issue I suspect that many people do not detect same as we have only one user who has reported&nbsp; the issue but it happens for every account we have tested.<br />
<br />
Any update on this call would be helpful&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thanks You<br />
<br />
Niall&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Emails keep gong to the junk folder - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Emails keep gong to the junk folder</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I saw other users reporting it but I didn't see any reasonable answer besides the questions that have nothing to do with the problem. Emails are going to the junk folder although the sender is not blocked, defined as safe. Moreover, every day new emails
 are going to the junk folder from different senders that went to the Inbox just &nbsp;a day before. Once moving them to the Inbox they move back to the junk folder. Not sure why you are asking people about rules. When moving email from Junk to Inbox no rule is
 applied. There is no reason for the email to go back to junk besides what it is: a microsoft bug. Which should be fixed. I am subscriber of microsoft office and not sure why the hotmail is being treated like a step son. Before you ask all the questions I give
 the answers below so to all microsoft guys if you can't help than don't but please please don't ask the same questions that have nothing to do with the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp;<span>How exactly are you trying to access Outlook.com? Is it through Email client, browser or Mail app? - browser. It happens with every browser.</span></p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp;</span><span><span>How exactly have you configured your account? Is it configured with POP3, IMAP or Exchange Active Sync? - not relevant.
 This is hotmail account which I haven't&nbsp;configured.</span></span></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><span>3.&nbsp;</span><span>Is the issue related to a particular sender or domain? - no, it's random</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><span>4.&nbsp;</span><span>Have you made any rule to move the emails to&nbsp;</span>Junk&nbsp;<span>folder?
 - NO</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Check your Junk folder -&nbsp;</span></span><span>If you see any messages that should have been delivered to the Inbox, click the box on the left of each message to put a check mark
 and then click the&nbsp;</span>Not Junk<span>&nbsp;button - done. Doesn't help.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Check your Blocked sender list - list is empty</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Add the email address to your Safe senders list - it's there and I also press "it is Safe" once I open the email in the junk folder. Doesn't help.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Check your Email Rules - no rules apply for those emails that move to junk. It is random. One day the sender goes to Inbox and the next day to Junk. There is no logic here so all those questions are useless.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Check your Junk Mail Settings - Choose Junk Email filter is set to Standard</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Check your Reply-to address -&nbsp;</span></span>Your "From" address is picked</p>
<p>Email forwarding - not enabled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, bottom line, even before I had one(!) rule the emails started going to junk. The problem started around the time other users are reporting which is around November 2015.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea when the bug is going to be fixed? Please just reply if Microsoft is aware of the bug and planning to fix it so users can know how long to wait. Do not ask any question about my browser or rules. It has nothing to do with it. This is a bug.<br />

<p>i've reported it in the feedback button on outlook numerous times.</p>
<p>you can add as safe senders, put rules to send them to inbox. checkmark them and put 'not junk' ot 'move to' and put inbox. Doesnt make any difference. i go back to junk folder 15 minutes later and the same exact emails are back. What's worse is more and
 more emails are starting to do this. It's getting worse...</p>

            I think there are thousands like us. I am not sure why again and again we are being asked the same questions about what browser are we using and if we have rules to the junk folder. And now most of my emails are going to junk. Sometimes just saying that
 Microsoft is aware &nbsp;to the problem and working on a fix is better than wasting time of so many users that spend so much time answering their questions. I think it's disrespectful to people using their product and those who actually pay subscription fee to
 their products. &nbsp;I prefer to pay for hotmaill as long as I can talk to some customer service.

<p>I am in the same place. My first email account. This is the major 3rd problem I encounter in the last 2 years. The first one was the Search fails again and again and after like a month of forum ping-pong with the support they agreed to access my account
 and fix it. The second one was managing rules fails and this one took almost 2 months of ping-pong and I have no idea how it was solved but I guess someone eventually did access &nbsp;my account and fix it. The 3rd one is now with the Junk. All problems have few
 things in common. They are all problems on the server/Microsoft side, they can be fixed only by Microsoft support guy accessing your account and fixing it, they are all being reported by hundreds of users at the same time period and finally all those users
 need to spend months back and forth being asked to provide screen shots, logs, and answer many not relevant questions. Why ask the same questions again and again about which browser are you using, does it happen on all computers??? Why can't the problem be
 fixed for all users without each one of us needing to spend weeks in conversation with the support team?</p>

<p>hi all,</p>
<p>I pretty frustrated about this.</p>
<p>for over a week now nokia messaging has stopped working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to reinstall, delete the account etc. Nothing helped.</p>
<p>I'm using nokia e71 and gmail as my email server.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>any idea what's going on with this issue??</p>
<p>thanks a lot.</p>

            the some over here with E72. Stopped since a week from today. I tried everything and all my emails (e.g. Corporate email, Hotmail,&nbsp;Yahoo, Gmail, OVI) stopped working; however, they are connected. Any solution Nokia?!&nbsp;

<p>My E72 has stopped all email services, email.nokia.com cannot send me my password even though it prompts and confirms I am registered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was previously a Blackberry user, no email since the 22nd of December (2009), no one in Vodafone understands this model completely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I emailed a detailed request for support from Nokia, it is now 1st of Feb, no response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What kind of shoody service are both of these telecommunications giants providing?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why does the service provider, not understand the product completely?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why does the manufacturer and provider of nokia messgaing service not reply to customer queries and compliants, do you really have that many issues, you cannot respond withing a month?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Nokia store finder doesnt even work on the site!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are reading this and are stillwithin your 7 day cooling off period, do not listen to salespeople that will try to just hold you in, send it back, call 02 and buy a blackberry, the E72 only works in the imagination of the salespeople or in the manual.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do have problems, get ready to call watchdog (consumer affairs programme)</p>

<p>I got lucky with one of Nokia messaging support guys who was with me online sending emails backward and forward until I discovered something. To start with a brief background on my problem, as it may help you, I had my emails stopped from being synchronized
 since mid-January. I deleted all the emails from my phone, and logged to Nokia messaging and unsubscribed. Then , I encountered like many others problems with relogging-in or signing-up in the email.nokia web. When I sign-up, it asks for your number and model
 of the phone (mine is E72). When I mandate my model, I get a message that I have the latest email preloaded and installed on my device and to make sure to accept the terms. So, I decided to try adding my mail boxes again through my phone directly but without
 any success. I was using my home wireless network (my internet provider) as my access to the internet and email setting. From today’s trial with Nokia Guy, I found this discovery. Since I was in my office and way from my home, I HAD to use my Telecom provider
 (SIM card) network data network, though I am not subscribed and always avoiding paying extra costs, to set-up my emails through the phone directly. To my surprise, I got the Nokia Policy acceptance thing after adding up my emails details. From there, all my
 emails where set-up and synchronized (HEHA LIFE AGAIN TO MY PHONE). I am using my corporate exchange server email plus Yahoo, Hotmail, OVI, and GMAIL (GMAIL looks like it did not get successful but will test it later). Now, I am still in the office and since
 I get my emails set-up, I will go to my home and try synchronizing through my WLAN like before again. In summary, looks like the user have to set-up his emails again through his SIM card connection to the internet and looks like it’s a way for NOKIA to authenticate
 that you have both a phone and a SIM card plan to enable setting up your accounts. Then, you can use any mean of connectivity to synchronize once established. Question, what caused my emails to stop synchronizing in the beginning? Answer, no clue other than
 Nokia might did some rework on its server that requires users to set-up again their accounts! I hope that this works with users who have their emails preloaded on their devices</p>

            Hey Wish I could agree with your theory, but can't. I have only tried to access it through network's data plan and not at all through my wifi. Still no luck! It will ask for my password which I enter, it then tries to validate. And then it asks for the
 password again!! To top this all off, I am trying this service for the first time today. First downloaded it through OVI, then uninstalled it and reinstalled it from
<a href="http://email.nokia.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://email.nokia.com</a> and still got the same result. All I want is push email (or something that resembles as close to push email as possible) on my phone and the ability to manage all my
 accounts. Looks like this is where other brands of phones beat the nokia. How sad!

<p>I have also lost all use of my nokia messaging service. No sync, no access, it wont validate my password. Even when trying to sort it out online I'm fast with errors. I can't add a new email address at this time it says when I do. I've been having these
 issues since the end of January and am now in VITAL need of some help to get this working again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This seems to be an issue with a LOT of nokia customers. Are they even listening to these issues that people are having? I hope so! I need my email working again now!</p>

<p>I had the same problem with my businesses Exchange 2003 email account. It stopped syncing about a week after I bought the phone in November. I was on the verge of binning the phone last week when I had one last ditch attempt. I archived and then restored
 all the mail folders on the server and deleted old/unwanted contacts. I then manaully changed the setting on ALL mail acounts which asks me to choose to connect via my wireless router at home or contract 3G Internet so that I have a user defined manual setting
 defaulting to "contract internet". This caused the phone to start syncing again without hanging the connection. I think it was the latter issue whch did the trick - the horrible pop up connection dialogue box I think was interfering with the sync. Eliminating
 this got rid of all the sync problems and meant that I didn't have to keep restarting the phone. Its now working perfectly for the first time in months. I didn't need to delete and restore any email accounts. I would be interested to hear whether this works
 with anyone else.</p>

<p>The way I made it work after having all the same symptoms you guys described:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, deactivate (yes, delete) your nokia email account via email.nokia.com. (cancel your subscription)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remove the software from your phone via the application manager.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have experienced the same problem with my Nokia E71, the Messenger email stopped working, I reverted back to the phone original e-mail program, and my Rogers account (Canada) was not responding as well. Rogers e-mail is back on line but for the second
 day the Nokia Messaging email is not working.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It happened once before and I resolved the issue by reinstalling the program, this time there is no luck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will use my phone original e-mail program, and will try the Messenger again after the weekend.</p>

            Same here with e72, Fido/Rogers Canada. Wifi or 3G does not matter, Gmail email are not pushed to my phone since 1-2 weeks. I did recreate Gmail account on nokia.com but have not reinstalled the messaging app since I cannot find it in my installed app
 list. Is there a trick? I was lured into Nokia camp with free offline navigation (which works still) and push email, not working. Nokia wake up and give us an answer.

<h2>            Outlook Icon changed to default windows icon</h2>
                    <p>I was running a store bought version of Office 2010 for home and student. Last night i used the anytime upgrade option to upgrade to office professional. i paid for the upgrade, got the key, used it and upgraded my software. All the programs i should have
 appeared in the proper place in the start menu, but here is my problem: I went and tried to put the shortcut to Outlook on my desktop next to all the other office programs I have there and as soon as i placed it there the icon changed to the default windows
 icon from the Outlook icon. The program opens up and runs fine, just that it looks bad having this ugly default icon in the middle of all the other ones. Any ideas how I can change this back to look properly. The upgrade was the only thing I did then, and
 this only happened with Outlook,&nbsp;I also put Access on the desktop last night and the Icon stayed as it should.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, I am running Windows 7 premum 64bit.</p>

            I just had the same problem. Creating a new shortcut directly from the executable solved the problem for me.<br />
<br />
While following various guides to try to fix it, I discovered that the repair/uninstall tool no longer works. When I select change from the all programs list, a window opens saying "preparing necessary files", waits a few seconds, and then closes with no further
 messages.<br />
<br />
I know this a different question from the original topic, but I'm curious if the issues of the missing icon and broken installer are related.<br />

    <title>Design flaw&#58; Office &#91;PowerPoint &#47; Word&#93; &#40;2007, - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Design flaw&#58; Office &#91;PowerPoint &#47; Word&#93; &#40;2007, 2010, 2013&#41; derives proofing language from keyboard layout</h2>
                    <p>I'm posting this here as I have found no other way to report this bug (or rather unhelpful feature).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am working with Office 2013 on Windows 8.1, but the behavior has been consistent since at least Office 2007. My system language is English; in Office, I have English and German proofing tools installed; *English is set as the default editing language in
 the Office language preferences*, and pretty much all documents that I edit are US English.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, my hardware, in particular my keyboard, is German, so I am using German (DE) keyboard layout.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, whenever I create a new element such as a new text box (or even add a new&nbsp;bullet point) in PowerPoint, the editing language is set to German regardless of my default editing language (or the language set for the previous bullet). [Edit: The same is
 true for creating a new document in Word.] While language autodetection works reasonably well in Word, this does not seem to be available in PowerPoint anymore; the English text I enter remains classified as German and is flagged by the spell checker. This
 behavior is very annoying and a design flaw (made worse by the fact it is impossible to simply select all slides and set the proofing language for all elements on all slides at once).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whoever designed this meant well, but ultimately fell into&nbsp;a trap of US-centric thinking. "I am typing US English on my US keyboard. Now I want to type French. Oh, they have all these weird diacritical marks not present on my keyboard. I guess I have to
 switch to a French keyboard layout to write efficiently. Hmm, why would I ever switch to a French keyboard layout if I didn't want to write French? So I can safely infer that I am typing French when I use the French keyboard layout!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, this does not hold true for the rest of us from the countries using these weird diacritical marks. Our keyboard layouts&nbsp;are usually supersets of an English language keyboard (at least for normal text -&nbsp;German programmers pay for this by having
 to use ALT GR to type { [ ] } and \), so there is no reason whatsoever to change the keyboard layout in order to type English text. It is actually highly counterproductive as some letters (e.g. y and z for Germans, even more keys for French users) switch around,
 and people would have to adjust&nbsp;their touch typing when they could just as well keep using their accustomed layout. Non-touch typists are even less inclined to use a layout that deviates from what is printed on the keys.&nbsp;Personally, I don't know anybody who
 switches to US layout for typing English on German hardware, and I work for a German company where 80% of the internal communication is in English.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In short, determining language based on keyboard layout is a bad idea, at least for non-English latin alphabet languages. It would be ok to keep this as an optional feature - as mentioned above, I see this&nbsp;working for&nbsp;US users, and probably also for languages
 with wildly different character sets&nbsp;- but it absolutely needs to be possible to switch this off in the language preferences. A simple checkbox 'use keyboard layout to determine editing language' would do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This may only be at the level of an annoyance, but it affects millions of users. I just hope somebody reads this here who knows how to forward this to the right people...</p>

            <p>It's a known problem and one that's come up any number of times before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have anything but a US keyboard so can't test any of this, but here's something you might try:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Shut down PowerPoint.</p>
<p>Start Word.</p>
<p>On the Review tab, choose Language | Set Proofing Language.</p>
<p>Remove the check next to Detect language automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click OK</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start PowerPoint up and see if that has had any effect on it. &nbsp;PPT inherits one or two obscure settings from Word. &nbsp;Maybe this'll be one. &nbsp;Do let us know if it helps, please.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PowerPoint 2010 had an option that might have helped (Automatically switch language to surrounding text or something like that) but 2013 seems to have lost that option.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your feedback. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Turning off 'Detect language automatically' in Word has no influence on the behavior in PowerPoint.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, it has made me realize that Word has the same problem: When you create a new document, the proofing language will be set depending on your keyboard layout, disregarding your default editing language setting. This is only less annoying because (a)
 detect language works reasonably well in Word, (b) it only happens when creating the document, not for every paragraph, and (c) CTRL+A, set language works in Word. Still, the same option 'Use keyboard layout to determine editing language' should be added to
 the Word language options as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this has come up before, do you know whether this has been brought to the attention of the Office dev team? I would understand if they didn't want to remove this ability altogether, but I don't really see an argument against making it user switchable,
 which should be easy enough to implement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, you don't need a non-US keyboard to test the behavior&nbsp;- you just need to install at least one alternative keyboard layout.

            <p>I can't imagine that the Word dev team isn't aware of this, but I'm not sure whether the PPT group has dealt with it. &nbsp;However, since you've explained it (and the pain it causes) in such detail, I'm going to send a link to this thread to someone I know on
 the PPT team.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, if you need to set the overall presentation default to, say, US English rather than the keyboard-dictated German, there are a couple of add-ins that might help. &nbsp;I have one called LanguageSelector ( free demo version and info at

            <p>Excellent, precise description of the problem. I fully agree. </p>
<p>The key point is, that we may want to "type" in a different language (In reality I want Spell Checking to happen in a particular language), but the Keyboard Layout is fix, it's not changing! The Spelling / Language has no relation with the Keyboard layout
 being used to type the Latin letters...</p>
<p>I must add that the situation is even worse: </p>
<p>I can format a PPT Slide and set the Proofing language to English by selecting all elements on a single slide - Spell checking will show any typos against English Language (For example will underline "<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">demadn</span>").
</p>
<p>However when I correct the typo by deleting the "d" and adding it to the end of the word: "<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">deman</span>d", the newly typed "d" letter is again NOT treated as English, so I have to re-apply the English Proofing language
 again to the modified word :( </p>
<p>The suggested solution is the right direction, there should be a simple Office-wide flag to turn-off "Keyboard-based" language detection and allow the users to specify their Default language as well as allow for any document to select the Proofing language
 of that Document (PPT / WORD / Email). </p>

<p>There isn't a way to disable the feature. However it is a new feature they are testing, and they are looking for your feedback on it. Please use the send-a-smile/send-a-frown buttons in any of the Office apps where it is showing up for you to let the team
 know what you think about it and how you'd like to see it changed.</p>

            The DefaultValue property does not initiate a new record per se, it merely sets a value for when a new record is initiated.&nbsp; You'll see the value in the empty new row, but no new record will as yet have been initiated, i.e. the subform's Dirty property
 will not&nbsp; be True.<br />
<br />
If you are seeing the pencil icon without entering anything into the subform manually, i.e. its Dirty property is True, it suggests that a value is being assigned to a column in the subform's recordset in some other way than by setting the DefaultValue property,
 e.g. in code in an event procedure in the subform's module.<br />
