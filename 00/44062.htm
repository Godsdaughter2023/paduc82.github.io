<h2>            Transferring data across xbox 360 hard drive to Cloud Saved Games</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am struggling with transferring my data across from xbox 360 hard drive to the Cloud Saved Games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the downloaded games, they move across but only Mbs and not Gbs, why is that? (It says too that they 'in sync')</p>
<p>
</p><p>and for disc games, do I have to put the game discs in to move across?</p>
<p>
</p><p>but, for both disc and downloaded games, they say 'skipped items: some items are skipped.'&nbsp; Also say 'to see what they were, go to Settings, System, Storage, and check the source and destination devices.'</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please explain this to me, or even solve this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for helping.</p>

<p>Hello Coolz,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for bringing this issue to our attention. Do you mean that the file sizes for the saved data average in Mbps, or that the upload speed is in Mbps? Any disc games that are backwards compatible&nbsp;will need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;installed&nbsp;on the Xbox One by placing
 the disc in the console. Any digital backwards compatible games will show up in ready to install as soon as the account is placed on an Xbox One and signed in.&nbsp;We have a list of all
<a href="https://www.xbox.com/xbox-one/backward-compatibility/available-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
backwards compatible games</a>. We have an article entitled <a href="https://support.xbox.com/games/game-setup/game-saves-in-the-cloud-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox 360 Cloud Game Saves FAQ </a>which can answer several questions about cloud saved games. Be sure to let us know the results!</p>

            As long as you're signed into Live, everything like achievements, purchases, etc. are saved to the Xbox servers. So they're tied to your account. You would need to save your games saves to the cloud so they will transfer to the One. Once you're on the
 One, any digital games you own will be listed as "Ready to Install" in your Games and Apps, or you would insert the disc to play it. Once you start the game, the game will sync with your saves from the cloud.&nbsp;

    <title>Windows 10 free upgrade product key - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnnyseven7  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 free upgrade product key</h2>
                    A couple of years ago I was given a free upgrade by Microsoft to Windows 10 from Windows 7. However the upgrade seemed to break my computer as after the upgrade I got a blue screen of death and had to take it to a specialist to fix. I was advised that
 the hard drive was damaged and had to be replaced and the technician also installed Windows 10 with the new hard drive. After a recent Windows 10 upgrade I am being asked for a product key. I was never provided with a product key when I received my free Windows
 10 upgrade. My Windows 7 product key does not work. How can I get a Windows 10 product key?

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once one has the .iso file they may wish to use the <a href="http://download.cnet.com/Windows-7-USB-DVD-Download-Tool/3000-18513_4-10972600.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            When installing or uninstalling software get Error 2378 - Could not access VBScript run time for custom action</h2>
                    <p>I am getting Error 2378 Could not access VBScript run time for custom action, when I try installing software and uninstalling some software.</p>
<p>I have tried several of the fixes on line for regsvr32 vbscript.dll and nothing has helped.</p>
<p>I have tried deleting the keys in HKCU\Software\Wow6432Node and it says that they don't exist.</p>
<p>I have registered the VBScript engine in the folder that it is installed, says sucessful but still doesn't work.</p>
<p>I have tried with run as administrator from the command line also.</p>
<p>It is&nbsp;a Dell laptop running Win 7 Home Premium 64 -bit.</p>
<p>Any suggestions would be appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Which operating system is installed on your computer?</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b> This error message indicates that the VBScript engine is not currently registered on the machine where the install/uninstall is taking place. I
 would suggest you to try the steps as below and check if the issue is fixed. If you have already tried these steps then let us know.</p>
<p>Delete the following registry the keys and then register the VBScript and check if it helps:</p>
<p><b>Step 1:</b>
<span>&nbsp;</span>If you have a 64-bit operating system, you will need to follow these steps:</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click Start, and then type <b>
cmd</b> in the Start Search box.</p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Right-click <b>cmd</b> in the Programs list, and then click Run as administrator.</p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>At the command prompt, type the following command and then press ENTER:</p>
<p><b>reg delete "HKCU\SOFTWARE\Classes\Wow6432Node\CLSID\{B54F3741-5B07-11CF-A4B0-00AA004A55E8}" /f</b></p>
<p>If you have a 32-bit operating system, you will need to follow these steps:</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click Start, and then type <b>
cmd</b> in the Start Search box.</p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Right-click <b>cmd</b> in the Programs list, and then click Run as administrator.</p>

</span></span></span>At the command prompt, type the following command and then press ENTER:</p>
<p><b>reg delete "HKCU\SOFTWARE\Classes\CLSID\{B54F3741-5B07-11CF-A4B0-00AA004A55E8}" /f</b></p>

<p>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click Continue</p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>At the command prompt, type the following command and then press ENTER:</p>
<p>If you are using32 bit version of Windows then run the following command:</p>
<p><b>regsvr32 vbscript.dll</b></p>
<p>If you are using64 bit version of Windows then run the following commands:</p>
<p><b>cd %windir%\syswow64</b></p>

            <p>Please answer&nbsp;<em>each of the following diagnostic questions</em> in a correspondingly-numbered list in your very next reply (no need to quote this post):</p>
<p>1. What is the <em>full name</em> of your installed anti-virus application or security suite and
<em>when (approx. date) does your current subscription expire?</em>&nbsp; What anti-spyware applications (other than Defender) are installed?&nbsp; What third-party firewall (if any)?</p>
<p>2. Has a(nother) Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer?</p>
<p>3. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [PICK ONE] come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it? (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>
<p>4. Open <strong>Add/Remove Programs</strong> &amp; make sure the <strong>Show Updates</strong> box at the top is checked (and leave it checked); then select the
<strong>Name</strong> option in the <strong>Sort by</strong> box on the right. Now scroll down &amp; tell me if ALL of the following updates are listed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) KB2621440, KB2641653 &amp; KB2647518</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) KB2647516, KB2661637; KB2598479, KB2631813, KB2585542; KB2633171, KB2618451; KB2393802 &amp; KB971029</p>
<p>Most will be displayed as <strong>Security Update for Windows XP</strong> followed by the KB number in parentheses.</p>
<p>If IE8 is installed,&nbsp;one will be displayed as <strong>Security Update for Windows Internet Explorer 8</strong> followed by the KB number in parentheses.</p>
<p>5. Is Firefox, Chrome or any other alternate browser installed?</p>
<p>6. Are you in the habit of using "Registry cleaners" (e.g., Registry Mechanic; System Mechanic; RegCure; RegClean Pro; Advanced SystemCare; Registry Booster; McAfee QuickClean; AVG PC TuneUp; Norton Registry Cleaner; PCTools Optimiser; SpeedUpMyPC; Advanced
 System Optimizer; TuneUp Utilities; WinMaximizer; WinSweeper; CCleaner)?</p>
<p>7. Have you ever had occasion to do a <a href="http://www.michaelstevenstech.com/XPrepairinstall.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Repair Install</a> (or a clean install) of WinXP for any reason?

<p><strong>Your&nbsp;computer should NOT be connected to the internet <em>or any local networks</em> (i.e., other computers) in its current state. All of your personal data (e.g., online banking &amp; credit-card passwords) should be considered at-risk, if not already

MSE is sufficient, provided that your Windows Firewall is turned on and that you have a router between your PC and the modem.<br />
<br />
Having more than one virus scanner is not a good idea. Get rid of one of them.<br />

            <p>Don't know why that link isn't working....McAfee must have pulled it or their FAQ is being revised.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The MCPR should work...and you can uninstall/delete the application after you're through using it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's a few suggestions from Stephen Boots, MSE Forum Moderator regarding fake antivirus programs and general malware prevention measures:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Unfortunately, these type of malware attacks are difficult to keep up with because they trick you into letting them install. They usually come
 from an infected web site, and usually through an advertisement. You get a pop-up from the infection and you click&nbsp;it to close the pop-up - which allows the infection to install.&nbsp; They can also be delivered in a "drive-by" fashion with no action needed by
 the user due to the system being unpatched, no matter what security software is running.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When you encounter one of these fake virus pop-ups while browsing, immediately do the following:<br />
<br />
-<b>Do not touch any browser window to close it or browse further</b>.<br />
-Immediately press Ctrl-Shift-Esc and bring up Task Manager and forcibly end all instances of iexplore.exe, if using Internet Explorer, or the executable for&nbsp;the browser you are using.<br />
--or--<br />
-Go to Start/Shut Down and restart the PC without touching any browser windows.<br />
-If you used task manager to close browser instances, reboot the machine.<br />
-Then go to Control Panel/Internet Options and delete all temporary Internet Files and cookies. If you are using an alternate web browser, open the browser settings to do the same - delete the local cached files and cookies.<br />
-Perform a full scan with your antimalware program.<br />
<br />
The above steps should prevent the infection from taking hold.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Besides using an antimalware program, the following recommendations will assist in protecting the PC from infection:
</span></p>
<p><span>-Make sure that the Windows Firewall is enabled.
</span></p>
<p><span>-Make sure that all important/critical updates, including service packs for the operating system and programs are installed from Microsoft Update
 (Windows Update). </span></p>
<p><span>-Make sure Internet Explorer is at version 8 or higher and updated with all patches.
</span></p>
<p><span>-In Internet Explorer 8 or 9, use the SmartScreen Filter.
</span></p>
<p><span>-Make sure that IE Internet Security settings are at least set to medium-high (default).
</span></p>
<p><span>-Enable the pop-up blocker in IE.
</span></p>
<p><span>-On Vista and Windows 7 make sure thatUser Account Control (UAC) ON&nbsp; and not running with elevated privileges.
</span></p>
<p><span>-Make sure that Windows Automatic Updates are set to at least notify, but the preferred setting is to download and install automatically. If you
 update manually, be sure to update as soon as possible after being notified of available updates.
</span></p>
<p><span>-<u>Make sure that installed applications, especially Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Flash, and Java are at their latest versions. Many vendors are regularly
 updating and patching for security holes.</u> </span></p>
<p><span>-Never click through links from unknown sources and use caution even if they are from a "trusted" source.
</span></p>
<p><span>-Never open unsolicited email attachments.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck...</p>

    <title>Emails sent from Windows 10 Mail app - received as coming from unknown - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> c bates  say:</h3>
<h2>            Emails sent from Windows 10 Mail app - received as coming from unknown sender&#47;bulk email</h2>
                    <p>I was wondering if someone could assist me with a problem I have encountered with the Windows 10 mail app (latest version 17.6965.41051.0).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I previously set up my email account with my internet service provider (not an @outlook.com address) as an outlook.com account. I&nbsp;accessed my email account using the outlook mail (i.e. outlook.live.com) without the problem noted below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently I started using the Windows 10 mail app&nbsp;to access my email account.&nbsp; I&nbsp;have&nbsp;just learned that any emails I send using the mail app &nbsp;are being received as coming from an unknown sender.&nbsp; I have confirmed that recipients see my emails without any
 sender&nbsp;name or marked unknown sender&nbsp;or [Bulk]&nbsp;in the subject line or noted as "This sender failed our fraud detection checks and may not be who they appear to be". This appears to be an error specific to the mail app as when I send email using outlook mail
 (outlook.live.com) such error messages are not received by email recipients.&nbsp; I also tried sending emails using by internet service provider's web mail service and no errors were received.&nbsp; I would like to continue to use the mail app but this is a problem
 as recipients of my emails are receiving them with these errors and they or their email programs/apps are&nbsp;treating my emails as&nbsp;bulk email or even spam.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have deleted and re-added the email account (as an outlook account) to the mail app several times and the error persists.&nbsp; Any assistance would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also reviewed the detailed internet headings on the received emails (from a recipient who uses Outlook 2016) and I could not see any differences between the details for emails sent from the mail app (with the problem) versus those sent from either the
 outlook mail or my internet service provider web email service (and neither of these last two have any problems).</p>

            <p>Thank you for your comments. I have tried the two methods above and the problem persists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I note that I have installed the mail app on three different laptops accessing this specific email account and emails sent from each laptop for this email account all result in the unknown sender error for email recipients.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also used the mail app with a different&nbsp;email account with an internet service provider (not an @outlook.com address) but that is set up as&nbsp;an outlook.com account. The mail app on different laptops works fine with this different email account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Accordingly this error seems specific to this email account and does not appear to be an issue with the mail app installation since the error is replicated on different laptops using the mail app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any further comments you have would be appreciated.</p>
<p>

<p>I had not heard anything from Microsoft on this and I had just about given up but I tried again today and I have now found a solution that works for me using the Windows 10 mail app on different devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They key was&nbsp;that when I added the account under Settings - Management Accounts - Choose an Account, I chose "Advanced setup" and not the "Outlook.com" option I previously used. (Note that "Advanced setup" is the last option under Choose an account and so
 you may need to scroll down to see it.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under Advanced Setup choose "Exchange ActiveSync"</p>
<p>
</p><p>For "Email address" and "Password" - enter the email address you have setup as an outlook.com account (may not be an .outlook.com account but just has to be an email address set up as an outlook.com account)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Username - I had to enter the email address here as entering just the my name did not work.&nbsp; This would be the username you use to access the email account and so it may or may not be the email address itself but in my case it was the email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Domain - I left blank.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For server - enter eas.outlook.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check the SSL box if needed - in my case I needed to check it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Account name - this can be anything and is how the email account will be listed in the mail app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click sign-in and hopefully everything is ok now with emails being sent from the mail app and not being received without your sender name and/or marked as junk/bulk, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that before doing any of these steps I deleted the previously setup email account in the mail app. As you probably already experienced when you first used the mail app you will need to sync your inbox and any mail folders you have to retrieve messages
 from the server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps Steve.</p>

            <p>I hope to try Steve's suggestion BUT when I get into 'Mail' 'Settings' 'Manage Accounts' I am shown a list of my four accounts along with 'Link Inboxes' (I've no idea what that means) and 'Add Account'. I select an account, two options, Delete Account or
 'Change Mailbox Sync Settings'. Naturally I choose the latter. Where it says 'Send your messages using this name' I enter my name, click 'Done' followed by 'Save'. I send an email, but my name is NOT displayed to the recipient.</p>
<p>I can't see any reference to 'Advanced Setup' so 'Exchange Active sync' is also not available. The only reference to 'Advanced' is 'Advanced Mailbox Settings' which does not include 'Exchange Active Sync'.&nbsp; As for Outlook.com do I need this? We've had Outlook
 Express, Outlook as part of Microsoft Office, now we have Outlook.com, would it not be possible for someone at Microsoft to invent a new name to avoid confusion. I have been trying to use 'Mail' as they seem to be doing away with wonderful Windows Live Mail.</p>
<p>As for the earlier suggestion to check updates, this is Windows 10, we have no control over updates, we get them whether we want/need them or not.</p>
<p>I should be interested to know if Microsoft have plans to uninstall Windows Live Mail during a future update session. I'm giving up the Mail app and will continue to use WLM until it's removed by which time perhaps the 'Mail' app will work.</p>

            The solution in the <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2842520" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">KB article</a> works on Windows 7, too, despite the warning you see.&nbsp;With all programs closed, use the

</p><p>Thanks Firedog but the article you refer to says this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Once Regedit starts, navigate to the&nbsp;<strong>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows Live\Communications Clients\Shared\Policies&nbsp;</strong>key and remove the entry where:<br />
<br />
The Name field =&nbsp;<strong>ssl.live.com_MBL_SSL&nbsp;</strong>and Data field =&nbsp;<strong>MBI_SSL</strong>.</li><li>Exit out of Regedit.</li></ol>
<p>AND You say any values starting with ssl in the name field!</p>
<p>(value means line or entry? &nbsp;Registry key is stuff that starts with HKEY?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT:</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my registry, under HKEY_CURRENT_USER....etc etc I could only find these:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>mail.services.live.com_MBI_SSL</strong> (in the name field) &nbsp; and <strong>
MBI_SSL</strong> &nbsp;in the data field,</p>
<p>
</p><p>so nothing that <strong>starts&nbsp;</strong>with ssl as you say, or ssl.live as the windows instructions above say!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I noticed the spelling in the kb article is MBL in the name and then changes to MBI under data!! &nbsp;An innocent/careless typo? &nbsp;Or ? &nbsp; Gee, if it is a typo then pretty slack of MS support as you dont want typos when dealing with registry, no?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I'm stumped.</p>

Yes. I pointed out the discrepancy when the article was first published, but it still hasn't been corrected many months later. That's why I suggested just looking for values whose

</p><p>Thanks for the reply, Noel. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would you believe the darn thing is up and working again just as suddenly as it went awry on me yesterday morning?! &nbsp;Maybe the 3 or 4 attempts at repairing the windows essentials programs worked, or the bug that was keeping it stuck in 'updating calender
 events' mode finally got surmounted somehow? &nbsp;I don't rightly know, that's all I can say! &nbsp;Or maybe just opening the registry window and closing it did the trick? &nbsp;Or there was one of those automatic silent updates that ironed it out? &nbsp;Could be any one or
 none of the above. &nbsp;The mysteries of computers and software! &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, unfortunately I do not have another MS mail account, though I do use the windows live mail handler program to dwnld my one @live a/c and a @yahoo mail account. &nbsp; The program usually checks the @live. mailbox first then does the yahoo second. &nbsp;Yesterday
 it was getting stuck in the first &nbsp;so there was no way to know if it would have successfully checked the other, @yahoo, one. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And from memory I believe I had this problem once before but do not recall how it was resolved then (through repair programs in control panel maybe?). &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I've got your expertise I might as well ask you a question. &nbsp;when I opened the regedit window there were other 'keys' in the left pane below the windows live folder/stage &nbsp;<strong>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>which were labeled <strong>windows live mail</strong> and <strong>windows mail</strong>. &nbsp;That's not connected to what we're doing? &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>O-oh, another automatic 'important update is trying to shut down my computer to finish install. &nbsp; better send this off.</p>
<p>Cheers and thanks again.</p>

            <p>It's good to hear you're up and running again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will usually only see server error 3204 when that rogue registry entry is present, so it's not clear why it disappeared.&nbsp;There is some interaction between Windows and the live.com servers that puts it there for some users; I once suspected that the change
 at the server was caused by accessing the same account via EAS from a tablet or smart phone, but that seems not to be the case. Anyhow, a reboot or two often helps.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other keys you saw in the registry contain settings for the two programs Windows Live Mail and Windows Mail. You won't normally have to have anything to do with them. It can be quite dangerous poking around in the registry when you're not absolutely
 sure of what you're doing.</p>

            <p>To all who may have come here with a similar problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you may have read above, the problem (error message and inability for win. live mail to download or upload mail) &nbsp;went away just as suddenly one day after it appeared. &nbsp;The reason is unknown and it could also have been due to a bug in a recent update
 of Windows Essentials which was then corrected with another automatic update. &nbsp;Or it could have been the several attempts at repairing the windows essentials programs, though I must say after going through each time there was no immediate results despite several
 re-boots. </p>
<p>
</p><p><span>All I can say is that if you have the same problem do eveything that has been attempted here as well as the suggestions by firedog
<strong>and</strong>&nbsp; also allow for 24 hours or so to elapse to see if you get the same result as me, namely for everything to go back to working again.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Good luck.</span></p>

    <title>Receiving IDE Device Failed ECC circuitry error during boot-up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> 4evergrateful  say:</h3>
<h2>            Receiving IDE Device Failed ECC circuitry error during boot-up</h2>
                    I have a Dell Dimension 2400 PC.&nbsp; The Dell monitor recently quit working and emitted a strange odor.&nbsp; I replaced it with a Samsung EX2220.&nbsp; Since replacing, I have been having problems at boot up.&nbsp; I get a message that Primary Drive 0 is not found.&nbsp; I
 ran diagnostics and got "IDE Device Failed ECC circuitry error."&nbsp; When I tried booting from diskette, it failed as well - "Exception occurred in module DISK.MDM! No line mapping found!"&nbsp; I have been able to get it started eventually (opened up the cover, removed
 all devices, etc.) but it takes quite a while.&nbsp; I haven't turned it off in several days because I fear that it will still have problems.&nbsp; It has been running fine; therefore, I don't think there's a problem with the hard drive.&nbsp; I was also unable to get it
 to start in safe mode.&nbsp; I would press the F8 key but kept getting keyboard failure.&nbsp; I would appreciate any advice on how to proceed with this problem!&nbsp;

<p>Hi 4EverGrateful,</p>
<p>We first recommend you to cross check if the IDE cables are connected correctly to their respective connectors on the mother board.</p>
<p>Try the following steps and check the result.<br />
<strong>Step 1:</strong> Change the first boot device priority to hard drive in BIOS<br />
a. Start your computer, press delete button continuously to see BIOS screen.<br />
b. Change the first boot device priority to hard drive.<br />
c. Press F10 to save the settings and restart the computer.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Modifying BIOS/complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the
 configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</p>

<p>What error message, if any, do you receive when the update fails to install?</p>
<p>If you haven't already, try downloading the update in a <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
clean boot state</a>. Sometimes software conflicts can interfere with Windows Updates.</p>

            Hi Arthur,
<br />
<br />If you are running Windows 10 Pro, you will have access to Group Policy and can stop Windows Update from updating your GPU driver altogether, please see the article below: 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/263851/how-to-prevent-windows-from-automatically-updating-specific-drivers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/263851/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />If you are running Windows 10 Home, then the only thing you can do is hide these updates for that device 
<br />
<br />Download the tool from the link below, run that, in the list of pending updates, select that update and click 'Hide' that will stop windows from attempting to install it: 
<br />
<br /><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>

<p>And, of course, I have the Home Edition :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried that tool but it looks like it will be quicker to just rollback the driver every time Windows does an update.</p>

<p>I've noticed lately, a very annoying issue.</p>
<p>I always choose the option to keep me logged in on this website. However, it fails completely. I close the tab? Sign in again.</p>
<p>The other annoying part is: Each area of Xbox.com makes me re-log in. Happens at live.xbox.com, support.xbox.com, forums.xbox.com as well as marketplace.xbox.com. Why does each of those require a new log in to my account?</p>

<h2>            Free Agent Service.exe  Application error</h2>
                    When I shut down my computer I get the following message: Free Agent Service.exe&nbsp; Application Error: The instruction at "0xffffffff" could not be read. I am not sure of the number of "f's", I think it is 8. My computer is running very slow and I am having
 a hard time logging into a bridge game on yahoo. About 2 weeks ago, I turned on my computer the first thing in the morning and I got a welcome to Explorer 8 page,&nbsp;not my usual display, etc.&nbsp;My e-mails, pictures, documents, etc. were all missing. I could not
 find outlook express. To make a long story short, it was a disaster. I called my son-in-law, the family computer expert. He was able to get into my computer remotely and found everything but it was not in the correct place. He told me to get an external hard
 drive and copy everything before it disappears forever which I did. I started trying to copy everything into its correct place but did not have time to do everything. I shut down the computer that night. I turned it on the next morning and everything was fine
 and in the correct place. But ever since then&nbsp;my&nbsp;computer has been slower than a snail. It is driving me crazy. My son-in-law is too busy to help me right now. What is wrong and how can I fix it?<br />
Thanks for any help you can give me

            Free Agent Service would have been installed on your PC once you would have connected your External Seagate Hard disk to your computer,<br />
Go to Add Remove Programs and remove the Free Agent Program(may start with "Seagate"), post that, do a restart of the system and then check whether everything is ok or not.<br />
Do post the results, incase this does not helps, we will try something else.

            Did you lose the Seagate functionality? I have the Seagate FreeAgent backup disk and I am having the same closing difficulties, but I don't want to lose the backup capability Seagate offers with this tool.<br />
Thanks.<br />

    <title>Remote Access Scam&#63;&#63;&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Remote Access Scam&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've read through these "Microsoft Impersonator Scams" and have found some useful information.&nbsp; My 86 year old mother-in-law just got scammed.&nbsp; She put in the website (all she remembers is www.??? and then clicked a few things they told her to but they asked
 too much and she got totally flustered and told them she'd have to get a friend to help and they got annoyed so she hung up.&nbsp; Likely TOO LATE.&nbsp; To top it off, she then proceeded to go in to check her bank account???!!!&nbsp; IF they had gained remote access to
 her computer could they see the password, etc. that she was putting in, and could they access her bank??&nbsp; I had her cancel her VISA and debit card but now my concern is all the other accounts that she pays through the bank and all those accounts that have
 account numbers showing when you go in via the computer to pay them.&nbsp; Can they actually get all those account information too and does she need to cancel all that too?&nbsp; The unfortunate part is that I am in Toronto area and she is in Kingston, Ontario so I'm
 trying to help her out via the telephone.&nbsp; ALSO, do we need to contact all of her contacts - can they access any of their information if they email her?&nbsp; Thanks for any advise and help you can provide.&nbsp;

They probably can.<br />
could they access her bank??</span><br />
They probably can.<br />
Can they actually get all those account information too</span><br />
Yes<br />
does she need to cancel all that too?</span><br />
No.<br />
Do we need to contact all of her contacts - can they access any of their information if they email her?</span><br />
Yes<br />
<br />
It all depends on how sophisticated the scam is. If this had happened to my own mother then I would do this:<br />
<ul>
<li>Suspend all Internet banking access immediately.<br />
</li><li>Ask the bank to reset all Internet banking passwords.<br />
</li><li>Back up all personal information to an external medium.<br />
</li><li>Restore the PC to factory condition.</li><li>Restore all personal information.</li><li>Restore Internet banking access.</li><li>Notify all contacts in her address book of the event.</li></ul>
<br />
This is not something that you can do by remote support. Someone competent needs to be in Kingston in front of the PC.<br />
<br />
Your mother in law should also review her Internet banking security level. The one I currently use relies on two independent channels. Each time I make a payment to a new recipient (as opposed to a pre-existing recipient), I need to type in a 6-digit code that
 arrives by SMS on my mobile phone. It would require a very high degree of sophistication for a scammer to break into a PC and at the same time intercept an SMS transmitted to a mobile phone.<br />

<p>Rich, </p>
<p>Re: 8007007E = FileNotFoundException <br />
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>The solution is in the error message "...FileNotFoundException" means there is a file missing, that is, one of the files your program depends on is not deployed.</p>
<p><br />
Run <b>SFC /Scannow</b> to make sure there is no system corruption. </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</a>&gt;&gt;

<p><br />
Run <b>CheckSUR</b> to verify there are no system packages that have become damaged.</p>

<p><b>A repair install is the usual solution of (Checksur.exe) doesn't work</b>. </p>
<p><font><i><b>If the System Update Readiness Tool does not correct the problem, you'll need to repair Windows.</b></i></font></p>

</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: It may take an hour or longer to detect and replace the incorrect data, please be patient. When it is finished, please restart the computer and run Windows Update again.</p>

<br />

Try resetting the windows update components and check if you are able to install.</p>
<p>You can reset the windows update components by referring to the article:</p>

Restart afterwards and see if the updates download now</p>
