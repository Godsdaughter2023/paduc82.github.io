<h2>            Wireless Display Adapter Lag Issues</h2>
                    <p>Hi there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently purchased the Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter and hooked it up to my Samsung TV. I'm trying to project to it from my HP Envy Recline 23, but while it found it and connected to it with no problem, the connection is not good. Both video and audio
 lag and stutter a lot, which renders the device useless. It should be noted that the PC and the TV are in the same room, fairly close.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC has both a an Intel HD Graphics 4600 chipset and an Nvidia GeForceGT 730A video card, both with the latest drivers installed. It also has a Ralink RT3290 802.11bgn Wi-Fi adapater. According to Windows Update, it has the latest driver (5.0.37) installed,
 but I found a newer one (5.0.46) on the internet. After I installed it, though, my machine wouldn't find the Wireless Display Adapter, so I reverted back to the older version. Lag issues persist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help?</p>

            <p>Actually, I found the solution!</p>
<p>
</p><p>For those of you with the same problem: Apparently, the problem WAS interference from my router - keep in mind that the Wireless Display Adapter doesn't use wi-fi, but its own wireless connection with the computer. The trick is to set your router to broadcast
 in a different channel from the one it's currently using, but to stick to channels 1, 6 or 11 (I kept trying all the wrong ones hehe - this article explains why these particular channels should be used:&nbsp;http://www.metageek.net/support/why-channels-1-6-and-11/).</p>
<p>
</p><p>My router was using channel 1. After setting it to 6 (I haven't tried 11 yet), it stopped interfering and the WDA worked like a charm (it may be my head, but I see the slightest lag sometimes... I'll try channel 11). If you're not sure how to do this, check
 this article:&nbsp;http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/21132/change-your-wi-fi-router-channel-to-optimize-your-wireless-signal/</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps!</p>

I'm trying to install iTunes 64 bit. Getting "Could not open key" errors.<br />
Could not open key:<br />
UNKNOWN\Components\[long string]\[long string]
<div>"Verify that you have sufficient access to that key"<br />
<div>Only choice is to click OK, upon which the install continues. However the "Could not open key" error occurs 2 more times - each with a different key string.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Clicking OK continues the install until I get this error-</div>
<div>"The installer has insufficient privileges to access this directory: C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\iTunes. The installation cannot continue. Log on as administrator or contact your system administrator."</div>

<div>I am the only user and have admin privileges. I also right click the install program and select Run as administrator and still get the same errors.</div>

    <title>Configuration Registry Corrupted&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alexfaucheux  say:</h3>
<h2>            Configuration Registry Corrupted&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, so recently I had to download iTunes on my computer so I can put some music on my friend's iPod.&nbsp; I noticed when iTunes installed, it rolled back the installation of AMS (Apple Mobile Support) driver.&nbsp; Because of this, I was not able to connect said
 iPod to my computer.&nbsp; Anyhow, I found the driver and tried to install it manually, only to give me the error message "Installation Failed: Configuration Registry Corrupted".&nbsp; That rose a red flag, so I ran registry cleanups and sfc, which neither found any
 issues with the registry.&nbsp; But the issue is not longer just the iPod, it is any USB drive connected.&nbsp; When I connect my SanDisk Ultra USB drive, I am given a prompt that it is ready to use, but it is not listed with the other devices preventing me from accessing
 it.&nbsp; Disk management does not even list the drive as a possible mount, and under device management, it tells me that no driver is installed for the drive. So I tell it to update the driver.&nbsp; Once my computer restarts, I try to access my USB drive, only to
 find out that I am no further than I was earlier: Still not listed with the other drives, still not listed in disk management, and still has the error symbol in device management.&nbsp; So, I decided to connect another USB drive, and it still had the exact same
 result.&nbsp; With both connected to my computer, neither showed up as accessible, and both had error symbol in device management.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS. The exact same result happens with the iPod device.&nbsp; Not listed with the other devices, not listed in disk management, and when I try to update the driver for it, it tells me that AMS needs to be installed before the iPod driver is installed, which AMS
 refuses to install.&nbsp; The drivers for the other USB's claims to install correctly and restarts my computer, but it does nothing to change the outcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone could help me, that would be great!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additional info in case needed:</p>
<p>OS: Windows 7 upgraded to Windows 10</p>
<p>Computer make/model: HP Pavilion dv7</p>
<p>If you need computer specs, I can list them but I don't know why you would need them</p>

    <title>All of a sudden 2 Different Headsets for XBOX One S Wired Controller - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> damonte33pallywog  say:</h3>
<h2>            All of a sudden 2 Different Headsets for XBOX One S Wired Controller stopped working Cant UnMute Known Issue With no solutions</h2>
                    <p>Ihave a Turtle Beach and a Brand New Sades Head Set. &nbsp;When I got them on Christmas I plugged themboth in and My Wife and I were Playing Diablo 3 and they were both producing Sound. &nbsp;It was great. &nbsp;The next day wehn I plugged my new Sades Head Set into my
 controller to play Arkham Knight it wasnt producing Sound. &nbsp;I tried my turtle BEach on the same controller and it wasnt proucing Sound all of a sudden. &nbsp;I tried them both on my brand new wireless Xboxx One S Controller and they both stopped working there as
 well. &nbsp;I tried my Sades HeadPhones on my Ipad Pro and they worked really Well booming sound. &nbsp;The Microphone Icon with the line through it indicating mute or no mic is in the top corner of the screen. &nbsp;I cant seem to get it to go away. &nbsp;I researched this online
 and there seem to be a alot of people who are having the same problem. &nbsp;No one knows how to fix it. I spent Multithousands of dollars buying everything for my XBOX ONE S and getting over 178 Games. &nbsp;Now this issue makes it so I cannot play Xbox Live Gmes that
 allow Chat. &nbsp;It is frustrating because I fully commited to the Xbox Brand and got everything and now I can not interact or hear sound when I use any of my head phones. &nbsp;Is there anything else I can try before I give up on Interactive Online Play and sound
 through my wired Head sets forever or until I get mynext generation Console PS5 or Anaconda. &nbsp;Xbox’s Cutomer Service Support on this particular HEad Set Issue will determine if I get a Play Station next time or a Switch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>DOes anyone have anything I can try to tryand unmute the Headphones? &nbsp;I need to get rid of the Microphone with the line throughit icon on the upper righthand corner of the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Thank you for your response. &nbsp;I followed your directions exactly and my Headphones have no sound still the microphone icon in the upper right hand corner of the screen has the slash through it to indicate that it is muted. &nbsp;I tried starting a party and it
 says “We cant find a microphone for these people”. Go to device settings I go to device settings and I update the controller with the headset plugged into the controller jack. &nbsp;When I go down the list of the menu the one that says Volume or headset volume
 does not light up when I push to it on the directional pad but the other options work when I click on them.</p>
<p>Again I would like to thank you for your attempt at fixing my problem I really appreaciate it.What I have heard is that this is a known flaw with XBOX ONE S and XBOX One X Wired JAck Controllers. &nbsp;No one can explain why. &nbsp;</p>
<p>One person said they opened it up and bent the contacts but both my 6 month old controller and my newer unused controllers worked on hristmas with both headsets. &nbsp;Then after Christmas they both stopped working on both controllers after working fine the day
 before. &nbsp;I have heard that this is a known unfixable issue that MIcrosoft knows about but isnt addressing</p>
<p>If anyone can help me fix it I will be extremely Impressed and grateful. If there is no fix then I will need to buy a Playstation or a Switch which is a bummer because I fully commited to the Xbox One Brand and got 175 Plus Games.</p>
<p>

<p>Thanks for sharing Yes it is extremely frustrating that this major flaw is not being addressed by Xbox I am surprised that this glaring design flaw is not being addressed by Xbox word is that they dont know how to fix it. &nbsp;Its too bad When I boughtmy xbox
 one S Assumed microsoft would be able to fix something like this or at least stand by their product. &nbsp;I am hoping that they &nbsp;respond to me as I have spent thoysands if dollars investing in Xbox ganes and hardware. And two headsets. &nbsp;Has anyone else on here
 had this issue?</p>
<p>

</p><blockquote>Try an xbox headset adapter and their is official headset stereo too, I intent to buy tomorrow after having spoke with an agent this evening.
</blockquote>
<p>Is there a headset adapter for the xbox one s wired controller? &nbsp;My understanding was there wasnt. &nbsp;If there is please met me know I could try that. &nbsp;What us it called? Or are you talkimv about the furst generation xbox one controllers? &nbsp;I have the second
 generation controllers all of my cbox hardware is kess than a year old. I bought it brand new.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would think that an official headset might work but two days ago my turtle beach and the Saddes Headset I got for christmas were both working perfectly on both xbox one s controllers simultaneously. &nbsp;The next morning both stopped working and didnt work
 on either controller when I tried both headsets. &nbsp;This leads me to belueve this is a orobkem with the controllers or my XBoxOne S.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your feedback I hope Xbox Has a fix for this so I can a tually enjoy my Xbox LivecAccount and my 175 Plus Games&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks Happy Holidays&nbsp;</p>

<p>Do you have a Microsoft store near where you live? If so then you could consider taking your headsets, controllers and the console there and ask them to help you troubleshoot your components. Try your headsets with their controllers, your controllers with
 their console and your headset etc until you've gone through the various combinations to try and figure out where the fault is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would definitely be unusual for two different controllers to develop the exact same fault at the same time. AFAIK, the headset detection is based on sensing a headset being plugged into the 3.5mm jack of the controller or chatpad or headset adapter jack.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a work experience with a similar type of issue years ago (3.5mm mic jacks and different mic plugs which damaged the mic jacks), it could be possible that a headset plug is damaging the jacks however one would need a micrometer to measure plug diameters
 of an official Microsoft headset and the third party headsets to determine if that is a possibility. If they are all the same diameter then it shouldn't matter which type of stereo headset is being plugged into the 3.5mm stereo headset jack.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if it isn't a jack/plug problem, then it leaves the electronics in the controller and/or the console. Unfortunately this is where Microsoft has to step in and provide their troubleshooting expertise as we have no insight as to what is going on at that
 level.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck!</p>

<p>Thanks all for your response.&nbsp; Unfortunately I don't have a store near me. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just spent over 2hrs chatting to support.&nbsp; He had me testing multiplayer connection, asked me if my tv was on mute, update the controller for the 3rd time, blamed the controller, blamed the headset then the retailer.&nbsp; He then told me to try a factory
 reset, which I was concerned about doing as I was worried my son would lose all his Fortnite extras, however he assured me that wont be the case.&nbsp; Did the factory reset &amp; how I wish I never opened that can of worms.&nbsp; Struggling now to get into accounts &amp; just
 to top it all off the mute icon in the top corner is still there &amp; the agent I was speaking to cut me off because I never responded to him within 3 mins of my last message to him.&nbsp; Argh!!!&nbsp; Well, tomorrows another day to sort this mess out. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Sorry to hear you are having a hard time trying to resolve your muted mic option. It looks like you'll have to wait for Microsoft to release a console or controller update to fix the issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>An alternative fix might be to get a Microsoft Chatpad or Headset adapter as the 3.5mm jacks in those don't appear to be having the same muted mic issue that the controllers are having.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck!</p>

<h2>            Sound Audio Playback Echo on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>OT- unwanted sound echo</p>
<p>Hello, I don't understand the new settings at all- it doesn't show anything that I actually need to see. I want to disable the strange echo/surround sound effect that I have, no matter what playback I disable or configure or whatever setting I change related
 to sound, this echo doesn't go away. I'm starting to get frustrated over this.</p>

            <p>Hi. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I had what I think is&nbsp;the same problem, and I used your March 2016 instructions, Arul, to resolve the problem, though the steps I did seemed like they wouldn't have any effect. I was happily surprised when the problem was fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be clear, here's the problem I had:</p>
<p>
</p><p>When my Dell Latitude laptop is docked, it played audio through its internal speakers in addition to any external speakers or headphones that were plugged into either the audio jack on the docking station or the laptop itself. However, it played the audio
 on the external device&nbsp;on a slight delay from the internal speakers&nbsp;-- less than a second, but enough to really garble spoken word and drive me a little nuts.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what I did. I went into Control Panel &gt; Troubleshooting &gt; Troubleshoot audio playback. From that window, it suggested I would need to "Open enhancements" and do some manipulation in there. I clicked "Open enhancements" and it brought me to a window
 that looked identical to one I've spent much time in already -- Audio device options. It was set on "Headphones (Realtek High Definition Audio)" (I have a Dell laptop.)&nbsp;I left all the settings in there alone, and OK'd out of the window. The troubleshooting
 wizard said a restart of Windows was needed. I closed the troubleshooting wizard, and then Windows brought up this message that made me think the problem wasn't really fixed:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Troubleshooting has completed. Troubleshooting was unable to automatically fix all of the issues found. You can find more details below. Problems found: Audio device isn't set as default - Not fixed; Audio enhancements didn't load - Fixed."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Imagine my surprise when a restart did the trick. </p>

<h2>            Windows 7 won&#39;t activate after clean install and several upgrades to my computer.</h2>
                    
<p>I bought a copy of Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit.&nbsp; I installed it running my old hardware but found Windows 7 hogged too many resources.&nbsp; When there was enough money kicking around to upgrade my computer a couple months later I did so (new motherboard cpu
 and ram).&nbsp; Windows 7 wouldn't boot normally or in safe mode, my old XP installation wouldn't boot normally but would boot in safe mode.&nbsp; So I reinstalled Windows 7 with a clean install (reformatted my hard drive) and it works great but now it won't activate!&nbsp;
 It says I need to type in a different product key because the product key I typed cannot be used to activate Windows on my computer.</p>
<p>I understand the need to fight piracy but&nbsp;the thought&nbsp;I can't upgrade my computer without buying another product key is rediculous!&nbsp; Is there any solutions to this problem?</p>

<p>Activate manually.&nbsp; It's detecting your prior installation and seeing this as an attempt to install the product on another computer.&nbsp; This is a common occurrence.</p>
<p><span>To manually activate, go to start, search box and type in slui 4 and enter.&nbsp; Enter your country and press next.&nbsp; You'll be on a screen with a phone number and
 a bunch of codes at the bottom.&nbsp; Call the number and wade through the automated prompts until you reach a human.&nbsp; Have your product code handy as it will be requested.&nbsp; Explain the situation but it's the same PC and only installed on that one PC.&nbsp; They should
 give you a code to enter on that screen to activate the operating system.</span></p>
<p><span>I hope this helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>
<p><span>If this doesn't work (these procedures are for Vista but I'm assuming they will work with Windows7), then repost your questiion in the Windows7 Forums at:<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7install/threads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7install/threads</a>&nbsp;where

<h2>            PC has downloaded 19 updates on Windows 8, but when I restart the install hangs and never gets past the first update.</h2>
                    Not sure why it's doing this.&nbsp; If I go into the Control Panel it says there are 19 updates available.&nbsp; If I try to run "Install Now" it comes back with an error saying that "Installer is currently running" and to try later.&nbsp; I looked at the updates and
 they are all Office related, are there any known issues with Office updates in Win 8 that cause the installer to fail?

            <p>Sorry, due to frustration didn't think to put that info on the post.</p>
<p>Samsung RF511</p>
<p>Windows 8 Pro upgrade from Win 7 Home Premium</p>
<p>Intel core I5-2410M 2.30 GHz</p>
<p>64bit</p>
<p>6GB RAM</p>
<p>Nvidia GeForce GT 540M (Intel HD Graphics 3000)</p>
<p>Windows Defender/Firewall</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After posting I thought about moving out of the online sign in and switched to a local account since I was reading on other post this can cause issues sometimes.&nbsp; This at least allowed me to view the install process and see which install was hanging.&nbsp; It
 looks like KB2553290 was the culprit and was holding up the install.&nbsp; Plus, when I rebooted from local account it installed an addtional 16 updates not including the 19 that I was seeing.&nbsp; Not sure if this was causation or correlation.&nbsp; When I went to run
 installer again manually it started updating, but it hung up on a Service Pack 1 for Office 2010.&nbsp; This is a large update, but it sat for over an hour and when I checked the Task Manager the installer was completely idle.&nbsp; I am going to try it again and see
 if it will install.&nbsp; Things seem to be moving in the right direction at this point, but I am not out of the woods yet.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please answer&nbsp;<em>each&nbsp;of the following </em>[admittedly tedious]<em>&nbsp;diagnostic questions</em> in a correspondingly-numbered list in your very next reply (no need to quote this post):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1a. When (approx. date) did you purchase <em>the Win7 computer?</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1b. When (exact date, preferably) did you upgrade to Win8?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. What anti-virus application or security suite was installed on <em>the Win7 computer</em>&nbsp;and did you uninstall it &amp; reboot before you upgraded to Win8?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3a. Has a Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer
<em>since you bought it</em>? [1]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3b. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [pick one] come preinstalled on
<em>the Win7&nbsp;computer</em> <em>when you bought it?</em> (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Assuming Office 2010 was installed <em>on the Win7 computer</em>, had SP1 ever been offered by Windows Update before you upgraded to Win8?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Are you or have you ever been in the habit of using "Registry cleaners" (e.g., Registry Mechanic; System Mechanic; RegCure; RegClean Pro; Advanced SystemCare; Registry Booster; McAfee QuickClean; AVG PC TuneUp; Norton Registry Cleaner; PCTools Optimiser;
 SpeedUpMyPC; PC Doctor; TuneUp Utilities; WinMaximizer; WinSweeper; Comodo System Cleaner; Advanced System Optimizer;
<em>CCleaner Registry Cleaner</em>)?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1a.&nbsp; July 2010</p>
<p>1b.&nbsp; Oct 28th</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Avast and no.</p>
<p>3a.&nbsp; Yes, Norton</p>
<p>3b. Yes, Norton</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Win 7 was completely up to date with all updates before upgrading to Win 8 Pro.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; No</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Added Note:&nbsp; I did a PC Refresh using Win 8 after the upgrade which unistalled all previous apps.&nbsp; Then I reinstalled Avast and was having issues with IQRL driver issues and BSOD.&nbsp; Uninstalled Avast and everything seemed to start working until this issue
 popped up.</p>

            <p>So just to update where I am at now on this issue, I have gotten all of the 19 updates to install now except for three of them.&nbsp; Each one of these, even when installed individually manually, will make Windows Update freeze up and stop responding, I have
 verified this through Task Manager.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Service Pack 1 for Office 2010 KB2510690 32 bit</p>
<p>Update for Microsoft OneNote 2010 KB2553290 32 bit</p>
<p>Update for Microsoft OneNote 2010 KB2589345 32 bit</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried shutting off Windows Firewall to see if that was causing an issue, but it still froze up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other than these three updates, everything else is installing&nbsp;normally. I noticed Windows Defender updated overnight&nbsp;and I was able to install a new driver this morning&nbsp;that was available for my&nbsp;Nvidia card.&nbsp; At least now we seem to be narrowed down to these
 three specific updates that are causing&nbsp;the issue.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mr. Fix-It you sent me to will not run on Win 8.&nbsp; When I get to the point to choose between default or aggressive and try to run in default it stops and says "This Microsoft Fix it does not apply to your operating system or application version." and
 proceeds to shut down and gives no option to continue forward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any other ideas??</p>

            <p>Yes, I did use the desktop version when I tried to run the app.&nbsp; Today when I tried again to see if the updates would install I did get a new error code, 80040016.&nbsp; When I looked this up on Answers I found a different Fix it that says it repairs Windows
 Updater when it won't install updates.&nbsp; It went through and said it found several&nbsp;issues, fixed some but failed to fix others.&nbsp; I rebooted and ran it again and then that time it said it fixed everything.&nbsp; I rebooted again and I tried installing the Service
 Pack again, but it still failed to install.&nbsp; I am thinking maybe something is corrupted in Office and that is why I cannot get the update to install.&nbsp; It makes no sense that everything else updates, but not these three.&nbsp; I installed another Windows Defender
 definition files update with no issue just a few minutes ago.&nbsp; This is really frustrating, the only thing I can think to do at this point is uninstall Office and start from scratch again.&nbsp; Thoughts?</p>

            <p>It may have been too late for the Norton Removal Tool to "come to the rescue" here. Ideally, you would have run it
<em>before </em>you upgraded to Win8.&nbsp;That being said...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you install Office 2010 before or after you upgraded to Win8?&nbsp;...and if before, had Office 2010 SP1 ever been offered via Windows Update while you were still running Win7?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS: Thanks for being my "guinea pig" in testing Fix It 50202 on a Win8 computer. That being said, the Norton "leftovers" may have been playing a role here, too, so the jury's still out as far as I'm concerned.</p>

<h2>            Slow USB 3.0 in Windows 8</h2>
                    I'm getting very slow write speeds of about 25mb/s in Windows 8. I have the latest USB 3.0 drivers for my ASROCK motherboard installed. This happens on all USB 3.0 ports. I had no problem getting around 100-150mb/s in Windows 7. Any ideas on what might
 fix it?

            <p>Hi Fate,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems that, you need more information to work on slow write speed, refer to the following information and check the issue status.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to follow the methods provided to fix the issue:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1: Run the maintenance troubleshooter.</span></b></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps to run the troubleshooter:<br />
a. Open Search by swiping in from the right edge of the screen (or if you're using a mouse, pointing to the upper-right corner of the screen and moving the mouse pointer down), and then tapping or clicking Search.<br />

            Hey thanks for your help but none of these solutions worked. I even tried installing the Windows 7 USB 3.0 extensible host drivers and it's still not reaching USB 3.0 speeds. I looked in device manager and it shows that my flash drive is connected to the
 USB 3.0 host but it refuses to hit full speeds. There's just something about Windows 8 that's preventing me from using this flash drive at max speeds.

<p>After my conputer install updates from Microsoft and it restarts, my desktop gets completely&nbsp;&lt;removed&gt; up. Also and error message appears on the screen and I have to restart my computer everytime. I dont know why this happens. Its a Windows 7. The desktop
 look like a very old classic theme of Windows XP i guess. This is&nbsp;&lt;removed&gt; and Microsoft or Windows should really do something about this. I tried to take a snap shot if the desktop but i wouldnt let me do anything.</p>

            Umm' I called TOSHIBA and they told me to take the battery off the laptop, place it back in and restart the system. This fixed my theme and its been working properly now, but everytime It updates the theme messes up... so i have to repeat the battery and
 restart thing everytime this thing updates. The Aero thing did not find any Issues.

Just wanted to let everyone know that I managed to get the Netgear&nbsp;WN111v2 to work with Windows 8. All I did was plug in the WN111v2,&nbsp;connect to the web via an ethernet cable and ran Windows Update. It found the USB adapter and downloaded the driver!

    <title>Need help connecting to an Xfinity hotspot via macbook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> salmonthecolor  say:</h3>
<h2>            Need help connecting to an Xfinity hotspot via macbook</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>A few months ago I followed a tutorial about how to connect to Xbox Live through a macbook hooked up to an Xbox with an ethernet cord. I could connect to Xbox Live for a while but recently it stopped working. There is a Comcast Xfinity hotspot near my house
 that I use for internet and that I used to use for Xbox Live before it stopped working. I've tried a bunch of different tutorials around the web but none of them have fixed my problem. So far I've only gotten my Xbox to connect to the network and not the Internet,
 and that only happens when I set the IP Address of my ethernet cord on my macbook to the same as the Gateway on my xbox. I know the IPv4 addresses for Comcast's DNS servers but how should I configure the rest my network settings on my macbook and Xbox so that
 my Xbox can connect to the Xfinity network through my macbook? i.e. what should the IP Address, Subnet Mask, and Gateway on my Xbox be and what should the IP Address, Subnet Mask, and Router options in the network settings of my Macbook (<a href="http://imgur.com/3R1809O" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://imgur.com/3R1809O</a>)
 be?</p>

            <p>Hey there, SalmonTheColor! I'm very sorry to see any issues with connecting through your Macbook! I do see that it was working previously; hopefully we can figure out what is going on!</p>
<p>The way you are set up, we generally don't suggest. Connecting through a wifi that isn't your own can cause its own issues, and going through a computer connection through an ethernet cable only works about half the time. Computers aren't designed to be routers full time, and the Xbox sometimes decides that it's not going to recognize that set up anymore. I am assuming that when you connect to the Xfinity hotspot with your Xbox, you are unable to do so because of the way it needs to connect via a webpage. Would I be correct?</p>
<p>My main suggestion is to start from the beginning. Reset all of the network options that you have on your Macbook back to defaults. Then follow he tutorials you had found previously.</p>
<p>If that doesn't work for you, or you've already tried that, I would make sure your console isn't having issues in general by taking it another internet connection. If it can connect up just fine with that, then I suggest <a href="https://www.apple.com/support/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">contacting Apple support</a>, as they may be able to assist you better with setting up that internet sharing option. If it doesn't work, then something is likely wrong with your console, and I suggest using our <a href="http://myservice.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Online Service Center</a> to set up a repair for you.</p>
<p>Our community in the networking forums are pretty awesome people. There may be a member that has more experience with Macs that may be able to better assist you if you do not want to reach out to Apple support. Hopefully one of these options gets you all sorted and you can enjoy your Xbox Live soon! :)</p>

    <title>Sync Center not allowing me to select what to sync - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Sync Center not allowing me to select what to sync</h2>
                    <p>About a week ago, my Sync Center started reporting an error syncing one file. &nbsp;The file no longer existed in Offline nor Network, and there was no option to fix it (even that produced an error). &nbsp;To fix the problem, I attempted to unsync everything and get
 a clean sync. &nbsp;For some reason, I could not select the original top level network drive to sync (basically, my "home" or personal "H:" drive) as before, so I attempted to sync the individual folders under it. &nbsp;I selected the first folder in the list, right
 clicked, and checked "Always available offline". &nbsp;The green sync icon appeared on the folder. &nbsp;Then I attempted to add the next folder, but the selection is not "sticking". &nbsp;No check mark on the drop down, and no green sync icon on the folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Need to reset and start again. &nbsp;How?</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Start menu is not updating Most Used list, etc... - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Start menu is not updating Most Used list, etc...</h2>
                    <p>I installed fresh Windows 10 Education on my computer and I just noticed two things strange about Windows:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;The Open settings icon is a black box although it functioned fine</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a67530fe-966a-4240-9bd5-11073cd1810d" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. The Start menu is not updating Most used list, Recently added list...</p>
<p>When right click a program and select Pin to start, I do not see the program showing up in Start menu.</p>
<p>When I go to Settings Personalization Start , then turn the switches on and off, I do not see the Start menu getting an update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I change any of the switches to on/off, I have to restart my computer to see the update in Start menu, the same goes for Most used list, Recent List...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions ?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

uninstalling KAV W10 start menu runs perfectly again on my laptop<br />
<br />
start screen not updating is a know issue with KAV 2016 (<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">or previous&nbsp;builds</span>)&nbsp;and kaspersky labs have promised an update to fix the problem<br />

Thank you for visiting the Microsoft Answers community forum.<br />
<br />
If this problem just started about a week ago I would recommend doing a system restore back to just prior to when the problem started.&nbsp; Here's how:<br />
<br />
To restore the operating system to an earlier point in time, follow these steps: <br />
Click Start, type system restore in the Start Search box, and then click System Restore in the Programs list.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click Continue.
<br />
In the System Restore dialog box, click Choose a different restore point, and then click Next.<br />
In the list of restore points, click a restore point that was created before you began to experience the issue, and then click Next.
<br />
Click Finish.<br />
The computer restarts, and the system files and settings are returned to the state that they were in at the time that the restore point was created.<br />
<br />
If that does not work, or you don't have a restore point for the right time period, try running the system file checker to see if any system files are corrupted:<br />
To run the System File Checker tool, follow these steps: <br />
Click Start, and then type cmd in the Start Search box.<br />
Right-click cmd in the Programs list, and then click Run as administrator. <br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click Continue<br />
At the command prompt, type the following line, and then press ENTER:<br />
sfc /scannow<br />
When the scan is complete, test to see whether the issue that you are experiencing is resolved.<br />
<br />
Let us know if this helps or if you still need assistance.<br />
Thank you,<br />

    <title>Some Apps &#38; Games force to close when at 125&#37; DPI - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ryonhirasawa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Some Apps &#38; Games force to close when at 125&#37; DPI</h2>
                    So it's been bothering me lately that I can't use apps nor play games that are old, examples being Star Wars Battlefront II (2005), Star Wars Rogue Squadron, Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds Yume Nikki, Puyo Puyo 3, and PoD Gold due to their low resolution.
 (Actually, any game with a resolution lower than 1920x1080 will be closed FORCEFULLY)<br />
<br />
Now, 125% DPI is the most comfortable I'm with for my laptop, but it's the only thing that causes trouble with the system.<br />
Whenever I open PoD, for example, it loads as normal, but then it closes itself to the desktop, forcing me to click on the taskbar many times only for it to close and close. When at 100% DPI, the problem doesn't happen.<br />
<br />
I'm very certain I was able to access all of these games and apps before the April Update, and afterwards, it sickens me that I can't even use these properly. Is there a way to be able to use 125% DPI and not make a fuss with these?<br />
<br />
And no, the Compatibility settings aren't helping with the issue either. So I don't know what to do.<br />
<br />
Edit: So I found a rather ridiculous "solution" - as the app opens, flail the cursor randomly and it loads as normal. (What the heck)

<p>I use the 'Advanced' option and have 125 on one machine and 130 on the other machine (1440p monitor).</p>
<p>However I am on a desktop machine, and while I don't have any of the games you listed I do recall having a couple
</p>
<p>games that are limited to low 4:3 aspect ratio resolutions that don't launch correctly if I don't have the Compatibility option below set.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have not tried this option already.... Select - <em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Change High DPI Settings</span></em>, and tic the box next to
</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Override High DPI Scaling Behavior</span>.</em></p>
<p>( I do not have the <em>Program DPI</em> option at the top of the page selected as this may conflict with the custom DPI setting in Display)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win10 has a habit of doing this automatically on lots of games that don't need it, but tends to miss the games that do.</p>
<p>Generally when this option is required a game will not centre on the screen correctly, but I have found those few that don't launch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Failing that, it looks like your unique mouse magic may be the only way out ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>[ EDIT: Hmm, interesting. I just fired up SW-KOTR (2003) and I have it running at 1600x1200 (on my 1440p monitor).
</p>
<p>Tried it @1024x768 and still no problem, and don't have the DPI Compatibility option set for this game.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Are you using integrated graphics or a dedicated graphics card ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Have you tried changing the monitor res to match the game res ?&nbsp; ]</p>
<p>
</p><p>[ EDIT 202: So being curious about integrated graphics, I fired up SW-KOTR on IntelHD4400 and...
<em>Not</em> good.</p>
<p>I think it may have to do with the game forcing wide screen no matter if I use 1024x768 in both game and on monitor,</p>
<p>and have the Intel HD graphics set to<em> Maintain Aspect Ratio</em> (as I do with my Nvidia gpu). However, with this game I
</p>
<p>get a black screen right after the splash screens load no matter how the Display DPI is set, or if I use the Compatibility option,</p>
<p>or combinations thereof.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The going bat guano crazy thing did manage to force the game to the foreground, but only after I selected Task Manager when</p>
<p>doing the Ctrl/Alt/Delete thing. The mouse magic is not something I would want to do all the time as I managed to move my
</p>
<p>unlocked Taskbar to the left side of the screen and somehow managed to pull a game shortcut from one of my game shortcut folders</p>
<p>on the desktop, as well as launch Steam (I certainly did go bats with the mouse didn't I ? Shouldn't have been clicking while waving,</p>
<p>me thinks.)</p>

    <title>MTP Device drivers issue. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            MTP Device drivers issue.</h2>
                    <p>Hello. I am reposting my original post because even after 10 days, i got no response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently upgraded to Windows 10 Enterprise N edition. After doing so, i am not able to connect my phones to it via USB. In the device driver manager, it shows this error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"The drivers for this device are not installed. (Code 28)</p>
<p>The install class is not present or is invalid.<br />
<br />
<br />
To find a driver for this device, click Update Driver."</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a quick internet search, and trying to install Samsung Kies software, i came to the conclusion that it had something to do with the "Windows Media Feature Pack". Which i found from:&nbsp;https://www.microsoft.com/en-pk/download/details.aspx?id=48231</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even after installing this pack, the error persists. I am still not able to connect my phones to my Windows 10 pc.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The PC is custom build Core i7 (2600) with Windows 10 Enterprise N 2015 LTSB 64-bit. And no, the computer is not on any domain. I use direct internet.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>I, too, am having this problem (missing contacts) after upgrading to Windows 10. Here are the specifics...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was previously running Windows 7 Premium and using the stock Windows Live Mail (WLM) app. I'm not sure what&nbsp;that version of WLM was.&nbsp; After upgrading to Windows 10, there is a new WLM which appears to have migrated&nbsp;all of my&nbsp;mail, folder structure, and
 message rules properly. However,&nbsp;when I click the contacts button&nbsp;at the bottom of the WLM navigation pane, the folder is now empty, except for a message that says that my account has no contacts, and to sign in with a Windows Live ID for messenger or Hotmail
 to see those contacts.&nbsp; I never kept any of my contacts in messenger or Hotmail, or any other external server. All my contacts were kept locally on my PC, and everything worked great until the W10 upgrade.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, even if I can locate and import all of my contacts from the previous version of WLM, I'd rather not dump them to some cloud server where data mining bots could have access to all of my personal and/or business contacts.&nbsp; So, is it possible to find and
 migrate my contacts from Windows 7 WLM to Windows 10 WLM, and if so, can I still keep them locally and not "sync" them to the cloud or other off-site location?&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks in advance for the time and effort!&nbsp; =)

            <p>I just converted to windows 10 from 7 Home Premium. Windows 7 was rock solid, predictable, and capable. Why did I do this? All my email contacts are missing. This is super annoying. For Microsoft not to put a BIG WARNING TO BACK UP EVERYTHING FIRST is just

</p><p>Not really - the safety and security of your data is YOUR responsibility.</p>
<p>Surely it's just common sense to make a backup of all your critical data before embarking on an OS upgrade?</p>
<p>Do you make backups at all?</p>
<p>What happens if (and when) your HDD dies? Would you blame your loss of data on the HDD manufacturer?</p>

            <p>If you didn't completely reformat your system when you did the upgrade, you might still be able to recover your favorites - especially if the upgrade kept your old copy of Windows in a renamed folder.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows stores your Internet Explorer favorites in the folder:</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\Users\[username]\Favorites&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (where [username] is the name you log into Windows with)</p>
<p>
</p><p>When in doubt, check every "Favorites" folder under each username in the C:\Users folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your favorites are stored as files, which may be further organized into a folder substructure&nbsp;in the favorites folder. Once you locate your files, just move the entire content of the old favorites folder into the favorites folder of your current username
 folder in windows 10, and they should appear next time you open Internet Explorer. The only thing that won't copy is the order in which the favorites are displayed in the IE menu - you will have to re-organize them to some degree in IE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also note that Microsoft Edge (which may be your default browser in W10) has a much different (and less friendly/useful) way of displaying shortcuts/favorites that may not even use the favorites folder, so installing/setting-up IE as your default browser
 may be necessary to get your favorites back the way you like them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck!&nbsp; =)</p>

<p>
</p><p>I agree it is important to back up but it is totally irresponsible and unprofessional for Microsoft to set up an upgrade that often tampers with something so basic as contact list.&nbsp; I have fortunately lost my Categories but it should never have happened.&nbsp;
 This is a failure (again) in product development.</p>

<h2>            Windows Store &#34;Starting download&#34; loop</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I recently updated to the latest windows version (as of July 19, 2017), and am now unable to download apps from the windows store.</p>
<p>I've tried stopping and starting the BITS and Windows Update services, as well as renamed the SoftwareDistrobution folder. I've restarted my computer almost 10 times now, signed out and back in, and ran the Windows Store and Windows Update troubleshooters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happens is when I go to download any app, it will start the download, acquire the license, then give me an error, then it automatically retries to download and install the app, entering a loop that is too fast to stop without stopping the Windows Update
 service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Going back to the SoftwareDistrobution folder and looking at the ReportingEvents file shows multiple lines of [AGENT_DETECTION_FINISHED], [AGENT_INSTALLING_FINISHED], [AGENT_INSTALLING_FAILED], with the failed lines showing an error: "Windows failed to install
 the following update with error 0x80246007: Samsung Flow."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm at a loss here and just wanted to try out the Samsung Flow app, now my whole store is buggered. I would appreciate any help.</p>

            I've tried this (multiple times) as well as renaming the SoftwareDistribution folder but neither has worked for me.

<p>The Windows 10 installation folder might be corrupted or unfinished.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please try this step:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>You need to go to drive C &gt;&gt;<strong>Windows</strong> &gt;&gt;<strong>SoftwareDistribution
</strong>&gt;&gt; <strong>Download </strong>&gt;&gt; <strong>delete </strong>the all the contents of the folder.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Please take note that you can remove the contents, but not the Download folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
Get back to us with the outcome so we can help you out further.</p>
