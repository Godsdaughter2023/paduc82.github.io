            Hello RemEdwards Please follow these methods 
<br />Method 1: Ensure your RPC services are running properly
<br />“The RPC server is unavailable” problem can be caused by improper functioning of RPC service on every computers connected. You may follow the steps below to ensure that all the services related to RPC run normally.
<br />
<br />1) Press the Windows logo key and R on your keyboard to open the Run dialog. Then type “services.msc” and press Enter.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />2) On the Services window, scroll down to find the items DCOM Server Process Launcher, Remote Procedure Call (RPC) and RPC Endpoint Mapper. Ensure their status is Running and their startup is set to Automatic. 
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />3) If not, you should go to method 4 to change the related settings in Registry. 
<br />
<br />Method 2: Check the firewall on your computer
<br />Firewalls can block traffic requested by RPC and therefore cause RPC server unavailable problem. You should check your firewall configuration and see if it blocks the network connections for RPC. If you are using a third-party firewall, read its instruction or do some research about it to unblock the RPC network connections. 
<br />
<br />If you are using Windows Firewall, here are the steps of its configuration:
<br />
<br />
<br /> 
<br />1) Press the Windows logo key and R on your keyboard to open the Run dialog. Then type “control“ and press Enter. 
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />2) On Control Panel, search windows firewall. And then click Allow an app through Windows Firewall below Windows Firewall.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />3) Scroll down to find Remote Assistance. Ensure its communication is enabled (All the boxes of this item are ticked).
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Method 3: Check your network connection
<br />“The RPC server is unavailable” problem sometimes occurs because your network connection is not set properly. To check your network connection:
<br />
<br />1) Press the Windows logo key and R on your keyboard to open the Run dialog. Then type “ncpa.cpl” and press Enter. 
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />2) Right click the network connection you are using, and then select Properties.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />3) Make sure File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks and Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6) are enabled (The boxes next to these items are ticked).
<br />
<br />Method 4: Check your Registry
<br />You should check your Registry settings to make sure RPC is running properly on your computer. To check Registry:
<br />
<br />(*WARNING: Registry editing can bring about unexpected problems to your computers. It is strongly recommended that you create a system restore point and back up your registry before you proceed.)
<br />
<br />a) Log in your operating system as Administrator (Registry Editing requires Administrator Privileges).
<br />
<br />b) Press the Windows logo key and R on your keyboard to open the Run dialog. Then type “regedit“ and press Enter.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />c) When your Registry Editor is opened, navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\RpcSs. See if there is any item that does not exist as the image below shows. If there is, it is suggested that you reinstall your Windows.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />d) If you found Remote Procedure Call (RPC) was not correctly set when you tried method 1,  you can edit Start registry key in RpcSs path. Double click on Start to edit its value. Set its value data to 2.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />e) Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\DcomLaunch.  See if there is any item missing. If you found DCOM Server Process Launcher was not correctly set, double click on Start registry key to edit its value. Set its value data to 2.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />f) Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\RpcEptMapper. See if there is any item missing. If you previously found the setting of RPC Endpoint Mapper was not correct, double click on Start registry key to edit its value. Again, set its value data to 2.
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope it helps

    <title>certificate revocation check failed due to proxy usage bug on - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> luis cordeiro  say:</h3>
<h2>            certificate revocation check failed due to proxy usage bug on connection.</h2>
                    <p>For months I have tried to troubleshoot this issue with two PCs when using SSTP VPN. In no forums this was answered, instead it was always a CRL issue to everyone that tried to help; but yesterday I final realized what was the problem and I think it is a
 bug on Windows 8 (and the same for Windows 7).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The scenario to make it short is:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Windows 2008 R2 configured to accept SSTP VPN</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) Certificates correctly configured with the CRL distribution points available on the internet</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) certutil –urlfetch -verify worked fine with given service certificate running from the faulty computers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4) On this two PCs the revocation check error shows up sometimes with no explanation. On Win7 it was able to resume after 2 or 3 tries, on Win8 it stays with the error after many retries</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5)Other PCs using this same VPN do not show this error at all (win 7)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For months this was a big mystery until yesterday, this because the win7 would recover and make troubleshooting hard; only with the win8 this is was a unsolved issue and allow to pinpoint it better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reason is quite simple, and I hope this is helpful for anyone out there; also, I think Microsoft should be aware of this, but not sure how to open an official support request.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue is caused by a not very well known functionality of having specific proxy servers by connection. Usually, users configure a global proxy without knowing that a proxy can be configured by connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This means that if I have VPN connection "ABC" (lets say), I can configure it, so, when connected,&nbsp;it uses the VPN network remote proxy; so only when the VPN connection is active, only then, the proxy on the remote network is used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is very useful functionality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue is observed because the proxy can only be used after the VPN is establish; what happens is, when the VPN connection is SSTP type, it tries to use that specific "by connection" proxy before the connection is completed. This is wrong!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In other words, the SSTP connection is trying to use a proxy that is not reachable yet!!! Because of this the certificate revocation check fails (of course), and the VPN connection is not established.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although I have a workaround now, I wonder how to make this info get to Microsoft so it is fixed in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas are welcome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue is replicable easily<br />
</p>

<p>Hi Max,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The concern you have encountered may be due to a corrupted file or a misconfigured setting.<br />
<br />
You can make the text and other things like icons larger in Windows 10. You can choose to resize everything in one fell swoop or temporarily resize with the Magnifier. You can also just change the text size for certain items without affecting anything else.
 To do this, kindly follow the steps provided by <strong>Jezhel Uga</strong> on this
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-other_settings/text-and-graphics-size-in-windows-10/b72b7f21-4d92-4345-9421-2ba6507cb520">

<p>

            <div>Hi Sandeep,</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for looking into my issue. I did all but Method 2 and found no issues. I'm not wanting to take on Method 2 of changing the registry unless I confirm I have a real issue which leads me back to my initial question in my post. Should I be concerned
 about the error message I'm receiving from a manual Microsoft Update if the automated Windows 7 update is working?</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The error specifies that there is a corruption on the dll file. You can ignore the message if everything is working fine in the computer.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to follow method 2 and let me know if its occuring again. There is a fixit in the method 2. Please run the fixit.</p>

<p>Please post back with the result.</p>

            Hi Jimmy!
<br />
<br />Welcome to our community.
<br />This is Leocadia, independent community expert, and I am glad to assist you today.
<br />
<br />Sorry to hear about this situation.We would like to help you promptly. 
<br />
<br />To better assist you with this concern, we would like to know the following. Check these items for a better solution to specific symptoms:
<br />
<br />    If a blue screen error opens and you cannot continue,
<br />    If the computer locks up at random times, or shortly after turning on the computer, a hardware component might be failing. 
<br />    If lockups occur when coming out of a sleep or suspend mode, restart the computer. Adjust the power settings and update the BIOS to fix this problem. 
<br />
<br />Also,  we need to know. Before the issue started, did you install any Windows update or new software?  Have you tried logging in to safe mode, for us to see if you will get the same issue?
<br />
<br />If not, here is how to login to safe mode:
<br />
<br />    Restart your PC. When you get to the sign-in screen, hold the Shift key down while you select Power &gt; Restart.
<br />    After your PC restarts to the Choose an option screen, select Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart.
<br />    After your PC restarts, you'll see a list of options. Select 4 or F4 to start your PC in Safe Mode.
<br />
<br />Looking forward to your reply.

            Hi JIMMYGJR_77,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />
<br />How to Boot from a USB Flash Drive in Windows 10 - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-usb-drive-windows-10-pc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-...</a>
<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be a clean Install. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)
<br />

<br />
<br />If you want a very lightweight guide - Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10

<p>Thank you for your quick reply.&nbsp; I obviously will have to power off in order to reboot and get to the safe mode.&nbsp; I fear I will get a blue screed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your suggestion of a fresh install of Windows 10, however, since December 26th when I did in fact get a blue screen, Microsoft Techs had me reinstall Windows 10.&nbsp; I spent days reloading all my software only to develop another problem.&nbsp; Since
 December 26th, I have reinstalled Windows 10 three times and have spent the past three weeks again downloading all my software.&nbsp; I'm sure you understand why I am hesitant to start all over again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible that by booting to safe mode and running a troubleshooter, that the problem will be resovled?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again,</p>

            Thank you.&nbsp; I did as you suggested, however, I don't get the Windows logo but powered on and off three times.&nbsp; I came to a screen that stated I had start up problems. I was given four options, none of which was "troubleshooting."&nbsp; I chose the one that
 indicated "Start Up&nbsp;Normally"&nbsp; I was able to log on, but have not tried to sign out to see what happens.&nbsp; I would like to get into safe mode and run the troubleshooter.

<h2>            Latest Ransomware Worm Questions &#38; Concerns</h2>
                    <p>Alright so I've tried to figure this out on my own &amp; I'm just overwhelmed with uncertainties. I've searched my list of Installed Updates for: KB4012212, KB4012215 &amp; even KB3212646. None of which are installed on my Windows 7 Home SP1 system &amp; I'm not even
 sure if those are the patches I need based off what I've read <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/ms17-010.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>. The only download page for any of them I've been able to find is regarding
<a href="http://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/search.aspx?q=4012215" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
KB4012215</a>. However, as you can see there's 4 different downloads for Windows 7 with the same KB code. I've tried checking for Windows Updates manually several times over the past 2 days &amp; all it's found lately are the usual MSE definitions. My final question
 below is regarding a new PC I'll soon be building that's very much related to these concerns.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1:</strong> What specific updates does my PC need to be protected from this latest exploit?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2:</strong> Where do I download them &amp; if I likely already have installed, how do I identify to double check?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>3:</strong> Is there a way I can manually download the security patches for Windows 10 &amp; install them via a USB flash drive, before ever letting that new PC go online?</p>

    <title>PC won&#39;t boot up or start recovery console - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lonnie7  say:</h3>
<h2>            PC won&#39;t boot up or start recovery console</h2>
                    
<p>Windows XP 2004</p>
<p>AMD Athlon XP 3000+</p>
<p>AVG 8.0</p>
<p>My friend tried to jailbreak his ipod. Now his PC won't boot up the OS. It will go to screen with the options to choose to either boot up in safe, normally, last known good configuration etc. Choosing any of these options results in the PC checking for IDE
 drives, and soon after a crash back to a screen that says "A problem has been detected and Windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer." I can attempt to start the recovery console, but then I get a blue screen&nbsp; that gives the same spiel,
 then this Stop error:</p>
<p>STOP: 0x0000007B (0xF79BA524, 0xC0000034, 0x00000000, 0x00000000).</p>
<p>In addition, I changed the boot order in the BIOS and attempted to use the recovery console through a boot ISO. It ends up crashing to that first screen that showed up. Even if the OS is irrecoverable, these guys would really like the get the data off of
 their hard drive.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Or, if you just want to back up his data and do a clean install:</p>
<p>1. Pull the drive and put it in a USB drive enclosure or use a USB drive adapter. Attach this to a computer running a working install of XP/Vista/Windows7. Use the working Windows Explorer to copy the data to the rescue system's hard drive and then burn
 the data to cd or dvd or copy it to an external hard drive. I prefer not to do this if I know the drive is infected because there is a chance of infecting the host system. In these cases, I use #2 below.<br />
<br />
2. You can boot the target computer with a Bart's PE (XP only) or a Linux Live CD such as Knoppix or Ubuntu and retrieve the data that way. This has the additional advantage of telling you whether the problems you're having are hardware or software-related
 because if the computer behaves perfectly under Linux you know that Windows (software) is the culprit. Conversely, if the computer misbehaves under Linux you will know that there is a hardware problem. Here is general information on using Knoppix for data
 retrieval when you can't get into Windows:<br />
<br />
You will need a computer with two cd drives, one of which is a CD/DVD burner <span style="font-weight: bold">
OR</span> a USB thumb drive with enough capacity to hold your data <span style="font-weight: bold">
OR</span> an external USB hard drive. Download the Knoppix .iso and create your bootable CD*. If you are doing this in an older operating system (XP or Vista), you'll need third-party burning software like Nero, Roxio, or the free<a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">ImgBurn</a>
 (Windows 7 can burn .isos natively). Burn as an image, not as data. Then boot with the CD you created and the Windows files will be visible in Linux. If you want to burn CD/DVDs, there will be a Linux burning program to use.<br />
<br />
*If your computer only has one optical drive and you want to use that drive to burn data or need to test the drive, you can create a bootable USB thumb drive running Linux instead of a bootable CD. This website will show you how to do that -<a href="http://www.pendrivelinux.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pendrivelinux.com</a><br />

<h2>            Laptop Backlight issues</h2>
                    I have a Toshiba Satellite P875 and while I figured out how to turn the back light on my keyboard off (by accident) and then again back on, I can't figure out how to open the timer settings. It's either on or off, and I would love to figure out the settings.
 I've googled a lot of different sites, and they don't seem to have anything available for Windows 10. Does anybody out in Cyberland have an answer for me?

<h2>            Black screen&#58; C&#58; disk check FROZE</h2>
                    
<p>I recently bought a Sony Vaio laptop with genuine Windows Vista and I've been using it for just a few months.</p>
<p>I was using it normally one day and suddenly the laptop froze. So I pushed the power button to reset Windows. A black screen came up and I was asked to wait for a C: disk check. Alright. So I waited.</p>
<p>"Checking file system on C. The type of the file system is NTFS."</p>

<p>And I haven't done the recovery disks. I tried once but the recovery disks process also takes

<p>Hi Jyifang,</p>
<p><br />
I would suggest you&nbsp;to run “chkdsk /r” to&nbsp;repair problems related to bad sectors, lost clusters, cross-linked files, and directory errors from the Command prompt in System Recovery Options menu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;1. Insert the installation disc.</p>
<p>2. Restart your computer.</p>
<p>3. Click the Start button, click the arrow next to the Lock button, and then click Restart. If prompted, press any key to start Windows from the installation disc.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If your computer is not configured to start from a CD or DVD, check the information that came with your computer.</p>
<p>4. Choose your language settings, and then click Next.</p>
<p>5. Click Repair your computer.</p>
<p>6. Select the operating system you want to repair, and then click Next.</p>
<p>7. On the System Recovery Options menu, click Command prompt.</p>
<p>You may run a Checkdsk to repair problems related to bad sectors, lost clusters, cross-linked files, and directory errors.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When you run the checkdisk, there are chances of losing data so you can take a backup before running checkdisk.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; At a command prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER</p>
<p><strong>chkdsk&nbsp; /r&nbsp; X:( drive letter)</strong></p>
<p>9. Press Y when you are prompted to check the disk the next time that the system restarts.</p>
<p>10. Close all applications, and then restart the computer</p>
<p><strong>Refer to “Check your hard disk for errors” <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Check-your-hard-disk-for-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

Thank you for visiting the Microsoft Answers community forum.<br />
<br />
That is not an option for Live Messenger.&nbsp; These are the only options for closing the program:<br />
<br />
Close Messenger<br />
Depending on how you prefer to use Messenger, you can leave the Messenger window open, close it but leave Messenger running (so it's out of your way), or close it and sign out.</p>
<p>• To close the Messenger window but keep Messenger running, click the close (X) button in the upper-right corner of the window.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
• To exit Messenger, click your name, and then click Sign out from here. You can also exit Messenger after you have closed it, right-click the Messenger icon in the taskbar, and then click Sign out in the shortcut menu.<br />
<br />
I hope this information was helpful.&nbsp; Let us know if you need more help.<br />

    <title>Recovering a xbox 360 gamertag - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Recovering a xbox 360 gamertag</h2>
                    <p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Hi I need help recovering my gamer tag on the Xbox 360, I don't know where else to go for help, I've spoken to the customer support, and they say they can't do more than what they've tried.</span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I’m hoping someone here will know the solution. When I created the gamer tag the e-mail I used was a yahoo account, the e-mail account was inactive since then, yahoo deactivated the e-mail, and deleted it, someone else created an account using the same
 name.</span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I recently got a new Xbox 360 slim 4 Gb, to transfer the gamer tag I first need to input the password to the e-mail, but I can't because it's not my account anymore, so a password reset can't help me, all I want to do is disassociate my gamer tag from
 the e-mail and associate it to a new e-mail, </span></p>

<p><span>does anyone know where or who I can contact to help me with this?
</span></p>

<p><span>I’d recommend performing clean boot.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Clean boot helps in eliminating driver conflicts. This is because of the fact that in a clean boot configuration the usual start-up programs do not start.
 Also non-Microsoft services are not started in this state.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please refer this article for detailed information on how to do this.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>After the computer is in clean boot state, check if the images are still distorted in My Pictures folder. Accordingly follow the suggestions from the article
 above to determine and fix the problem.</span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 file history will not backup files located on an external - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> prbureau  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 file history will not backup files located on an external drive</h2>
                    <p>I have windows 10 pro. I&nbsp; turned on file history and selected the folders that I want to be backed up. Some of these files are from an external drive. (I have two external USB drives one for storing the file history and the other for large documents.&nbsp; The
 file history USB drive has the letter F:&nbsp; the external drive that has the files I want backed up is on Y:&nbsp;&nbsp; I have selected the Y: external USB HD drive &nbsp; from the Select Folder as a folder I want backed up and ran the backup. Windows did not backup the files
 on the Y: drive. I then selected a subfolder on the Y: drive to be backed up. The same issue Windows backup will not backup any folders or files on the external Y: drive even when I specifically select the folder to be backed up..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question is how can I get windows 10 backup to backup folders on the Y: drive.&nbsp; I cannot copy these files to the C: drive because the file size would be too big.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The File History drive is 1.8Terrabytes and the amount of files on the Y: drive is only 650 gig.&nbsp; Therefore there is plenty of space on the F: drive to store the files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how to get the files backed up from the Y: drive.&nbsp; </p>
<p>If windows 10 cannot backup files from an external drive then why does Windows 10 allow me to even select the Y: drive as a folder to backup without any error message?&nbsp; The Y: drive is selected as a folder to backup and as a further test a subfolder of the
 Y: drive is also included however neither is backed up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone know how to solve this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards</p>

            <p>I'm sorry, but simply adding a folder on another disk does <em>not </em>work. Frederik Long, have you tried it? Please don't provide "solutions" unless you have verified that they work. It's fine to provide suggestions, but you should state whether or not
 you have verified that they work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My system files are on an SSD, and I keep my data files on a separate disk, an internal HDD. I've tried many configurations:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Use "Add a folder" in "Backup Options" to add the folder directly.</li><li>Add the folder to the default "Documents" Library on my C drive.</li><li>Create a new Library and add the folder to that Library.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>None of these works. The scary thing is that File History does not give a warning. You have to read the message very carefully to see when the last backup was, and then realize that it was before you included the new folder. Fortunately, I discovered this
 before I needed it. Even though I thought I was doing a good job of backing up, nothing was happening. I switched to the 3rd party utility that came with my external USB disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very sad that Microsoft has let its users down when it comes to one of the most important things that users need to do. Any knowledgeable computer person will emphasize the importance of backups. I'm very disappointed that Microsoft does not provide an adequate
 utility to make this extremely important activity easy for the ordinary user.</p>

            <p>The fact you have a folder in a Library folder does not mean that file have to be in a library to backup. The question is have you actually tried to add a folder that is NOT in the library folder to the file history backup? If you had you will see that it
 makes no difference if a folder is in the a library or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You don't have to add external drives to libraries. I tried adding my files on the external drive to the library - it made no difference the backup would not work on the external files.&nbsp; The files would not backup.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We do not need to add any files or folders
 to the libraries to have file history work. We just have to add the folders from the backup as I had stated in my original questions. &nbsp; I know this&nbsp; because I added a folder on a another external drive and it backed up with file history. This folder was not
 in a library folder. However&nbsp; I had to made some changes mentioned below.&nbsp; <br />
</p>
<p>I have finally managed to backup my files on the external drive using Filehistory.&nbsp; I found out that Microsoft software has a limitation of 256 characters - (some references say 260 characters) in the path of a file. There is a&nbsp; event log that you can check
 to see errors on Windows. You can access this by going to the actions panel (or control panel) then searching for the word&nbsp; "Event"&nbsp; you will see in the list of results event log.&nbsp; When I checked it there were thousands of errors all to do with filepath too
 long message for FileHistory .&nbsp;&nbsp; There are event logs for many things, not just backup - it would be worth checking this event log if ever you have problems with your PC. I can't remember now which log I saw, because there are dozens listed in the Event Log&nbsp;
 but I think I expanded the Microsoft folder then chose "Backup" from there I could see the error "Filepath too long" listed thousands of times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since Microsoft do not have the insight to provide any simple solution to this issue (that I am aware of) I had to&nbsp; manually exclude all the folders with filepaths that were too long. I first had to find all the paths that were too long. I used some software
 to do this called long path tool&nbsp; whihc I got from here http://KrojamSoft.com&nbsp; but even when I found the affected files I still had to manually remove all these files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then when I ran the FileHistory again it worked and backed up everything on the external drive. All I did was Add the folder in the FileHistory options but made sure that all the folders that had paths greater than 256 were excluded. I did not add the folder
 to any libraries however as it is not necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; I don't understand why Microsoft have not yet solved this issue in a simple way that everyday users&nbsp; are not affected by this.&nbsp; We should be able to have paths longer than 256 characters in this day and age without us having to find fixes, or work around
 or delete or rename the files manually.&nbsp; Microsoft is living in the dark ages. We should be able to backup any file of any path length.&nbsp; Basically if I don't rename tens of thousands of files then there appears to be no way that I can back them up with FileHistory.
 &nbsp; What is the point of FileHistory if you don't even know why certain files&nbsp; are not being backed up?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are relying on this backup to safeguard our files. &nbsp; I think it is insanely poor design, or complete non regard for customers date&nbsp; by Microsoft not to address this issue.

            <p>Just saying: The idea of backing up is to copy stuff from an internal hard drive to an external hard drive, like a USB-attached drive or a network drive or 'the cloud,' so if the computer goes
<em>kaboom</em> you still have a working copy of your data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's certainly no rule against backing up data already stored on an external drive; it just doesn't fit &nbsp;with the idea of backing up. That may be why you're having so much trouble.</p>

            <p>I already explained why the data would not back and I also provided the solution, so I'm not clear why you posted your remark?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The idea of backing data is to backup data, irrespective of where the data is.&nbsp; If an external drive fails that data is also lost if it is not backed up.&nbsp; That is why it is essential all data is backed up both internal drive data and external drive data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I already explained in my last post FileHistory will backup external data on an external drive provided the number of characters in the path length is not longer than Microsoft's Windows 10 limit.&nbsp; I removed all files that had a path longer than 256 characters
 and FileHistory then backed up the external drive data.&nbsp; None of the folders in the external drive where in a Library.&nbsp;

            <p>Perhaps I did not state my situation clearly. I have <em>two </em><em>internal
</em>drives:</p>
<ol>
<li>An SSD for my system software, plus the default Windows 10 Libraries (Documents, Music, Pictures, Videos).</li><li>A HDD for my personal data.</li></ol>
<p>I use an <em>external </em>USB disk to <em>hold </em>my backups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>File History does a fine job of backing up the Libraries from my SSD (#1 above). However, I have been unsuccessful at getting File History to back up my
<em>personal data that is on my HDD </em>(#2 above) to the external USB disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having said this, if I were using an external disk as an active storage location, I would certainly maintain backup copies of the data on that external disk to some other storage location (another external drive, DVD, cloud, tape, etc.).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I agree completely with prbureau that Microsoft should provide a simple-to-use backup application that allows flexibility. I've been in this business since 1961, and I know that backing up is one of the most important things that&nbsp;we do with our computers.
 OS suppliers should make it <em>easy </em>so as to encourage users to do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my many years working as a software engineer, I've probably spent as much time writing "utility" apps as I have "user" apps. It's not always easy to convince management that such apps are important, but those of us who do this a lot know that they are.
 And management is very happy when you can recover in a few hours instead of many days!</p>

            It's debatable whether Microsoft should include a full-featured backup utility in Windows. Maybe they should also include a full-featured photo and video editor, since that's what many people need in a computer. And maybe they should include a full-featured
 anti-malware solution. That's pretty important. How about a full-featured media player? You can criticize Microsoft for not including this or that or the other thing, but they can't be all things to all people, and besides: their over-reaching has already
 got them in trouble with the DOJ and the ECJ.

            <p>You make some good points. I sort of place upgrading, backing up, and malware protection in the "housekeeping" category. Not fun, but important. MS seems to do a reasonably good job on upgrading and malware protection, but I think they are a little lacking
 in backing up. Doesn't seem like a lot to add additional disks to the current File History.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I do agree with you that it's good to leave full-featured apps to third parties. And I agree that MS can't be all things to all people, although I note that their advertising certainly suggests that they want to be. :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is one feature of File History that I believe does deserve criticism. As I mentioned in a previous post, the indication that my files were not backed up when I added the second disk was very obscure. There was no warning. In the message at the end
 it simply told me the date and time when my files were last backed up. After doing this a few times, and thinking I was backing my work up, I read the message more carefully and saw that nothing in my backup had been changed for a few weeks. If I try to use
 a feature that doesn't exist, I should be warned that the app is not doing what I thought it was.</p>

            I do not want a video editor from Microsoft. But if they provide software to back up files, that program should work well and not have path length limitations of 260 characters which, apparently, other operating systems no longer have. Very annoying. I
 am loosing a lot of time with this issue. Of course renaming files is not an option for me.

<span><span>Crustyle</span></span></a>,</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>The issue seems to be caused by some incompatible devices attached to the computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. Since when are you facing this issue?<br />
<br />
b. Do you remember making any changes on your computer?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c. What are the steps did you try to fix the issue temporarily?</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method 1:<br />
</span></strong></span><span><span><br />
<span>&nbsp;</span>Disconnect all the external devices (printers, scanner, USB (Universal Serial Bus) drives, etc...)Except mouse and the keyboard and then boot up.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If this corrects the issue then add the devices back one at a time until you discover the piece of hardware causing the issue.
 Then get any updated drivers\software for the device. </span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method 2:
<br />
</span></strong></span><span><span><br />
If you still come across the issue, I suggest you to run Hardware Troubleshooter and then check for the issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Open the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box,
 type troubleshooter, and then click Troubleshooting. Under Hardware and Sound, click Configure a device.</span></span><span><span>‌</span></span><span><span>
 If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Access the link below to know more about Hardware Troubleshooter:</span></span></p>

</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the above step does not help us to diagnose the issue, uninstall the drivers for USB [Universal Serial bus] host controller
 and restart the computer. Let Windows install the generic drivers and then see if it helps you to fix the issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. Open Device Manager by clicking the Start button, then Device Manager in the search box.</span></span><span><span>‌</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c. Look for the device under USB [Universal Serial bus] host controller, right click on it and select Uninstall.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>d. Reboot the computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>e. On reboot, Windows 7 should re-install the drivers automatically.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please get back to us results.</span></span></p>

<h3> kengr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Comfort Optical Mouse 3000 Not Scrolling on Windows 7 but Works Fine on Windows Vista</h2>
                    <p>I have a Comfort Optical Mouse 3000 attached to a TrendNet TK-801R KVM switch, which then attaches to several PCs.&nbsp; The KVM is a PS/2-based device, and does not require any drivers on the controlled PCs. The mouse is attached to the KVM via the USB-to-PS/2
 adapter that came with the mouse.&nbsp; When operating a Windows Vista machine, the mouse scroll wheel works just fine for scrolling.&nbsp;Under Vista, the mouse shows up in Device Manager as&nbsp;a Microsoft PS/2 Mouse, and no Intellipoint software is installed.</p>
<p>Under Windows 7 (64-bit Ultimate), the mouse wheel doesn't scroll at all.&nbsp; Clicking the mouse button works as expected, but it just won't scroll when the wheel is operated.&nbsp; Device Manager shows the mouse as a HID-compatible mouse.&nbsp; I have tried to configure
 the software with (a) no Intellipoint software installed, (b) the latest Intellipoint software installed, (c) an older version of Intellipoint software installed [as recommended by a couple of other sites], and (d) telling Intellipoint that it is just a Wheel
 Mouse Optical or other similar device.&nbsp; I restart between each configuration change, but the result is always the same...no scrolling functionality.</p>
<p>Because&nbsp;scrolling works through this KVM switch when controlling a Windows Vista machine, but not when it's controlling a Windows 7 machine, I don't think the problem is the KVM switch.&nbsp; I have tried swapping ports on the KVM, to make sure it wasn't an issue
 with one of the PS/2 ports.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I would like to get some ideas on what might be the cause and possible solution.&nbsp; I used to have a Wheel Mouse Optical in this setup, but when it died, I replaced it with the Comfort Optical Mouse 3000.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I should have mentioned in the original post that I had tried a couple of times&nbsp;uninstalling the driver through Device Manager, restarting and letting it recognize the device again, etc.&nbsp; Doing this had no effect on the behavior.&nbsp; The mouse is always recognized
 and functions okay except that the wheel doesn't scroll (under Windows 7 only).&nbsp; I have also tried configurations with and without Intellipoint installed, and with two different versions of Intellipoint installed.&nbsp; None of these configurations changed the
 behavior.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I have just found a solution to the problem.&nbsp;The motherboard on my Windows 7 machine has just one "combo" PS/2 port, which can be used for either a keyboard or a mouse, but not for both simultaneously.&nbsp; I had the PC-end of the keyboard cable plugged
 into this port, and had the PC-end of the mouse cable plugged into a PS/2-to-USB converter, which was attached to a USB port on the computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;With the system shut down, I decided to try switching them around so that keyboard used the PS/2-to-USB converter,
 and the PC-end of the mouse cable plugged directly into the PS/2 "combo" port.&nbsp; This immediately solved the problem.&nbsp; The mouse wheel started scrolling in every application.&nbsp; Wheel scrolling works with or without Intellipoint installed.&nbsp; So, as of this morning,
 the problem is solved.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It looks like having the mouse&nbsp;go from USB (on the mouse itself) to PS/2 (on the KVM) and then back to USB (at the computer) was just too much "conversion" for the Comfort Optical Mouse 3000.&nbsp; (The old Wheel Mouse Optical went through the same path without
 a problem, so I hadn't considered this end of the connection&nbsp;to be a significant factor.)&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bottom line: Going only from USB to PS/2 (at the KVM), and doing no more conversions at the&nbsp;PC-end of the cable seems to have solved the problem of wheel scrolling for this mouse.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Re-activation</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded my HP laptop in July, 2016, from Windows 7 to Windows 10.&nbsp; Just yesterday, Windows stated it could not go online because a certification service has not started.&nbsp; I decided to reset my laptop and Windows came back up after some time doing the
 reset.&nbsp; It has an 'Activate Windows' watermark.&nbsp; I went to Settings / Activate and got the message "We can't activate Windows on this device because you don't have a valid digital license or product key."&nbsp; The error code is 0xC004F012.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I, all of a sudden have an invalid copy of Windows???</p>

            This can happen after a reset and sorry about that.
<br />The link below is a very good step by step and how to fix this.

            Hello Jedidiah,
<br />
<br />The error 0xC004F012 happens because of missing or corrupt licensing repository
<br />and the solution is to rebuild the Tokens.dat or Activation Tokens file on the system
<br />
<br />Open the following folder – C:\Windows\System32\SPP\Store\2.0.
<br />If Windows is installed on a different drive, please replace C:  with the appropriate drive.
<br />You will find the ‘tokens.dat’ file in the 2.0 folder. Rename that to ‘tokens.old’. Close the File Explorer.
<br />Run Command Prompt as administrator, type the following command and hit Enter:
<br />net start sppsvc
<br />Execute the following command:
<br />cscript.exe slmgr.vbs /rilc
<br />Wait for the commands to be executed and then reboot the system twice.
<br />Go to Settings 
<br />Activation and run the ‘Activation Troubleshooter’.
<br />
<br />Hope it helps, have a good day       
        </p>

<p>This answerer wants payment for the service.&nbsp; I do not believe I should not need to pay $.01 for ant solution in this matter.&nbsp; I need a real answer to this obvious fault on the part of Microsoft since as I stated originally I got the free upgrade to Windows
 10 in 2016 and no indication was ever given that what I got was a temporary license. The only indication that anything was amiss was after I had to reset my PC due to losing my internet capability.&nbsp; After the restart, an "Activate Windows … Go to Settings
 to activate Windows" watermark showed on my laptop's screen.&nbsp; After that I had no more product key.&nbsp; WHY IS THIS???</p>
