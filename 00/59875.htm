<h2>            voicemail suddenly not working on Skype 7.59</h2>
                    <p>Skype 7.59, High Sierra MacOS 10.13, MacBook Air (early 2015): Without warning, my Skype number is not picking up when calls come through, so I am missing calls. I understand that there is no longer a customised voicemail, but NO voicemail response?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a world-wide subscription, so this should work. I depend on Skype. Please help.</p>

            Wow.... now I'm frightened I'm in the same boat.&nbsp; &nbsp;I thought it was bad enough that suddenly my customized voice mail message wasn't working.&nbsp; &nbsp;Now it's possible I'm not getting a voicemail response at all.&nbsp; This would explain the drop in business the
 last couple weeks.&nbsp; And zero response from Skype.&nbsp; They don't even have support.&nbsp; It's fine for a paid service, but I do have a paid Skype number plan with them and get no support.

<h2>            No skip option in Windows 10 Upgrade</h2>
                    I have a genuine Windows 8.1 Single Language OS preinstalled in my Lenovo Y50.I downloaded the Windows 10 ISO and installed Windows 10 Home in another partitionIt asked for my product key but I skipped those steps.It didn't activate and after browsing
 through a few forums I found that you need to upgrade first and then clean install the OS.So I tried to upgrade my Windows 8.1 OS but the setup asks for my product key and there is no skip option and I couldn't upgrade it.My Windows 8.1 key doesn't work.Please
 help.

<p>Purchase a product key for Windows 10</p>

            <p>Your problem is that you do not have an existing eligible Microsoft OS in&nbsp;that partition. You are supposed to upgrade the 8.1 and if you wish perform a clean install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no KEY. Once Microsoft has verified the installation they keep that information on file for you. This is how you will be able to do a clean install later if you wish as they will be able to activate it from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you install to an empty partition then nothing is there to qualify it and you will have to license it. The upgrade is basing itself on your existing qualified OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have a period of time to decide whether you wish to revert and the previous OS is still there, changed to an .old file or folder from what I've noted which allows for a complete restoration (I don't know if non-Microsoft programs are restored but I doubt
 it). Any non-Microsoft content is basically yours to adjust, adapt or reinstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Backup is always a good thing that you should do when you go to make such large changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's the best as I know how to explain it. Read about the conversion as much as you need to and ask more questions as you need to. There is no such thing as a stupid question, only uninformed mistakes.</p>

<p>The Restore/Refresh/Reset page applies to Win8 &amp; Win8.1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you're apparently missing 5 or 6 months' worth of a security updates (as well as Win8.1 Prerequisite updates), you're best bet at this point is doing a Reset ("Remove everything and reinstall Windows").</p>

                    Currently I use a microsoft administrator account to benefit from windows 8 features
<div>and I created a local administrator account just in case my hotmail account gets unavailable (virus or whatever)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is it a good idea to transform the microoft account (daily use) into a standard account to surf safer?, I may avoid malware or wht other practicl advantages I would get by switching to a standard account while leaving the local account administrator as
 an emergency solution?</div>

            1) No. &nbsp;You can still be infested, bit it will be sand boxed to just what your specific account can do/change.

<div>2) Usually just when you want to install something or change a system wide setting.</div>
<div><br />
<div>3) As long as you can log in as an administrative level account, you can do anything on the system/to another user - other than mess with some other accounts encrypted files.</div>

            <blockquote>
<p>But if one administrator gets infected, the others will also suffer the same infections with few exceptions for personal files &amp; preferendces, no?</p>
<p>if the infection is so badly for one administrator the PC will not reboot for the others, no?</p>
</blockquote>
<br />
That's all highly dependent on the infection/infestation.&nbsp; Most concentrate on the user access and once then they may have a specific task - if they can perform that task - they have no need for infection/infestation of anyone else on the machine.<br />

<h2>            Apps say they are not connected, but i am&#33;</h2>
                    <p>THis probably isnt even Microsoft's fault, but im asking just incase anyone may know or have any tips. So these apps are the only apps i have discovered which wont connect, even though i am connected already. All other apps like chrome and steam,etc. work.
 If you need more information, please ask!&nbsp;</p>
<p>So this app used to work but for some reason it won't connect to the servers... Also i have put this on adobe forums as well, as well as contact my pc manufacturer, nothing so far tho...</p>

            Hi there alpha! Go to Settings&gt;Accounts&gt;Your Info&gt; from there choose sign in with local account instead. After doing that sign out and back in onto the local account.  
<br /> Go  back to the same spot as mentioned above and choose Microsoft account. After signing in click verify (right below after signing in on Microsoft account). It will send a text to your phone number, which you can use to verify your account. 
<br />
<br />This should fix that error code.

            HI Unicorn Alpha, 
<br />
<br />From face value, it sounds like it may be a proxy settings issues, but let’s look at all of these below first...
<br />
<br />Let’s run through this list to see if we can get the store functioning properly. 
<br />
<br />App troubleshooter - <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/Appsdiagnostic10.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F2...</a> - download and run and see if it finds anything wrong with the store. 
<br />
<br />Next, let’s clear the cache - Hit the windows key + r, then type “wrreset.exe” and hit enter.  This will clear the windows store cache. Let’s check the store again. 
<br />
<br />Proxy Settings - Click start and type “control panel” in there, find “internet options” - Then click on the Connections tab, then LAN settings. Make sure “use proxy server” isn’t checked off, if it is, uncheck it, and click apply. 
<br />
<br />If these don’t work, we can move forward with uninstalling/reinstalling the store manually. 
<br />
<br />Let me know!
<br />- C

<p>Ooh Thanks! it seems to have worked, tho its still loading now....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thing is i ran the download. it opened the store, no error message. Seemed to be fine.</p>
<p>On a side note, how could i fix the adobe CC thing?</p>

            Is CC still giving you that error? I’d uninstall and reinstall the app. 
<br />
<br />And is the store still loading? Did you run the troubleshooting, reset, or change the proxy settings? Reboot your PC is you haven’t already, and let me know!

            Hmmm, can we try a different user account? 
<br />
<br />Select the Start  button, then select Settings  &gt; Accounts  &gt; Family &amp; other people &gt; Add someone else to this PC.
<br />
<br />Type a user name, password, password hint, and then select Next.
<br />
<br />Log in with that user, and try to download your adobe apps. I’m starting to think it’s profile specific.

<p>I have attached them above&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;but here they are:</p>
<p>THing is, it has, i think the same situation on everything. I can't update the thing at the moment due to the thing. I think it is because it might have trouble connecting to the internet? i don't know for sure. Because the adobe worked when i switched network
 (to school internet signing, which made me connect with a proxy). Umm the microsoft seems to have worked on this new thing... So what im thinking is that the program itself has difficult or some barrier connecting to the network,...</p>
<p>Thing is some things dont work on this new network either, such as the very last screenshot, the onedrive one...</p>

    <title>Machine Debug Manager NAG DIALOG BOX - Windows 7 Professional - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Machine Debug Manager NAG DIALOG BOX - Windows 7 Professional </h2>
                    
<p>Hi...(hope I put this in the correct area...)</p>
<p>Just upgraded VISTA BUSINESS SP2 to 7 Professional.&nbsp; Everything is fine with the exception that now, this stupid, nagging "MACHINE DEBUG MANAGER" dialog box / NAG that needs an "OK" to disappear keeps coming up.&nbsp; I really don't care if it's running or not;
 I just don't want that dialog box to appear.&nbsp; If that means disabling it, so be it.&nbsp; But I already have the script error options UNCHECKED in Internet Options / Advanced.&nbsp; I can't find instructions on how to disable this (MDM.EXE) in Windows 7 (Microsoft site
 has instructions for WIN XP).&nbsp; Also, I can not find anything related to this service under SERVICES.MSC, so I am a little confused and frustrated.</p>
<p>Suggestions, anyone?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Andy</p>

<p>Hi <strong>DrInfoman</strong>,</p>
<p>I would suggest you to follow these methods provided below and check if it fixes the issue.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Try renaming the file to different name and check.</p>
<p>The path to the file.</p>
<p><strong>C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\VS7Debug </strong></p>
<p>rename it to something like <strong>MDM1.exe </strong>and check for the issue.</p>
<p>If the file is not present in the above path then you may search for the file in this below path.</p>
<p><strong>C:\Windows\System32</strong></p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>a. Go to Control Panel.<br />
b. Click on Administrative Tools.<br />
c. Double click on Component Services.<br />
d. Click on Services(local).<br />
e. Then look in the Name column on the right, scroll down untill you find, Machine Debug Manager.<br />
f. Right Click on it and select properties.<br />
g. Where it says Startup Type, change to Disabled.<br />
h. Click apply and ok.</p>
<p><strong>Method 3:</strong></p>
<p>If the above provided steps doesn't resolve the issue then I would recommend you to run online Virus Scan to remove any infections, if present.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Sounds like a hardware problem, possibly heat related, though malware could be the problem<br />
(worth checking).<br />

And for other malware :<br />
<br />
If you need to check for malware here are my recommendations - these will allow you to do<br />
a thorough check and removal without ending up with a load of spyware programs running<br />
resident which can cause as many issues as the malware and maybe harder to detect as the<br />
cause.<br />
<br />
No one program can be relied upon to detect and remove all malware. Added that often easy<br />
to detect malware is often accompanied by a much harder to detect and remove payload. So<br />
its better to be overly thorough now than to pay the high price later. Check with these to an<br />
extreme overkill point and then run the cleanup only when you are very sure the system is clean.<br />
<br />
These can be done in Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot however you should also run&nbsp;<br />
them in regular Windows when you can.<br />

<h2>            Lost Access to Network Shares after Switching from NetBEUI to TCP&#47;IP &#40;Direct Hosting of SMB&#41;</h2>
                    Please Help!<br />
<br />
I'm trying to switch File and Printer Sharing over from NetBEUI (which I've been using since Windows 2000) to TCP/IP (with NetBIOS disabled under WINS according to http://support.microsoft.com/kb/204279/en-us) on the two Windows XP machines in my peer-to-peer,
 password-protected workgroup.&nbsp; (This is in preparation for new Windows 7 machines coming on line, which cannot use NetBEUI.)&nbsp; Now I can't see any of my network shares on either machine from the other, although both machines can still access the Internet through
 the router and the shares and permissions still seem valid. &nbsp;Here's what I did, for what it's worth:<br />
<br />
On both of the Windows XP machines that are currently on my LAN, I (1) un-checked NetBEUI for all network connections where it was installed (wired LAN, Bluetooth, and Wireless), (2) changed over from NetBEUI to TCP/IP as the binding for both "Client for Microsoft
 Networks" and "File and Printer Sharing" on the wired LAN and wireless connections, and (3) disabled NetBIOS over TCP/IP under WINS for wireless (it already was disabled for the wired LAN) per instructions for "Direct Hosting of SMB over TCP/IP" in the above-mentioned
 KB article.<br />
<br />
I don't know whether this is a router problem or a Windows problem.&nbsp; I've never shared files through any router over TCP/IP before. &nbsp;Are there settings on typical routers that would be critical to TCP/IP file sharing (especially with NetBIOS disabled) but that
 wouldn't matter for NetBEUI?&nbsp; Or where else could I have gone wrong? -- JCW2<br />

            <p>I don't think that Direct hosting of SMB over TCP/IP is what you really want.&nbsp; Two of the "advantages" listed on the KB article are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; •Removing WINS and NetBIOS broadcast as a means of name resolution.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; •Standardizing name resolution on DNS for file and printer sharing.</p>
<p>... which are the standard ways that devices are detected (i.e. find each other)&nbsp;on a network in order to connect to them -- particularly within a single subnet.&nbsp; If you want to go with SMB, then you need to set up your own DNS server (generally done in
 big companies)&nbsp;and/or create a "Hosts" file on each computer&nbsp;that lists and identifies the serving&nbsp;devices on your network (which should then have a fixed IP address assigned) or connect using IP addresses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; NetBEUI&nbsp;can be dumped.&nbsp; Nobody uses that anymore.&nbsp; But "NetBT" ("NetBIOS-over-TCP/IP") is what has replaced it for the most part.&nbsp; They are not the same.&nbsp; Windows 7
<u>does</u> support NetBT and so do most printers&nbsp;and servers that are Microsoft compatible.&nbsp; My recommendation is to re-enable NetBT and disable NETBEUI (if you can&nbsp;find it).</p>

I'll study your references shortly; but if I understand you correctly, Direct Hosting of SMB over TCP/IP will not work on a simple workgroup behind a router (which is serving DHCP but not DNS).&nbsp; So that means I must just return to the default settings and use
 NetBIOS over TCP/IP.&nbsp; Correct? -- JCW2<br />

<br />
OK, after taking a hint from another forum and blundering around a bit, I think I'm beginning to follow what you said here; and I think it will work for me:&nbsp; After following the instructions in "Direct Hosting of SMB over TCP/IP," I eventually discovered that
 I can request any particular shared file by UNC (\\server\share\file_path) **if and only if** "server" is replaced by the specific IP address of the desired computer on the LAN!&nbsp; (I guess resolution of these IP addresses is the DNS-like service that would
 be provided by NetBIOS, at the cost of its broadcasts, additional open ports, etc.)&nbsp; In fact, just typing "\\192.168.0.###" into the Windows Explorer address bar brings up **all** the shared directories on the specified computer and even lists them underneath
 the workgroup name!!&nbsp; (I suppose these shares could then be mapped to drive letters for permanent access; but maybe there's a better way, below.)&nbsp; This is very cool!!!<br />
<br />
Since I had already set up my router with DHCP reservations for all computers on my LAN -- they were listed in a MAC filter anyhow, so that was easy and turns out to have been convenient! -- their IP addresses are effectively fixed and known in advance.&nbsp; Thus
 I don't really need the name-resolution service of DNS, although something like it it would still be convenient.<br />
<br />
This is where your mention of creating "Hosts" files intrigued me, if I can figure out how to set it up.&nbsp; (I've heard it said that taking control of your "Hosts" file is a good safety precaution anyhow, since it is a frequent target of hackers trying to divert
 legitimate Web requests to their own malicious sites.)&nbsp; Does anybody have any tips and/or references that would help me accomplish the name resolution there?<br />
<p><br />
Finally, what functionality do I actually lose by going the Direct-Hosting-of-SMB-with-Hosts-file route as opposed to using NetBIOS over TCP/IP?&nbsp; Granted, any new machine added to the network would also have to be added to all the "Hosts" files (or mapped to
 a new drive letter); but given that I already have to add it to the MAC filter and assign it a DHCP reservation in my router, this isn't a heavy burden for something that doesn't happen often.&nbsp; Should everything then work the same as if NetBIOS were providing
 the name resolution?<br />
<br />
The only missing piece so far -- it's not obvious how this same trick would apply to printer sharing (although I'm not using that feature right now anyhow).&nbsp; Could this be handled seamlessly through the "Hosts" file as well?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Bottom line:&nbsp; I would be grateful for more elaboration on the method; but if I can't stand whatever inconveniences turn up with this method, it should be easy enough to revert to NetBIOS over TCP/IP -- just one check box for each LAN connection on each computer.&nbsp;
 Best Regards -- JCW2</p>

            <p>Apologies for being not replying sooner but I'm usually only around during my lunch hour at work...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>JCW&gt;&nbsp; I can request any particular shared file by UNC (\\server\share\file_path)
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **if and only if** "server" is replaced by the specific IP address of the desired</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;computer on the LAN!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, that is what you need to do because SMB pretty much tosses out the protocols that automatically discover other devices on the subnet (i.e. broadcasts).&nbsp; "If and only if" may be a bit too restrictive in your statement above.&nbsp; More specifically, the "server"
 must either be an IP address, or a name that can be resolved to an IP address using standard TCP/IP resolving methods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any "name" can be resolved to an IP address if it exists in either the "hosts" file (always checked first) or if the DNS server configured on your computer returns an IP address when sent the "name".&nbsp; For a small home or office setup, it is more practical
 to add a line to your "hosts" file should you prefer to use names rather than IP addresses.&nbsp; The "hosts" file in Win XP usually&nbsp;exists as the file:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts</p>
<p>The file does not have an extension (which makes it harder to edit with Notepad which seems to insist on a ".txt" extension).&nbsp; But you can feel free to edit the file with any text editor to associate a name to an IP address.&nbsp; Simply add a line like:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 192.168.0.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JasonPC</p>
<p>and from then on you should be able to use \\JasonPC\share instead of&nbsp; \\192.168.0.5\share.&nbsp; As you may have figured out, this file is subject to misuse as one could enter a line like:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 198.168.0.100&nbsp; www.google.com</p>
<p>into the hosts file and from then on anytime&nbsp;someone connected to www.google.com, they would connect to the specified IP address instead of the real site.&nbsp; The only line required to be in this file (in XP)&nbsp;is:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 127.0.0.1&nbsp;&nbsp; localhost</p>
<p>so if you see any other lines that don't begin with a "#" character, you had better know what they are.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Printer Sharing, it depends on how your printer is connected to the network.&nbsp; If it is connected to another computer (e.g. via USB cable) and then shared from that computer, then it works just like file sharing on that computer that you mention above.&nbsp;
 On the other hand, if your printer is connected directly to an IP switch or router or is wirelessly connected, then the printer itself must either support SMB or you need to use a print driver that doesn't use Microsoft Networking at all (many printers come
 with drivers that use port 9100 for printing).&nbsp; Best to consult your printer manufacturer here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HTH,</p>

            <blockquote>...More specifically, the "server" must either be an IP address, or a name that can be resolved to an IP address using standard TCP/IP resolving methods.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any "name" can be resolved to an IP address if it exists in either the "hosts" file (always checked first) or if the DNS server configured on your computer returns an IP address when sent the "name".&nbsp; For a small home or office setup, it is more practical
 to add a line to your "hosts" file should you prefer to use names rather than IP addresses...</p>

Thanks, Wander, for the very helpful comeback.&nbsp; But you didn't really address this question:<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;Finally, what functionality do I actually lose by going the Direct-Hosting-of-SMB-with-Hosts-file route as opposed to using NetBIOS over TCP/IP?&lt;&lt;<br />
<br />
So far I've thought of one feature of NetBIOS name resolution that I expect will be lost with direct SMB.&nbsp; Some of my computers have both a wired Ethernet connection and a wireless WiFi connection to the router (not usually operational at the same time).&nbsp; The
 problem is that each network adapter has its own MAC address, hence a unique IP address reserved for it by the router, but the computer itself has only a single name in the workgroup,&nbsp; With direct SMB resolved through a HOSTS file (probably the same through
 a DNS server), I presume that I would have to use different names for the wired and wireless connections in order to resolve them to the corresponding IP addresses.&nbsp; Therefore I would have to to have two network names for each such computer and know in advance
 which connection method was being used.<br />
<br />
I presume that NetBIOS, on the other hand, would not care which connection method is in use but would identify the computer only by its name on the workgroup, appreciably simplifying the operation.&nbsp; (I've no idea what it might do if both connections were operating
 simultaneously.)<br />
<br />
Is the above a real or an imagined inconvenience?&nbsp; Are there other such feature losses that I haven't though of yet?<br />
<br />
Thanks again, very much, for the education! -- JCW2<br />

<h2>            Error code&#58; 0x800B010B, after trying to install .NET Framework 4 on Windows 2003</h2>
                    <p>Running Windows 2003 Server, Enterprise Edition, Service Pack 2</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I had trouble installing windows updates.&nbsp; I would constantly get an error from windows update that indicated there was a a problem with the security credentials:</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>The error I got was<b> 0x8007f0da</b></p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>I followed all of the tasks identified to fix this at:</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p><b>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/958050</b></p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>they did not resolve the issue.&nbsp; So I went on to the "Advanced Troubleshooting" specified in the article at this location:</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p><b>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/822798</b></p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>I tried everyone of these steps, with no avail.&nbsp; One of the updates that it could not install was .NET 4, so I was also investigating that issue.&nbsp; In the process I ran .Net Cleanup Tool:</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p><b>http://blogs.msdn.com/b/astebner/archive/2006/05/30/611355.aspx</b></p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>After doing this I tried to re-install .NET 1.1, 1.1sp1, 3.5 and 2.0, but was only able to reinstall 3.5, as 1.1 and 2.0 were part of the Windows 2003 operating system.&nbsp; After installing .NET
 3.5 Windows Update installed numerous 3.5 updates/fixes.</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>I ran .NET Framework Setup Verification Tool and it showed all of my .NET's installed were fine, except 1.1.</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p><b>http://blogs.msdn.com/b/astebner/archive/2008/10/13/8999004.aspx</b></p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>So then I proceeded to manually fix my 1.1 install by following these instructions:</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p><b>http://blogs.msdn.com/b/astebner/archive/2005/06/21/431385.aspx</b></p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>After following these instructions, and re-running the .NET Framework Setup Verification Tool, it shows all my .NET's in good:</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>.NET Framework 1.1 SP1</p>
<p>.NET Framework 2.0 SP2</p>
<p>.NET Framework 3.0 SP2</p>
<p>.NET Framework 3.5 SP1</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>I then manually download dotNetFx40_Full_x86_x64.exe and try to install it and it fails.&nbsp; The error I get is:</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p><b>[9/16/2011, 14:27:8]Failed to verify and authenticate the file -C:\c7290308adb3cdc4f3c4424c046838cc\netfx_Core_x86.msi</b></p>
<p><b>[9/16/2011, 14:27:8]Please delete the file, C:\c7290308adb3cdc4f3c4424c046838cc\netfx_Core_x86.msi and run the package again</b></p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>I follow the instructions here to extract the file and verify the certificate:</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>[9/16/2011, 14:27:9]Final Result: Installation failed with error code: (0x800B010B), "Generic trust failure. " (Elapsed time: 0 00:00:05).</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>So I went to the original dotNetFx40_Full_x86_x64.exe file, Right Click, Properties, Digital Signature, saw it was valid, did View Certificate, and Installed the Certificate for good measure.&nbsp;
 Still same error.</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p><span>I removed the file C:\c7290308adb3cdc4f3c4424c046838cc\netfx_Core_x86.msi as it told me to.&nbsp; I did not see where I could "disable
 .NET"&nbsp; and then re-enable it like you can in some other versions of Windows: </span>
(<b>Start button</b> –&gt; <b>Control Panel</b> –&gt; <b>Programs</b> <b>–&gt; Turn Windows Features on or off
</b>–&gt; clear check box next to <b>Microsoft .NET Framework).&nbsp; </b>I cleaned %temp%, rebooted the box and then tried to install the standalone installer again, but get the same result.</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>I am looking for ANY ideas that can help me with this as it's driving me nuts.</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p><span>If I look at the Certificate on&nbsp;</span> dotNetFx40_Full_x86_x64.exe it shows Valid from 12/7/2009 to 3/72011, so it's expired.&nbsp; I thought that
 may be the issue, so I set my clock back to 1/1/2011 and retried the installation but it still fails.</p>

<p>Can you access these locations and do you have your Programs/Accessories listed in there, they should be listed in the&nbsp;two paths?&nbsp; Navigation to these locations might require you to show BOTH Hidden and System files via Control Panel/ Folder Options/ View.</p>
<p>C:\Users\usernameXXXX\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Accessories<br />
C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Accessories<br />
<br />
If you can access these then they should appear on the Start Menu.<br />
<br />
If they are missing you could copy new folders and shortcuts in to the appropriate location.</p>

<h3> qudico  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 Icons Disappearing and Task Bar Not Working</h2>
                    <p>I bought an HP p7-1587cdPC desktop with Windows 8 installed.&nbsp; I noticed that on the desktop, the icons would disappear when the pc would go to sleep.&nbsp; The task bar shows icons, and when I hover, it shows in a little window what the page should be, but doesn't
 expand open to view the screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried right clicking and selecting and deselecting to view icons on desktop but it doesn't work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried right clicking on the start screen menu that pops up on the bottom left to do the sfc scan, but when I click on Command (Admin), there is a notification sound, and my screen dims and does nothing.&nbsp; I have to escape to get back to the desktop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the start menu, I am able to get on the internet, but none of the programs installed on my pc will open.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have also tried returning my pc in case there was a defect.&nbsp; I replaced it with a brand new one, and have the same issues (sorry Costco).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only thing that has worked is if I shut down every time I am done working, as long as I don't let it go to sleep.&nbsp; Help!</p>

            <p>Hi Qudico,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community and we are glad to assist you on this issue.</p>
<p><br />
As per the issue description, you are unable to open the icons on the taskbar and access the programs installed on the computer from the start screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may have to check if the drivers on the computer are up-to-date.</p>
<p><br />
Since this issue has occurred in a new computer, I would suggest you to contact HP&nbsp;to update the drivers currently installed on the computer.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Note:</strong> Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring
 of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Hope it help.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Please feel free to let us know if you have any other Windows related query and we would happy to help you.<br />

 i cannot turn it off without unplugging it is becoming annoying. It makes playing action games like DMC and basketball terrible it just shoots the ball and goes off everytime i get the ball. Is there some trick or some configuration file i can edit to adjust
 this or fix it? </p>

    <title>Large Update to Windows 10 fails... with no information, no clue, no - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> garyk5  say:</h3>
<h2>            Large Update to Windows 10 fails... with no information, no clue, no help</h2>
                    <p>Some background:&nbsp; I am a computer professional with 25 years experience. &nbsp;I had an arduous time installing the UPGRADE for Windows 10 from 8.1.&nbsp; It kept failing after trying so many troubleshooting techniques.&nbsp; Eventually, I discovered that it simply ran
 out of space, because it was <em>foolishly</em> trying to use the "D" drive for downloaded installation files, when there was clearly not enough space.&nbsp; Why it wouldn't check ahead of time is beyond me.&nbsp; Anyway, I eventually downloaded the entire set of software
 files and installed directly from a subdirectory off of the "C" drive, which worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, I received a notification that I was on an outdated version of Windows 10 and that it was time to "Update" to the latest.&nbsp; I allowed Windows to do its job. But it refused to do it properly, and with consideration. I discovered that it ran out of space,
 because ONCE AGAIN it was trying to use the "D" drive for downloaded install files.&nbsp; Exasperated, I wiped the "D" drive clean (it is a "recovery" drive, but learned this is meaningless once you upgrade your operating system) and it seemed to get far along
 much further than before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>STILL IT FAILED.&nbsp; This time after 50% or so, it simply showed me that dreaded "Restoring previous version of Windows" message.&nbsp; However, this time once the PC restarted I did not receive any COURTESY MESSAGE informing me of the installation fault and error
 message.&nbsp; I was given the desktop as if I'd just done a normal warm boot.&nbsp; This prompted me to SEARCH THE INTERNET to try finding a solution.&nbsp; And I thought I did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Low and behold, Microsoft has a diagnostic tool for the Windows Update.&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Why didn't Windows tell me about this when it failed?&nbsp; Or better yet, why didn't it run such a tool FIRST before attempting the installation to fix any potential problems?&nbsp;
 No matter...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the utility. It found something wrong.&nbsp; "Service registration missing or corrupt."&nbsp; It supposedly repaired it.&nbsp; I ran it again... "cannot find anything wrong." Great.&nbsp; So I tried the update yet again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FAIL.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, no message pop-up or log to browse.&nbsp; No indication of what went wrong.&nbsp; The diagnostic tool just came back and said there was nothing wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So... anybody here have any advice as to what I should do&nbsp;next?&nbsp; </p>

<p>Thanks for your reply.&nbsp; Here are my responses to your question:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I had actually tried to upgrade back in Jan/Feb timeframe, but the automatic upgrade kept failing. It took me many&nbsp;hours and days of troubleshooting to eventually find a workable path to install it, by downloading the full install to my local hard drive.&nbsp;I
 eventually successfully completed the upgrade from 8.1 to 10 in July.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Prior to 2016, I had declined to upgrade because I wasn't confident I could upgrade from 8.1 to 10 without running into issues that would impact my ability to conduct work on my computer.&nbsp; The "nagware" pushed to my computer was very annoying, so I uninstalled
 and hid 3 different updates that pertained to the upgrade (after learning from various software communities about them). Later, when I decided to give in and go for the upgrade, I let the nagware back onto my computer, but as I stated in point #1, it was unsuccessful
 via automatic upgrade.&nbsp; I had to do it manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. That link to the version number was useless to me, because "Build" and "Version" do not appear in the dialog.&nbsp; I discovered "winver"... which shows build 10240... the original.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Yes, I had Norton installed for a while back in 2015.&nbsp; But I declined to renew the subscription.&nbsp; I completely removed it and cleansed the registry of any Symantec/Norton entries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. McAfee was offered as a trial, but I declined.&nbsp; I also deleted all references to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. I do have Avast! installed.&nbsp; But when I did this upgrade I elected the "disable permanently" option... which triggered warnings that I had no anti-virus installed on the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7.&nbsp;It was&nbsp;on my 2nd to last attempt to <strong>update</strong> (I have upgraded&nbsp;already)&nbsp;where I was informed of this error:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=9dd855ac-9fdf-480f-9ef7-fd1f64f9b75e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d9dd855ac-9fdf-480f-9ef7-fd1f64f9b75e" /></a></p>
<p>I found some tips on-line to deal with it, which included turning off the&nbsp;Internet connection once all upgrade files were downloaded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. On my very last attempt, I think it took nearly an hour.&nbsp; It looked to have gone&nbsp;past the first phase and into the second phase of installing, so I was confident I solved the problem I noted above.&nbsp; But then I fell asleep.&nbsp; When I awoke, my&nbsp;login screen&nbsp;showed
 normally, but when I logged in... no information.&nbsp; No message.&nbsp; I thought it was successful.&nbsp; But then when I checked the version, I discovered I'm still on the original release.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to say, I've upgraded&nbsp;the Windows&nbsp;operating system&nbsp;many times in the past on many different computers I've owned over the years... and while there were install quirks here and there, it was NEVER this bad.&nbsp; Going from version 7 to 8 was a breeze in
 comparison to 8.1 to 10.</p>

            <p>Hi Robear,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>1 [a,b,c]. </strong>I downloaded Windows 10 upgrade from the Microsoft download website sometime prior to April 2016. I do not have the precise date.&nbsp; I went for this option when the automatic upgrade kept failing, over and over and over again...
 no matter what I tried (and believe me, I followed A LOT of tips from both Microsoft and other windows tech websites (like Ten Forums). I began the manual upgrade attempt in June and successfully completed it sometime&nbsp;around June/July 2016.&nbsp; Again, I did not
 keep track of this as I didn't think it was necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2.</strong> My HP Envy M6 notebook came with Windows 8.0 preinstalled.&nbsp; I upgraded it to Windows 8.1&nbsp;from the Microsoft downloads site.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>3.</strong> Yes, the Norton subscription had expired, and then I uninstalled it.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>4. </strong>Yes, during my many different attempts to get Windows 10 installed, I ran the Norton Removal Tool just to be sure it was gone.&nbsp; And it was.&nbsp; NO traces.&nbsp; I even searched the registry.&nbsp; I also uninstalled the Symantec Update software that
 was present (apparently they install this for managing updates to all Symantec software, including Norton).</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Yes, Avast! is still installed. I had the Pro version, but frankly I found I didn't need all of the extra bloatware installed by it, so I went back to the Free version.&nbsp; When I did the Windows 10 install, I had completely removed it.&nbsp;
 With the anniversary update, I discovered there is a "disable permanently" option, so I went with this.&nbsp; Windows warned me I had no active anti-virus software running when I did this... isn't this the equivalent effect of uninstalling it?&nbsp; Or should I uninstall
 it completely?&nbsp; I would go with Microsoft Defender, but honestly it is not as highly rated as Avast.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>6.</strong> I searched installed update history&nbsp;and found:</p>
<p>KB3176492 - installed</p>
<p>KB3172983 -&nbsp;<strong>not</strong> installed</p>
<p>KB3172987 -&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;installed</p>
<p>KB3159635 -&nbsp;<strong>not</strong> installed</p>
<p>KB3125217 - installed</p>
<p>It sounds like I should have these installed. I did a check at the "Microsoft catalog" but it doesn't look like this is possible... Windows 10 controls everything now, not like Windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>7.</strong> I did run a check and it found some updates for Microsoft Office (I have a work subscription to Office 365). Nothing else.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>8.</strong> I have <strong>Adobe Flash Player </strong><strong>version 22.0.0.209</strong> installed.</p>
<p>

            <p>I attempted to run the update again.<br />
1) Uninstalled Avast! completely<br />
2) Ran the windows update diagnostic tool - no errors.<br />
3) Ran SFC /SCANNOW - no errors.<br />
4) Ran DISM /online - no errors.<br />
5) Disabled ALL services that are non-Microsoft<br />
6) Ran TaskManager to identify any 3rd party running services - shut those down.<br />
7) Started the update.<br />
<br />
The process went to somewhere over 60% completed on the 2nd phase of the install (about 1 hour into the whole process), when it rebooted and showed me the desktop... and winver verified the original Windows 10 was still installed.<br />
<br />
I tried yet again... this time using the Media Creation Tool. &nbsp;I elected to create an ISO file for another computer. &nbsp;The creation process completed successfully. &nbsp;I opened the ISO in Windows Explorer, which creates a virtual DVD drive. &nbsp;I ran the setup file.
 THIS TIME I elected not to download updates. &nbsp;It took about 20 minutes to get through the first phase of the install (large font, white screen). &nbsp;Then the next phase with blue screen small white font ran (incidentally, WHY doesn't Microsoft provide an overall
 progress bar of some kind? User is left wondering why install hadn't finished after 100% in the 1st screen). &nbsp;After 20 minutes it reached the 50% milestone. &nbsp;At this point I kept a keen eye on the process to see WHAT if anything might briefly flash to give
 some kind of clue why the install fails.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
At 62%, approximately 1 hour from the installation start, the screen suddenly changed. The installation stopped and I was told "The installation ran into an error." Something about a "stop code." &nbsp;There was a QR symbol that I used to read with my phone, but
 all it turned up with is a page that tells me the installation was aborted due to a stop code. The computer then restored the previous version of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the desktop resumed, I was presented with an error this time:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f8bdcf12-bf61-41c7-bfcd-a62380a1f862" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f8bdcf12-bf61-41c7-bfcd-a62380a1f862" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is such an incredibly terrible user experience. &nbsp;I'm seeing plenty of on-line criticism of the Windows 10 rollout and update... calling it disastrous. &nbsp;Frankly, at this point, it seems like I have two choices:<br />
<br />
1) Abandon Windows 10 --&gt; go back to Windows 8.1<br />
2) Stay with the original Windows 10, until Microsoft finally cleans up this messy and fault ridden update.<br />
<br />
Your recommendation?<br />
<br />
Is there any visibility into how Microsoft is addressing this issue? &nbsp;Does the company acknowledge that the Windows 10 update has serious flaws? &nbsp;And finally, how long will Microsoft actively support Windows 8.1?<br />
<br />
Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hello Robear,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Yes, I verified those installs by going to view <em>Installed Updates</em>, and using the search function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I don't know why you're fixated on Norton... it's gone.&nbsp; No trace of it.&nbsp; I cleansed the registry of any leftovers.&nbsp; But WHY would a program
<em>not installed</em> cause Windows 10 update to fail?&nbsp; Makes no sense to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; Yes, the Media Creation Tool provided from the Microsoft website. If you want to verify I used the right software, it's here:&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</a>. Click on "download tool now."</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Windows Defender has updated to the latest definitions - "Definition Update for Windows Defender - KB2267602 (Definition 1.227.2105.0)."&nbsp; But why would Microsoft Defender create a problem for updating a Microsoft Operating System?&nbsp; Surely, Windows would
 be coded to deactivate or suppress an incorporated&nbsp;Microsoft antivirus tool like this.&nbsp; Are you suggesting that an older virus definition might interfere with the Windows 10 install?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Comment:&nbsp; I think I've demonstrated a good working technical knowledge of Windows.&nbsp; Just so you know, I've been using Windows since the 1990's.&nbsp; I was certified on the original Windows NT and Windows 2000 server.&nbsp; Norton is a dead end on analysis... like
 I've told you, my computer has <strong><em>no trace </em></strong>of Symantec software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've learned about WHDownloader, and was able to retrieve and install the notable update KB3172987, that Windows has strangely not managed to install.&nbsp; I'm going to see if having this in place corrects the problem.</p>

            <p>OK, the applying of KB3172987 made a small improvement. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Last time, the 2nd phase of install aborted at 62%.&nbsp; Now, it went to 71% before failing.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Unlike last time, when I logged in I was NOT informed of what caused the error.&nbsp; I was left with no indication anywhere to know WHY it failed.</p>

            Hi Tom34,
<br />Windows uses miracast for displaying content on other miracast compatible devices so the real answer to you question is no or not natively.
<br />however, chromecast does allow you to cast the desktop (duplicate your screen)
<br />open google chrome
<br />click the three dots icon in the top right
<br />select cast
<br />in the small window that opens, click the down arrow in the titlebar next to "cast to"
<br />select cast desktop
<br />then open the photos app and you should see it on both, your monitor and your chromecast device.
<br />
<br />hope that helps, please let us know if you experience any issues.

            resolved by good old DOS , click on cmd.exe in system32 run as administrator.<br />
<br />
move to parent directory and type in dir /x /a<br />
<br />
Find the 8.3 name of the directory even though it may only have 6 or 7 letters such as e.g. forums the 8.3 name may show up as forums~1<br />
<br />
then do rd forums~1 /s and this should get rid of it

<h2>            Unable to boot the PC stuck in WinRE mode</h2>
                    <p>HI </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope someone can help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My windows 10 disk just stopped working and will now only boot up as far as recovery options. I have tried all the recovery options available from reset to auto fix. It errors that it can't complete reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would love some advice on how to approach fixing this in a logical fashion. Really don't want to have to wipe drive unless really have to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Jon</p>

<p>Do you have access to another PC to download the Media Creation Tool and create boot media.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</a></p>
<p>If you can create boot media then you can use that to boot the system (change to boot from USB) and see if that will fix the issues with your system. The Troubleshoot menu looks the same but it is running from the installation media.</p>

<p>But Today i attached the power supply to surface pro 3, it doesn't charge, the LED on the charger was not lit. I reboot my surface several times, but it doesn't work. What should I do next? Is there an easy way to fix it?</p>

            <p><span>Hi KeithLiu,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We value the time you have taken to post in the Microsoft Community! <span>
Sorry to know that you are facing charging issues with your new Surface Pro 3. I can imagine the inconvenience you are experiencing, especially taking into consideration the device traveled with you such a long distance from the US to China. Please know I will
 do my best to assist and guide you in the right direction!</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please check the following:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>Make sure you have all and latest <strong>Windows updates </strong>applied. This is very important.</span></li><li><span>Test<span> if the problem is with the Surface or the adapter.&nbsp; Check from different outlets and locations.&nbsp;Take a look at the charging port and the tip of the adapter, see if there is any debris or corrosion.&nbsp; If you can, try your charger with a different
 Surface, and a different charger with yours.</span></span><span> </span><span>If you can get your charger to work with a different device, the problem may be with your Surface. If your Surface starts taking a charge from a different charger, your charger may
 be malfunctioning.&nbsp;</span><span> </span></li><li><span>Please read all troubleshooting steps presented in the following support article:</span></li></ul>

<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>Additionally, try holding down the "<strong>Volume UP</strong>" and the "<strong>Power Button</strong>" at the same time for about 15 to 20 seconds.&nbsp; It should do a reboot and if no activity, release and 'click' the power button one time.&nbsp;
</span></li><li><span>As a last step, (if you have confirmed the issue is NOT with the adapter) you can try uninstalling and reinstalling the battery drivers as shown below:</span></li></ul>

                    <p>Hello friends,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been looking all over the internet but I can't seem to find the Windows 7 Winter Theme which was available on the Seasons Tab as well as the Microsoft Store.</p>
<p>Can someone help me bringing it back or send a link to download it please ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had many memories with that theme and I have upgraded to Windows 10 and wanted to install it but I couldn't find it anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bye for now please get it on the site again Microsoft!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't delete anymore themes as they're all important for each individual!</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT:&nbsp; &nbsp;I have found small version of the theme and then used Google to find the big resolution ones and now I have downloaded them individually and created the theme back :D.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the download link which is not from Microsoft anymore but from me ENJOY!&nbsp;</p>
