    <title>Uninstalling Arcsoft - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Uninstalling Arcsoft</h2>
                    I recently had to&nbsp; buy Office 365 after many years using 2003 with few problems. I now find that my photos open in something called Arcsoft Photoviewer, instead of whatever the previous, presumably default, photo manipulation saystem was. I need to easily
 process photos (pretty basic cropping, rotating, altering contrast and so on). How can I uninstall the Arcsoft and revert to whatever the previous system was?

            You can use following options to uninstall Arcsoft. Let me know if you face some problem
<br />
<br />Option 1 - Through Control Panel
<br />Type appwiz.cpl in Windows Starts Search box and click it
<br />Locate Arcsoft in the list of programs
<br />Click it and Uninstall will be enabled on the bar above the box
<br />Uninstall it
<br />Reboot your system
<br />
<br />Option 2- If above doesn't work, use third party uninstaller named Revo
<br />Download from - <a href="https://www.revouninstaller.com/revo_uninstaller_free_download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.revouninstaller.com/revo_uninstalle...</a>

<br />Did you install a scanner? It probably came with the scanner software. Epson ships with ArcSoft PhotoStudio.

            Darn Enter key sent my response before I finished. If you used the default windows 10 software, it was Photos. Right click on an image file, choose Open with, choose another app, then tick the box to always use this app and choose Photos.

<p>Hi Diane,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; My Windows 10 has Pictures, rather than Photos; opening that and right clicking on an image unfortunately still results in Arcsoft.&nbsp; My scanner (Scanjet G3901) was installed about six years ago, so I don't think that can be the problem. It seems to have
 started since I was persuaded a week or so ago by an MS bod in the Phillipines to buy Office 365, after Office 2003 started to misbehave. Is there any way I can get MS Picture Manager (which was always satisfactory) to work with the wretched 365? Whatever
 sort of MS loony decided to remove a basic photo manipulation programme from a new version of Office? I despair !</p>
<p>

<br />Folder or application? 
<br />
<br />You can install picture manager in windows 10 - i have no idea who well it works with office 365, but if you only attach images, it really won't be used in office much. 
<br />see <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/microsoft-office-picture-manager-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/microsoft-office-...</a> for instructions. 
<br />
<br />Something installed Arc software- I have an Epson scanner, so i know what put it on my computer... i would look at any new hardware you installed. It's possible other software, such as a PDF application, added it. 
<br />
<br />I have a new computer i recently set up - its not polluted with other software (yet) - this is what i get when i double click on a jpg:

<br />photos is the default that windows wants you to use - tick the box if its what you want to use.
<br />
<br />right clicking on the file and choosing open with gives me this choices: <a href="https://www.screencast.com/t/RzHugt5uB5Yi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.screencast.com/t/RzHugt5uB5Yi</a>
<br /> if you have other photo software installed, you'll have more options. choose 'choose another app' to see the first dialog i posted - tick the box to use another app as default then choose the app.

<p>Many thanks for that. Several other replies to digest, so I'll have a bit of a ponder. I always worry a bit about installing third party stuff, and it irks me that, thanks to MS's short-sighted policy, I now may have to.

<p>Hi E,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for that. There've been several replies so I'll have a bit of a think before figuring what to do next. What on earth posessed MS to remove something as basically necessary as a simple photo editing programme ?</p>

<p>Hi Abdul, </p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the possible reasons why PowerPoint doesn't have an insert tab can be due to a corrupted Office application. In this case, we suggest that you launch it in

<h2>            Connected Accounts not Working</h2>
                    Like so many other people, my Yahoo and Gmail connected accounts in Outlook stopped working several months ago.&nbsp; I never changed any settings, they just stopped working.&nbsp; I tried every suggested fix I could find, and nothing worked.&nbsp; It's clearly a problem
 on Microsoft's end. Is Microsoft working on a fix, or should we simply give up on the connected accounts?

    <title>Camera broken after 14327 and 14328 on Lumia 535 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Camera broken after 14327 and 14328 on Lumia 535</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After 14327 and 14328 camera is broken, at least on the Lumia 535.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can't take photos with the regular camera app nor make movies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lauching from the lockscreen or action center causes the app to hang and sometimes show only a green screen that hangs even on 3rd party camera apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope there's a real fix coming soon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would be nice if this problem was reported as a known issue beforehand, so people could choose to update or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rafael</p>

    <title>Lumia 950 shuts down if screen goes off&#33;- OS 10.0.15245.0 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Lumia 950 shuts down if screen goes off&#33;- OS 10.0.15245.0</h2>
                    <p>A few days ago my Lumia 950 started shutting down on its own. This would happen when the screen goes off for standby. When I'm actively using, it doesn't shut down. I thought it was a problem with the battery, so I ordered a new one, and I still have the
 same problem. So basically what happens, is that the screen goes off, and the phone becomes unresponsive. Clicking the power button to power it up will not work. I have to remove the battery, reinsert, and then restart the phone. And this keeps happening all
 day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I came to the idea of switching on the glance screen to prevent the screen from going off, and low and behold, this has fixed the problem! It hasn't shut down in hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know why this happens, but I have seen some people posting here, and looks like it all started recently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My Windows OS version is&nbsp;10.0.15245.0. Wasn't this rolled out a few days ago?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am quite sure this is a software issue!</p>
<p>Can you please forward to the Microsoft engineers (or whatever)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm also wondering if there is a way to revert to a previous firmware?</p>

    <title>Circular Reference caused by TODAY&#40;&#41; function - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cracka69  say:</h3>
<h2>            Circular Reference caused by TODAY&#40;&#41; function</h2>
                    
<p>have not had this problem with this 5 year old spreadsheet before today. Formula is:</p>
<p>=(YEAR(TODAY())-2000)*10000+MONTH(TODAY())*100+DAY(TODAY())</p>
<p>as of today it tells me I have a Circular reference in this cell.</p>
<p>This happened after Excel crashed, repaired and restarted. I have checked and there are no named fields TODAY nor is there a User Defined Function.</p>
<p>Even creating a new spreadsheet and entering TODAY() as the only field results ina circ ref for that cell so it is wider than the original spreadsheet. This has only happened since Excel failed, repaired and restarted.</p>
<p>Any suggestions would be gratefully appreciated.</p>

            Hello Fedor, <br />
<br />
Is this for the recent Windows 10 Creators Update? <br />
<br />
Have you tried disabling all firewalls and anti-virus installations prior to actually invoking the process. Furthermore, this would also mean disabling Windows Defender but leaving the Windows Firewall enabled.<br />
<br />
<strong>Important Note</strong>: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you
 should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.<br />
<br />
Also, check Andre Da Costa's WiKi articles regarding the Windows 10 Creators Update:

<p>Unfortunately, also disabling the Antivirus Protection from Windows Defender (the only Anti Virus app I am using/have isntalled) did not help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I searched through the internet and figured out that the error from DISM diagnosis can be fixed by download the .iso of the currently installed it, mounting it (thankfully available through context menu since Windows 8.1) and then pointing the source for
 the /RestoreHealth DISM command to the install.wim file in the /source folder of the mounted iso. But even though I followed the steps as explained in several tutorials (especially in the official ones from Microsoft), even this could not help me. I am linking
 the dism.log&nbsp;<a href="https://ctrlv.it/id/25022/3986338992" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope anyone can help me out. I really don't know what to do anymore.</p>
<p>

            I already did - several times already. And have not yet received a single answer or reaction. Plus, what is even more astonishing to me, this bug is not even listed under "Known issues for PC" in the blog posts for a new build release - although I first
 reported it several months ago.

            This is any ongoing issue and has been posted on this forum many times with various fixes, such as removing any 3rd party Virus program even if it was never used as builders of system will add trial versions, also removing anything plugged into USB's/Media
 slots except wired KB/Mouse, also if using a docking station need to remove it from the docking station, and the most important thing is to post info about your system, after many attempts to upgrade sometimes the best way is to do a clean install using the
 newest ISO from the Media Creation Tool site for insiders from this link &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</strong></a>

<p>As I stated: I searched through the internet for hours and days. I already saw all these proposed solotiuns - none of them worked. And I explicitly do not want to perform a clean start, as I think the error can be fixed some other way.</p>

<h3> vidhuj  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do i select all pictures in camera roll without clicking each photo&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have hundreds of pictures in my camera roll on my Lumia 820. I was trying to bulk delete all pictures on the phone to make up space. Here are the options I see.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the camera roll folder, I see a select button below. When i click that, all pictures are showing to be selected with a theme colored border. At this point my expectation is that I will be able to bulk delete the pictures and videos, but I cant. When i
 choose the options now, it shows a a "select all" option, but it is disabled. At this point, I need to select the pictures I need to delete one by one. I dont want to click through hundreds of pictures to delete all pictures. I am not able to mark any videos
 for deleting. How do I do bulk photo and videos delete using the phone? I know I can delete all using the sync tool, but I want to use the phone to effectively bulk delete my pictures and videos</p>

            When you are viewing the Camera Roll, click the select button at the bottom. Then press the three little dots on the bottom right. A menu should come up that allows you to select all.

            No SD card. I do have some videos in the camera roll. On the select mode, I have noticed that the videos can't be selected. I will have to try deleting the videos and try the select all. Even if that is what is causing this, it&nbsp;is not obvious.

which of course is very f'ing stupid since select all isn't needed with a few pics, but sure helps when you have a large amount, which is the very reason to have a select all option IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!!</p>

Thank you for choosing Microsoft Community and posting the question.<br />
<br />
From your description, I understand that you want to know how to add a domain to Office 365 Home Premium.<br />
<br />
The feature of adding domain is not a part of Office Home Premium 365.&nbsp; It is only available for the following Office 365 suite:<br />
<br />
Office 365 Small Business, Office 365 Small Business Premium, Office 365 Enterprise (E1 Plan), Office 365 Midsize Business and Office 365 Enterprise (E3 Plan).<br />
<br />
I hope the above information is helpful. If you have any other questions related to Office products, reply and I’ll be glad to help you.<br />
<br />
Thank You.<br />
<br />

    <title>N73ME SMS problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sid1907  say:</h3>
<h2>            N73ME SMS problem</h2>
                    Here's another problem with ma N73ME,.....the phones is killing me...I recently formated my phone aftr backing up all my Phone memory data and also formatted my MMC.....after this I put back everythin and my phone was back to normal, or thats wat i thought,
 but then the SMS problem started.....this was actually the reason for me to format the phone in the 1st place....<br />
the problem is that once i get an SMS i need to restart my phone in order to get another one and then again to get more....and if i dont restart it and elave it for a while all the SMSs accumulate and when i restart it....they all come together.....I formatted
 my phone again aftr my 1st format but the problem is back.....I had backed up around 1500 SMSs which were ther on my Phone memory...is the problem due to that or is due to the fact that I have my MMC pretty full....I hve jus around 300 MB free...<br />
also I'm using firmware version<br />
V4.0727.2.2.1<br />
04-07-2007<br />
RM-133<br />
the phone has become slower aftr i updated it during my 1st formatting/....also is their any odr firmware update?!??!?!

            If you have a hugh amount of SMS reside on your phone why not set it to use memory card space instead of phone memory. Goto Messaging &gt;&gt; Option &gt;&gt; Setting &gt;&gt; Other &gt;&gt; Memory in Use &gt;&gt; Memory Card. It will ask you whether you want to move all your messages
 to memory card, it's up to you. Normally, it is better to have ample space of phone memory (&gt; 10MB) left. Also, your card(300 MB) is more than enough to acommodate your messages compare to only 40 MB begining of phone memory before you have to put a lot of
 things on it. Believe me you and your phone will be more than happy.

            <p>Microsoft Security Essentials is designed to manage the PC’s real-time protection against malware including viruses, rootkits, spyware and trojans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should not have more than one AV program providing real-time protection.&nbsp; If you opt to install MSE, you should use the appropriate removal tool for any AV software on your computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No antimalware program will provide 100% protection. The authors of these rogue programs alter the characteristics/signatures on a regular (sometimes daily) basis to help the programs avoid detection.&nbsp; All AV vendors (whether free or paid versions) fight
 a constant battle to stay ahead of the bad guys and keep their databases updated and current...in fact we sometimes receive complaints on these forums regarding failure of other AV programs to&nbsp;adequately protect&nbsp;computers…see these threads:&nbsp;

<h2>            Email on Desktop Client &#61; forever &#34;saved as&#34; in user&#39;s OWN PC</h2>
                    <br />
Apparently -- your "topic section (also has a SMALL RAM (brain) .. and can't hold the full question topic.!!!<br />
<br />
re: (my original topic -- was too long ..Of:<br />
<br />
ANSWER = Answer&nbsp; ? Such a small word .. but one NO-ONE at Microsoft seems able to "supply".. (without criticising the asker, or to antagonise all who come later, seeking the same answer - which isn't here - as an):<br />
<br />
Thus the tiny brain topic of:<br />
(revised into a new "smaller topic" thread):<br />
<br />
ANSWER = Answer ? Email on Desktop Client = forever "saved as" in user's OWN PC (I need an honest complete) ? ANSWER = Answer ?<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />
RANT BEGINS NOW <br />
Please note though: it's long - (too long for some of the Minisoft assistant's RAM to ever&nbsp;comprehend)<br />
.. so all I ask - is for you (all) to at least try to read it all -- <br />
In it's entirety.<br />
(before&nbsp;those tiny brain RAM assistants DO NOT - by&nbsp;offering their standard&nbsp;useless reply -- which will NOT be an: ANSWER ?).<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />
Would someone please explain, why NO ONE at Microsoft, appears brainy enough, to answer just&nbsp;a simple question..<br />
<br />
WHICH EMAIL DESKTOP CLIENT PROGRAM, is available now to DOWNLOAD AND USE - for ex-users of the&nbsp;XP &amp; Outlook Express 6.0 Desktop Client (yes the email client that actually worked), which those&nbsp;users of, are now being forced to work with NON -WORKING email systems
 (in a virtual cloud) within MS's near useless win 8.1 &amp; win 10 (with 64 bit) machines, and where one's emails (that are desperately waiting to be "saved as" and deleted forever from your servers in a cloud somewhere, and which&nbsp;need to be&nbsp;printed to PAPER -
 OMG that old surface mail medium .. (that a lot of people still need to use - becasue they neither have - nor desire .. electronic mail)..
<br />
<br />
As your CLOUD based email ..&nbsp;somehow cannot be "saved as" .. directly onto one's own DESKTOP folders via any decent (halfway workable)&nbsp;Email Clients any more.. as they (MS)&nbsp;DO NOT PROVIDE ONE.. at least not a PC based desktop version of one - that is even halfway
 as useful - as Outlook Express 6.0 was (just basic online version called "MAIL APP" - which is as useless as proverbrial "cow's lilly hangers" on a bull&nbsp;).<br />
<br />
And .. where oh where, is the ability (now long lost after XP's Outlook Express is no longer supported) for someone to "even get" their precious (or secret content) original OLD emails OUT of their hard-drive storage facilities, to even be able to bee seen
 - on one's desktop .. .. *yes* all&nbsp;those emails stored in&nbsp;a user's OWN storage systems, back-up hard-drives &amp; memory sticks etc., as our&nbsp;private aux. external hard-drives that contain all of our OLDER (saved as emails) from an outdated Outlook Express Program..&nbsp;??<br />
<br />
When&nbsp;these (now) DO NOT OPEN in the&nbsp;newer versions of Windows,&nbsp;.. as there's no on-board desktop email client program provided in win 8.1 ? (maybe not even in win 10 - which I am highly dubious in installing, as I will LOSE more of the programs I always use
 .. to gain LOTS that I have never, or never will, USE.!!!)<br />
<br />
So - where is the method, for all of us "original" windows XP users, to open our "saved as" emails ?&nbsp;(via a PC desktop client), On anyprogram capable of opening them now - ?<br />
Yes - all of our OLD emails - in "saved as" legal discovery&nbsp;folders, which for seven years, we all need to keep safe,&nbsp;in our external FAT &amp; NTFS back-up hard-drives.<br />
<br />
emails..<br />
TOTALLY DOWNLOADED, into the "users"&nbsp;own computer/ computer systems hard-drives, and external hard- drives, memory sticks, or even into one's pre-historic "documents &amp; or pictures" .. Desktop PC&nbsp;folders etc..?<br />
<br />
Oh and NEW emails.. (new emails - arriving from now on) THAT WE CANNOT DOWNLOAD .. (for our own ultimate safety thereof) after Minihard decided to STOP US DOING OUR OWN SECURITY DOWNLOADS &nbsp;.. forcing everyone into a useless CLOUD system (for all electronic
 email = mail) where the&nbsp;ultimate LONG TERM = FOREVER security of "our" secret and extremely personal &amp;/or highly secretive business type communications -- are now being deliberately (read that as arrogantly) left exposed (in a cloud system) .. to anyone who
 can "HACK" a cloud based system, hosted miles, if not many a country,&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;entire continents AWAY - from our own (highly secretive .. AND TOTALLY SAFE) - PC and external off-line back-up security based systems, by way of "hidden folders" saved&nbsp;on a memory
 stick, or in a back-up EXTERNAL (non-connected) hard-drive, locked away in our own banks SAFE, or even - for total protection - simply "dug &amp; buried" in protective wrapping, DEEP DOWN&nbsp;into a hole in the back yard, where NO ONE can "ever" hack into them, but
 where we can - at almost a moments notice.. reload and "print out, or email to a lawyer somewhere, when requested to do so, under&nbsp;"LEGAL DISCOVERY".&nbsp;<br />
Why can "no-one" at MINIHARD (I mean Microsoft) actually come up -- with a viable user friendly .. extremely easy to use, alternative desktop client email server program .. equivalent to that which we have always enjoyed working with..<br />
ie: Outlook Express 6.0 on XP.<br />
<br />
Please:<br />
ANSWER = Answer ?<br />
Without telling us nonsensical things such as<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;<br />
We (whom do NOT want cloud storage of important "secretive" emails)&nbsp; - MUST NOW only "use" throw away - instant message type emails.. that can ONLY be read "in a cloud" - (an online storage facility - somewhere miles away from their owners protection, - such
 that OTHERS can easily hack into and steal those private highly sensitive emails)<br />
<br />
WHY?<br />
Why can't your long term, older type people USERS (as well as freshly here- NEW private &amp; business people alike - even those with trade secrets THAT MUST BE PROTECTED OFF COMPUTER.. .. actually have their full right, to their ENTIRE email contents.<br />
<br />
Why must we "retain forever" a copy in a cloud somewhere, which - given enough time ..WILL BE HACKED AND STOLEN.???<br />
<br />
Why&nbsp; can we "NOT" simply save these in our "own PC &amp; computer land based systems, in a DESKTOP PC's memory, or in our "own" external hard-drives, where - at our "leisure" .. minutes, weeks, months EVEN YEARS from now, we can "safely read these" IN OUR OWN PRIVATELY
 HELD SYSTEMS, without being "forced" to have a retained copy .. exposed to the internet's hackers.. somewhere in a different country.. on YOUR servers..<br />
MY SERVER is all I want my info "stored" on.!!!!<br />
<br />
Where is the equivalent Desktop Email Client -- with ALL the original user-friendly functionalities.. that Outlook Express 6.0 has given me (and LOTS of other people &amp; businesses worldwide) ..?<br />
<br />
Why must we be FORCED to expose our email contents, to hackers YEARS FROM NOW.. in a highly unsafe "cloud based system.?<br />
<br />
YES -- I want Outlook.com<br />
<br />
However I NEED to have final total control .. of ALL of my electronic communication "mail" (email) in MY PC.. via an onboard desktop email client server program.<br />
<br />
One that is not "saved" INTO A VIRTUAL CLOUD - for prying eyes to read.. now or in the future.. somewhere remote from our own security concerns, in your&nbsp;MICROSOFT HOSTED ..&nbsp;"cloud" system.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately -- I doubt if I will "ever" get a truthful answer-- to that question ..
<br />
A Question for which a ANSWER is never given, WHICH IT SEEMS .. almost everyone with a "secret email" needs to know.. but isn't being given ANY constructive (useful) long term security answer "for".<br />
<br />
The (topic) word says it all..<br />
Yet no-one can offer it as an:<br />
<br />
Answer..<br />
Is it so impossible to do?<br />
Or is no-one at Microsoft. actually capable of producing such a program .. as we were (once) given with Outlook Express 6.0 on XP.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Really -- !!! <br />
(are you all that dumb? Don't answer that last bit.. as I already KNOW the answer to that problem.!!!)<br />

<p>Wow..<br />
ANSWERED.<br />
I hope -- sort of.. still not totally certain .. but it's the BEST that I can find, given that no=one seems to KNOW which Microsoft product - does WHAT job?<br />
<br />
But at least - for now -- this issue has been resolved (solved) by myself..<br />
Without any useful (or otherwise) assistance or HELP..?<br />
From anyone =- especially anyone knowledgeable -- in or close-to Microsoft.<br />
<br />
I have had to dig &amp; dig all around OMG _Google..<br />
To discover a Microsoft Email "handler" that I can install on the desktop - to "handle" all the email traffic that I currently generate, receive and transcribe..<br />
It's apparently called.<br />
"EXHANGE SERVER".<br />
<br />
Wow -- who would ever&nbsp; have believed that it would be such a weirdly difficult mission - to "find" the modern alternative to Outlook Express 6.0 ?<br />
Re:<br />
https://products.office.com/en/exchange/microsoft-exchange-server-2016<br />
<br />
Unfortunately though..<br />
THIS DESKTOP PROGRAM .. isn't at all "like" Outlook Express (which it claims to replace) as..<br />
IT IS NOT FREE.<br />
Nor is it available as a one-off -- forever mine to use "program" --It's a licenced product - that CAN ONLY BE USED PERMANENTLY if the VALID LICENCE IS CURRENT AND FULLY PAID.. (in advance).?<br />
So -- it's not the B-all end all (that) it claims to be., it's just another thou shalt pay (through the nose) for a service that USED to be free.!!!</p>

Interesting video..<br />
<br />
I may or may not export/import the old files from the XCP machine (as I don't think I'll be tossing it out quite yet, and can continue to use it as an offline easy to use PC for other offline projects I currently work with&nbsp; - thus will always have the old files
 accessible there..)<br />
However - for all new pop3 incoming and aux. forwarding of other emails.. ?</p>
<p>Windows Live Mail does appear to be a good option.<br />
<br />
Although - you did mention one thing I have been seriously considering..<br />
Something (as you said - most people wouldn't even consider)..<br />
And that is to actively RUN my own server, or more to the point, several servers ..<br />
Re:<br />
[quote]<br />
"Your server" is not good enough, unless you have your own domain and run your own SMTP transport. That's usually outside the scope of what most people want to do or understand how to do. Most people who&nbsp;wish to&nbsp;use email&nbsp;have a mail service provider, like
 Outlook.com or Google Mail or Yahoo or AOL or Verizon or Time-Warner.<br />
[unquote]<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't JUST have my own "domain name" .. I have FOURTEEN of them.<br />
Thus there's actually nothing technically speaking, to stop me from running all 14 of mine, in exactly the same way that they're being run, by your examples of:<br />
"Outlook.com or Google Mail or Yahoo or AOL or Verizon or Time-Warner" etc..<br />
<br />
Which is exactly WHY -- I have been developing my own ideas on running that type of server based email MX system, ever since gaining my very first Top Level Domain&nbsp;Name - back in 2002.<br />
<br />
Which is precisely also "why" I am&nbsp; investigating all my options.. in order to&nbsp;eventually gain the method, to obtain&nbsp;a "server" that is good enough.<br />
<br />
After all -- if my own ISP can "run" a wild-carded catchall email "supply &amp; demand" server system, where their "clients" emails are POP'ed down into their end-user's own&nbsp;PC's or even imap'ed.. as an ob-line server..<br />
<br />
Why can't any of my 14 Top Level ".com" ;&nbsp;".co.nz"&nbsp;; ".kiwi" &amp;/or ".co" domains .. be "run" exactly the same way?<br />
<br />
Surely it's ONLY a technical matter, in order to "set-them-up" .. as mail forwarding/ host &amp; dispatch centers.<br />
<br />
p.s..<br />
My own mail service (&amp; General ISP service) provider is now called SPARK (which used to be Telecom NZ for telecommunications with Xtra as the internet side of that telephone company's service.).<br />
<br />
Spark.co.nz is now the overall telco <br />
And since Telecom's Xtra merged with Yahoo a few years ago, SPARK and Yahoo's MSN service - is the New Zealand MAIN ISP (There's a few others here such as vodafone, slingshot, 2degrees etc.. but SPARK is the main ISP for NZ.<br />
<br />
As Spark.co.nz is their domain name I see no real reason any of MY 14 .. cannot perform the exact same type of email service.<br />
<br />
However - as far as I am aware, No One .. is willing to "merge" the old "paper/envelope system of surface-mail with the all-in-a-cloud internet email - method of delivering information..<br />
Which is - of course, exactly what I have been "setting myself up" for - during the past nine years.<br />
<br />
Now that I have a few PC's (instead of just a single XP machine years out of date) .. I feel well positioned to take that next "leap" to being a fully functioning transcription service provider, where there's many rural people who do NOT have an always on -
 or even a partly on internet service (some are even too far OUT -- to get a reliable "dial-up" service - on their telephone line) .. thus many rural people in this end of the world, being as they are, too far "off" the grid, must rely on an ever increasingly
 poor surface mail system, which is now being touted, as a partial service, down from a six day a week delivery to three days or in some areas, two days a week (with a possibility of a no-day a week = a completely non-existent rural postal service in the future.?)
<br />
<br />
I am well situated, exactly halfway between all points of the map, in the entire Otago/Southland areas of Otago, NZ&nbsp;(equidistant between North Otago's main center township of Oamaru, and Southland's "Main City" of Invercargill, plus equidistant bewteen both
 Wanaka &amp; Queenstown International Airports/towns and Dunedin City /Dunedin's International Momona Airports and every other town locality in between)<br />
<br />
And .. as I "like" to travel, (with a 4WD capable van) I could also easily "merge" a delivery run from a transciption email server, and that&nbsp;of a surface-mail service / and visa versa..
<br />
Plus with a T-Stick laptop .. could also "provide' a mobile service between those tow, for transient campers, who "holiday/work at non connectable sites &amp; river-camping spots, or in local orchards/vineyards etc, when people simply DO NOT HAVE ACCESS .. to their
 own (back at home) services.<br />
<br />
There's absolutely nothing to also "stop me' from arranging to get people to forward their normal emails, to my email domains when in this area on holiday -- for me to then text them or telephone or even "drive to them" to advise them they have important emails,
 that they need to attend to, and can thus "provide" via the laptop, a service for them, to formulate their replies, which I can then simply insert- into a reply format - on my servers, when back "in cellphone range, or when connected to the broadband service
 at home..<br />
<br />
At present, as far as I am aware, NOT ONE BUSINESS, anywhere, provides that type of always there, 24/7 email alert system whereby people on holiday (from anywhere in the world) can get a TXT, or a landlaine call, or a cell call or a personal "drive-to' alert,
 for them to be able to "instantly reply - vis the same supported methods, (I have two NZ 0800 freephone contact numbers, an Australian to NZ 1800 freecall number &amp; 8 cellphones on the house phone's answering service, all with text alert backup - from SPARK.<br />
<br />
Making my NZ Company - the best solution for tourists from within NZ as well as for any overseas tourist/transient worker.. to be able to "use" for the e-mail to surefacemail provider..<br />
<br />
;-)<br />
As - after all -- why have I been also "building" my own NZ Company up - to attempt this stage - for the past 16 yrs..?<br />
<br />
I have a small insider knowledge-- on this sort of "mail service" type of enterprise, with a distant cousin having quite an in-depth working&nbsp;knowledge - of all things ISP related (although my distant cousin = Alan Marston .. who started and ran NZ's other ISP
 = "PlaNet", wasn't too forthcoming on giving any useful verbal assistance .. when I asked him about this, and other PC matters, when he was here&nbsp;on a recent visit with me, whilst&nbsp;talking with my 101yr old Dad).<br />
<br />
Thus - my perseverance.. at researching more on this - on the current www. </p>

            There's no large technical impediment to running your own mail server, but many commercial ISPs--those that service most non-business users--have terms and conditions that prohibit running home servers. Check with your ISP.

            OK will do. However, (after how many years now.. 2002 till 2015) my ISP for the first domain name - whilst charging approx. $NZ16 - $NZ17 per month, ever since I first registered this Domain Name with them (via a WAP capable cellphone .. as an MX exchange
 Domain), is finally agreeable, to letting me have actual (usable) direct access to my own dashboard, thus finally, I am going to be (it hasn't happened yet, but when I get the new win 8.1 capable desktop email pop client working) they will switch me from a
 totally controlled, by them, to a self controlled, by me dashboard, where I will FINALLY have ultimate access to such things as my CNAME &amp; POP &amp; web-site A record details..??<br />
Not bad for a so-called TOP OF THE COUNTRY ISP "master server"..!!!!<br />
<br />
It has something to do with a recent historic case, where someone "else" complained that they were locked out of (by thus being deliberately denied access to) their own administration controls, against the terms of the NZ Domain Name commission.<br />
<br />
So - in the continuing saga of "unbundling" their copper network, to all other ISP's.. this is a result.<br />
<br />
Finally - I will be "master" of my own (original 2002 registered) domain name settings.<br />
<br />
I have always enjoyed such settings, with all 13 other domain names, that are "hosted" via another completely independent Domain Name Registrant, whom unfortunately .. is CLOUD BASED, thus do NOT allow any POP access, thereby forcing me to "pop" via my 2002
 registrant's services.<br />
<br />
But yes.. I am in contact (read that as have tried for 13 years now) with my originl ISP for all matters relating to my email services, and how I operate them.
<br />
The only large technical impediment to running&nbsp;my own mail server, is this... I don't "know" the (actual)&nbsp;technicalities of "doing" it.!!!

            <p>I have (today) however, discovered a work-around, for not being ABLE to directly "save-as" any emails from Outlook.com into my own PC's folders and aux ext hard-drives..<br />
<br />
And it's rather easy &amp; simple (yet extremely time consuming)<br />
<br />
All I need do -- is "initiate" the print option then, when able to "view" the print as page, simply select all, copy and DIRECTLY PASTE all of it, into a notepad, name it as the email subject (with time &amp; date added) then save-as (that notepad doc) into wherever
 the h3ll I want it saved.</p>
<p><br />
My work around, may be awkward and slow.. but it works as a finite back-up.<br />
<br />
Thus - if all other options for finding a desktop client fail.. I can slowly back-up the most important emails in that fashion (and just leave the rest - in the clouds).<br />
<br />
After all -- a printed page is often better than nothing, and I have several BIG SHEDS .. and a container or two, n which to store LOTS of paper.</p>

Oh the problems.. ?<br />
Where to start = which to choose.?</span></p>
<p>I may have to go Linux (but that will also mean a huge learning curve to get myself "up to speed" in a very short time, as I know NOTHING, of that operating system. ???<br />
<br />
Thus .. maybe I need to enquire down at Otago University, to see if there's not maybe an "Up &amp; Coming" data programmer, who is capable of "creating" a specialized email client specificially for my "own domain name server service..<br />
As again (it comes down to personal preferences)..<br />
WHY "must I use" someone else's "domain named client system" - and yet not utilize&nbsp;one ,,&nbsp;OF MY OWN DOMAIN NAMES .. (to actively "hold/create .. the specific client system, with my "own licence terms" .. that I wish to run)..<br />
<br />
Currently - it appears as if:<br />
EVERY TOP LEVEL DOMAIN NAME -&nbsp;seems capable of "being the creator/host" of it's own systems &amp;/or servers..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why can't I thus get help (locally here in NZ)&nbsp;in creating a brand new (different) type of service, hosted and held, via my own domain names.?<br />
<br />
After all -- if others can do it in other countries of the world, (such as Miscrosoft via microsoft.com), why not someone in NZ via say QUIX4U.com ? Surely it isn't too difficult for the "right person/group of IT persons.. to create&nbsp;an
Oh lets say QUIX-NZ ?<br />
<br />
After all ..<br />
I have NO NEED - to compete head-on .. with any other proprietary program, as NONE of them, actually do -- what I want as a fully integrated mail&nbsp;transcription program to actively do.<br />
<br />
Thus I may eventually "need" to get some very clued up graduating university students, to "assist me, and or work for/with me .. to program this in a way that will work for me.. even if it won't work for anyone else. (but can still assimilate itself -&nbsp;into
 the general virtual webmail system environment .. to interact with all previous versions of them).</p>

<h2>            The file &#34;File Name&#34; may have been changed by another user since you last saved it.</h2>
                    <p>When editing and Excel document and then saving, this prompt appears: The file "File Name" may have been changed by another user since you last saved it. In that case, what would you like to do? Save a copy or Overwrite changes</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Office 365 and save to OneDrive. No other users have access to this or any of my files. When viewing the properties of the file, the Security tab indicates 3 users: SYSTEM, brindiebee (my MS account), and ADMINISTRATORS (this computer name/Administrators).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a new issue. Before I was able to hit save and no pop-ups. Anyone know a fix?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Getting a prompt that the file name has been changed by another user while using Excel can be caused by a few things. This could be caused by multiple browsers being open in the case of Excel online or multiple instances of the Excel app. For us to resolve
 your concern, kindly answer the questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Just to confirm, are you accessing the file through Excel online or through the Excel desktop application?</li><li>If it is through Excel online, which browser are you using and do you open the same file on different browsers?</li><li>Since you mentioned that you save the file on OneDrive, did you share the access of the file to any one else?</li></ul>
<p>We look forward to your response to our queries.</p>
        </p>

<p>As with the original (brindiebee) questioner, I also am an Office 365 subscriber. To answer your questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>When I double-click the file in my OneDrive folder, so it seems to be the Excel 365 online. Just &nbsp;now, I tested by opening my Excel desktop app, opening the same OneDrive file, making the same changes, and then clicking "Save" - and it did not throw the
 error.</li><li>Chrome. No, I have not opened the same file with different browsers simultaneously. For my test as well as the error occurrences, I was using Chrome.</li><li>No, I have not shared access to the file with anyone else.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>This issue has only recently (maybe less than a month) started happening. It has not yet happened with WORD 365 or PowerPoint 365.</p>

<p>No, it's not possible to do that yourself. &nbsp;</p>

    <title>Outlook 2010 crashes when clicking link in message - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> per l bylund  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2010 crashes when clicking link in message</h2>
                    After installing the August Patch Tuesday patches, Outlook 2010 suddenly became quite unstable. Almost every time I click a link provided in an e-mail message, the e-mail client crashes and gives me two options: search for a solution online and restart,
 or just restart. Well, I would rather it didn't crash.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It seems (but I have failed to verify this) the crashes are especially for links including lots of parameters - Outlook ALWAYS crashes when I click links in e-mails from numerous vendors, i.e. where the links include a longer URL with a bunch of parameters
 specifying a certain campaign/sale or product. I use the preview pane for reading e-mails, but I am not sure the problem is exclusive to the preview pane. Also, I am not sure it is simply an HTML e-mail issue (but I haven't verified this).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Does anybody else have the same problem? Any solutions or suggestions to solve this problem?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm on a new Lenovo Thinkpad with Win7 Home Premium 64-bit on which I have Office 2010 32-bit installed. I have all the latest patches and updates.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>

            I found the problem. It seems it is some module of the Spybot Search &amp; Destroy 2.0 beta that can't handle e-mail URLs specifically to the Facebook web site...
