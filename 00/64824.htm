<h2>            Excel and PPT files save VERY slow</h2>
                    <p>I work with relatively large XLSX and PPTX files. When saving it taks ages for the system to settle. In the meanwhile the screen shows something like the attached.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I run Windows 10 on a i7 laptop, and saving a 120Mb file to the hard drive&nbsp; shouldn't take 20 min.&nbsp;</p>

            Where are saving the files, locally or to OneDrive?
<br />
<br />Those are significantly large files.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features 
<br />Scroll down to Microsoft Office
<br />Select it
<br />Click Change
<br />
<br />Now, wait while the repair wizard starts up.
<br />
<br />Choose the type of repair you would like to perform. Depending on the severity or availability of your Internet connection, you could try the first option, Quick Repair, which is much faster and tries to fix the problem without a data connection.
<br />
<br />If that doesn’t resolve the problem, then go back and try the Online Repair option. For my particular issue, I ultimately had to use the Online Repair.
<br />
<br />The repair process is straight-forward following the wizard. Note that you’ll need to save your work and close all Office programs first, and then click Repair.
<br />
<br />Then wait while the repair process runs.
<br />
<br />You will notice the repair experience is similar to a fresh installation. The amount of time it takes will depend on your connection speed and what the issue is.
<br />
<br />You will see your Office apps light up in their respective colors while the repair completes.
<br />
<br />Once the installation is complete, restart your computer just to be sure and launch your apps and verify if the problem you were having is resolved.

            Hi Thomas.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Does this happen with any files other than Office?  It appears to be some sort of hang, correct, but with display distortion?  
<br />
<br />First try repairing Microsoft Office.  Go to Settings &gt; Apps &amp; Features, choose Microsoft Office, then Modify, then Repair.  This solves most problems.
<br />
<br />Next let's try restarting Windows Explorer to see if it is at fault.  Right click Start button to open Task Manager, show More Details, then choose Processes tab, scroll down to Windows Processes, then further down to Windows Explorer.  Right click to Restart, click OK.  Restart PC.
<br />
<br />If not then go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 11 to check for damaged System Files.  
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Surface 3 display problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> njc_1000  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface 3 display problems</h2>
                    <p>I have a Surface 3 Pro recently updated to latest Win 10. I've had problems with it not appearing to start up, just a black screen - this has been happening since before the latest update. Two button reset has had variable results, usually eventually working,
 but I've just discovered that it <em>IS</em> starting - if I plug in an external monitor,&nbsp;the touchscreen is still black and the display is only on the external monitor. Strangely the screen is still touch sensitive, showing on the ext monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Settings only shows one monitor, and Device Manager shows only a Generic PnP Monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            Hello,<br />
<br />
We are conducting a follow up regarding your concern. Are you still having difficulty with connecting your Surface to the external monitor? Are you connecting it with a docking station or directly to the device? Also, do you have a spare Mini DisplayPort adapter?
 Did you try connecting with it also? Was there any difference?<br />
<br />
Let us know.

<h2>            Xbox Live down - can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t even play a game offline. Pathetic.</h2>
                    
<p>I thought this draconian issue was fixed pre-launch...I thought the <strong>[Mod Removed]</strong> at Microsoft figured out that ALWAYS ONLINE isn't necessarily always a good thing. Like right now...I understand XBL is down. That's fine.
<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong>&nbsp;happens.</p>
<p><br />
But why can't I play my single player game offline and the dumb thing sync with the stupid system gets fixed?</p>

<p>I agree this is just getting out of hand. single player games and video streaming services should be able to work without logging into the xbox live servers. even if you still require live for all these services (which I argue you shouldn't need Gold to
 watch Netflix) why not allow the machine to understand when offline that it has xbox live gold? that way we wouldn't lose all these services.</p>
<p>no gameplay, no video streaming, and no guide for television... when xbox live services are down you basically have a bricked machine. this is not what I expect or accept from a system I spent quite a bit of money on and then also pay a yearly fee to access
 the online servers</p>

<p>Quack Quack Quack. I'm a sitting duck! </p>
<p>Fortunately I'm more patient than most on here, so I'm willing to sit it out, but this has seemed a bit more consistent of an issue in terms of Xbox Wire, core services, and other gameplay crippling issues. I'm not on the verge of freaking out like most
 seem to be, but I must admit that near-weekly system failures don't reflect well.</p>

<p>Exactly!!!! I moved and didn't have internet for a short period of time and it made it nearly impossible to play games offline. I agree guys this is seriously getting out of hand. If you buy a car and drive it ten feet only to have the engine explode how
 would you feel? MICROSOFT EMPLOYEES PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE NOT GIVING US WHAT WE PAID FOR, GOD FORBID IF WE MAKE A NAME WITH A CURSE WORD, OR OUR CREDIT CARD DOESN'T PAY FOR GOLD! Our service is promptly suspended or our account is canceled. I know

            <p><span><span>Hi LaShanta,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. </span></p>
<p><span><span>I understand that you are having a tough time working on the computer.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I will certainly help you to resolve the issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 1</strong><span>: As an initial step, I suggest you to disable antivirus software (and any other security software) and firewall on the computer as a test and check if that fixes the issue.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Disclaimer</strong><span>: Antivirus software helps protecting your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other
 software and\or troubleshoot any pertinent issue, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to malware attacks.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Step 2: </span></strong><span>I suggest you clear the
<strong>Clear browsing data option </strong>of Microsoft Edge and check if you face the issue. To do so perform the steps below.</span></span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Click on the <strong>More actions</strong> icon next to the feedback icon present on top right corner of the Edge.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>Settings</strong> and click on <strong>Choose what to clear.</strong></span></li><li><span>Check the boxes <strong>Browsing history, Cookies and saved website data and Cached data and files
</strong>and click on <strong>Clear.</strong></span></li></ol>
<strong><span>Step 3</span></strong><span>: </span><span>I suggest you to </span>
<span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">run the troubleshooter for Windows apps</span></a></span><span> and check if it helps.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span>
<p><strong><span>App Troubleshooter</span></strong><span> is an automated tool which we have developed to address a number of known issues that can prevent the Apps from running properly. This troubleshooter automatically fixes some issues, including suboptimal
 screen resolution, incorrect security or account settings etc. You can click on this link to download and run the Apps troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 4</strong>: Let us run <strong>SFC scan </strong>and see if it&nbsp;brings any difference.</span></span></p>
<p><span>The <strong>sfc /scannow (System File Checker) </strong>command scans all protected system files, and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Press ‘Windows + X’ keys. </span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Click on <strong>‘Command Prompt (Admin)’</strong> to bring up an elevated command prompt.
</span><span><span><strong>Note</strong>: Click <strong>‘Yes’</strong> if it prompts for permission.</span></span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>In the <strong>command prompt</strong> type in the following command and then press
<strong>Enter</strong>.</span><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sfc /scannow</span></span></strong></p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>Also, try to </span><strong><span>browse inPrivate in Microsoft Edge</span></strong><span> and if the issue persists.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows-10/browse-inprivate-in-microsoft-edge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows-10/browse-inprivate-in-microsoft-edge</span></a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Hope it helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Do let us know if you have any further query on Windows, we are glad to assist you further.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Why has Skype stopped working properly on my Surface.</h2>
                    <p><span>I have Skype as standard on my Microsoft Surface (Operating System Windows RT 8.1 32bit). Skype has been working normally since I got the Surface 3 years ago, but for the last week I have been unable
 to make video or phone calls. When I click the Skype icon on the Windows desktop the message comes up “Oops… there was a problem” and “we were unable to sign you in”, when I click the “Try again” button, the same message keeps on coming up. When I go to internet
 explorer and go to Skype.com sign in it immediately comes up with my account and my main home page. It show me as “online” and is completely up to date with a list of my recent calls. However, if I move the cursor and hover over the video call and phone call
 and “send” icons a little “No Entry” type symbol appears and prevents me clicking on the icons to make any calls or send messages. I have a Lenovo desktop with Windows 10 that I can use for Skype, but I need Skype to be working on my Surface for business when
 travelling. Please help. ps.... seeking help though the Skype options is a really tortuous rigmarole esp when the "chat" option is not made available!</span></p>

<p><span>Thanks Ruwim.B. Very disappointed and angry. Not with you. With Skype. I use Skype extensively for pleasure and business as I travel internationally and need to be in face-to-face contact. I trust
 Microsoft and their products and I deliberately chose the Surface 2 Tablet with Windows RT8.1 when I bought it just 3 years ago. I specifically chose it because, amongst other things, Microsoft claimed “You'll also be given free access to Skype's International
 Calls and Wi-Fi hotpot access, making it easier to keep in touch with people all around the world. “ about the package. I forked out just under £550 for the Surface &amp; keyboard, and now to find out that Skype in the interests of “Because we want everyone to
 experience the best Skype has to offer“ have unilaterally decided to render my tablet useless for the major purpose for which I bought it, I am very very cross. Skype surely must have realised the consequences of their decision …. so what have they done to
 help out all the poor people like me who have had their systems forcibly “retired”. Is there something we can do to make our poor old Surfaces run Skype?</span></p>

<p>Is there something&nbsp;I can do to make&nbsp;my Surface (Windows RT8.1)&nbsp;run Skype? Do I have to dump my Surface? If Skype says it's will support running on&nbsp;Windows 10 - can my Surface be upgraded to Windows 10?</p>

<h2>            Folders in left column of File Explorer not opening</h2>
                    <p>I've always had the folders in the left pane of windows FILE EXPLORER open it's branches to other folders. This includes my NETWORK Folder so that I can access all devices and external drives via my home network. NOW I CAN'T. This is only on my notebook
 computer as my desktop computer is working just fine with access and folders opening. I've checked every avenue, opened all the help sections, gone through all the settings etc and nothing is working for me to get this notebook's windows File Explorer to open
 up my Network Folder.</p>
<p>I can 'double click' the icons in the right column (of external drives etc) and add more and more windows get access to files but this is both messy and stupid.</p>
<p>Why has Windows File Explorer lost it's way all of sudden. Yet another Microsoft forced update?</p>
<p>Please explain... if anyone has had similar problems with File Explorer and found an answer.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

    <title>Locked out of Xbox Live. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> killa ayce  say:</h3>
<h2>            Locked out of Xbox Live.</h2>
                    
<p>Ok so hopefully this is the last time I have to write a paragraph in a forum now that these are back up.</p>
<p>Here is the run down of my problem..</p>
<p>The other day I changed my email address, completely. I also deleted the old alias. Today signing onto Xbox Live it requested that I enter a password for the old email address, which shouldn't even exist on my account. On top of that, I have a list of passwords
 that I am completely positive I know, that aren't working. I also changed all of the security info on my account, including my phone number and email. I go to check my account, and none of the information I changed seemed to be saved. The main issue here though
 is that I'm being asked to sign into an account name that doesn't exist, and even if it did, my previous passwords are not working and I'm completely locked out. It's no big deal, but in the end with no help, it would be a huge inconvenience if I had to go
 buy another&nbsp;Xbox Live card. Personally, I'd get rid of Xbox and go PS4 I'd be so upset making another account for no reason. If anyone from the company can help me I'd appreciate it because I love Xbox besides all of this. Thanks. :)</p>

<p>Quick little update since apparently I haven't been assisted yet.</p>
<p>Fact of the whole matter is that Xbox Live is requesting me to sign into a Microsoft account that does not exist anymore. I deleted the alias and have a different primary. Plus the passwords that I originally and positively had aren't working. I guess you
 could consider this a bump. Help.</p>

<p>This same thing has just happened to me! I changed my alias, I then tried to log into my Xbox one account and it's asking me for a password for my old alias. Even though I know the password, xbox one is not accepting it..wth? I can log into my account online
 with my new alias (this one) just fine.</p>

                    <p>I want to burn a dvd using media centre.</p>
<p>I have burned a data disc using windows explorer and a second data disc using windows media player (initially media player kept telling me to connect a burner and restart the player despite burning the disc using windows explorer - anyway, this problem seems
 to have fixed itself!!)</p>
<p>In Media Centre in my video library, when i select a video and right click to burn to dvd, media centre informs me "Invalid application&nbsp;&nbsp; unable to launch burn cd/dvd"</p>
<p>Can anyone shed some light on what is happening / offer advice on how to fix it?</p>
<p>Big thanks in advance.</p>

<p><span>Many thanks for the time you have taken to reply to my issue.
</span></p>
<p><span>I started my enquiry with information that I
<strong><span>could</span></strong> burn discs from windows explorer and from media player. Since your first question was whether I could do either of these two things, I am reluctant to apply methods 1, 2 or 3 for the
 moment as I'm not sure whether your suggestions are designed specifically to tackle my issue.</span></p>
<p><span>I do have 3rd party burning software (Nero 10) is the one I use.</span></p>
<p><span>I have not tried to burn from media centre previously so I cannot say whether it has been in working order in the past. The only changes have been scheduled updates that may have run.</span></p>
<p><span>Many thanks in advance for any further guidance you can give me.</span></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A system may hang or freeze due to several reasons. Hardware failure and memory exhaustion are just one of the few. As an initial troubleshooting step, we recommend that you check for the latest update on your device. Select the
<strong>Start</strong> button, and then go to<strong> Settings&gt;Update &amp; security&gt;Windows Update</strong>, and select
<strong>Check</strong> <strong>for</strong> <strong>updates</strong>. If Windows Update says your device is up to date, you have all the updates that are currently available.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, we recommend performing a clean boot in Windows to isolate software conflicts on your device. To do this, you can perform the steps posted on this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>. In the clean boot environment, check if you'll encounter the issue. The link will also provide steps
 to isolate the possible cause of the issue. Once you're done troubleshooting, check the
<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong> section to revert your device to normal boot.

<h2>            Game problems</h2>
                    <p>having a huge problem with my games? Every app or game that I am trying to play is giving me an error code claiming that it is taking to long to start and giving me an error code. Also after I continuously try it a few times than it will work but the second I switch to another game I get the same codes over and over. I have hard reset my Xbox a few times already with no luck. Also it will not let me report this problem via Xbox insider hub because once again I'm getting the same error code that the app is taking too long to start for some reason</p>

<h2>            Odd entry in System Protection &#62; System Properties in Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have an ongoing VolSnap problem (deleting shadow copies and restore points on startup) so I have tried a number of things including running sfs /scannow, running ChkDsk, removing a few programs to create more hdd space and moving space from my data partition
 to supplement the C: partition.&nbsp; However the problem remains.&nbsp; After the the partition sizes I noticed System Restore was turned off on the C: drive (the only partition I normally have it on) so I entered System Protection &gt; System Properties to turn it back
 on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is when I noticed the anomaly as follows:</p>
<p>Windows (C:) is shown twice as -</p>
<p><strong>Windows (C:) (System)&nbsp;&nbsp; on</strong>&nbsp; </p>
<p>and <strong>Windows (C:) (Missing) on</strong></p>
<p>The data partition <strong>(P:)</strong> <strong>(Personal)</strong> and recovery partition (unlettered and hidden) are both shown and marked correctly as 'off' but another small unlettered and hidden partition labelled as 'System' with Disk Management is
 not shown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if this anomaly is part of the VolSnap problem but would be grateful if someone could advise how I can correct System Protection &gt; System Properties.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Hi Rommel Ram,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your quick reply.&nbsp; The VolSnap problem was my main concern as it caused me to lose restore points - the issue in System Protection &gt; System Properties was discovered as a result of my investigations into System Restore after losing restore
 points.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>It was suggested to me that my use of the VOPT defragmenter may have caused the VolSnap problem.&nbsp; Although I had no restore points, I do undertake fairly frequent partition image backups using Macrium Reflect so I used an October C: partition image
<em>(created before I had used VOPT)</em> to restore the C: partition.&nbsp; That appears to have cured the VolSnap problem but of course I needed Windows Updates for the period October to December.&nbsp; That was a pain - it took 12 hours of Windows Update searching
 for updates before I could download and install.&nbsp; This suggests a problem with the Windows Update Service if not a deliberate awkwardness on the part of Microsoft regarding users of Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue in System Protection &gt; System Properties remains but this seems to be only cosmetic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have noted your suggestions so I can try them should the issue return but for the time being I shall see how things go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            <p>Hi ElderN,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your interest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have listed answers to your queries numerically following the sequence in your post:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My VolSnap problem was, that on Startup, if there were any restore points the shadow copies and the restore point(s) would be deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The VolSnap service can be disabled in Service (look for Volume Shadow Copy, right click it, open 'Properties and select 'Disabled' in the General tab Startup Type menu list).</p>
<p>
</p><p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, I wanted to find out why I was having problems with maintaining restore points - the chief suspect was VOPT which when it was run to defragment the C: partition appeared to have corrupted some system files.&nbsp; This was not rectified by running
 sfs /scannow nor by ChkDsk.&nbsp; Fortunately I was able to use a Macrium Reflect image file of the C: partition created just before I installed VOPT.&nbsp; Recovering this image file to the C: partiton resolved the VolSnap problem albeit leaving me to do a few program
 updates and run the Windows Updater.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As explained in (1), any restore points previously created (either scheduled or manually created) during a session, would be deleted on the next system startup when the VolSnap error would be logged in the Event Viewer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, I could create a restore point manually but it would only remain for that session and would be deleted on the next startup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, this was suggested to me on another forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6) &nbsp; &nbsp; VOPT can still be downloaded - the original creator (who created software under the name of Golden Bow Systems) has died but his wishes were that the software be available in the public domain.&nbsp; It can be obtained from several third party download
 sites some of which tend to load downloaders with PUPs so caution is required. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I did uninstall VOPT using Revo Uninstaller at its maximum setting to clear all VOPT related registry items - this did not resolve the issue as, I suspect, the damage had been done to Windows system files so after rebooting the system there was no
 improvement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>8)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have done further research on Windows Update and it seems I was missing the July 2016 Rollover Update for some reason.&nbsp; I have now installed it and now await next week's 'Patch Tuesday' update to see if there is any improvement on Windows Update
 search for updates times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>9)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, I agree, often the solution is simple but one sometimes needs a little guidance to find it so forums like this, where one can get advice from other users like yourself, are a great source of help.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>10)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for the useful links at the end of your post.</p>
<p>

            <p>I suspect the issue is somehow related to VOPT but I am not installing it to find out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Volume Shadow Copy Service is not the same as the VolSnap Service so it sounds like you are disabling the VSS Service and not the VolSnap Service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe you are getting them mixed up since disabling the VolSnap Service would require some extra effort.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They are not the same thing as you can see here:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/be0d96d8-95a4-494b-b8f3-a31c40f1fe94" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/be0d96d8-95a4-494b-b8f3-a31c40f1fe94" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have instead somehow disabled the VolSnap Service by mistake you should enable it again (how did you disable it).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I saw the history of VOPT but don't think I am going to be installing it to test :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the VolSnap error logged in Event Viewer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>With VOPT uninstalled your RPs are still being deleted and how do you know they are being deleted?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it just because you don't see any here:</p>

            <p>Hi ElderN,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your continued interest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are correct, I did get a little confused about the Volume Copy Service and the VolSnap Service. &nbsp;Your Command Prompt image is very helpful - thank you for including it.&nbsp; Although I did stop and then restart the Volume Copy Service before I resorted to
 recovering the C: partition to an earlier date via Macrium Reflect, I left the VolSnap Service untouched.&nbsp; Since recovering the C: partition I have had no problems with the VolSnap Service and any restore points are left in tact so the situation is resolved
 albeit without me knowing where the original corruption occurred.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am fairly sure VOPT was the culprit.&nbsp; It is a very impressive program in many respects but I am probably better off without if it is indeed the culprit and it is that easy to cause a major error.&nbsp; I've been advised to stick to the built-in Windows defragmenter
 tool although I find it rather sluggish (slow but sure I suppose).&nbsp; I have previously used Piriform Defraggler, a much simpler program than VOPT.&nbsp; I has been effective, is quite quick, has never caused me any problems but has less 'bells and whistles'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The VolSnap Error was logged in the Event Viewer as follows:</p>
<p>==================================================<br />
Record Number&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : 2269956<br />

Event Data Length : 40<br />
Record Length&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : 212<br />
Event Description : The shadow copies of volume C: were deleted because the shadow copy storage could not grow in time.&nbsp; Consider reducing the IO load on the system or choose a shadow copy storage volume that is not being shadow copied. &nbsp;<br />
==================================================</p>
<p>Before I resolved the issue, I knew restore points were being deleted because I noticed that the free space on the C: partition was higher than expected after the first VolSnap error.&nbsp; System Restore reported there were no restore points and when I made
 the System Volume Information folder visible, I could see it was empty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My System Restore program window, such as the one you kindly included, was empty after a VolSnap error but now, since the recovery action, is populated with a couple of restore points (one created during Windows updating and a manual test inclusion).&nbsp; As
 system resources are a little limited on my system, I tend to keep restore points to a low level and sometimes clear all but the last when the system has been proving reliable for a while so I would tend not to have as many as you.&nbsp; I also do regular partition
 image file backups with Macrium Reflect keeping three or four months of copies for the C: and data partitions.&nbsp; Macrium Reflect has proved its worth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            <p>That's good that things seem to be working again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes when installing third party programs with lots of bells and whistles they will install themselves with most or all of their bells and whistles enabled or sometimes if you get to choose folks think that installing everything and enabling every feature
 is good.&nbsp; More tools and protections must be better!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not look at VOPT too much but there might have been an option that tells it to really clean up things on your system as part of its optimization process and that cleanup might be to remove temporary Internet files, caches, recycle bin, system logs,
 crash dumps, and maybe even Restore Points - although if it was smart it would leave the last one.&nbsp; And if you have it set to run automatically on every reboot it may have just been doing what you told it to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows has a Scheduled Task that runs defrag every Wednesday at 1AM (or as soon as it can) and on my 5 year old installation it seems to be working pretty good in the analysis for today:</p>

            <p>Hi ElderN,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are certainly looking after me, thanks, very much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just realised that although I had uninstalled VOPT from my system before I restored the C: partition using Macrium Reflect, VOPT was actually on the restored image too.&nbsp; It would not have been on very long at the time of the backup and had probably
 not been run or run only in a basic mode - anyway it is now completely uninstalled.&nbsp; I remember one thing I tried to do with VOPT recently before, restoring the C: partition, and that was to run the option to defragment the Page file, that is possibly the
 point that VolSnap was affected.&nbsp; I did not try any other options in VOPT - I certainly avoided any cleaning routines as I prefer to rely on Windows Disk Cleanup or CCleaner for that kind of activity
<em>('better the devil you know')</em> and I did not set up any automatic defragmentation schedules.&nbsp; I limit the programs I allow to run at startup to essential Microsoft services, my security software and Sticky Notes
<em>(which I find useful for reminders etc.)</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your scheduled running of the Windows Defragmenter looks interesting - it looks as if you tend to leave your system on for overnight activity.&nbsp; I tend to power off after each session so I would set aside a time for a manual use of the service when I try
 the service.&nbsp; I've used it on earlier incarnations of Windows such as Windows 98, Windows 98 SE, Windows Millennium Addition and Windows XP.&nbsp; It used to take a long time then so I tried third party defragmenters - none have caused me any problems until VOPT
 and that was likely my fault. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It's great having this transatlantic conversation (oh the wonders of the internet), cheers and best regards.</p>

            <p>The paging file cannot be defragged while Windows is running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some third party tool might put something in your Windows startup temporarily to run the next time the system starts to defrag it before Windows finishes loading (maybe).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the XP days there was a Windows program that would do the job (and also the registry) for you on the next reboot:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/pagedefrag.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">PageDefrag</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not my scheduled running of defrag...&nbsp; it comes built in with Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The built in Windows Scheduled Task for defrag wants to run every Wednesday at 1AM (and I am usually awake then) but it is also set to run ASAP if that start time is missed:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/15b8fab9-2563-4c41-970f-c546904d9c18" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/15b8fab9-2563-4c41-970f-c546904d9c18" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So if your system is not running at 1AM Wednesday the defrag will run as soon as it can and only under certain conditions so it won't bog you down while you are doing things:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a545b516-9275-46e7-8a25-3e7c12e8df29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a545b516-9275-46e7-8a25-3e7c12e8df29" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I never notice when it runs and by leaving it alone and letting it do it's thing hopefully it doesn't find too much to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can right click the task and run it whenever you want and you can see it in Task Manager running at a Belo Normal priority:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8b41dd6d-8fcd-41ad-a09a-904a89d708ab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8b41dd6d-8fcd-41ad-a09a-904a89d708ab" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When it is finished,&nbsp; the Process will end and you can read all about it in the Event Viewer Log:</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi ElderN,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the Windows Defragmenter information, that was very helpful.&nbsp; I'll maybe give it a go shortly and see how things work out.&nbsp; At the moment the service is set on Manual on my system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do understand that the Pagefile can only be defragmented when the C: partition is not in use so should have happened at the next startup.&nbsp; If I remember correctly, after setting VOPT to defragment the Pagefile, I rebooted the system and there were no obvious
 signs of activity before Windows loaded.&nbsp; I guess that's where the problem started.&nbsp; I had my suspicions later and thinking the Pagefile itself may have been corrupted, I followed a routine I found on the social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums site as follows:</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Try telling it not to use a Paging File:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click <strong>My Computer</strong> and select <strong>Properties</strong>
</li><li>Select the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab </li><li>Click the <strong>Settings</strong> button under <strong>Performance</strong>
</li><li>Select the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab </li><li>Click the <strong>Change</strong> button under <strong>Virtual Memory</strong>
</li><li>Select <strong>No Paging File</strong>, click <strong>Set</strong> and <strong>
OK</strong> </li></ol>
<p>Reboot your computer, and delete pagefile.sys if it exists. You may have to change the attributes with the
<strong>ATTRIB -S -H PAGEFILE.SYS</strong> from <strong>C:\&gt;</strong></p>
<p>To tell the system to use a paging file again, repeat the steps above, but select
<strong>System managed size</strong> in step 6.</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The Pagefile was running afterwards so I don't think I did any harm but it did not cure the VolSnap problem.&nbsp; However that's 'all water under the bridge' now after after recovering the C: partition to the earlier date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I am in the habit of powering down my system when finishing a session, particularly if its at the end of the day, how would this affect the Windows Defragmenter Service?&nbsp; For example, would it be able to pick up where it left off the next time the system
 was powered up?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers and regards.</p>

<p>Sorry to hear you are having trouble with your Surface 2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try holding the power button for ten seconds, release and wait for ten more then start as normal.&nbsp; What was Surface doing before this?&nbsp; Did you shut it off or let it sleep?&nbsp; Is Surface fully up to date?&nbsp; Getting any error codes or messages?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know what is happening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards</p>

            <p>Yep standard for surface 2.&nbsp; See my posts in other threads.&nbsp; I am convinced that the display hardware, the display driver, or both are faulty.&nbsp; This causes the Sleep of Death, also crashes of the&nbsp; display driver on the desktop and slow wakes from connected
 standby.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The disk errors, I think, are just the disk not responding quickly enough when device wakes from standby.&nbsp; Don't think it's a big issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd request an exchange device.&nbsp; Keep the pressure on MS.&nbsp; They need to address this display issue.</p>

    <title>Win 7 hangs after splash screen - can&#39;t repair or restore - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> erica and matt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 7 hangs after splash screen - can&#39;t repair or restore </h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I'm running Win7 Ultimate 32-bit on an HP 311 netbook.&nbsp; The other day the system froze, and after removing power supply to restart. it began hanging after the splash screen just before or at log in.&nbsp; I had installed a critical update earlier in the day,
 but rebooted the machine after install, and used the machine without any issues for at least an hour after that before it froze.</p>
<p>So far I've tried the following diagnostics, repair tools, and fixes:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Last Known Good Configuration</span> - booting via this option appears to begin loading Windows as normal, but then the machine restarts and returns the following message: "Windows failed to start. A recent harware
 or software change might be the cause." It then recommends I run Startup Repair.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Startup Repair</span> - runs for 10+ minutes and returns the following message: "Startup Repair cannot repair this computer automatically." It recommends I send information about this problem (which I've done at least
 twice). Here are the problem details:</p>
<ul>
<li>Problem Signature: </li><li>Problem event name: StartupRepairOffline </li><li>Problem Signature 01: 6.1.7600.16385 </li><li>Problem Signature 02: 6.1.7600.16385 </li><li>Problem Signature 03: unknown </li><li>Problem Signature 04: 21201004 </li><li>Problem Signature 05: AutoFailover </li><li>Problem Signature 06: 5 </li><li>Problem Signature 07: BadPatch </li><li>OS Version: 3.1.7600.2.0.0.256.1 </li><li>Locale ID: 1033 </li></ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">System Restore</span> - restoring to each of the last 4 restore points (3 of which were days before the known critical update) generated the same error message: "System Restore did not complete successfully.&nbsp; Your
 computer's system files and settings were not changed.&nbsp; Details: An unspecified error occurred during System Restore. (0x80070002)"</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">sfc /scannow</span> - One forum suggested running this at a command prompt.&nbsp; It returns the message: "There is a system repair pending which requires reboot to complete. Restart Windows and run sft again."&nbsp; However,
 I can't do a normal shut down and restart because I can't load successfully.</p>
<p>Thanks for any assistance!</p>

    <title>Windows Movie Maker scrunching up widescreen video when published, - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eatingaburger  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Movie Maker scrunching up widescreen video when published, tried lots of settings</h2>
                    It's been a long time since I've had to use Windows Movie Maker so I'm still using a machine with Windows Vista Business, Version 6.0, SP2, Movie Maker version 6.0.6002.18273.<br />
<br />
I started with a .MOV widescreen home video (properties say it's 1920x1088) and it previews fine in WMM but upon publishing it keeps scrunching into a narrow format.&nbsp; I've been looking up answers to this and I've already tried a bunch of the usual suspects:<br />
<br />
1) Video properties are set to NTSC, aspect ratio 16:9<br />
2) Under publishing settings I've tried various things from:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) "Best quality for playback on my computer (display size 1920x1080, aspect ratio 16:9)"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) I've tried some of the "More settings", including DV-AVI (NTSC, 720x480 16:9), Windows DVD Quality (720x480 4:3, which is not what I want), Windows Media DVD Widescreen Quality (720x480 16:9 but it still doesn't work)<br />
<br />
I don't get to select "High quality video (large)" as suggested by some of the threads I've searched because I seem to be using an older version of WMM and this is not one of the choices available.<br />
<br />
Strangely, the one only way to get output that looks widescreen (but really poor quality) is to tell WMM that the video format is PAL, which it's not.&nbsp; I'm not able to upload such a large PAL file to facebook, in any case.<br />
<br />
Are there any other suggestions for how to fix this with my version of WMM?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

            <p>I moved your post to the Vista forum.... not all MOV files are the same and Movie Maker might be having codec issues with it. Try converting the MOV file to a WMV using the Freemake Video Converter...

            Thanks for your idea.&nbsp; I should clarify that I had already converted the MOV to a WMV before creating the moving in Movie Maker (I also tried using an AVI source to start).&nbsp; It seems to me that the last step of publishing is really tripping things up.<br />

asks user to either Ignore or Close the error box.&nbsp; Whatever my option chosen by me, the same error-box opens up again!! This goes on.<br />
<br />
System is windowsxp Professional<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
