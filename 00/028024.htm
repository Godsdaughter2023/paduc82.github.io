<h2>            &#34;Save target as...&#34;. Outlook 2003</h2>
                    When I have used Office 2007 or 2010 at work, I can right click on links and select the option "Save target as...". This option doesn't appear to be available for links in emails in Outlook 2003, and I'd be grateful for advice on whether this is a feature
 of Outlook, or a setting I need to change in the options somewhere? <br />
I am using windows 7 Pro and Office 2003 Pro.<br />

    <title>Nokia C3 New Icons And Latest Firmware Problems - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Nokia C3 New Icons And Latest Firmware Problems</h2>
                    1. Nokia has changed the icon of OVI Store (only in collection), which is like symbian anna. Second is OVI Browser has updated to the version 1.0.1. It has changed its name to NOKIA Browser and also the icon, which is again like symbian anna (blue color).
 Third thing is that after updating to 8.65, a new bookmark of CHAT APPS have been added. That is also like symbian ANNA. So is nokia going to change only the default theme of C3 or is going to add Symbian ANNA like features in NOKIA C3 (i wish i becomes a
 smartphone :))<br />
<br />
2. After updating to version 8.65, i am not able to load communities in my NOKIA C3. It freezes on the home-screen. When I asked NOKIA they said turn off your mobile, take out the battery and memory card and restart it. I have tried this and resetting factory
 settings but it still doesn't work. How to solve it?

            They're just icons. Your C3 cant become a smartphone. Its not like its getting an OS upgrade. Plus the hardware cant even support basic Symbian, let alone Anna.<br />
<br />
Try reinstalling firmware for the problem.

    <title>Outlook 2007 blocks perfectly valid pdf file - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook 2007 blocks perfectly valid pdf file</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A user using Outlook 2007 sent another user, also using Outlook 2007, a pdf file. The name the file ended in "N.V..pdf". I'm guessing Outlook found the two dots dubious, because it displays the following message: "Outlook blocked access to the following
 potentially unsafe attachment". The problem is that the initial user also received beforehand the same file and his Outlook didn't throw any errors whatsoever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's not much of a difference between the two computers, so I don't understand why they should behave differently. After renaming the file so that it ended in "NV.pdf", it worked. But as an IT admin I must ensure that everything goes smoothly without
 my intervention each and every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas what's going on? (I know there's a way to disable the security protection in the registry, but I wouldn't want to)</p>

<p>There's nothing unsafe with that attachment. It's the same file the initial user received from another person. He receives it and it worked fine. His Outlook (2007) didn't block it. Wheras the person whom the initial user sent it to had the attachment blocked
 (by his own Outlook 2007). It doesn't make any sense. The pdf file is safe. So Outlook is wrong, because, as I've already said, changing the name of the file to end in "NV.pdf" worked fine. So Outlook is right when the name doesn't suit it? It doesn't mean
 that outlook is blocking usafe attachments, it means something is wrong with the matching algorithm.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why would you assume I'm using Exchange? I do work in an office, but Exchange is used by less than 20% (or so) around the globe. It's true that I didn't specify that I'm using IMAP, but even so.</p>

<p>Hi. I have the same problem. I found out that this problem exists only in Outlook 2007 and 2010. it appeared after updating. The problem is in the name of the file. I found out that if the name of file contains "!"or another simbols that I haven't find yet
 it will be blocked. Renaming helps or you can delete 2 updates KB3191898 - for office 2007 and KB3203467 - for office 2010. For instance in Office 2013 this problem is absent.</p>
<p>If someone finds another solving of the problem, let me know please.</p>

<p>Hi. I have the same problem. [...] it appeared after updating. The problem is in the name of the file. [...] you can delete 2 updates KB3191898 - for office 2007 and KB3203467 - for office 2010. [...]</p>

<p>I'd also like to thank you and others who've responded (Antoine_Leca who actually understood what I was getting at :) ). Things are much clearer now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, theoretically, naming a file like that, even if it looks awkward, is not a mistake, because the first dot belongs to "N.V." (it's an acronym). But now I do understand why Outlook actually thought the extension was ".pdf" instead of simply "pdf".
 It's an honest mistake that a common user will make and it's rather hard to make them understand how it works each time something changes in Microsoft updates. But at least now I have an objective explanation and I know where it stems from (the updates mentioned
 by maksmsk).</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. The reason why the two computers reacted differently was that the first user didn't have the respective update.</p>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is a sidepoint but in fact, Outlook (and&nbsp;any other&nbsp;program) still consider the extension to be "pdf"; the rules to recognize the extension are always: search for the
<strong>last</strong>&nbsp;dot (here, the <em>second </em>of the .. sequence), then consider all the characters after that last dot; the second to last dot is never considered in such a process, so is not part of the extension. If Outlook recognize something special,
 it is either the name ending in . once the ".pdf" ending sequence is removed (likely), or perhaps the strangeness of having such .. sequence in a name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also do not know exactly what was having in mind the programmer at Microsoft which crafted the change, or the security researchers which found the original issue that update was trying to fix.<br />
But if there is a real issue (as opposed to a mere bug) with those ..pdf files, they need to have a pretty convincing explanation... since it is all too easy to build a attachment name as &lt;name of client&gt; + ".pdf";&nbsp;and since to avoid that case on the user side,&nbsp;the
 programmers&nbsp;need to re-program an unbounded number of programs (including in the U.S.A., where firm names ending with ", Inc." or ", Ltd." are not uncommon) to swallow the last dot in &lt;name of client&gt; before buidling the attachment name: this is not likely
 to happen!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A user using Outlook 2007 sent another user, also using Outlook 2007, a pdf file. The name the file ended in "N.V..pdf". I'm guessing Outlook found the two dots dubious, because it displays the following message: "Outlook blocked access to the following
 potentially unsafe attachment". The problem is that the initial user also received beforehand the same file and his Outlook didn't throw any errors whatsoever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's not much of a difference between the two computers, so I don't understand why they should behave differently. After renaming the file so that it ended in "NV.pdf", it worked. But as an IT admin I must ensure that everything goes smoothly without
 my intervention each and every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas what's going on? (I know there's a way to disable the security protection in the registry, but I wouldn't want to)</p>

I have just started to have Outlook block pdf's as unsafe attachments from my insurance agent even after signing him as a trusted sender and re sending the pdf's. I have received numerous pdf's in the past for my agent without problems. My computer also did
 some Microsoft updates when I turned on this am and this might have something to do with it.

I've added my hotmail.com to my iphone, and as people send me email to my outlook.com it gets forwarded to that based on my alias. The problem is, I cant reply FROM my outlook.com email. And beings that I dont have an outlook.com password, I cant really setup
 outlook.com on my mail client. <br />

I've read that I could make my outlook.com email my primary, but will that blow away my hotmail? Will that give me the ability to reply from both email accounts on my iphone?<br />

<p>Deleting the Alias will make it available for everyone after 30 days. You may sign it up as a new account if no one else beats you to it.</p>

            I don't know enough about the iPhone to say if this is possible for you, but with a desktop mail client, you could set up a second account that uses the alias as the outgoing address.

<h2>            PIN refreshes www.office.com.getkey instead of showing Product Key</h2>
                    I bought a product key card from the shop I work at for Microsoft office home and student 2010 and I have installed it many times on customer's laptops. However, with my copy when I enter the pin on www.office.com/getkey it simply refreshes the page with
 blank boxes again. I have never encountered this problem setting up any other laptops - any ideas?

    <title>windows defender endless scans - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fulviods  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows defender endless scans</h2>
                    <p>Good morning,</p>
<p>I would like to have some clarification about Windows defender for Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>Whenever I run a full scan, it takes about 2 hours to complete, but after that, Windows defender process&nbsp;keeps on running with cpu at 10-30% and reading huge amount of data from the hdd for hours on end (sometimes for 1 or 2 hours, sometimes endlessly) as
 if the scan was actually still going on.</p>
<p>Could someone please explain the reason for this?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p><span>The CPU utilization for the Full Scan itself would normally drop off to 0 within a few seconds, so this is not the expected behavior. That being said, I would just ignore it myself. Identifying and eliminating the source of this kind of anomaly can
 be next to impossible. A simple alternative would be to just run Full Scans infrequently (once every couple of months) or not at all.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Windows Defender’s real-time protection (on-access)&nbsp;has you covered for any active malware that Windows Defender is able to detect (has definitions for),&nbsp;and Automatic Maintenance is already running a daily Quick Scan&nbsp;which will find most
</span>latent&nbsp;items<span>.&nbsp;Since Defender’s real-world protection scores are still subpar,&nbsp;you should&nbsp;probably be more concerned with periodically running third-party on-demand scanners in place of the Windows Defender Full Scan. This is actually a more effective
 security strategy, because the third-party online scanners and virus/malware-removal tools actually have better detection rates, which means that they&nbsp;can potentially detect active malware that Windows Defender might be missing.</span></p>

            As much as we would love to reply by email, doing so would prevent others from benefiting from any conversation that takes place trying to lead you to a resolution.&nbsp; When you setup your Live Account, you used an email for notifications.&nbsp; As long as you
 have the <strong>Alert Me</strong> checked at the bottom of a reply, any replies to your post will be sent to that email address to make you aware that someone has responded.<br />
<br />
That said, you indicated that Contacts will not sync.&nbsp; When you established the partnership, you had the option to select various items to sync (like Calendar, Tasks etc).&nbsp; Do any of those sync?&nbsp; Is it just Contacts that do not sync?

<p>Firstly I'd suggest upgrading the firmware,</p>
<p>Otherwise the n96 voice recognition is very inteligent, but you and it need to get to know each other, the more you use it the more you will train your voice and the better it will pick up what you have said</p>

<p>I found the voice recognition on the N96 to be very annoying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems to have a hard time coping with strong regional accents and you find yourself talking quite oddly to get it to work.&nbsp; Even training it is frustrating and not always guaranteed to work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a case of practice, practice, practice, then seeing how it goes. &nbsp;</p>

            Upgrading the firmware won't help in this case.&nbsp; It really is just a case of the phone getting used to your voice.

<br />I would also try resetting Skype:

            Availability of an app is completely dependent on the respective app developers. Microsoft has nothing to do with it. You can contact eBay Support.

</p><p>Welcome to the Skype Community Forum!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your Skype configuration settings must be obsolete. Try to <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA10634/how-do-i-uninstall-and-reinstall-skype-for-windows-desktop?q=uninstall#completeuninstall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
completely uninstall</a> and reinstall of the app. </p>
<p>Also, reinstalling Skype can cause your firewall settings to become out of date, which can affect the quality of your audio calls. To avoid this, you might need to
<a href="https://support.skype.com/faq/FA10953" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
update your firewall settings</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover, make sure that the volume for Skype under <strong>volume mixer </strong>
is&nbsp;set to high. To access the volume mixer, right click the speaker icon&nbsp;on the Task tray &gt; volume mixer.</p>

    <title>Why does my PST Backup take so long&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeff a. davis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does my PST Backup take so long&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My Outlook just took a long time&nbsp;to do its monthly backup when Outlook was shut down? Luckily, I have it set to only make a backup every 30th day. I swear it just took about 5 minutes to do one and nothing seemed to be able to interrupt it while it is doing
 it except unless I was willing to hit the CANCEL button.</p>
<p>And please don't anyone jump on here and start talking malware or viruses. Read my About Me. I have a clean PC and I can't stand everyone jumping in with malware excuses or concerns. I got so sick of the malware freaks that I posted a ton of stuff about
 my PC in my About Me or whatever it is called on this site. </p>
<p>I did a clean install and a start over a few months ago and I NEVER abuse the internet or open any unknown attachments. I put that all in my stuff here too.</p>
<p>So, <strong><em>perhaps I have some hardware that is failing intermittently or some intermittently conflicting software</em></strong>. I don't know. I would just really appreciate some help from an expert on those issues and I don't know anyone locally who
 can diagnose this for me. I'd prefer to not try fixing this with someone who hasn't done it before.
</p>
<p>I installed the maximum RAM chip that is available for this PC by buying it at
<a href="http://www.memoryx.net/mocolectapcm.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.memoryx.net/mocolectapcm.html</a>&nbsp;and then learning how to have my bios recognize and use the new RAM, which didn't happen automatically like I would have thought that it would do.</p>
<p>Also, I can't afford to ship my tablet PC to someone or to its manufacturer (Motion Computing)&nbsp;to try to fix since I suffered a very serious accident a couple of years ago which disabled me permanently and caused us to lose my business which I had just re-mortgaged
 my house to take about $300,000 in cash out to build the new real estate business after I bought a franchise and earned my brokers license from my state's department of real estate. Check this out at
<a href="http://1unv.com/ti8kjkc?1297563267" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u>http://1unv.com/ti8kjkc?1297563267</u></a></p>. I don't know if the tabs will work on that card unless you are my Facebook Friend and I don't
 usually add anyone as a Friend that I don't know personally.

            <p>My first suggestion is to change your backup frequency to every few days, rather than every 31 days, unless you're willing to lose all the changes you've made in your folders since the last time you backed up.</p>
<p>Are you using the PFBACKUP tool from Microsoft?&nbsp; If not, how are you doing the backup?</p>
<p>How large does WIndows Explorer say your PST is?&nbsp; If you stop Outlook and copy the file manually with Windows Explorer, how long does it take?</p>
<p>Is your PST an ANSI PST or a Unicode PST?&nbsp; In Outlook, right-click the root of your folder set in the Navigation Pane and choose Properties, then Advanced.&nbsp; Examine the "Format" field.&nbsp; If it references "97-2002", then it's ANSI.&nbsp; Otherwise, it's Unicode.</p>

            <p>I had put it to 31 days since I was tired of it taking so darn long. I did have it set for every day, since I have 850+ Contacts and lots of saved emails in lots of folders. I owned a real estate brokerage office and ran it myself before I had a bad accident
 a few years ago.</p>
<p>So, I'd sure like to set it back to daily if it will ever happen quicker!</p>
<p>The backup that I use is the one put out by Microsoft and it adds the item Backup in Outlook under File. I'd have to guess that is the PFBACKUP tool that you asked me about! I dunno ...</p>
<p>My PST is 1.38 GB.</p>
<p>And, do you think I should copy the file manually with Windows Explorer to see how long it takes? I've never done that. But I've got to tell you that I did do a Clean Install and start over with Outlook to solve some Security Essentials mess that me and
 a bunch of other folks had happening. Microsoft Tech finally talked me into going thru that big ordeal to fix what I considered to be their problem. They told me that was the only solution that they knew of and everyone else had done it to solve the issue.</p>
<p>So, luckily, I had everything backed up on a MAXTOR USB One Touch hard drive using Acronis True Image Home. That was quite an ordeal recovering everything with that.</p>
<p>Also, I use SyncBack SE to sync this tablet's docs with my desktop PC. So, actually, I am backed up twice on almost everything! COOL!</p>
<p>I need a bit of help on your last item. You asked me Is your PST an ANSI PST or a Unicode PST? Then you told me how to get that info.</p>
<p>But, I went in My Docs&nbsp;and right clicked Outlook&nbsp;backup.pst in my Tech Issues Tablet folder and chose Properties and clicked on an Advanced button and I don't see what you&nbsp;are describing.&nbsp;The box that I see it titled and the 1st line says Choose the options
 you want for this file. Below that, it lists File and Index Attributes with these 2 items checked saying 1. File is ready for archiving 2. For fast searching, allow Indexing Service to index this file. Below that, it is NOT checked in either of the Compress
 or Encrypt Attributes. But I don't see anything like a Format field.&nbsp; ????</p>

Don't do this with Windows Explorers.&nbsp; Notice that I said to do this from your Navigation Pane.&nbsp; That's within Outlook.&nbsp; Stat Outlook.&nbsp; In the Nav Pane at the left, right-click the root of your folder set and choose Properties, then click Advanced.

            <p>If I understand everything correctly - basic premise is that the backup is taking "too long" copying at least one file of 1.38gb (along with anything else included). If that's the case, what exactly is this backup being compared to in terms of time to determine
 whether or not it's &lt;too long&gt;? Too humor myself, I copied a 2gb file from/to the same local hard drive and it took ~3 minutes so depending on your system - time may not be unreasonable at all.</p>
<p>Just a few factors that play a part in disk related timings:</p>
<p>#1 - Speed of your hard drive (5400rpm vs 7200rpm) and on-board cache - if copying locally (or to put this another way - quality of the hard drive involved)</p>
<p>#2 - Available temp work space (depending on how a program does things)</p>
<p>#3 - Type of drive that is the target of where the files are being copied (you may have mentioned it but didn't notice)</p>
<p>#4 - Other processes going on at the time and priority given to/taken by the program (may not have anything to with Outlook or any other Microsoft program)</p>
<p>There are a variety of approaches you can follow to limit your exposure and be operational in less than an hour in most cases (hardware failures excluded) without similarly interfering with day-to-day operations.</p>

            <p>Thanks Brian! I went back and did what you had told me to do. I should really read better and then follow instructions! I right-clicked on
<em>Personal Folders</em> at the top of a section that is titled <strong>All Mail Folders</strong> and selected
<strong>Properties</strong> for <em>"Personal Folders" ....</em> . &nbsp;</p>
<p>I <em>hope</em> that was the correct thing to right-click! Tell me if it wasn't!
</p>
<p>Anyway, in the <strong>Format</strong> box, it says <em>Personal Folders File</em>. So, according to what you wrote, I guess it must be Unicode (whatever that is?).</p>
<p>So, is it still a good next step to copy the file manually with Windows Explorer to see how long it takes? I've never done that, so I might need instructions on where to find the file and how to do it, if that is what I should do now.</p>
<p>And, I'm not sure if I should try to work on things for you, Brian, and also for Karl, who has come onboard to help me. I really think that I should just stick with going along one path with one person. So I guess I'm starting and sticking with you. I hope
 that Karl is OK with that decision!</p>
<p>So, Brian, please give me a next step even if it is just to take a step that you had already told me to take!</p>
