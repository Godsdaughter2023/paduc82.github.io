<h2>            Sway captions</h2>
                    I've added captions to individual photos &amp; photos grouped automatically &amp; they work fine.&nbsp; But if I add captions to photos grouped as stacks or slideshows, the captions don't appear when I run the Sway presentation.&nbsp; I've seen similar questions asked before
 but, as far as&nbsp;I can see, without a satisfactory answer.&nbsp; Can anyone help or at least let me know whether Microsoft are actively looking into the problem?

<p>Hi Jeff,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Captions not showing up would definitely be a bug that we need to investigate.&nbsp; For stacks and slideshows, captions don't display by default, but do cause a button to appear in the upper corner of the image that, when clicked, cause the caption to display.&nbsp;
 Are those buttons failing to show?&nbsp; If so, would you mind sharing a link to a Sway that reproes the issue so that I can investigate?</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Jason</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes the buttons do show but that doesn't really help if you're trying to automate the presentation.&nbsp; It would help enormously if there was the option for captions to appear on stacks &amp; slideshows in the same way as they do for single photos.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also any chance of getting videos to run automatically rather than having to click on the Run button?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Jeff,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have definitely heard feedback before along the lines of getting all types of content to automatically show/play when presenting a Sway, but there is currently not a way to do that.&nbsp; With a video, you can use an embed card and embed an iframe from a site
 that supports autoplay.&nbsp; If you would like to add support for these features, I encourage you to post that in the Sway suggestion box:&nbsp;

<h2>            OptionButton and Plain&#47;Rich Text Content Control in Word 2010 and Word 2016</h2>
                    <p>I am working on a template with OptionButton and Plain/Rich Text Content under Word 2016. It works very well. However, when I try to use this template under Word 2010, once I click any OptionButton, the rest Plain/Rich Text Content all become un-editable.
 I didn't write any code for OptionButton click event... How can solve this problem? This template is designed for both Word 2010 and Word 2016 users.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Erin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There’s a possibility that the template you’re using is not yet optimized to work with Word 2010 as it does with Word 2016. In this case, what you can do first is to attach the template you’re using through the Developer tab and check if Automatically update
 document styles is checked in Document Template.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if this works for you. </p>

<p>Thank you Genevieve, I tested the template again. I found, if I didn't restrict the template only fill in, whether I click or not Option Button, won't affect the following Text content, under Word 2010. However, if the template is set as only fill in, once
 you click the option button, the following text contents are all locked for editing. I wonder, is there some coding I can use to get ride of those automatic locks... or should I change some properties of those Option Button under word 2010?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem doesn't happen in word 2016...</p>

            If you are using Content Controls, you should not be applying protection for filling in forms. &nbsp;Rather, set the Content Controls so that they cannot be deleted and\of use the Grouping facility to "group" the text that you may not want to be deleted.

<p>Thank you, Doug. You are right, I can use "group" to disallow users changing the template. However, if I "group" the template, my Extend/Collapse sections created by Macrobutton and bookmarks won't work well. Is there any way I can keep those extend/collapse
 sections uneditable as well?&nbsp;</p>

            This happens to me on Windows 8.1 everytime I create a new Microsoft Account based user. I think that's happening on Windows 8 too. To overcome this I always create local accounts and then link them to a Microsoft account.

    <title>iPad just tries connecting to meeting content - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ilpo juvander  say:</h3>
<h2>            iPad just tries connecting to meeting content</h2>
                    <p>I'm a bit forced to use two connections toward meetings I attend:</p>
<ol>
<li>Connection for voice (iPad Pro)</li><li>Connection for meeting content (Windows PC, for viewing and/or sharing my screen, no voice connection made through this)</li></ol>
<p>Reason for this setup is simply that voice connection through connection #2 is just two slow, I need to use second internet connection to get the voice up. Anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I accept meeting content on my #2 connection, on my iPad I can use the voice just fine, but there is a circle of dots going around the screen and my iPad Pro gets really hot and also eating battery really fast. It is still trying to get the connection
 up for viewing the content and there is no way to cancel this although content is visible on my PC already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This used to work just fine, I could see the content on my PC screen and iPad would not try to connect into it. Not sure if it was after my PC client was updated with Skype for Business from Lync client or not or if it was the app on iPad that was updated
 during the summer holidays.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype for Business client also misses the option to reconnect to meeting content if I do get it accidentally opened on my iPad. This was a feature in Lync client and that worked just fine.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Llpo,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It’s recommended that we use one device to join meetings (one device matches one account at the same time when joining a meeting), so please join the meeting using your iPad only
 to check if it works fine. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If yes, then we will focus on investigating the symptom “<em>voice connection through connection #2 is just two slow</em>” in this thread. To investigate it, we need to collect
 some information below:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Do you mean the voice connection through
<em>connection #2</em> has a huge delay?</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If no, then the issue may be related to the iPad connection. Please provide some information below for our better understanding:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Which app are you using in your iPad? Also, let us know the detailed version of the app.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Does it work fine if you configure another normal Office 365 account on your iPad to join the meeting?</span></p>

            <p>iPad alone is just fine. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This also works differently if I'm connected to Office 365 (meet.lync.com) or some other sync server like (lync.some_company.com, I have no knowledge over what this server version is, but it just works). This other company's server does allow me to view
 content on my PC and iPad does not try to connect to it all the time (just had a meeting few minutes ago where this worked just fine). Now in 15 minutes I'm attending another meeting hosted on meet.lync.com where this is an issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. voice connection through connection #2 is really poor, it has delays, breaks voice etc. etc. Sharing and viewing meeting content is fine. Well, that is slow as well.</p>
<p>2. Client version is 2013, 15.0.4849.1000</p>
<p>3. Cannot change to different network as this needs to go through vpn connection. Nothing I can do for this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This poor connection is really related to network issues, I don't believe anything else is wrong with that.</p>

<p><span>Since you cannot change to a different network to test it, I have sent you my test account’s credentials via a private message to determine whether it’s an network issue. Please
 configure it on your PC and then join a meeting to check if the voice connection has a delay as well. You can click the link below to access the private message:<br />

            <p>Works same way as the other connections I have been using so iPad tries to connect to presentation all the time and heating up a lot while doing that.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is </p>
<p>- no 'cancel' button to stop it doing this on iPad</p>
<p>- on PC side there is no way to disconnect from the presentation and let iPad to take over that</p>
<p>- on PC side there is no way to reconnect to presentation and take over from iPad (which was there with Lync client, something like 'rejoin meeting content')</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I close the meeting on PC side, iPad still tried to connect to meeting content and not getting there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I stopped sharing from own account and shared screen again, iPad screen just went blank after this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Voice in general was 'ok' early in the morning, but now that I tried it again, connection went to 'yellow' for sometimes.</p>

            <p>Clearly it is not supported - anymore - when this new Skype client for PC/online server was launched.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was still 3 months ago ;) so in that sense this is step backwards and also functionality from Skype client have been taken away/missing.</p>

            Something has - again - changed on the server side, this time for the good direction Now iPad is no longer trying to connect all the time! So it switches back to normal voice only screen when I connect to meeting content on my PC.

<h2>            MS Antimalware gives slow boot time</h2>
                    I have a very slow boot time: 3:19 sec. with Vista and everything up to date. According to Soluto 40% of that time (81 sec) is taken up by MS Antimalware; 30 sec by services &amp; ctrl; 27 secs by svchost dcom. I do not have any other anti malware installed,
 and there is nothing like it in the rest of the progs which load. Any ideas for this one?

            <p>It sounds like you have too much anti-malware running.&nbsp; You should only have one active program.&nbsp; Stand-alone on demand scanners are OK.</p>
<p>Please check the following and be sure to run the uninstall tools for any ant-malware you ever had installed.</p>
<p>Also check MSCONFIG. Ensure that only necessary programs are running at boot.&nbsp; To get a real in depth look at startups, get autoruns, free from Microsoft.</p>

    <title>Dell keyboard number pad - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bill froude  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dell keyboard number pad</h2>
                    <p>In the past 6 or 7 months I purchased a Dell Inspiron 3847 machine operating with Win7 Professional 64-bit.</p>
<p>The machine came with a wired keyboard and mouse.</p>
<p>Everything worked great.</p>
<p>I started into the Win 10 Tech Preview about 3 or 4 months ago.</p>
<p>Sometime after using Win 10 TP, I noticed my keypad isn't working properly.</p>
<p>The number pad won't input the presses to the screen.</p>
<p>However, the number keys across the top of the keyboard still work just fine.</p>
<p>As I seem to recall, the first release number I downloaded, the keypad worked fine; but I'm not 100% sure.</p>
<p>I just don't remember the keypad problem at first or exactly when it surfaced.</p>
<p>I remember once or twice using the keypad to enter password info without watching the screen to see what was entered.</p>
<p>After pressing the Enter key, I got back 'Error' notices.</p>
<p>It was only after a few of these that I realized that my keypad wasn't entering what I pressed; thus the 'Error' messages.</p>
<p>It was with the first update that Microsoft pushed to me that I recall the problem with the bad keypad.</p>
<p>After the second, and present, update (#9879) the keypad still isn't functioning properly.</p>
<p>The keys across the top still work just fine, so I'm not going to push this issue.</p>
<p>

            <p>I hadn't thought of trying to boot in safe mode.</p>
<p>I've just been accepting the irregular key pad as part of being a 'tester'.</p>
<p>I bought both the wife and me the same exact Dell computer.</p>
<p>Think I'll try exchanging out keyboards next time both machines are powered off, just to eliminate possible equipment failure.</p>
<p>Then I'll try booting in safe mode.</p>

            <p>In answer to the Microsoft Community query, no, I haven't found any answer to this issue yet.</p>
<p>My keypad portion of my wired Dell keyboard is still not working correctly.</p>
<p>However the number keys across the top of the letters works just fine.</p>
<p>With the crush of the season, I just haven't been able to pursue it further.</p>
<p>I haven't even tried the safe mode suggestion, either.</p>
<p>Thanks for checking, Microsoft.</p>

            <p>Well, I've decided to take the 'replacement' way out of this keyboard issue.</p>
<p>I just bought a new, exactly the same, keyboard on eBay.</p>
<p>When it gets here, I'm going to take mine out of service and plug in the new one.</p>
<p>Just on the outside chance that it's a hardware issue.</p>
<p>Sure hope that solves the non-functioning key pad.</p>

<p>Dec. 23rd-</p>
<p>I went ahead and bought a new identical replacement keyboard on eBay.</p>
<p>Just received the new keyboard in today's mail.</p>
<p>With the computer turned off, I took out the original and plugged in the replacement boards.</p>
<p>Alas!! &nbsp;This key pad has the same problem as the original.</p>
<p>Number keypad doesn't input the key presses correctly, but the numbers across the top work just fine.</p>
<p>Guess it must be the keyboard driver file.</p>
<p>For some reason I can't get the keyboard driver file from Dell.</p>
<p>Oh well, hope the next update fixes the problem.</p>

            You still can. Go to the People module, select the Contact(s) you want to categorize and click "Categorize" on the Ribbon.

<h2>            Excel 2010 No Longer Able to Open Multiple Windows</h2>
                    <p>Previously, I was able to use the Microsoft Fix-It located below to have Excel 2010 open multiple windows. But after performing updates, it no longer functions. I can see all the registry changes that the Fix-It applied are still in the registry. Does anyone
 know what caused the break?</p>

<p>
</p><p>How do I fix this?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>I resolved the problem after trying several steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It could be as simple as un-sync'ing the Outlook Contacts and re-sync'ing them back again. &nbsp;To do this from Outlook for iOS...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select Settings</p>
<p>Select the Email account</p>
<p>Select Advanced Settings</p>
<p>Toggle "Save Contact to Device" off and on again</p>
<p>
</p><p>WARNING: The impact of doing this, is if you had previously added detail to the sync'd contacts, via iOS Contacts, such as a portrait picture, these will be lost. &nbsp;My Favourites contacts which were sync'd from Outlook have now lost the portrait pictures
 that I had added post sync'ing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had tried un-installing Outlook iOS, re-installing and adding my Exchange account but that didn't resolve the problem. &nbsp;In fact, that made it worse. &nbsp;The particular contact, missing the mobile number was duplicated in iOS Contacts. &nbsp;The original sync'd
 contact with the missing mobile number and now an additional one, but hey, the additional one had a mobile number! &nbsp;It was after this that I performed my simple suggestion at the start of this post, which removed the original contact with the missing mobile
 number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I do recall, for the particular contact, that was missing the mobile number in iOS Contacts, was that when it was first sync'd there was no mobile number. &nbsp;The mobile number was added later, in Outlook for Windows, and was OK in Outlook for iOS, but
 then failed to sync with iOS Contacts. &nbsp;I also noted during this exercise that there was additional email display name values for email2 and email3 with no valid email addresses, and after I removed them via Outlook for Windows, again the changes were OK in
 Outlook for iOS, but failed to be sync'd with iOS Contacts. &nbsp;Conclusion, the sync features of iOS Outlook with iOS Contacts are not bullet proof!</p>

<h2>            How to remove or replace a colour category once it&#39;s in the email. thanks</h2>
                    I liked the 'mark as unread' option before, so even if it was 'read' it was obvious I needed to reply to it later. So am using the colour category instead which doesn't work as well for that. So I added a 2nd colour to the same email by mistake, and can't
 see (even online) how to remove it so I have double colours. Help please and thanks.&nbsp;

<p>I'm a simple user, with many needs, i install so many wonderfull apps from nokia store, and test apps from nokia beta labs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>there is so many widgets and apps i use, and probably there is so many people that has the same problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>there is no enough space on the home screen to put all widgets i going to use,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>nokia never updates a phone between operative systems, so is imposible a update from symbyan s60 to symbian^3 and this feature is necesary</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i recently find "spb shell" this giveme multiple desktops thats cool, but i can't use all the nokia widgets so i may ask if there is a plan o posibility of a update to s60 to make this posible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and if is not posible the creation into nokia labs of a program like spb shell that create a fake multiple desktop but compatible with the nokia widgets, with a look and fell like the current home screen do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>please all people with this problem post here to aks for this feature is going to make your phone more friendly</p>

<p>&nbsp;Can I ask what phone you are using? If it is one of the S60 5th edition phones then I don't think</p>
<p>multiple home screens will ever be implemented.</p>
<p>&nbsp;As for Symbian^3 devices, there are 3 home screens to put your apps and widgets on, but I would prefer a couple of extra homescreens in addition to the 3 that are already there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I'm sure many others share the same opinion that more homescreens is a must in future firmware upgrades.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

<p>and if is not posible the creation into nokia labs of a program like spb shell that create a fake multiple desktop but compatible with the nokia widgets, with a look and fell like the current home screen do.</p>

<p>please all people with this problem post here to aks for this feature is going to make your phone more friendly</p>

<p>Used to think the same way. But there is only so many apps that I used regularly, which meant that many apps sat on the home screen, was never used regularly and it only looked good that I 've filled up the screen.</p>

            well that says the page, but in case of nokia battery monitor it start to give a error of permisions says i need to removed and add again, but it stay saying the same. so, the compatibility give problems, in the other hand widgets as nokia bots and probably
 other give the same problem, there is no better solution that one given for the original programers XD

            i'm using a C6-00 this model shares the same OS with N97 and mini, it a nice update from my old phone, like rayhipkiss says the perfect solution is a firmware update, but i see this moment far on the future if users don't ask for it on the current models,
 nokia probably says we need to change the phone to a symbian^3 and this can be a easy change

            maybe nokuzer is right there is so many apps that can fill the screen but 3 home screens like the symbian^3 give the chance to sort items, put more accessible on the first desktops and less important on secondary,<br />

well probabilities are infinite

            I know what you mean OP. I've had the same gripe with my N97. But now I've switched to N8 and I find two homescreens to be the perfect sweet spot for me. Will Nokia provide an update for 5th edition with more homescreens? I don't think so. My full two
 screens take pretty big chunk of RAM. 5th edition devices are simply underpowered when it comes to memory.

<p>krisq, if two screens take too much ram, and programs like spb shells make 4 with less resources, to me says nokia is far from the rigth solution, and with more work can make a better solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>by other hand i read that hackers make a instaler for the 5800 XM, to install Symbian3 and it no use much memory with the 3 desktops, can be the widgets you are using that use that amount of ram</p>

<p>Have the N8 -never thought I'd need three home screens, because of the slide it is easy to go from one to the other. Now i use all three. keep the main one simple clock, date profile and favorite contacts -second for email/ messaging and web short cuts and
 the third for applciations.</p>

            Plenty of people is not using SPB Shell just because it uses too much RAM. So no, multiple homescreens on 5th edition simply won't happen. Would love be proven wrong though.

    <title>Image in Access 2007 report not printing - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Image in Access 2007 report not printing</h2>
                    <p>I created a report in Access 2007. I inserted a picture into the report using the "Image" control. When I preview the report, the picture&nbsp;is present in the preview. However, when I then print the report, everything prints except the picture. I checked the
 "page setup" to make sure that the "print data only" was not selected. I also verified that the "display when" property for the picture was set to "always". Picture would not print.</p>
<p>I tried the same picture in an Excel 2007 spreadsheet. It printed okay. So the printer is working fine. But for some reason Access won't print the picture though it shows up in the print preview. What's wrong??</p>
                </div>

            <p>I have narrowed the problem further. I'll explain, but first I should mention I only have one printer. So I did as you suggested and checked for the latest driver. I had the latest, but I downloaded it again an re-installed incase something had gotten messed
 up.</p>
<p>The problem remained. But by accident I stumbled upon a further clue to the problem. Previously, I had used the "DoCmd.OpenReport" with the "acViewPreview".&nbsp;Instead this time I chose the&nbsp;option "acViewNormal". It worked. Picture printed. When I changed it
 back to "acViewPreview" the picture shows up in the preview. Then when I manually did a "Print Preview" from the ribbon, the&nbsp;report printed but without the pictures. So there appears to be some kind of bug in the Print Preview of a report. Otherwise Access
 2007 will print the picture, but not from a preview.</p>

            Can confirm that I just had this problem and my printer settings (on a Canon IP4500) were set to FAST (i.e. draft) - changed to standard printing quality and the image printed just fine.

    <title>Auto Save message and adding fields&#63;&#39;s in Access 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> annmorales  say:</h3>
<h2>            Auto Save message and adding fields&#63;&#39;s in Access 2016</h2>
                    <p>I have 2 questions regarding Access 2016.</p>
<p>1) My supervisor wants to know if the save message can be hidden/deleted.... from a split form after one has already filtered, hidden, etc.... I always thought that those messages were automated by the program.</p>
<p>Any searches performed within the split form will be exported to Excel and saved as an excel spreadsheet and then reformatted. &nbsp;If one accidentally clicks yes to the save message within Access should I assume that what will be saved are the results of the
 search <strong>ONLY</strong> but the split form will remain intact? &nbsp;If that is the case, then one could click cancel without any consequences.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) My supervisor also wants to know, based on knowledge from the programmer's of our purchasing program for Weill Cornell Medicine, if fields can be added to the db in a future. &nbsp;The purchasing program is going to be modified/altered but I have not been
 given any specs whatsoever. &nbsp;I will have to revise the db which goes live this Monday (July 31st) but my IT person doesn't know when the changes will take place within Purchasing. He said it could be months, years, sooner or later than that. If fields can
 be added to a table (db) which would already be in existence, then wouldn't the snowball effect occur throughout the entire db affecting all of the components? &nbsp;Is this possible or even wise to do? &nbsp;I haven't read or seen such an example but I could be totally
 incorrect. &nbsp;If it is not possible or advisable, then I assume I would have to recreate the entire db. Presently, I have created 2 db's each of which is 100% completed, tested and functional. One is complex but the other not as much. &nbsp;The more complex db would
 be affected due to the changes made in Purchasing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly advise with specs if necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.<br />
</p>

<p>Re #1: you should install a test version of the program, connected to a test version of the database, so you can safely experiment.</p>
<p>Or create a split form in one of the sample databases (File &gt; New) and experiment with that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Re #2: that is a great question for the vendor of that software. Contact their sales or support department. It seems unlikely, because for extensive changes you need the source code for the program, and most commercial software is not sold that way.</p>
<p>It also seems shortsighted to buy a program that you know needs to be modified before you know if that's possible. Only government agencies would do that (grin).</p>

<p>I'm a little confused. Are you talking about a purchased Access program or one you are developing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>#1 I suspect the save message you are getting is about the form design, not the data. And yes that can be suppressed by controlling what happens when you close a form.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2 If you are talking about a custom designed Access app, yes it can be modified anywhere along the line. But if you are talking about a purchased app, then you have to ask the vendor.</p>

<p>Thank you both for your responses. I am speaking about an Access db that I designed at work using the company computer which contains the entire MS Office Suite 2016. &nbsp;I haven't purchased anything via my company nor has my IT department told me of any such
 purchase. &nbsp;Is that what you are asking? If I understood your responses well,</p>
<p>&nbsp;In reference to questions</p>
<p>
</p><p>#1: &nbsp; If the save message is referring to the design, not the data, then what would happen if one of my colleagues accidentally clicked yes? &nbsp;Wouldn't the design of the split form be altered permanently which is exactly what my supervisor and I don't want?
 &nbsp;Wouldn't I then be forced to create another split form with the original design or copy/paste it from the the untouched completed db? Hence my original question of whether the save message can be hidden at all from all users? &nbsp;I also plan on experimenting
 as Tom suggested.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2: &nbsp; I am speaking about adding a field related to purchasing ( I don't have any ideas for new fields within my db for it already has much valuable information). &nbsp;It would not at all be a purchased app but another descriptive piece of information. &nbsp;If I
 understood correctly, I could add another field to the table already in use and then add it to the query, form, report, etc.... without causing damage or loss of &nbsp;integrity to the db? If I generated a report including the previous records, would those records
 show a blank space within the newly added fields? &nbsp;Is that correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again for your explanations and expertise; I greatly appreciate your responses. &nbsp;I plan on printing and showing my supervisor this conversation.</p>

<p>First, you were the one who mentioned a purchasing program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#1 The reason they are being prompted to save is because the user has probably changed the filter or sort order for the form. These are considered design changes because they change properties of the form. So they would save the form with whatever filter
 or sort they put in. But this can be prevented. Add your own Close button (and disable the built in one or use the On Close event to close the form without saving the changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2 And yes, you can modify the table(s) as you need. If you don't fill in the field in previous records, then it would appear empty when used in forms and reports.</p>

            Thank you so much for the information. &nbsp;The split form would have definitely had changes made to it for filtering. I will definitely add my own Close button. &nbsp;Would that Close button contain a macro (On Close Event) to then close the form without saving
 the changes? &nbsp;If I remember correctly that is an option. &nbsp;I don't have access to the db at the moment. How exactly would I disable the built in button? Thank you again for such great answers to my questions.

<p>I was able to disable the Close button on the Format Tab of the property sheet and then created a Close button via the Command Button Wizard (Design tab) using Form Operations/CloseForm/Text named it Close Form/Command named it Close Form but still received
 the same message. </p>
<p>I then tried all again, went back to the Property Sheet/Format/Close Button/No. That does work fine.</p>
<p>I also tried</p>
<p>Property Sheet/Event/On Close/ was asked to choose between Event Procedure or a Macro that I have created. I was also given the Choose Builder option.</p>

            On the Close button you create in the Wizard. As soon as you place the button. then hit Finish in the Wizard. then in the Events tab select the On click event and use the Code Builder option. That's where you place the code I gave you.

    <title>Copy to Sharepoint online through mapped drive sometimes results in a - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jr-harrisons  say:</h3>
<h2>            Copy to Sharepoint online through mapped drive sometimes results in a corrupt file</h2>
                    <p>Recently, and I suspect since the PC was upgraded to Windows 10, copying a file to a sharepoint site using a mapped drive in windows explorer sometimes results in the file showing up as 0kb and is corrupt and will not open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens often when copying a single file. &nbsp;When copying a number of files, there maybe 1 or 2 such files that do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you undo the process through windows explorer it puts the corrupt file / files back rather than the original resulting in lost files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone shed any light on this?</p>

            Hi JR-Harrisons,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Before you use the Open with Explorer feature, please make sure you select Keep me signed in for signing into Office portal. You may also try steps in
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2629108" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this article</a> to check if there are some improvements. <br />
&nbsp;<br />
If the issue persists, I'd like to confirm the following things:<br />
1.When does the issue occur, just when you use the Open with Explorer feature or some minutes after using this feature?<br />
2.Is the issue related to one specific file format or a random issue related to all kinds of files? Capture some screenshots for "the file showing up as 0kb and is corrupt".<br />
3.By "the corrupt file / files back rather than the original resulting in lost files", can you share with us more details?<br />
4.For those problematic files, directly click the Upload button in the cloud library, check if they can be uploaded successfully.<br />
5.Do other users in your tenant encounter the same issue?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Best regards,<br />
Tim<br />

            <p>This may not just be an issue with SharePoint.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We are having a similar issue when trying to save file (copy or move) to a mapped drive over slow WAN or VPN connections using Windows 10.&nbsp; Some files end up with the same 0KB size.&nbsp; No error is shown during the save process. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are still trying to duplicate the issue with a Mac, Window 8.1, and Windows 7 computer but so far they are not having the issue so we are focusing on Windows 10.

            <p>After working with Microsoft Support we located the issues.</p>
<p>It was a third party application, RSA DLP Endpoint Agent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue happened when saving to SharePoint and network shares.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We found the issue by disabling all third party services (using msconfig) and slowing bringing each one back online until we found the one causing the issue.

<h2>            can I recover a deleted voicemail message&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have just accidently deleted an important voicemail by hitting '3' instead of '5'.... Can it be retrieved? It's the very last thing to be deleted in VM. I'm on a Lumia 800.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hoping someone can help!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

    <title>Dual Booting RTM with Insider Preview - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jackson626  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dual Booting RTM with Insider Preview</h2>
                    <p>I'm running Windows 10's RTM on my PC. I want to continue participating in the Insider Program&nbsp;(previously I ran it in a virtual machine on a Windows 7 PC) and from what I've read dual booting is the best way to go about doing this, so as not to affect my
 primary computer if anything goes wrong.</p>
<p>My question is this: how do I go about installing the Insider Preview alongside the RTM in a dual boot situation?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm confused as to whether I would need a licence to do this - my Windows 10 PC is activated, but would this carry across to the Insider Preview in a separate partition?</p>
<p>Also, where can I get an ISO or media to install Windows 10 Insider Builds? Do I use the Media Creation Tool?</p>
<p>If anyone has any advice or suggestions about this situation I'd really appreciate it :)</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>I am dual booting on two computers, one boot each is build 10240 and one boot each is build 10565. &nbsp;There is no problem doing so. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The easiest way is to install a qualifying Windows (7 or 8) and upgrade. &nbsp;The qualifying Windows needs to be a license not currently in use on any computer. &nbsp;A copy that you have already used to upgrade to 10 is in use, so it needs to be a spare copy. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you choose to clean install the second copy it will not activate unless you use phone activation. &nbsp;If you choose the phone activation route you will have to enter the dummy key in order to complete the installation. &nbsp;Then, once Window 10 is running,
 &nbsp;open a command prompt and enter "slui 4" to start the phone activation diaglogue.&nbsp;</p>

Why, Jessen? &nbsp;Why go TechNet? &nbsp;The method is simple. &nbsp;Install Windows. &nbsp;Activate Windows. &nbsp;If the user can't meet the requirements for activation, don't do it.

            <p>Thanks a lot! :) This helps to clear things up a bit.</p>
<p>I assume this means that dual booting counts as two devices, and therefore needs two licences. I only have one licence which I've upgraded to Windows 10. Everywhere I've read says not to install Insider Builds on your primary computer, but it seems to me
 like this is the only way to do so now without buying an extra licence or using a spare computer (which I don't have).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm apparently enrolled in the Insider Program's fast ring&nbsp;on my computer but I've been stuck on RTM ever since it came out :/ I've had some strange problems with my Microsoft account on my PC so I'm blaming it on that :)</p>
<p>Thanks again</p>

            <p>I read a Gabe Aul's tweet around the end of July in which he said dual booting on the same license works in Windows 10 (definitely a change from previous policy) but that virtual machines require their own licenses. &nbsp;So I tried it. &nbsp;I clean installed a second
 copy on &nbsp;a second hard drive and ran into the product key screen which would not permit a SKIP or DO LATER. &nbsp;I used the dummy key so that the installation would at least finish. &nbsp;When it did, i used phone activation. &nbsp;(To start phone activation, open a command
 prompt and enter "slui 4")</p>
<p>
</p><p>The automated agent cannot process an activation string generated with the dummy key (it is blocked on Microsoft's servers) so it passed me to a live agent who then forwarded me to a second level tech. &nbsp;That tech remoted into the computer and inserted a
 retail product key and activated it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I am in fact dual booting starting with the same license without purchasing a new license. &nbsp;That I got a free retail key into the bargain was a surprise. &nbsp;That it worked for me does not guarantee that it will work for you because time has passed and who
 knows what has gone on in the activation centers since. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously for it to work requires that the second instance be the same edition as the original upgrade. &nbsp;Devices are registered by edition as well as version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's my experience, YMMV.</p>

            <p>Thanks so much for your help!</p>
<p>About ten minutes ago I stumbled across a solution for my Microsoft Account issue I was having, which fixed it :)</p>
<p>Build 10565 immediately started downloading in Windows Update.</p>
<p>I'm now wondering whether it's a good idea to install it over top of the RTM or whether I should attempt a dual boot.</p>
<p>Also, where did you obtain a second copy of Windows to install in your dual boot setup? Did you use the Media Creation Tool?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks :)</p>

            <p>I used the same dvd from the Tool on all my installations. &nbsp;The copy of Windows doesn't matter (never has). &nbsp;It's all in the license.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep in mind that beginning with Windows 10 Microsoft is using <em>device activation</em>. &nbsp;I think that's why Gabe said dual booting off of one license works. &nbsp;I also think the mechanics is another matter.</p>

            <p>I've just read the Microsoft Software Licence Terms, where it states </p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>"</em><span><em>In this agreement, "device" means a hardware system (whether physical or virtual) with an internal storage device capable of running the software.<strong> A hardware partition or blade
</strong><strong>is considered to be a device.</strong>" and "</em></span><span><em>Under this agreement,
<strong>we grant you the right to install and run one instance of the software on your device (the licensed device)".</strong></em></span></p>
<p>From this I gather that dual booting does require two licences. I've just been talking to a Microsoft Tech through the Contact Support app to clarify this, however they couldn't help me as they weren't related to the Insider Preview.</p>
<p><span>I'm just not sure whether I should attempt to partition and install using the Media Creation Tool in the hope it might activate, or whether I should install on my primary installation, or just stay on RTM?</span></p>

            <p>In addition when using the insiders preview the activation now shows we have qualified our pc as digital activation. So continuing to use the Evaluation Copy we are tied to the RTM license agreement, Also tied to the Evaluation build not to use this software

 on the server so they can be received by other devices?&nbsp; I have already noticed that several emails that were received in by the new office 365 email were not also received on my old laptop.&nbsp; I only have office 365 on one device (the new laptop) and have Outlook
