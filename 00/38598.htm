            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As the error signifies, the Mail’s message store is unable to locate the database and it is quite possible that the message store has become corrupt.&nbsp; To resolve this issue, try deleting the
 message store file of your account. Navigate to the file by <strong>C: &gt; Users &gt; your username &gt; Local &gt; App Data &gt; Microsoft &gt; Windows Live</strong> and delete the file named,
<strong>Mail.MSMessageStore.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Note:</strong> The Mail.MSMessageStore does have a back-up folder and will work to recover your messages but may not be able to view some recently received messages.&nbsp;
 If you have web based e-mail, Windows Live Mail will sync with the mail server so they are made available again.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this help you fix the error message. Do keep us posted on the issue.</span></p>

<h2>            Are you happy with your Surface RT purchase&#63;</h2>
                    Hi all,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My name is Mark Hachman, and I'm a reporter from PCWorld. I'm trying to write a story about the Surface RT, from the perspective of those who have actually bought and used the tablet.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Ideally, I'm looking for a mix of both positive and negative experiences. If there's some hidden value that the Surface RT holds, I'd like to know about it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Some of the questions that I'm hoping to answer:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1.) When did you first purchase your Surface RT? Why did you buy it? Did you consider alternatives, such as the iPad or an Android tablet? If so, why did you rule them out?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>2,) In the weeks and months since you've bought the Surface RT, how has your opinion of the Surface RT changed? Has it improved or declined?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>3.) What do you typically use the Surface RT for? What do you enjoy doing with it? What really irritates you every time you use it? As a corollary question, what is the Surface RT's greatest strength? Its chief weakness?</div>

</div>
<div>4.) Would you buy another, at the reduced price?</div>
<div><br />

            Hi all,
<div><br />
<div>I'm in the process of trying to come up with a story on the Surface with Windows RT, and I think I'd like to talk to people who have actually purchased and used one. I'd like positive and negative experiences, please.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Among the things I'd like to know:</div>
<div><br />
<div>1.) When did you buy your Surface RT? What made you decide to buy one?</div>
<div>2.) Did you consider and rule out an iPad or Android tablet?</div>
<div>3.) In the weeks and months since you purchased one, how have your attitudes towards it changed? Have they improved? Declined?</div>
<div>4.) What do you typically use it for? What features/apps/functions add the most value for you?</div>
<div>5.) Would you buy another one, given the recent price decline?</div>
<div>6.) Is there a future in Windows RT, or do the current/upcoming small form factor tablets make it irrelevant?</div>
<div><br />
<div>As I said, I'm hoping for a mix of positive and negative responses, highlighting the flaws as well as the strengths of the tablet. If there is some hidden value there, tell me!</div>
<div><br />
<div>It's up to you whether or not you want to respond here. You can always email me at mhachman at pcworld dot com as well.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks!</div>

<div><br />
<div>1.) When did you first purchase your Surface RT? Why did you buy it? Did you consider alternatives, such as the iPad or an Android tablet? If so, why did you rule them out?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Answer: Purchased October 17, 2012 delivered October 26, 2012. Wanted a Windows Tablet, never considered iPad or Android.</div>
<div><br />
<div>2,) In the weeks and months since you've bought the Surface RT, how has your opinion of the Surface RT changed? Has it improved or declined?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Answer: I purchased mainly to use at home, surf the net, email Apps, etc.. using it the first weekend I found I was using it more than my Sandybridge Samsung Series 7 Tablet, ended up selling the Samsung and started using a desktop for x86 needs, remoted
 from my Surface RT. Now I use my RT for 95% of my compute tasks, even more so now that Outlook 2013 in the 8.1 Upgrade.</div>
<div><br />
<div>3.) What do you typically use the Surface RT for? What do you enjoy doing with it? What really irritates you every time you use it? As a corollary question, what is the Surface RT's greatest strength? Its chief weakness?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Answer: Office (PowerPoint, Excel and Word), OneNote note taking and organization, Outlook Email, Lync VOIP and IM Client, Web Content and Social Networks, Apps: News, CNet, Plex and lite gaming. I enjoy using my Surface RT. Greatest Strengths: Build Quality
 and Size and Weight, Works seamlessly in my Windows Eco-system (SkyDrive and SkyDrive Pro, Office365). Weakness: Tegra3 needs further optimization, wished it had an Active Digitizer.</div>
<div><br />
<div>4.) Would you buy another, at the reduced price?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Answer: Bought 3 at the regular price, one for my 12 year old who uses for school, VOIP Client&nbsp;and gaming.</div>
<div><br />
<div>5.) Finally, do you think that there's a future for the Surface RT, with smaller Windows tablets coming down the pipe?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Answer: Yes, there is a future for RT, I do believe we will see Phone and RT merging into a single ARM SKU.</div>

            <p>1) I purchased it 6 months ago so that I could use it in school for studying. Ipad and Android tablets do not have Microsoft Office application so they are useless for studying purpose, while a Laptop is too heavy to carry.</p>
<p>2) After using it for&nbsp;a few&nbsp;months, I was&nbsp;very disapointed because I&nbsp;found there&nbsp;were&nbsp;a lot of&nbsp;of system errors that happen due to the Update that Microsoft provides. For examples: After a update, sometimes my Surface RT couldn't be woken up from sleeping
 and I need to press the power button for a few second to restart the device. While the touch cover sometimes does not function,&nbsp;I have to remove it and attach it to the Surface again to make it function properly. The quality of the touch cover is so bad but
 it costs me 100 USD.</p>
<p>3) I use it for studying, watching movie, listening to music, playing game, Skype, browsing website. The strength of Surface RT is the "live title" that so beautiful and updates information around the world. The game applications that made by Microsoft themselves
 that cannot be found in other OS.</p>
<p>The weakness is that the price of the apps in market store is very expensive compares to other OS. Besides, the sound volume is very low. The&nbsp;Tegra 3 is not strong enough to handle most of the game application, you can feel this clearly when you play Samurai
 vs Zombies.</p>
<p>4) I will never buy any&nbsp;window RT products&nbsp;again.</p>
<p>5) The future of RT will become even darker unless the price is cheaper, the chipset is stronger, the OS has less system errors and operates more stable.</p>

<li>I was sort of Meh about it at first. I liked the battery life, and I've used it in training with the type keyboard. Having office is great. Now I'm running 8.1, and I REALLY like it as a tablet. 8.1 has some very nice improvements, so far.</li></ul>
<div><br />
<div>3.) What do you typically use the Surface RT for? What do you enjoy doing with it? What really irritates you every time you use it? As a corollary question, what is the Surface RT's greatest strength? Its chief weakness?</div>
<ul>
<li>Email, office work, twitter (news), and browsing the internet. Again, 8.1 helped with that</li><li>8.1 is still a little buggy, but that's my fault for using preview software</li><li>(irritation) The major apps still aren't all that. Music and email have gotten better, but MS should definitely had it's important apps running much better</li><li>(strength) integration with skydrive in 8.1 is fantastic. Needs same integration with skydrive pro and office 365 business versions.</li><li>strength - office</li><li>Weakness - Apps - I'm sort of a productivity/business/tool app junkie. I'd like some more I.T type apps like apps that will check the wireless network environment, apps for checking the network (network discovery apps), and maybe some sysadmin apps. On
 the other hand, not having a lot of apps is probably good for my wallet.</li></ul>
<div><br />
<div>4.) Would you buy another, at the reduced price?</div>
<ul>
<li>No, but I don't need another one for anything, If I needed another one? Not sure, I might wait for the next generation devices. I do believe MS needs to keep the price low, as they are not, in my opinion, ready to go head to head with Ipad. Also, with nexus&nbsp;devices,
 I'm not sure Ipad can keep it's pricing.</li></ul>
<div><br />
<div>5.) Finally, do you think that there's a future for the Surface RT, with smaller Windows tablets coming down the pipe?</div>
<ul>
<li>I'd like to say yes. I think it is awesome for students, actually a productive tablet. And I know I'm beating a dead horse, but 8.1 really changes it. I probably won't get the smaller ones right away, but in a generation or two?</li><li>I think it's future depends on:</li><li>1 can MS learn to Market. If I see dancers and clicking keyboards, Ballmer will hear my scream from here.</li><li>How much better will the Gen2 devices be? I like the surface, but it is obviously a Gen1 device</li></ul>
<p>hope this helps</p>

            <p>1. A month and a half ago. Replacement for my iPad 1. Yes but having office was the key feature for me. To me its better than a tablet alone and is a back up to my work dell laptop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Improved once I got the homegroup and remote desktop working. Was so different than the iPad and took a couple of days to figure it out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Web browsing and Netflix. Did some edits on PowerPoint and a few letters for work when I was on vacation. Pain is the inability to download drivers for things like iTunes, and recording software and cloud based shareware like adobe creative suite. Strength
 is through remote desktop I can access my pc and laptop and use all my software loaded on them in addition to usb and micro sd ports.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. If pro was around 600 sure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. If they eliminated the restrictions like the pro and marketed as a work worthy extension to a pc, I see hope. Better apps related to business and graphics (autocad and illustrator) with a focus on bringing tablet versions of their popular games could
 help.</p>

<p>We appreciate your response. The error code can be due to software conflicts brought about by a third-party program installed on your device. We'd recommend performing the steps posted above in a clean boot environment. To do this, you can perform the steps
 posted on this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>Note: In the clean boot environment, check if you'll be able to initiate the installation of the ISO. The link will also provide steps to isolate the cause of the error code that you've encountered. Once you've completed the steps posted by
<strong>Andre Da Costa, </strong>check the <strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>section to revert your device to normal boot.</span></p>

                    <p>Whenever I download a song or something along the lines of an mp3 and then play said song from the download folder using windows media player, it shows an "album art" that could never even be associated with that song. I can move the file to a different
 part of my computer (pretty much anywhere but in the downloads folder) and the "album art" disappears. So as far as I can tell, the photo is somehow set for only the downloads folder, and any folder there in. Is there any way that I can remove this "album
 art" from this set folder?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. I have never actually directly downloaded this particular picture, it only came through as the actual "album art" for a particular non-song related mp3. I will not speak of what the mp3 was, so don't even ask.&nbsp;</p>

<p>From the above thread follow the post by 'ichor'. Don't forget to make a back up of registry before editing the registry.</p>
<p>If you do not know registry editing do not try to solve this problem by yourself as the solution is quite techie matter.</p>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Tell us the exact error message you are receiving?<br />
2. Tell us the make and model of the Sony Ericsson mobile?<br />
3. Were you able to transfer and receive files earlier?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Since you have performed the transfer and receiving of files via bluetooth device without success, I would suggest you to follow these below steps and try again and check for the issue.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>To check for the Bluetooth settings on the phone.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Phone Bluetooth Settings.</strong> On the cell phone, turn the Bluetooth ON and make sure it is set to "Visible" or "Shown to all" or option that will allow discovery of your device later in the process. You need to know the name of your cell phone
 so you can easily make a distinction from other Bluetooth devices that are in range.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Laptop Bluetooth Settings. On the laptop, </strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Click on Start.<br />
2. Go to Control Panel.<br />
3. Hardware and Sound category.<br />
4. Click on Bluetooth Devices or Configuration. <br />
5. It is easier to find it if you switch to Classic View. <br />
6. You need to know the name of the laptop computer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Set the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Options tab</strong> - make sure that the Discovery and Connections options are all ticked(checked).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Share tab</strong> - make sure that you allow remote devices to browse, send, and receive pictures, music, and other files. Take note of the location of the "Bluetooth Exchange Folder".</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Paring Bluetooth Devices:</strong> Pairing simply means establishing the connection between two devices, sort of like handshaking. You can initiate pairing on either device.</div>
<div>Initiate pairing from the laptop by going to the Bluetooth Configuration again in the Devices tab and click "Add..." The wizard will guide you through the rest of the setup. Always use a pass code for security purpose. Complete the pairing by accepting
 the connection on the cell phone and entering the pass code.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Initiate pairing from the cell phone by going to the Bluetooth <strong>Settings</strong>=&gt;<strong>Paired Devices</strong> and choose "<strong>New</strong>". Your cell phone will search and should be able to find the Laptop. Then choose "Pair" and it will
 ask for pass code... you may enter 0000 and press OK.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A notification to connect will appear on the laptop. Enter the pass code and pairing will be completed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Transferring Single file:. </strong>On the cell phone, go to the file you want to share and choose "Send". You should see an option to send VIA Bluetooth and select the laptop as the destination. You will receive notification on the laptop that
 a device wants to send a file. Accept it and the file will be saved in the "Bluetooth Exchange Folder".</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Send file from the laptop by right clicking on the <strong>file</strong>=&gt;<strong>Send To</strong>=&gt;<strong>Bluetooth Device</strong>. Choose the cell phone device as the destination and you will receive notification on your phone when transfer is completed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Transferring Multiple Files:</strong> Go to My Computer and you should see your cell phone listed at the bottom in the Other section. Double click and browse the files that you want to copy from the folders. From here, you can simply copy files
 from these folders and paste anywhere on your laptop computer and vice-versa.</div>

    <title>installing drivers for xbox 360 wireless controller reciever - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> leithznaimer  say:</h3>
<h2>            installing drivers for xbox 360 wireless controller reciever</h2>
                    <p><span>Hi guys!
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I'd like to install drivers for my xbox 360 wireless controller reciever.
 I have seen tutorials on youtube showing how to do this from the device manager. However, when I go to manually install the driver from a list of available drivers on my machine, there is no option for 'xbox 360 peripherals'. Have these drivers been removed
 in a windows update? Is it no longer supported by windows 10? There are no downloads available for windows 10 from microsoft, but maybe somebody knows where else I can download the necessary drivers....</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you all</span></p>
<p><span>Leith</span></p>

    <title>I get an error message &#34;A network error occurred while - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            I get an error message &#34;A network error occurred while communicating with the game server&#34; with an error Code 0x80041009.</h2>
                    As the title suggest I have problems with games .. downloading or connecting.
<div>Here's a few examples:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Windows games (like online spades, sollitaire etc:)</div>
<div>-&gt;"A network error occurred while communicating with the game server. Error Code 0x80041009"</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Other games:</div>
<div>*League of legends:</div>
<div>-&gt; Could not connect to the HTTP server. PLease check that your internet connection is enabled and that your firewall is not blocking access.</div>
<div>Here's an interesting one:</div>
<div>Check out this (simplified) version of the logs:</div>
<div>
<div>Connect: (http://l3cdn.riotgames.com)</div>
<div>GetFile: ("/releases/live/system/rads_user_kernel.exe.version", "C:/RiotGames/LeagueofLegends/RADS/temp\TMP4DE1.tmp", RETRY, 0x00000000)</div>
<div>( &nbsp;ERROR)GetFile: perform request failed with code 5</div>
<div>( &nbsp;ERROR)GetFile: Retrying after failed attempt 1</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b><u>Here's the cool thing:</u></b> I can just open my browser, type in "http://l3cdn.riotgames.com/releases/live/system/rads_user_kernel.exe.version" And the file downloads trough my browser no problem. So somehow my browser can do it, the program can't....</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>*World of Warcraft</div>
<div>-&gt;Unable to connect, please make sure you're connected . . . etc etc..</div>
<div>WoW needs to download .auth files in my temporary dir in "C:\programdata\&lt;subfolders\..." But none get created.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b><u>Here's the cool thing: </u></b>I can copy those "auth" files from logging in on XP, and then I CAN log in to the server, and play fine.</div>
<div>Turn firewall off, antivirus off does not help.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>original title:Windows 7 (enterprise) - Games having real trouble getting online.&nbsp;
<br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What kind of black magic can prevent certain applications from downloading from the internet when my antivirus, and firewall are off?</div>
<div>-It's not DNS, if I can download that file trough my browser, I'm pretty sure that the DNS did its thing.</div>
<div>-It's not my router or anything, my XP is connected in the same way, and it works there.&nbsp;</div>
<div>-I'm not 100% sure, but I do think it worked fine in the beginning of the clean install.</div>
<div>-other note: even if I remove the programs in the list of allowed programs in windows firewall, Shouldn't I get a popup if i use it from the firewall?</div>

            <p><span><strong>Hi Wim DC,</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span>1) Which is the
</span><span><strong>antivirus</strong></span><span>
</span><span><strong>installed</strong></span><span> on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>2) Is this issue
</span><span><strong>limited</strong></span><span> to
</span><span><strong>games</strong></span><span>?<br />
3) Have you made </span><span><strong>any changes</strong></span><span>
 on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1-</span></strong></p>
<p><span><br />
</span><strong><span>Step 1-</span></strong></p>
<p><span><br />
You need to check if this issue persists in </span><span><strong>Safe Mode.</strong></span><span><br />
Refer the article-</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Start your computer in safe mode with networking</strong></a></span><span><br />
<br />
</span><span><strong>Note</strong></span><span>: Make sure you log back
 into </span><span><strong>Normal Mode</strong></span><span> after performing
 all the troubleshooting steps.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Step 2-</strong></span></p>
<p><span><br />
I would recommend you to perform </span><span><strong>Clean Boot.</strong></span><span><br />
Putting your system in </span><span><strong>Clean Boot state</strong></span><span>
 helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.
</span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Refer the article-</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</strong></a></span><span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Note</strong></span><span>: You need to follow
</span><span><strong>Step 7</strong></span><span> from the article mentioned
 above to get the computer back to </span><span><strong>Normal Startup</strong></span><span>
 after you follow all the troubleshooting steps.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Method 2-</strong></span></p>
<p><span><br />
You need to </span><span><strong>uninstall</strong></span><span> the
</span><span><strong>antivirus</strong></span><span>
</span><span><strong>temporarily</strong></span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Refer the article-</span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/is-IS/windows/How-do-I-uninstall-antivirus-or-antispyware-programs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>How do I uninstall antivirus or antispyware programs?</strong></a></span><span><br />
<br />
</span><span><strong>Note</strong></span><span>: Make sure you
</span><span><strong>reinstall the antivirus later</strong></span><span>,
 since the computer might be at a risk of virus infection.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists then, I would have you post your question in the
</span><span><strong>Microsoft TechNet Forums</strong></span><span> as
 it caters to an audience of </span><span><strong>IT</strong></span><span>
 professionals.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>

<h2>            Windows 7 notebook PC can no longer see Windows 10 desktop PC through the network</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 Pro update; Version 10.0.17134 Build 17134</p>
<p>I installed this Windows 10 update when it became available&nbsp;a couple of days ago and now have the following problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>While on my Windows 10 desktop PC I can see my Windows 7 notebook PC over the network, I cannot see my Windows 10 desktop PC from my Windows 7 notebook PC.<br />
When I run Windows 7 Network Diagnostics &amp;&nbsp;the Trouble Shooter, The HomeGroup screen appeared stating that it was detecting problems &amp; that it was waiting for network diagnostics to complete.&nbsp; The screen never did complete - I left it running for a couple of
 hours!<br />
Does anyone have a solution to this issue?<br />
</li><li>While I used to be able to run 'SnagIt' before I installed this update, now, when I invoke SnagIt, Windows starts configuring SnagIt!&nbsp; A few seconds later, a combo box appears stating that it could not locate 'snagit.msi.'&nbsp; When I use the Windows Explorer
 search facility, it finds SnagIt.msi although the Explorer navigation pane does not show the folder in which snagit.msi is located!<br />
Does anyone have a solution to this issue?<br />

            Hi Rich.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Homegroup is removed in Version 1803.  
<br />
<br />What's working most for network detection issues caused by Version 1803 is here:  <a href="https://windowsunplugged.blog/2018/03/27/network-computers-no-longer-present-in-file-explorer-on-windows-10-1803/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://windowsunplugged.blog/2018/03/27/networ...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over these steps to make sure File Sharing is set up correctly:  <a href="https://pureinfotech.com/setup-network-file-sharing-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://pureinfotech.com/setup-network-file-sha...</a>
<br />
<br />There are Changes to file sharing over a network in Windows 10:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4092694/windows-10-changes-to-file-sharing-over-a-network" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/409269...</a>
<br />
<br />To troubleshoot  sharing problems:

<br />
<br />This is the latest fix that's working for Version 1803 breaking networks.  Please try it and report back:   
<br />
<br />- shut all computer and network gear down then start again. 
<br />- Try browsing to some of the computers manually, press Windows key + R, type: \\computername, hit Enter
<br />- Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: services.msc
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />1. Start the "Function Discovery Provider Host" and "Function Discovery Resource Publication" services, and then set them to Automatic (Delayed Start).
<br />2. When you open Explorer Network, enable network discovery when you are prompted.
<br />
<br />If not then start over and set it up again:  <a href="https://pureinfotech.com/setup-network-file-sharing-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://pureinfotech.com/setup-network-file-sha...</a>
<br />
<br />The issue is also being tracked now with expert help here:  <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-files/homegroup-removed-how-to-get-network-sharing-work/01277332-2916-4a68-853a-116696b20743">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>As has happened with networking problems I have had in the past, the problem disappeared as suddenly as it appeared.&nbsp; While it disappeared following a reboot, I had rebooted both PCs a few times without that result.&nbsp; It just seems like 'flakey' software!</p>
<p>Thank you all for your sage advice.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
The error message you're receiving means that there are <strong>Dependencies</strong> that are not with the same
<strong>Log On</strong>. To check, please follow again the steps I have provided to go to
<strong>Windows Audio</strong> then add the steps below:<br />
<br />
1. Double-click <strong>Windows Audio</strong>.<br />
2. Click <strong>Log On.</strong><br />
3. Check what <strong>Log On</strong> is selected.<br />
4. Click <strong>Dependencies.</strong><br />
5. Take note of the system components where <strong>Windows Audio</strong> service depends then click
<strong>OK</strong>.<br />
6. Find the system component/s found on <strong>Windows Audio - Dependencies</strong>.<br />
7. Click the system component/s then look which one is selected under <strong>Log On</strong>.<br />
8. Make sure that <strong>Windows Audio</strong> and the system components have the same
<strong>Log On</strong> selected.<br />
<br />

<p>That's ridiculous. Why should you wait and pay for all those shipping costs because they can't make a controller. Personally I'd ring them and demand that they cover the costs as a minimum.</p>

<p>Oh, its more than ridiculous, its downright sinister imo......I raised cain for a hour with them, even pointed out that they told me if I bought the "complete" warrant , this wouldn't happen as there would be NO out of pocket expenses.....NOW they claim
 that a controller is an "accessory" and covered under a "different policy".....(one that I cant find in their terms of the warranty).....I explained that a controller or a power brick (same policy) are NOT accessories , that they are REQUIRED to use the console
 but to no avail</p>

<p>Wow, who would have thunk that people would have to go through all that? ^ </p>
<p>Perhaps it's time for warranty services to be processed (via Direct replacment) by the retailer as opposed to the manufacture.
</p>
<p>So if a controller breaks, you take the entire console etc back, get another and let the retailer deal with the manufacture.

<p>Follow up... If you have this issue, you need to TALK with someone... I got much better service with an actually human on the phone. Ask for someone to call you. Not sure how I even ended up on a page with the option to have one call you. At times this can
 be very confusing on the support pages.</p>
<p>The life chat people are nice but they can't really do anything for you, other than help you reset systems or trouble shoot. Good luck fellow sufferers.</p>

    <title>Problem with playing Xbox One offline - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> spacedefiner  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with playing Xbox One offline</h2>
                    
<p>I live in the country where has poor internet connection. The internet speed is not good enough to let me play games online all the times! I will explain my problem playing offline here:</p>
<p>First, when I turn on my console, I am not able to start the game that I have already installed to my system. The system requires me to sign in.
<span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">So by clicking "Sign in" on the top left, I can only see my existing Xbox Live account, Add new and Close tabs!</span> The only way to sign in is to choose that Xbox Live account, which requires my console to be hooked up with the
 internet to proceed! However, there are some people who told me that "you can still play Xbox One games offline, you just have to update your system being connected to the internet the first time you use! However, I already update my system the first time
 I turned it on. So updating is not an issue, though it took me hours to complete it due to the poor internet speed!!!
</p>
<p><br />
Now, I just want to enjoy my games offline, but it always asks me to sign in. How can I do? Without internet, I am not able to play!</p>

<p>if anyone knows how to get this solved, please help me! </p>
<p><br />
Thank you, your help is very much appreciated!</p>

<p>Sorry for the wait Space.</p>
<p>What you need to do is connect to the internet, get signed into our account and then go to your Settings menu. &nbsp;Once there, go to Sign In, Security and Passkey and then select the sign in option, Make it fast, Make it magic. &nbsp;This will save your password
 to the console and also have it recognize you with the Kinect.</p>
<p>After that, you want to go back to your Settings menu and go to Preferences. &nbsp;In preferences there is an option that says Instant Sign In. &nbsp;You want to select this option and then make sure you select your profile. &nbsp;This will set up the system to just sign
 you in automatically every time you turn the system on.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Hi Amelia,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>Older games that uses a disc installer usually runs into compatibility issues, especially when installing it in a new operating system such as Windows 10. May we know how you installed the game? Also, have you checked with the game developer if the Sims
 1 is compatible with Windows 10? In the meantime, below are some things that you can try:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong>: Run the compatibility troubleshooter to automatically detect and fix some of the most common issues with running older programs.</p>

    <title>Volume Bar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tham0402  say:</h3>
<h2>            Volume Bar</h2>
                    The volume bar (that tells you how loud your system's sound is) comes up whenever I use either the keyboard shortcuts for volume or those on my USB headset. Is there any way to turn it off? I play World of Warcraft, and it keeps knocking me out of fullscreen,
 which is a pain at times. I have an HP Pavilion p6210y, if you need that for some reason.

                    Hi
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Would really have liked to log a bug against windows but as pointed out elsewhere it seems you post things here and hope someone flags it up, so at least if someone else can try it and report it here i'll know it not just my installation. &nbsp;Anyway its a
 simple thing but very annoying. If you launch Windows Task Manager and maximize its window, make sure to turn off "Always on top" under options. I'm using a user account and have clicked on the "Show processes from all users" option prior to this and provide
 admin account credentials in case that makes a difference. Now try switching (Alt-Tab) to any other application, shouldn't matter if the other one is a maximized window or not. You should find you are still looking at the task manager window. Try switching
 a second time and you should end up seeing the app, note when you do Alt-Tab it starts on the app after the one you selected (at least in my case see my last note regarding a possible cause for that).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It doesn't appear to matter which tab on task manager you are viewing at the time. It seems like the always on top functionality is partial stuck. You can see this by going back to task manager. Switch the always on top option on and then back off and
 then try switching apps again, you should see the app first time round now.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>One other difference I have in my windows setup in case that's part of the issue is that i have changed the windows task switching (Alt-Tab) to the classic mode not the newer "Flip" mode, as i hated having my many apps reordered when trying to go back
 and forth.</div>

            Sorry how can that be by design. Why would you have an option to stop it being displayed on top of other windows yet when its turned off you have to select the other window twice before you can see it, that's a plain old bug.

            "By Design" means that it was programmed that way. &nbsp;It doesn't necessarily mean that it's intentional. &nbsp;They just don't use the term bug on a released product.

            Well i have left some feedback on the link provided before.. I tried the task manager when its not maximised and it does the same thing, so not limited to when its maximized like my topic title suggested.

You do NOT have the correct Server name. It should start with&nbsp; <strong>smtp</strong>&nbsp; ,<strong> not</strong> your e-mail address.<br />
<br />
I don't believe you were able to send anything out to anywhere. <br />
I doubt you were able to receive either.<br />
<br />
Call your ISP ( internet service provider ) or your mail server, ask them to help you set up your e-mail account. They may also have a website where you receive instructions of setting up e-mail account.</p>

<p><span>Above link has an easy to follow Guide for setting up Windows Mail.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<br />
Contact your ISP(Internet Service Provider).<br />
<br />
They provide you&nbsp;your Broadband/Dial-up connection.<br />
<br />
Ask them for: <br />
<br />
username<br />
password for your&nbsp;Broadband/Dial-Up Account with them<br />
<br />
incoming mail server POP3<br />
