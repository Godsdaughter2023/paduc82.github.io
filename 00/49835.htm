<p>I just got my Toshiba&nbsp;Satellite L455D laptop back up and running with internet connection and I was installing Windows updates and such when an option came up for a BIOS backup and flash. I don't know what this is, but if it was recommended by Windows update,
 I figured it can't hurt. Well, it went through these steps :</p>
<p>-Load new BIOS.</p>
<p>-Analyze old and new BIOS compatibility.</p>
<p>-Read old BIOS.</p>
<p>-Save old BIOS to backup file...... and it got stuck here. It says Phoenix WinPhlash is not responding and my computer has just been sitting here frozen for an hour and a half. I'm scared to touch it because I don't wanna mess anything up...<br />
What are my options?!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The BIOS updates come through the OEM (Computer Manufacturer) and not by Microsoft Updates.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 7 fullscreen games and desk apps losing focus, and focus stealing issues</h2>
                    <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">NOTE: Updates at the top of this posting, the original message is below that.<br />
<br />
UPDATES:</span> The following are some updates and new information I've gained since the original posting.<br />
<br />
Registry Settings<br />
<br />
After doing a lot of reading, I found some registry settings which appear to fix some of the issues I am seeing. All three were found in HKEY_CURRENT_USER-&gt;Control Panel-&gt;Desktop<br />
<br />
ForegroundLockTimeout: This was set to zero for some reason. I deleted the key and rebooted, but it came back set to zero. Therefore I looked up the default value of 200000 (decimal) and set it. After that it stayed.\<br />
<br />
I saw two others keys HungAppTimeout, WaitToKillServiceTimeout, and WaitToKillAppTimeout, and all were set to zero. I deleted these and relogged.<br />
<br />
I have no idea what set those registry keys to zero, but after putting them back to default, I can now click a minimized fullscreen application, and it comes back immediately. I still can lose focus when in a fullscreen or desktop application, but not as often
 as before, and now it is usually just poorly behaved apps stealing focus rather than seemingly random events.<br />
<br />
I wonder if there is some patch that changed those values, or a settings option that does. From what I read they are sometimes tweaked to allow faster restart and shutdown of servers.&nbsp; I have no software which would so that and didn't manually set them, and
 neither do the people I know. One of them has confirmed that their box also had those values set to zero and has no idea why.<br />
<br />
Hopefully that information is useful to others having odd focus issues.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">*** ORIGINAL POSTING FOLLOWS ***</span><br />
<br />
I have an issue in Windows 7,which at first I thought was several different issues, but I'm becoming convinced they are all related.<br />
<br />
All of them started happening around the same time--late January or Feburary after a Windows update--and largely the same or highly similar issues affect 3 of my friends and coworkers running both Vista and 7. Unfortunately my notes on which update happened
 during that time are missing, but all 4 of us saw the issues start near the beginning of the year in the Jan/Feb timeframe, which makes it seem like they must be related.<br />
<br />
NOTE: There were some minor issues even before that with focus, but nothing like what happened in early 2011. I've had focus issues with Vista and 7 all alone, but they were rare and sometimes fixable with registry hacks or it was some offending program, something
 didn't like Aero, etc.&nbsp; The issues below got much worse early 2011 so they are listed together in this post.<br />
<br />
I'll describe each problem separately along with affected OS and symptoms, and hopefully some can make sense of it and help me resolve the issue. Major issues first, then some minor issues, and any steps I took to check it out follow after. Sorry for the long
 post but this is a maddening problem affecting several people, and I want to be as thorough as possible.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">#1 Fullscreen apps and games not switching</span>: If I am in a fullscreen game, and I go to the desktop, it is very difficult to go back. If I just click on the taskbar icon, nothing happens. I have to click on it repeatedly,
 often a dozen times or more before the fullscreen app or game will be restored. It's most often with games. By fullscreen I do not mean maximized, I mean where a program takes the entire display. Games are easiest for reproducing it and so far all of them
 I currently use have the issue, and variances in how hard it is to return to fullscreen aren't significant between them.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">#2 Fullscreen apps lose focus</span>: This primarily happens to my friend running Vista when playing games fullscreen. She will be playing something like Lord of the Rings Online, and she loses mouse and keyboard focus, but the
 game is still fullscreen. Usually the only way she can fix the issue is to use CTRL-ALT-DELETE to bring up the task manager, which for some reason fixes the issue and she can go back to the game, for while. I run Windows 7 along with another couple of friends
 and while we also see this issue, it is much less frequent. Changing to an old mouse seems to fix it for Vista for some reason. On 7 it happens so infrequently it is difficult to reproduce to see if changing the mouse would help. In any case, going to and
 old mouse versus a nice new laser mouse is generally a horrible option.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">#3 Desktop applications lose focus</span>: This one affects two of us running Vista and 7. We will be typing in chat, email, whatever... and the foreground application will lose focus. What grabs it we are unable to determine.
 In my case I can occasionally see a taskbar button pop up and then immediately disappear, but I've never been able to track it down. Running in safe mode or clean boot seems to have no effect on this, nor does disabling every service, extension, and program
 but Microsoft's default ones in Windows 7 and Vista. Its almost like some Microsoft program is doing it. Also, while I did mention a taskbar icon showing up briefly on occasion, that may not be related: it does not always coincide with the loss of focus, and
 is not always present when focus is lost.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">#4 Desktop applications lose keyboard and mouse focus</span>: This is like issue #2 above, but happens at the desktop. Unlike #3 the window does not lose focus, it is still foreground, but keyboard and mouse stop working. It is
 usually impossible to switch to another window. Much like #2, the solution we have so far is to use CTRL-ALT-DELETE to switch to task manager, which temporarily fixes the problem. ALT-tabbing through windows doesn't work.<br />
<br />
The following are some more minor issues which may or may be related, because they too seemed to start at the same time.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Switching away from fullscreen applications takes longer</span>: In Windows 7 on my machine, switching out of fullscreen games takes longer than it did in the past. This was a minor issue in fall 2010, and became much worse in
 early 2011.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Some windows lose focus while being re-sized</span>: If I grab the corner of some windows to re-size them, sometimes the re-size operation stops before I release the mouse button, as if it lost focus. Usually window color indicates
 it still has focus however, and grabbing the corner again let's me move it a bit more. It can take several tries to get the window sized like I want it, as the re-size operation repeatedly quits before I release the mouse button. This affects only 2 of the
 4 people I'm talking about as far as I can tell from our conversations, and is split between Vista and 7. Both of us have Logitech mice so it could even be a driver issue, but using a cheap test mouse did not fix the issue with me.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Firefox</span>: Firefox repeatedly goes "dim", where Aero makes the window lose color to indicate the application is not responding. This did not happen before January 2011 for any version of Firefox.<br />
<br />
Things done to track the problem down:<br />
<br />
I have run programs like WhatHang and others that try to catch programs that are hanging, stealing focus, etc. Hours of testing found no results except that Firefox frequently hangs. Turning off Firefox does not solve any of the issues however, so I assume
 its not related.<br />
<br />
I have tried safe and clean booting, and they had no effect. Safe boot is rather useless since I generally cannot run the programs that most easily demonstrate the problem. I have also tried turning everything off except what comes with Windows 7, and it had
 no notable effect.<br />
<br />
I have tried using a different mouse. While this helped a bit with one of my friends, it has not helped me thus far. Different mouse drivers do not seem to help either. I have also tried different nVidia drivers with no notable information gained or fixes.<br />
<br />
I also ran through various other ideas suggested here like running the system file scanner and so on, and found no issues with my system, and where I was able to help my friends do the same they also found nothing of note with maintenance and checking tools.<br />
<br />
My friends and coworkers: most of them are not local to me, so my debugging of their issue has been rather limited. The main thing we all have in common is that we had minor issues in the past, like in 2010, and they all got much worse in early 2011. Unfortunately
 none of us kept accurate enough records to indicate any particular update that might have caused it.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I apologize for the log post, but this issue with focus is maddening. Its become a severe frustration so I thought posting thorough information on problems that seem related would be the most useful approach.<br />
<br />
I'm a systems comp-sci grad and a journeyman systems programmer, and I've tried everything I can think of to debug and isolate the problems, symptoms, etc and have had no luck. My friends are generally computer illiterate so they are even more baffled and frustrated
 by this issue. From my reading of the forums, I see a lot of Windows Vista and 7 focus issues, but rarely a lot of detail, and where a problem is identified, it this far does not apply to me or my friends.<br />
<br />
I'm happy to provide any other details I can.<br />
<br />
Updates:<br />
<br />
I forgot to mention that I have a dual monitor setup. Aero does seem unhappy with it, lot of flickering when going to fullscreen in games and other apps. I assume its because one display has Aero off while other has it on or maybe unaccelerated. Removing second
 display doesn't fix the issues that I can see but I mention it in the interest of being thorough.<br />
<br />

            Just want to chime in that I am seeing similar (though not exactly the same) behavior, and the timeframe seems to match as well. One of the updates must have screwed something up. I forgot my cardinal rule of never update anything :/<br />
<br />
Anyway, I have a few specific issues all related to fullscreen/windowing/input issues. When playing the witcher, when looking around if the mouse hits the edge of the screen it stops, thus giving a very narrow range of angles I can look from. In baldurs gate,
 as soon as I type any key, I am unable to click on anything (and whatever i typed doesn't appear). In police quest 3 (dosbox) it works fine until I type a key, and then the mouse bounces around the screen weirdly. If I alt-tab away, in these last 2 cases,
 and go back, the problem is solved until I press a key again. In the case of the witcher, if I alt tab and click on the taskbar icon, it seems to fix it, until I press a key.<br />
<br />
And I'm sure I didn't have any of these problems a few months ago. I've tried everything I can think of :( I tried the registry settings but they didn't seem to help.<br />
<br />
Edit: Oh, almost forgot. Whenever I click fullscreen on an online video, like youtube, it appears in the background behind other windows, and then I have to click on it in the background to bring it to the front. Very weird. Not sure if it's related. I'm going
 to try to change my video drivers... So annoying when everything was working great a few months ago.<br />
<br />
Edit 2: Disregard my post, I had a program called synergy running (used to use one mouse on multiple computers at once). Apparently it was the problem.

<h2>            Will not connect to Wi-Fi</h2>
                    <p>Can anyone please help me?</p>
<p>
</p><p>About 1 week ago my HP Pavillion x360 suddenly disconnected from the Wi-fi. The Wi-fi bars were empty with a little red X. I ended up restarting the computer and it reconnected. The next day it did this again and I deleted the Wi-fi driver (Intel(R) Dual
 Band Wireless-AC 3165) and reinstalled it from the Intel website. This fix lasted several hours. I then updated Windows and this fixed the problem for several hours, but the problems persisted. My laptop is not connecting to any Wi-fi network, not just at
 home, and my other devices connect to Wi-fi just fine. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally caved and asked HP Smart Friend to help me. They updated Windows, BIOS, and reinstalled the Wi-Fi driver. The fix lasted a day, but now the problem still persists. HP suggested that the problem is related to Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run the trouble shooter on my computer and on Google Chrome, but sometimes it fixes the problem and sometimes it doesn't. I'm still able to connect to the internet with an Ethernet cord but I don't have a way to do that at school.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any other fixes?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            Hey roamingyinzer,
<br />
<br />I've been hearing more and more of this recently -- it's my guess it was a Windows Update driver that messed things up. Try using HP Smart Friend to perform the reinstallation of your Wi-Fi driver again, but not before performing the following actions:
<br />
<br />1. Uninstall and reinstall your own driver, make sure you hide the driver update so that in the future it won't be installed (with WUShowHide): <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3073930/how-to-temporarily-prevent-a-driver-update-from-reinstalling-in-window" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/307393...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Go to File Explorer, right-click This PC then click Properties. And on the left pane, click Advanced system settings &gt; Hardware (tab) &gt; Device Installation Settings. Select No and click OK, then reinstall your driver.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps! Please let me know if I could be of more help, and good luck.

<p>Enable the diagnostic logs and see what events you get. I vaguely recall a problem that I had last year that was related to a power setting. But I'm going to have to do some digging to see if I can find that setting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>See</p>
<p>https://superuser.com/questions/1031263/how-to-check-the-event-log-if-any-for-network-failure</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the event viewer we can enable logging of WiFi. It gives detailed logs of the signal strength of WiFi.</p>

<li>
<p>
Open the Windows Event viewer (eventvwr.msc) and then within the View Menu enable the
<em>

</li><li>
<p>
Navigate to the WLAN-autoconfig event log. Since we enabled the Analytic and Debug logs option, beside the Operational log we also see the Diagnostic log.</p>
</li><li>
<p>
The Diagnostic event log by default is not enabled, so first we have to enable it by right-clicking -&gt; select
<em>
Properties</em>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>
As soon as the Diagnostics mode is enabled you should see events coming in. To enforce things a bit simply disable and enable your wireless connection using your vendor's wireless connection software or by pressing the hardware button on your laptop.

You can see when the WiFi signal is lost.</p>

I tried turning off power management settings for the Wireless-AC 3165 and my adapter still turned off on me. Twice, in a short period of time. It wasn't even that it disabled itself, it disappeared completely from the Device Manager window.<br />

<p>Considering I am not the only person who seems to have had this problem with an Intel WiFi Adapter for about the same amount of time, I'm skeptical that it is a hardware issue. In response to the article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The driver was updated, and it didn't fix the problem.</li><li>I don't appear to have Wi-Fi Sense on my laptop.</li><li>I changed the power settings both thru Device Manger -&gt; Power Management and through changing the plan settings in Power Options (putting it on Maximum Performance). Still didn't help.</li></ol>

<h2>            Windows 10 Mail App - Cannot send e-mails</h2>
                    <p>I'm setting up an account (IMAP4)&nbsp; connected to my school web based e-mail servers.&nbsp;&nbsp; And I can receive messages, but I cannot send e-mails! It was working fine in Windows 8.1 before I upgraded, now it is broken.&nbsp; The following error occurs</p>
<p>

</p><p><span>We weren't able to send this message, so we've put it in your Drafts folder. Before you try sending it again, you can check to see if the address is correct and that no attachments are too large.</span></p>

<p>

            I've discovered that the issue for my school email is that you cannot define your username and email account separately. For example, my username does not include @school.ca, but my email does, so the Mail app fails to send out emails properly, but receives
 them fine.

    <title>Problem with Corrupted Messages in Windows Mail - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problem with Corrupted Messages in Windows Mail</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I have recently tried to transfer a large number of my emails over from my Vista 32 desktop to my Vista 32 laptop &amp; am having considerable problems with corrupted messages.<br />
<br />
I transferred part using Easy transfer &amp; a cable. The deleted messages appeared to transfer reasonably well (although I have not thoroughly checked as there are 30,000), but the inbox &amp; 12 sub-inboxes would not transfer properly. So I transferred the&nbsp; folders
 individually by disk &amp; imported them in to Windows Mail using the import/ export tool (both computers run Win Mail V6). (I had no option other than to use the format for&nbsp;'Windows Mail 7' on the option list even though I use&nbsp;Windows Mail 6).&nbsp;When I import an
 inbox file I end up with 6 folders for each inbox (5 sub-folders). I finally find the messages in the 6th folder in Windows Mail&nbsp;&amp; they appear reasonably intact. However, when I click on the messages &amp; click 'select all' &amp; then 'move to folder' in order to
 get them in to the correct folder in Windows Mail on the new computer, the messages move across okay but become corrupted in the process. They are all perfectly readable, but sometimes the 'received date' is changed from the correct one, &amp; sometimes the content
 has been mixed up with another email from the same folder. It appears that the folder contents are being jumbled up in simply moving them from one Windows mail folder to another. Any ideas on this?<br />
<br />
Many thanks,<br />
<br />
David<br />

<h2>            Get Windows 10 app state that I have &#34;no supported network devices&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>With some help I have finally got the Get Windows 10 App working. It states when I click on "Check PC" that I have "no suppoted network devices" and therefore can not get a Windows 10 free reservation. Please see the screenshot below, unfortunately in German.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the following network devices in my PC:&nbsp;</p>
<p>- AVM FRITZ!WLAN USB Stick N</p>
<p>- Realtek PCIe GBE Family Controller</p>
<p>
</p><p>I doubt that at least the WLAN Stick from AVM will not be supported by Win10. Do you have any idea what I can do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much!</p>

            <p><span>Hello Robert,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand you need assistance for network device compatibility with Windows 10. I will certainly help you in the right direction to fix the issue.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Windows 10 is designed to be compatible with the vast majority of Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 devices, so your device is most likely compatible.
</span></p>
<p><span>Get Windows 10 is an app that’s designed to make the upgrade process easy. It displays the recommended a resolution if there is any compatibility issue.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>However, I would appreciate if you could tell us the&nbsp;</span><span>make and model of the computer,</span><span> in order to provide you with better assistance.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you that if the compatibility report shows that network devices are not compatible with Windows 10, then you may install it in Windows 7 compatibility mode.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow these steps to&nbsp;the network driver in compatibility mode and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 1: </span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Download the latest&nbsp;"network" driver</strong> for Windows&nbsp;7 from&nbsp;the manufacture website and save it in a new folder.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>Step 2: </span></span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Uninstall the old network drivers from the Device Manager.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a) Press <strong>“</strong><strong>Windows Logo” + “X”</strong> keys on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>b) Click on “<strong><span>Device Manager</span></strong>” from that list.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>c) Search for the “<strong>Network adapter</strong>” device from the device list,
<strong>right click</strong> on it and then select “<strong><span>Uninstall</span></strong>”. On the un-installation window, if you have an option: “<strong><span>Delete the driver software for this device</span></strong>” you may select that and then remove
 the corrupted drivers from the computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>d) Follow the on-screen instructions to complete it and the restart the computer if prompted.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>e) After the restart, please open the <strong><span>Device Manager</span></strong> again and then click on the “<strong><span>Scan for hardware changes</span></strong>” button. Check if Windows 10 detects the network adapter device and installs an
 appropriate driver automatically. If the issue still persists, then try the next step.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 3:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try to <strong>install the network driver them in compatibility mode,</strong> which you have downloaded in a new folder.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a. <strong>Right-click </strong>on the driver setup file and click on <strong>
‘properties’</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>b. Click on the <strong>‘compatibility’</strong> tab and check the box <strong>
‘Run this program in compatibility mode for’</strong> and select Windows&nbsp;7 operating system from the drop down menu.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>c. Click on <strong>‘Apply’</strong> and click <strong>‘OK’</strong> and run the file to install it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer to the following Microsoft Help Article below to make older programs compatible with this version of Windows.</span></p>

            <p>Hello&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/d2bc9484-d020-4a24-98b0-f4bd88257549" title="Amit K Verma">Amit</a>,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your quick reply. My computer is a self build PC with a "ASRock B75 Pro3" mainboard on which the network controller "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Realtek PCIe GBE Family Controller"&nbsp;</span>is build in. As this is only
 LAN I have the second network controller for WLAN "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">AVM FRITZ!WLAN USB Stick N" which I use.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">For both I had updated the drivers to the latest version but without any success. The Get Windows 10 app still state that no supported network devices / adapters could be found. What I wonder is that
 it state "Last Run 05.06.2015 22:44". Can I somehow rerun the PC check of the Get Windows 10 app to see if something change?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Thank you!</span></p>

            <p>Me again... Without any changes to the system and despite the "Check the PC" screen as in the screenshot above I was now able to reserve a free copy of Windows 10 over the Windows Update screen. It state in the Get Windows 10 app that I have reserved a copy
 (see screenshot below).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So everything should be fine for me now. Wondering why I didn't had a chance to reserve one before...</p>

            <p>Hi, I also have "Realtek PCIe GBE Family Controller" (and previously installed "Fritz!WLAN USB Stick") with exactly the same issue (ASUS H81M-PLUS motherboard with Realtek GBE on-board), I have previously had the Windows 10 Technical Preview running on this
 PC so I don't really&nbsp;think the Realtek GBE is incompatible, maybe a driver issue.
</p>
<p>Currently Running Windows 7 Professional x64.</p>

            <p>Yes, might be that the GWX app think it is incompatible as the driver was not yet verified for Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>@Dennis312 &amp; @AlastairWalker: were you able to get the free upgrade reserved like I? If not, try reinstall the driver with the latest version and check whether you can reserve it over the Windows Update screen.

    <title>mail with attached pdf gets dumped into draft folder or gets stuck in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pdf userwindows 8  say:</h3>
<h2>            mail with attached pdf gets dumped into draft folder or gets stuck in the outbox</h2>
                    <p>I'm using the Windows 8 Mail app that came loaded on my new PC.&nbsp;My biggest problem with it is that when I attempt to attach a pdf file to an email I wish to send, the email and attachment either&nbsp;gets stuck in the outbox; or, after a minute or two automatically
 gets shifted from the outbox to the draft folder without being sent to the intended recipient.&nbsp;I have three different ISP accounts, and attaching a pdf won't work on any of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Luckily I have another, different&nbsp;PC running XP, and I can send the exact same email and pdf file without a problem using&nbsp;all three of the same&nbsp;ISP accounts. But, it will&nbsp;NOT work using the Windows 8 Mail app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, in the Windows 8 Mail app it seems as if there is no way to check the progress of whether or not&nbsp;the outgoing message is transmitting&nbsp;as there is when using Internet Express or Outlook on the XP configuration. This is a major problem, since I can't
 tell if the transmission for the outgoing message has started, or more importantly,&nbsp;completed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One last thing about this particular problem. I tried using the SKYDRIVE link that keeps popping up next to the intended attached pdf file in the new message window&nbsp;as a way to send the attachment. SKYDRIVE froze and somehow a dozen or so of the same message
 with attached pdf file were sent to the recipient before I figured out how to delete the message from the outbox. This caused a real problem and a lot of wasted time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I may as well express a few other negative issues about the Windows 8 Mail app.</p>
<p>Another problem I've noticed is that when composing a message using Windows 8 Mail app, you can't cut text and paste it to another location in the email...you have to copy it, move it to the new location, and then delete the text from the original location...a
 really bad aspect of the Windows 8 Mail app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for venting my frustration with the Windows 8 Mail app, but it really needs to become much more dependable and user-friendly.</p>

    <title>DPC Watchdog Error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nelson beitez  say:</h3>
<h2>            DPC Watchdog Error</h2>
                    <p>My computer was running fine, but suddenly froze during a game, after rebooting the (soon to be seen a hundred times) DPC WATCHDOG VIOLATION ERROR occured and my computer has taken a huge knock to its graphic display, as well as countless black screens,
 no drivers being able to install,</p>
<p>and countless installs of WIn 10 via a flash drive and disic. Ive formatted my drives created partitions to test the SSD (which is where I had Win 10 on originally), re installed BIOS settings, but nothing has resolved this ongoing problem. I'm now left
 with a computer running in safe mode with networking. A BASIC DISPLAY ADAPTER running a (code31) and no GTX Video card running. I have tried updating windows 4 times, and 4 times no success.
</p>
<p>The recent Windows update has messed up my system, and I even though I have read through many other DPC WATCHDOG VIOLATION ERROR problems, they appear to not work on mine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone offer any help please?</p>
<p>

<h2>            chkdsk has finished checking disk</h2>
                    <p>Last night i started chkdsk because i notice problems with my laptop every time that i play music or video files. So after completing stage 5 of 5, it said ; free space verification complete. Adding 1 bad clusters to the bad clusters file. Correcting errors
 in the volume bitmap. Windows has made changes to the file system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the last two sentences at the bottom tells me that windows has finished checking my disk and to please wait while computer restarts. Its been stuck here the past 20+ hours. Is it normal to take this long at the very end ?</p>

            Chkdsk is a program that checks the logic of the data stored there.&nbsp; It does not check the physical health of the hardware.&nbsp; You should run the disk manufacturer's software to check the hardware.&nbsp; If you will give me the model number of your drive, I will
 supply you with a link to the correct software.&nbsp; You can find the model number in the device manager.

<p>Another good idea for problem solving is to describe what the "problem" is and more information about your system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do this so we can see what you have:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model or is it something assembled from separately purchased components?<br />
<br />
If the system is a Dell what is the Service Tag Number?<br />
If the system is an HP what is the serial number?<br />
If the system is an Toshiba what is the serial number?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Describe your antivirus/antimalware environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
msinfo32<br />
<br />
Click OK, and when the System Summary info appears, click Edit, Select All (Ctrl-A), Copy (Ctrl-C) and then paste (Ctrl-V) the information back here in your next reply.<br />
<br />
For video device and driver information, expand the Components, click Display, click Edit, Select All, Copy and then paste the information back here.<br />
<br />
For audio device and driver information, expand the Components, click Sound Device, click Edit, Select All, Copy and then paste the information back here.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
There will be some personal information (like System Name and User Name), and whatever appears to be private information to you, just delete it from the pasted information.<br />

<p>The hard drive in a laptop has a life expectancy of about 5 years.&nbsp; Some can go longer or shorter.&nbsp; I am guessing your laptop is nearing that age????</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is, again, please tell me hard drive model number and I will suggest the test software for that particular manufacturer's hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can find the model number under disks in the Device Manager.</p>

<p>sorry for the late reply. i got caught up with some things this weekend. </p>
<p>
</p><p>after waiting for those 20+ hrs for my laptop to restart on its own, i just restarted it myself. i turn the laptop back on, and everything is running normal. i went into event viewer and checked the chkdsk info, and everything looked ok. my laptop is running
 alittle better then before, but i still have the same problem as before but alittle less.</p>
<p>
</p><p>sometimes when im playing music and doing a simple task like browsing the web, i notice that things take alittle longer to load.. but if hit the pause button on the music player or hit mute on my keyboard, everything starts to load right away. it even happens
 when im looking through files on my hard drive through windows. its&nbsp; happening less since the chkdsk, but it still happens...</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have this program that came with the laptop, the program is by asus, the maker of my laptop. its called ATK package. i think something might be wrong with it, but when i try to hit the repair button in the&nbsp; uninstall page, it seems to not be able to find
 the file it needs. im gonnna look more into this ATK package tho...</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for the support.</p>

<p>the hard drive was from another laptop. it wasnt used alot. everything was running fine until like a month and a half ago. i have another 500gig hdd , but i dont wanna have to reinstall windows again. everything is running fine except for the slight pause
 in loading while playing music. i look at task manager and the cpu is always very low. im not doing heavy work on my computer and its acting weird. i did a&nbsp; deep virus scan with avast. i ran spybot search and destroy. i defraged. i dont know what else to do

            Hi , I am Dexter, an Independent Advisor, here to help you.
<br />
<br />I'll suggest you update your Windows to latest first, then reinstall the Chinese(Traditional) Handwriting Input, the 1709 version is old enough and may cause this issue.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let me know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.       
        </p>

            Thanks for your response Dexter. Yes, the issue "might" be resolved if we decide to update windows on the latest version but it is not an option right now, is there any other way to go around with this?

            Well, then I suggest you try to download and install language pack offline, here is a link provides the packs for Windows 10 1709:

<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let me know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>I appreciate your answer on this issue. I have tried this already. I apologize I might have missed this in my initial statement. So I tried to download the lang pack on that site and installed it locally. When I tried to add the Handwriting Input for Chinese
 Traditional, the same error happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It says "Something happened, and we couldn't install a feature." I couldn't extract any clues even in the event logs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,<br />

            Then I'll suggest you check your network configuration, try to change the Preferred DNS server to 8.8.8.8, then open a CMD prompt and run:
<br />
<br /><code>ipconfig /flushdns</code>
<br />
<br />Then try to install the language pack online again.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4d47fb34-546e-4b4f-869b-8d8b6cd6af40?upload=true" />

</p><p>I am sorry to hear about your Skype issue, and were you trying to close the Skype accounts? If that is a yes.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For closing unused accounts, you may check this <strong>Help </strong>article below:</p>

<p>
</p><p>For your group calls issue, how many members are on the group call? and the computer or device that’s hosting the group call needs to have enough processing power and network bandwidth for the call.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having many people on a call can sometimes put too much strain on the host device and cause call quality problems. To improve group call quality, make sure the host has a strong network and powerful processor, or reduce the number of people on the call.</p>

<h2>            Black Screen With Cursor After App Installation</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>Ok, so I know what you're thinking; another noob who needs to read forums more; but I have, and i'm still stumped.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I saw something about a prpgram.named duet display and thought "sounds pretty good, i'll have that", basically it turns your ipad into a second monitor for your pc. I install the program on windows and it asks to restart, as programs are want to do from
 time to time, and I click ok.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the computer starts up, I see the motherboard screen, bios text and then windows starts to load, and all I get is a black screen with the mouse cursor. Despite this, I think the login screen is behind this black screen, so I enter my password and hit
 enter, and it seems to be working like its logging in...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I went through the forums and figured it was a graphics driver conflict, so I managed to get the pc to start in safe mode with networking, uninstalled driver, reset; no effect. I tried to disable the integrated graphics only to find it is already
 disabled, doesnt even show up in the device manager. Ive tried recovery from last restore point (only yesterday), but it wont complete. I even tried installing the latest nvidia drivers for my card as a clean install, which has led to the black screen now
 has the.spinning dots. Ive left them running, in case it is installing some update that will fix the problem. &nbsp;I am loathe to reset windows as I only.just finished setting it up, this is a clean install with anniversary edition and a few games, but I really
 dont want to lose what settings i have managed to set up for myself if I can help it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ps, I have tried startup repair scan, windows +p trick, unplugging peripherals, shamanistic animal sacrifice and all the usual keyboard shortcuts including detect screen, all to no avail. Windows is activated and genuine, 16gb of ram, processor is an AMD
 FX6300 with and the hard drive was bought a week ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If someone could come along and give me the Nice, simple answer I have overlooked, that would be great :)</p>

            Hi Daniel,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the reply. May I knwo which Skype for Business client version are you using? Please provide us with the detailed information about this
<em>(e.g. 2016 MSO (16.0.10325.20103) 32-bit).</em><br />
<br />
Which kind of environment do you have set up, is it Skype for Business Hybrid/Server deployment or purely Skype for Business Online?<br />
<br />
Does this issue happen to any other users in your organization?<br />
<br />
If not, please try to check this issue via using any non-problematic colleague’s PC to see whether it is specific client side issue.<br />
<br />
Moreover, you may also try to check this issue via creating a new Windows user account and then performing a fresh install the latest
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/install-skype-for-business-8a0d4da8-9d58-44f9-9759-5c8f340cb3fb#OS_Type=Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Skype for Business application program from the portal</a> to see whether the problem still occurs.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
Shyamal

<h2>            Windows fresh&#47;clean usb install on Surface Pro 2 failure Error code&#58; 0xC004C003</h2>
                    <p>I'm having problems with activating windows 10. I am running a Surface Pro 2 I bought from bestbuy.ca and it came with windows 8.0 pre installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10 and downloaded the 64bit download tool (Media CreationToolx64.exe)&nbsp;and used it to download the windows 10&nbsp;iso. I used the fallowing settings
</a></p>
<p>Language: English United States</p>
<p>Edition: Windows 10 Pro</p>
<p>Architechture: 64-bit (x64)</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I then fallowed this guide</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-win_upgrade/creating-a-clean-installation-disk/c08003fd-8006-40a8-a3d9-1da2c35ed341">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-win_upgrade/creating-a-clean-installation-disk/c08003fd-8006-40a8-a3d9-1da2c35ed341</a></p>
<p>and&nbsp;used the Rufus tool to properly create a bootable windows 10 usb drive that my surface pro 2 could boot from.</p>
<span>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>I shut down the surface pro. Held the volume down button, pressed the power button, released the volume down button when the Surface logo appeared and it booted off the usb stick and proceeded with the windows 10 installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I do every time I do a fresh install of windows I chose custom install to get me to the list of partitions. I then deleted each partition until none existed and clicked next to proceed with the windows installation.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I simply I specified to skip typing in the product key during initial setup. Windows 10 installed fine and works fine. All drivers were installed and all systems running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After installing a few windows updates and my windows store apps again. I clicked Notification icon-&gt;All settings-&gt;Updates &amp; security-&gt;Activation</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under "Activate Windows" Windows is reporting "The product key doesn't work. You might need to get in touch with the store or company you bought windows from, or you can buy a new key from Microsoft."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clicking error details I get the message "Error code: 0xC004C003"&nbsp; "Error Description: The activation server determined that specified product key has been blocked." even though I had not provided it with a product key. I assumed it retrieved the windows
 8 key from the uefi bios.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Your Product key info" section reads&nbsp; "Current Product key: *****-3V66T" </p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I used a utility found on git hub to retrieve the windows 8 product key from uefi&nbsp;
<a href="https://github.com/christian-korneck/get_win8key#files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://github.com/christian-korneck/get_win8key#files</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The utility did indeed retrieve a product key ending in KP9F4.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a side note I must also mention that I recently had to install windows 8 on a laptop for my cousin, and that laptop had the windows product key embedded in the uefi bios. I performed the same steps installing windows 8 on that laptop as I did installing
 windows 10 on my surface pro 2. I made an assumption based on passed experience with the surface pro 2 trying to get it to boot from a usb drive unsuccessfully in the past&nbsp;that given it's only 1.5 years old that it too should have the windows 8 product key
 embedded in it's uefi bios.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to use the product key I got from&nbsp;the utility I got from git hub but got the fallowing error "Error installing product key Error code: 0xc004xe016" I am unable to determine with searches what this error code eludes to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what I can figure windows 10 is expecting a a windows 10 product key and I am assuming that it is trying to use the uefi embedded key that is a windows 8 key. Thus the issues i'm having.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So some questions are as fallows ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question 1: Because I did a fresh install from a usb stick should I have instead&nbsp;used the "Get Windows 10" tray icon to install a windows 10 upgrade over top of my previous windows 8.1 install, and if so would the upgrade process provide me with a new windows
 10 product key that I could have used at a later time&nbsp;during a fresh install of windows 10 via a usb key?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question 2: Do I need to call activation assistance and perhaps provide them with my surface pro 2's serial number to get a valid windows 10 product key. And&nbsp;if so where do I look to find the "activate by phone" phone number as the windows 10 activation
 screen does not provide one. Nore does it provide a button to click to get the number.</p>

            <p>I ended up downloading the windows 8.1 iso using the media creation tool and installing 8.1 fresh install and activating it then doing the win 10 upgrade. After that win 10 activated properly. I have not tried installing windows 8.1 letting it activate then
 installing win10 upgrade and letting it activate then wiping the drive again and installing win 10 directly and doing a fresh install to see if it will activate. I have a desktop machine I will be testing that scenario and will post results after completion.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing I noticed is that the win 10 upgrade does not provide me with a product key that I could write down and as of yet have not found an official&nbsp; way to retrieve the win 10 product key after it's been installed. So the question still remains how does
 one do a fresh install of win 10 if the win 10 upgrade does not give you a win 10 product key, because doing a fresh install of windows 10 prompts you for a product key during the initial installation process.</p>

</p><p>Thank you for the update. </p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You have to&nbsp;upgrade the existing operating system to Windows 10 once, then device becomes eligible for a clean install. This installation will not require the use of the Product Key.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can create a media by using the media creation tool. Refer to this <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Really syned n, </p>
<p>
</p><p>we have figured that out AFTER people started this process. Why does Microsoft even let a person do a clean install to begin with when upgrading if the out come can be a non validated OS with no recovery option. Microsoft should included a validation process
 of the current os before it even does anything else. Microsoft didn't code the update process properly and now people are stuck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the migration path was not executed by Microsoft correctly. Ms should not even give the end user the option to do a clean install until you've validated the windows 10 UPGRADE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft is responsible for this problem and should be actively fixing and correcting what you done to peoples hardware and software. If you give us the proper tools and migration path people wouldn't have this problem. Microsoft should not have offered
 a clean install option during the update. That option should only be released after windows 10 was installed and validated based on your comments above.</p>

 able to solve it: just create a partition of 20gb in your pc, install and activate w8 then use the media creation tool to upgrade to w10 choosing "save nothing", after that the new clean w10 will be activated and you can reboot to the old w10 installation
 (this one will be automatically activated!) and delete the old partition (and extend the partition where you taken the 20gb used for this trick).</span>

                    <p>I have windows 10 anniversary update installed.</p>
<p>I went to turn windows features on/off and ticked on Windows Subsystem for Linux (beta).</p>
<p>I went to settings/update&amp;security and enable developer mode and turned that on.</p>
<p>note in my event log saying these were done and system needs restart.</p>
<p>reboot machine.</p>
<p>enter bash on search and Cortana takes me to Windows store to install the game bish bash bus.</p>
<p>search store for bash and the only thing close is Terminal RT for windows 8.1.</p>
<p>search store for Linux and Ubuntu and still don't see anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>where is the windows 10 bash that is supposed to be automatically downloaded and installed?</p>
<p>Has it been removed?</p>

 it.&nbsp; I did a general search under c drive and under control panel.&nbsp; Where is it&nbsp;and why can I not install it?&nbsp; Thanks.

<p>wusa /uninstall /kb:2976978</p>
<p>wusa /uninstall /kb:3044374</p>
<p>wusa /uninstall /kb:3068708</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;Exit the command prompt, restart and run Windows Update again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Please follow the below steps to hide an update.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>1. Open the Control Panel and double click on the Windows Update icon. <br />
2. After Windows Updates or you check for updates, click/tap on the Update is available link.
<br />
3. Right click or press and hold on a listed Windows Update that you want to hide, then click/tap on Hide Update.
<br />
4. If prompted by UAC, then click/tap on Yes or enter the administrator's password.<br />
You will now notice that the now hidden Windows Update is grayed out. <br />
<br />

<p>Why should people ask her what games she wants to play when they don't do it for English people? &nbsp;French is the second most used language I think so she's not a trog or incapable of reasoned thought due to cultural limitations in thought through lack of
 communication. </p>

<p>I did mean all people, not just Alicia62160.</p>
<p>And the reason why is "This user's recent activity is not available." so we do not know what games they play if they block there activity, just like you Templar Boe we don't know what you are play'n.</p>
<p>So we don't know if we have the same games.</p>
<p>This has nothing to do with language, trog or incapable of reasoned thought.</p>
<p>We are just helping her out to find the correct way to the French speaking forum.</p>
<p>And since there is a French speaking forum she will find more French speaking people then on the English speaking forum.</p>
<p>French isn't the second most used language, so think again.</p>
<p>Top 10: Mandarin, Spanish, English, Hindi-Urdu, Arabic, Bengali, &nbsp;Portuguese, Russian, Japanese and Punjabi.</p>
<p>If you do wish to know then French is ranked nr. 16</p>
