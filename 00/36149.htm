    <title>Windows 7 Error&#58; &#34;Windows Explorer has stopped working&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 Error&#58; &#34;Windows Explorer has stopped working&#34; when trying to connect to network Shares.</h2>
                    I have newly installed Windows 7 Ultimate on my Laptop - clean, not upgrade. It is from MAPS and not a beta copy. When I try to connect to a network share, I get an error. "Windows Explorer has stopped working". If I go to Start &gt; Run and then type in
\\servername\users, I am prompted for credentials. I enter domainname\administrator and then the password, immediately I get an error message stating that "Windows Explorer has stopped working" then followed by "Windows
 Explorer is restarting..." and then the screen refreshes. If I open Computer &gt; Network &gt; Servername, I am again prompted for the credentials, but get the same message. The username/password combo doesn't seem to make any difference.<br />
<br />
One additional oddity, I went to Control Panel &gt; "Backup your computer", and when I was prompted for a network location to back up my system, I gave it the same network location and credential set and the system was successfully backed up to the network drive.

            I'm afraid you are stuck with trying the 'sfc /scannow' command run as admin. If no help you should try an in-place upgrade from the DVD. Some file is probably corrupt.

            Press Win Logo key+R, type: <strong>fsmgmt.msc<br />
<br />
</strong>Are you seeing your own shares?<br />
<br />
If so, open Credentials Manager in Control Panel, and look for an entry like your network logon. Deleting that may clear it up.

<h2>            windows fax and scan using lg-af300 and usb 56k modem</h2>
                    <p class="contentHeader2">How can I send and receive faxes using an LG-AF300 wireless phone modem and a USB 56K modem on my Windows 7 professional, (with Windows Fax and Scan<span> that is already part of the Operating System)? &nbsp;I've used this USB modem when
 I had DSL analogue phone service; then I changed to a "cellular" home phone. &nbsp;I see incoming calls coming on the Fax and Scan window, but can't send faxes following the instructions given to me by AT&amp;T reps and Windows documentation that came with the Windows
 7 software. &nbsp;How can I use what I have to fax files from my computer -- as I used to when I had DSL? &nbsp;Thanks.</span><br />

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would like to inform you that, a fax modem requires a standard wired phone line, you cannot fax modem using a broadband, wireless connection or USB modem. The GSM phone provider does not provide this service&nbsp;hence&nbsp;you&nbsp;could not use LG phone as a
 fax modem.</span></p>

    <title>Why am I Banned&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hipster0031  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why am I Banned&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I am a faithful Forza user since Forza 1 and I have always posted clean items in Storefront, Auction House, Club Garage and all. &nbsp;I have now been banned for 1 week with no explanation. &nbsp;I have a friends list with 80+ clean racers, I am president of a 42
 member Racing club specializing in clean A-Class races and there is no reason for my ban and no explanation by anyone. &nbsp;I paid for Forza and I paid for xbox live for Forza purposes only, therefore I deserve to be questioned not assumed guilty of a infraction.
 &nbsp;Who do I call and How do I call someone for if not resolving this issue then at least a list of infractions. &nbsp;Unless Microsoft, Turn 10, and The xbox community is run by a communist regime I have legal rights that allow me to face my accusers and challenge
 the charges. &nbsp;Please inform me of how to do this, thank you, your decade long faithful Racer, Hipster0031.</p>

<p>The only official way to enquire about a ban is to email *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. You can try posting on the official forums at forzamotorsport.net, but they'll usually just tell you they don't discuss bans in public and direct you to that email address anyway.</p>

<p>It's highly unlikely that they would respond and even less likely to give an exact reason.</p>
<p>It's best just to ride out the ban and get back to playing after. </p>
<p>As for your legal rights, you agreed to their terms. For the most part, their terms isn't an issue, but once every so often they pull something out that we might not have expected.</p>

<p>Theresa: Did you get the gamertag?</p>
<p>dave: no I don't pay attention to that ,, the guy took me out then I did the san</p>
<p>dave: one of bill gates homes is close to me I feel like droping him a note,, I understand why policeing is done,, but this is the wrong way</p>

<h2>            Update and windows defender security blocked</h2>
                    <p>Good morning<br />
</p>
<p>I can not unlock the windows update, and consequently also the windows defender security block.The last update is 03/02/2019 from there it is blocked everything.I also tried to follow the guides but do not unlock nothing, and it's the second time that happens
 to me. My notebook is an MSI with 16 GB of RAM, and I really do not understand why this problem happens and how to remedy it. As I understand it does not even know the developers microsoft, but one thing I know and is that this window 10 is really the worst
 operating system I've had.</p>
<p>The update error message is this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"There were some problems installing updates, but a further attempt will be made later. If the message appears again and you want to search for more information on the Web or contact technical support, this can be useful: (0x80070424)"</p>

            Hi Fabrizio
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />It looks like something deleted the Windows update service.  If Restoring the Windows update doesn't help, try doing a repair install.

<br />
<br />A repair Install keeps everything and reinstalls Windows.

            Hello Fabrizio,
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question.
<br />
<br />Please run Windows Update troubleshooter from Settings app &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot. See if it works. 
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work, try this:
<br />
<br />Open administrative Command Prompt and type following commands one-by-one followed by Enter key. 
<br />
<br />net stop wuauserv 
<br />net stop cryptSvc 
<br />net stop bits 
<br />net stop msiserver 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old 
<br />net start wuauserv 
<br />net start cryptSvc 
<br />net start bits 
<br />net start msiserver 
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt and see if Windows Updates works then. 
<br />
<br />Let us know if this helps!

    <title>No Password Hint appears in Win7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hayiam  say:</h3>
<h2>            No Password Hint appears in Win7</h2>
                    I am currently using "Windows 7 Ultimate N" it does not have media center, Media player and the movie maker etc but this is not the problem, I figured I needed to download this pack provided by microsoft anyways my real issue is that even though i have
 a hint set for my password but when ever i purposely enter a &nbsp;wrong password no hint appears. I have done restarting changing my Password and hint again but still no good. i was wondering if there is a certain file in the c drive that is responsible for this
 hint appearance so perhaps i can do something regarding that or maybe the problem is somwhat related to the "media center problem" thing.

    <title>Task manager prevents Windows from shutting down - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> accessshell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Task manager prevents Windows from shutting down</h2>
                    <p>For about one month now whenever I shutdown, the task manager prevents the shutdown.&nbsp; Message is task manager is shutting down, but it is not really.&nbsp; I have waited for up to 10 minutes and no change, I need to click on force shutdown then ok.&nbsp; Then the
 system shuts down.</p>
<p>I read somewhere to open the task manager, then shut down so I can see what is preventing the shut down.&nbsp; That does not help as first the desk top goes away and I get the screen that the task manage is waiting to close.</p>
<p>So I have two questions:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; What could have happened so I can prevent this from happening?</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Does it really matter if I have to do a force shut down?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hello Chris,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur due to software conflicts or if Windows is infected by a virus or malware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need not have to force shut down Windows as it may cause booting issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to <strong>perform clean boot </strong>and check the issue.<br />
</p>
<p>Refer this article:<br />
<strong>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</strong><br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps from section “How to reset the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshooting” to reset the computer to start as usual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please also <strong>run Microsoft safety scanner </strong>to check and remove any virus or malware.<br />
Refer:<br />
<strong>Microsoft safety scanner</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this information helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do let us know if you need any further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<span>&nbsp;It could possibly be the settings that might have changed. When you are using the webcam check for settings/preferences and see if you can make those changes. You can check for these settings in

<p>I want to remove a Subscription from my xbox live account,its a 1 month renew Subscription,recently i purchased a 1 year xbox live membership and i noticed that money was still being taken out of my bank account,i have tried to cancel my subscription on
 the xbox.com website and on my xbox 360 as well,when i tried to cancel the only Subscription i could see was the 12 month redeemed code,so i cannot end the 1 month renew Subscription as there isnt a option to do so.</p>

<p>Sounds like domain joined device where your admin has locked you out of those settings.&nbsp; If not domain joined I have no idea why it would be grey.&nbsp; A workaround option: Look to the right under related settings - you can manually change your time by clicking
 the link.&nbsp; It opens the clock, language and region section of control panel (still there just hidden).&nbsp; This isn't official answer but at least it allows you to&nbsp; update your time.</p>

<p>Hi Darry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for coming here to express your concern. Could you please help me understand where your frustration is coming from? Perhaps an earlier post you made that I dont see?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In terms of your tables being gone have you checked in your Ready to Install Section of the Game within the My Game &amp; Apps screen?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To see this you must:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;1.&nbsp;Hover over the Game in My Games &amp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Apps. Then press the Select button to&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;view options.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;2. Select Manage game &amp; add-ons.</p>

<p>Microsoft isnt responsible for a game developers failures in creating a game. Look at game server maintenance as example when they go down for x amount of time it's not Microsoft taking them offline it's the developer.</p>

<p>Pinball FX 2 was superseded by Pinball FX 3. Unfortunately, not all pinball tables available made the jump from Pinball FX 2 for Xbox 360 to the same game on Xbox One, let alone all the way to FX 3. Things to check, just to be sure:</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, make sure you're signed on using the same Microsoft account that bought the original tables. Second, with Pinball FX 3 launched, go to the main menu page of the game. You should see a list of button options towards the bottom right corner. One of
 those should say "X - Import Tables". Press this, and it will scan your account and import tables that you own on your account AND are eligible for import.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What tables are you missing, to your knowledge?</p>

            I sincerely thank you for not giving an ambiguous reply like the other ambivalent ambassadors. I have only been allowed to re-download the Bethesda tables containing “Doom” “Skyrim” and “Fallout”. To my knowledge i used to own five Marvel tables, Excalibur,
 Mars, Paranormal, Biolab, Pasha, Rome, Secrets of the deep and more that i can’t recall

<p>Okay, that is a start. Did you buy them for FX 2 on Xbox One, or on Xbox 360?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you bought them for the One, you should verify you own them by going to the Microsoft Account site and reviewing your purchase history.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, have you perhaps changed consoles recently? I have had table sets disappear from use. Deleting the problem table pack and reinstalling it (from My Games &amp; Apps) fixed it.</p>

<h2>            windows 7 HDMI audio not being detected.</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have spent around 10 hours or so on this so far and done everything recommended online including all of the steps in:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-pictures/windows-7-hdmi-sound-not-in-playback/739334b6-4169-44a4-b2a1-b2b5793a987b</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0f8c38c9-743e-4300-81f4-d83bc327830d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0f8c38c9-743e-4300-81f4-d83bc327830d?upload=true" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>As you can see, my Panasonic TV does not appear in the playback list of my newly built computer, even with disabled/disconnected devices checked.</p>
<p>I have another computer which does show Panasonic TV there using the same cable, and I can verify that at the time of writing the sound works fine on the other machine. So this is not a TV/cable issue, it's an issue local to my newly built computer and new
 installation of windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to confirm if I rightclick the 'digital audio s/pdif' icon above and press 'test' I hear no sound through the TV. Picture comes through fine on the TV it is just an audio issue.</p>
<p>It's also worth mentioning that I can hear sound through my headphones on the troublesome machine and when experiencing these issues they and no other devices were connected to any of the audio jacks on the computer. The HDMI is the only connected audio
 device and it connects through the graphics card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My spec is as follows:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>graphics card: NVIDIA 9800 GT.</li><li>processor: intel i5-7600k.</li><li>motherboard: gigabyte z270p-d3.</li><li>windows 7 64bit</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I firstly installed the high definition audio drivers directly from the gigabyte cd which came with the motherboard. This appears to have installed some software which pops open every time i plug in my headphones to prompt me 'what type of device did you
 just connect'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly i did all of the windows updates and because my processor is apparently not supported by windows 7 it fails on the installation of KB4054518 and KB3150513 as well as 2 or 3 security updates. I am not sure how relevant this is to the sound issue?
 On a side-note I would prefer not to get windows 10 as the last time I used it it would automatically shut down to install updates even if I was in the middle of some unsaved work, and my work requires my computer to run uninterrupted 24/7 which didn't appear
 to be possible in windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thirdly I attempted to install the latest NVIDIA drivers directly from their website and after all of these steps sound still does not come through to the TV.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c8604465-9b3f-440a-b30b-d7d58ddf8799?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c8604465-9b3f-440a-b30b-d7d58ddf8799?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Interestingly, in the NVIDIA control panel (I think this came with the NVIDIA drivers) it appears to detect 'Panasonic-TV' as a connected device.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/321a0d53-e6dd-4723-8125-dac96d87a0c7?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/321a0d53-e6dd-4723-8125-dac96d87a0c7?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that the High Definition Audio Controller in the device manager is 'enabled'.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/705c783a-71e9-486b-bf1d-d25befc5972e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/705c783a-71e9-486b-bf1d-d25befc5972e?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And so is the High Definition Audio Device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried every possible combination of turning the computer on and off again with and without the TV off or on and it doesn't seem to make any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cb0cb005-9326-42c7-afd4-47323fdfa572?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cb0cb005-9326-42c7-afd4-47323fdfa572?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If I run the troubleshoot playback devices these are the only two options I get. I'm guessing a third option for hdmi should appear here? either way none of the options help and the next step for the speakers shows:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/847b5b71-c368-4e8c-a1d5-447c5b798b6a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/847b5b71-c368-4e8c-a1d5-447c5b798b6a?upload=true" /></a></p>

<p>Hi RikTodd,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the information that you've provided, the audio driver that you're using is from the CD that came with the device. It is possible that the installed driver is outdated and causing your device to not function properly. As an initial step to eliminate
 any driver related issues, I suggest that you check out the manufacturer's support site and download the latest version of audio and video driver. Once you've completed the download, double click on the file to run the installer. Follow the on-screen instructions
 to complete the setup. </p>
<p>
</p><p>After completing the setup, check if the device will appear under the list of <strong>
<em>Playback</em></strong> devices. If yes, set it as default audio and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll appreciate if you can send us an update.</p>

<p>Hi Darwin,<br />
<br />
Thank you so much for taking the time to read and help me with this. I went to the Gigabyte website (I assumed the motherboard is what you meant by 'device'?), downloaded and installed the latest driver from:<br />
<br />
https://www.gigabyte.com/Motherboard/GA-Z270P-D3-rev-10#support-dl<br />
<br />
choosing the first and most recent file (mb_driver_v83.zip).<br />
<br />
The install wizard first uninstalled my existing realtek high definition audio drivers, and then rebooted. After which it finished installing the new drivers, and rebooted again claiming to have done so successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately the problem persists and the device is not visible in the playback window (irrespective of showing the hidden/disabled devices).</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5346a88b-a150-445a-b609-2dcc99c0e913?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5346a88b-a150-445a-b609-2dcc99c0e913?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>It may be worth pointing out that there are two HDMI ports on my computer. One that feeds directly into the motherboard, and one that feeds directly into the NVIDIA graphics card (9800GT). The latter is the one which I am using, although downloading the
 latest NVIDIA sound drivers didn't appear to help either.</p>

<p>Hello RikTodd,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apologies for the delayed response. Kindly check the following settings to ensure that the device configuration is set accordingly. Here are the things to consider:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><em><strong>Ensure that you're using the appropriate&nbsp;</strong></em><em><strong>HDMI audio</strong></em><em><strong>port</strong></em>. Always use the graphics card port for the device to be recognized.</li><li><em><strong>Compare the driver version</strong></em>. If the other device that you've mentioned is using the same graphics card unit, then compare the version that's running on that device versus the one running on the affected device. To do this follow
 these steps:
<ol>
<li>Go to <em><strong>Device Manger</strong></em>.</li><li>Click the drop -down arrow to view the audio driver.</li><li>Right-click and select <strong><em>Properties</em></strong>.</li><li>Check the version under the <em><strong>Driver</strong></em> tab.</li><li>If the version doesn't match. Manually download the driver from the support site, then install the same version to the affected device. Once you're done, check if the issue persists.</li></ol>
<p>
</p></li></ul>
<p>Let us know should you need further assistance.</p>
        </p>

<p>Hi Darwin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As mentioned, the HDMI cable does connect via the graphics card. I am unable to verify the same graphics card on the second machine as that uses its own built-in card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing I have recently learned is that HDMI sound <em>actually worked before
</em>on this machine after windows was freshly installed and due to a separate sound related issue some setting may have been disabled or tampered with, and only since then the sound stopped working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried everything I can think of with regards to the drivers:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.) installing the latest NVIDIA HD Audio drivers for my graphics card and uninstalling the motherboard's HD Audio Drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.) uninstalling the NVIDIA HD Audio drivers for the graphics card and reinstalling the motherboard's HD Audio Drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.) Installing both the NVIDIA HD Audio drivers and the motherboard's HD Audio Drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.) Uninstalling all of the drivers and letting Windows Update detect/install them for me automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5.) Using a program called DDU to uninstall all of the drivers in safe-mode and reinstalling them both manually and automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that there is nothing I can do to fix this by changing the drivers. I have also tried 'cleaning' the windows registry in case that was an issue with Glary Utilities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I think this may be related to tampering with some sound setting from a previous issue it would be helpful to have a complete list of all the settings that need to be enabled and services that need to be running for HD sound to
 be detected in the playback window.</p>

<p>I appreciate the comprehensive response. All the possible software issues has been ruled out based on the steps that you've performed. In addition, your system setting and configuration should be set to default since
<em><strong>Windows 7</strong></em> was just recently installed. Being said, our next option is to engage the support of the graphics card manufacturer to check out device compatibility and further isolate any possible hardware issues.

<p>Hi Darwin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your continued responses. I am certain that the hardware is fine because like I say sound
<em>did work before</em> on this machine so the problem must be software related. I am also confident that a fresh re-installation of windows would fix this, however I now have all of my work on the machine and would prefer not to reinstall windows and without
 understanding what the issue is it would probably at some point just happen again anyway.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Online people are suggesting that a known issue is that updating the realtek drivers can cause sound to only come from the speakers and not through HDMI. Perhaps this has happened to me. However if I try to install the&nbsp;<span>ATI
 HDMI Audio Device (R2.70)&nbsp;</span>from realtek.com which is posted elsewhere as a solution I am simply given the error 'no driver was supported in this driver package' before it quits the installer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you know what this error means? Only it doesn't appear to be documented anywhere. Also the 'Gigabyte realtek audio manager' has dosens of settings on several pages which do things like 'disable front panel detection jack' etc. I wonder if some combination
 of these flags could be what's causing this to miss the HDMI? This is all so very badly documented and there appear to be no robust troubleshooting steps to what is probably just a simple issue for a common problem.
</p>
<p><br />
I am also as mentioned concerned about the failure of windows update to install important updates, blaming my processor intel i5-7600k and wonder if they may be related to the issue. Why won't windows 7 support new (last generation) processors? Has Microsoft
 abandoned support for Windows 7 altogether?<br />
</p>

<p>Aside from the clean install, checking the actual hardware and hardware compatibility by&nbsp;seeking additional support coming from the device manufacturer is another way to further isolate the issue. This would provide us a better view of the issue prior to
 performing the install. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, you can perform these methods below to ensure that the device is configured properly and better identify any hardware issues:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Properly reset the device for it to be recognized</strong></em>. To do this, follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ensure that the latest sound card driver is installed.</li><li>Connect the HDMI cable from PC to the appropriate TV HDMI output.<br />
<em><strong>Note:</strong> Some TV provided multiple HDMI port. Ensure that the HDMI cable is plugged-in to the compatible port. Ex. HDMI 2 to HDMI 2. Check TV manufacturer's site for further details.</em></li><li>Ensure that the TV is switched off. Now restart the PC.</li><li>Go to, Control Panel &gt; Sound &gt; Playback and check if the device will show from the lists.<br />
</li><li>Once the device appeared, right-click on HDMI output and select Test to ensure that the device is working.</li><li>If yes, set device as default by clicking the Set Default button.</li><li>Once you're done check if issue persists.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Run the Sound troubleshooter</strong> </em>to identify any hardware issues. Here are the steps on how to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Type Troubleshooting in the search box.</li><li>Under Hardware and Sound, click Troubleshoot audio playback.</li><li>The troubleshooter will open, click Next and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the process.</li><li>Wait for the troubleshooter to complete and take note of any error message/s.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Lastly, use the on-board HDMI port and check if the issue persists.</strong></em>This would help us identify if issue is specific to the GPU's HDMI audio.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, could you provide additional information about the failed Windows Update that you encountered. Did you get any error message? As an initial step, you can download and install the
<em><strong><a href="https://aka.ms/diag_wu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Update Troulbeshooter</a></strong></em> to scan and identify any update components preventing the update from completing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your response.</p>

            <p>I am experiencing Wireless issues myself.&nbsp;I have made reports about it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>ireless does not connect when resume from sleep or hibernation on Windows 10 Pro 64 bit build 10240. When I try connect to a wireless network after resuming from sleep or hibernation, I cannot. I have to restart each time. This requires that I close all
 open windows and web browser tabs everytime this happens. I am sharing the Internet from a Nokia Lumia 625 running Windows Phone 8.1. I have isolated the issue because this also happens when I use a Android smartphone too, its not the access points that I
 am using. I never experienced this problem in Windows 10 builds 10166 and earlier. This just started happening in build 10240 since I upgraded to it on Thursday through Windows Update from build 10166 64 bit.

            Wow I though I was the only one with Wi-Fi issue, I tried resent Winsock and Ip, dns, with no luck! any ideas? I tried tethering with my samsung tablet for wifi, it usually works and now it's not after an upgrade, I have Linksys WUSB6300 AC1200 USB Wi-Fi
 AC card, I tried downloading drivers from official linksys webpage and there's only Windows 8.1 x64 latest, so yeah I might need to find my old wifi card and used it for the time being or is just a Winsock related problem, maybe registry corruption, I did
 all the steps, and successfully upgraded from 8.1 to 10 and Installed NVidia Graphics driver windows 10, still no luck, why is this happening, good thing its free upgrade, or else i would be really mad and start calling Microsoft Tech support number, I'm keeping
 my cool for the time being, but please I need a solution as soon as possible!&nbsp;

            Well I already decided to clean install Windows 10, and its a lot better, no issues on drivers and no conflicts! btw if you're planning to reset windows 10 to default, make sure you backup tour user settings and documents on C not the whole thing, just
 a reminder so you won't loose you save games and other settings on applications such as license!

            <p>You miss the point. Because the file format cannot support underline Notepad itself will not do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to upgrade from the .txt (text) file of Notepad to the .rtf (Rich Text File) file type. This can be done by using WordPad instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Often overlooked WordPad is included as part of Windows (no extra purchase required) and has enough functionality to create good looking basic documents. For example a typical CV should be clean, clear and easy to read yet most look to Word for their default</p>

<h3> taloshz  say:</h3>
<h2>            The PlayReady update was Incomplete.You will not be able to watch or record protected content until the is successsful. Anyone have this same problem and found a fix &#63;</h2>
                    I have clean installed 2x times the RC of windows 7 pro x64. Both times I have gotten this error in media center. I have&nbsp; manually downloaded the playready 1.3 program. I can record my satalite channels with no problems so I do not understand why it keeps
 saying the message above. I am however worried that when the DRM updates for the satalite it will no longer work and I wont be able to update it. I have not changed anything in the hardware in the computer also so it would not be because it thinks its a different
 computer. Any help would be appreciated.

            <p>Clarification on this: Been working on this issue for over 2 months on 4 computers, this is what i've found.
</p>
<p>Note: Not all fixes will work on a pc due to various stages of updates, patches, etc. No matter what anyone says or claims. What works for me, the other person, or even tech support, may not due to some odd configuration on your pc. None the less, this is
 what I've done on the final 3 computers that didn't auto update the readyplay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) get to the point in media center that it says Readyplay Failed to update, do you wish to try again.
</p>
<p>(OPTIONAL) Download the Reset DRM Tool from Microsoft, Change Compatibility Mode to Windows 7 (or lesser version of Windows), Run the Tool As Admin. It should Install and say Successful.</p>
<p>2) Open up Windows "Services" via Control Pannel &gt; Administrative Tools &gt; Services.</p>
<p>3) With Media Center Open and Showing "The&nbsp;PlayReady update was incomplete. Do you want to try again?" Goto the "Services" pannel you just opened and scroll all the way down to "Windows Media Center Receiver Services", double click on it, then click "Stop"</p>
<p>4) Navigate to the ReadyPlay HIDDEN folder (C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\PlayReady) and THEN delete the mspr.hds file.</p>
<p>5) Go back to the STILL OPEN &amp; RUNNING, Media Center and click "Yes" and "Next" to the Update PlayReady question. It should immediately zip past and say update complete &amp; you can watch and record copy protected bla bla bla. It may also update a guide or
 something too.</p>
<p>If this doesn't work for you after 5-6 tries, you might have something else blocking you, but you don't need both 32bit and 64bit PlayReady installed for it to update. It's the 'Service' that is truley stopping the update, but just simply stopping it w/o
 those others steps may not get it working &gt;.&lt; </p>
<p>Good luck! </p>

            Thanks Mcshane for some odd reason I guess the third try was the charm I uninstalled it yet again today and tried somethng weird actually even though I&nbsp; had the x86 installed only before. I installed both the x86 and the amd64 versions and low and behold
 it updated /shakes head. I dbl checked and it updated both so I guess whatever was blocking it was fixed by loading both. Thanks for the help.

            With misbehaving Windows Store apps, I've sometimes found that the best solution is to uninstall the app (right click, and select uninstall) then re-download/install. This usually does the trick providing everything else is working normally.

    <title>&#34;Printer properties cannot be displayed. The print spooler service - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> terrafrost  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Printer properties cannot be displayed. The print spooler service is not running.&#34; &#40;even when it is running&#41;</h2>
                    When I right click on a particular printer and try to view the Properties of it, I get the following message:
<br />
<blockquote>Printer properties cannot be displayed. &nbsp;The print spooler service is not running</blockquote>
<p>Problem is, it is running, as going to Administrative Tools -&gt; Services in the Control Panel verifies.</p>
<p>One of the "printers" I have installed is "Send To OneNote 2007". &nbsp;I can right click on that just fine - just not this other printer. Would I be able to do that if the print spooler wasn't running?</p>
Indeed, if I do disable the print spooler, *all* the printers in "Printers and Faxes" disappear. &nbsp;So the fact that I'm even seeing them in the first place suggests to me that the printer spooler is running.<br />
<br />
I posted this on <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/microsoft.public.windowsxp.general" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
microsoft.public.windowsxp.general</a> a while ago and someone there suggested I visit
<a href="http://www.utilitiessoftware.org/print-spooler" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this site</a> .&nbsp; Problem is, C:\WINDOWS\system32\spool\PRINTERS is empty. &nbsp;It's empty when the Print Spooler is running and it's empty when it isn't.
<br />
<p>Also, I was unable to install KB896423 since I'm running SP3. &nbsp;Trying to install it got me the following:</p>
<blockquote>Setup has detected that the Service Pack version of this system is newer than the updates you are applying.<br />
<br />
There is no need to install this update.</blockquote>
The printer is a "Local printer attached to this computer" connected via a "Standard TCP/IP Port". &nbsp;Personally, I think such a printer ought to be called "A network printer, or a printer attached to another computer", but that's the terminology the "Add Printer
 Wizard" uses.

            Hello terrafrost,<br />
<br />
Thank you for visiting the Microsoft Answers Community.<br />
<br />
What is the model number of the printer you are using?<br />
<br />
Printing to a "Standard TCP/IP Port, is used for a printer that is directly connected to a network, not your local system.<br />
<br />
I would try to uninstall your printer, and reinstall your printer.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps

            Hi Maggie<br /> <br />Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft Community. My name is Steven P., an Independent Advisor. I will be assisting you. <br /><br />Your Skype name is the username you created when you first joined Skype, other than your email address or phone number.<br /><br />If you sign in with an email address or phone number instead, then you have a Microsoft account, not a Skype Name.<br /><br />If you can't find your Skype Name, kindly:<br /><br />Tap or click your profile picture and both your Skype Name, and the account you're signed in as will be displayed on your profile. If you're signed in to a different account than you were expecting.<br /><br /><br /><br />Regards,<br />Steven P

4. Click Apply and the Ok.<br />

    <title>MIDI USB Class Compliant Devices Do Not Work in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tecmobowlted  say:</h3>
<h2>            MIDI USB Class Compliant Devices Do Not Work in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>
There seems to be a tremendous bug in Windows 10 whereby class compliant USB Midi devices are not recognized properly (read as composite devices instead of USB Audio devices, and with an error flag in Device Manager) or are recognized but cannot communicate
 to DAW programs that are supposed to use them.</p>
<p>
I have searched for hours, and found nothing but many, many threads of frustrated users. Help options seem to be limited to useless generic posts about contacting the device manufacturer (even though this issue occurs on TONS of devices and again, these are
 class compliant devices) or trying Windows troubleshooting or repair (but this is an inherent bug, so there's nothing to fix).</p>
<p>
Is there any hero out there who has solved this problem? Or anyone with some kind of access to a higher level of tech support? I don't imagine the fix would really be that difficult for dedicated high-level MS engineers, but it's clear that no one has solved
 this yet and it's a major Windows 10 shortcoming.</p>
<p>
I've just spent $800 on a new Windows 10 PC, and am very frustrated to find I can't use my keyboard anymore without spending another $50 on a MIDI USB device cable that has specific Windows 10 drivers.</p>
<p>
Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hey I had the same exact problem and this is how I fixed it, even if it doesn't work everytime! (but it is repeatable with an high rate of success)<br />
My keyboard is a CASIO CTK - 2400 and I run win10 on a Laptop/Tablet configuration.<br />
This is how I managed to make it work and what I suggest you try:<br />
-Connect the keyboard to a USB 3.0 port and turn it on (this is how I did it so I suggest you try this before trying it another way)</p>
<p>-Go to Settings&gt;Devices&gt;Connected devices and click on Device manager</p>
<p>-Check for the connection (my PC did recognize the keyboard as an unknown USB device)</p>
<p>-Press right click on Sound, video and game controllers and select "Scan for hardware changes"</p>
<p>-When I did it the PC finally recognized the keyboard showing a CASIO driver</p>
<p>after that the keyboard wouldn't still send MIDI signals but I knew it was recognized so I insisted to find a way with the DAW Fruity Loops and this is how I make it work every time!</p>
<p>-turn off the keyboard</p>
<p>-open the DAW and turn on the keyboard</p>
<p>-refresh the MIDI device list</p>
<p>-when it's connected to the USB 3.0 port it works only briefly (couple seconds)</p>
<p>-when it's connected to the USB 2.0 port it works perfectly (just a really tiny lag but it may be because of the keyboard anyway nothing too bad)</p>
<p>-sometimes it stops working even when plugged in the USB 2.0 port my suggestion is to reset the DAW and then the PC and see if it fixes it<br />
<br />
This is not ideal for live perfomances... but good enough for studio sessions.<br />
I hope this was of help, God bless!</p>

            Microsoft needs to listen. Content creators that work with an OS can influence a lot of people. Plugging in a class compliant USB midi device that worked [perfect until windows 10 but works as long as its a USB 3.x port is ignorant. If anyone comes across
 this problem, im using a ROLI seabord, that is class compliant, but is not recognized in windows 10 because it was plugged into a USB 2 port. This seems like im beta testing, whats up with your testers, or compliance dept? Really? No one mentioned that music
 creation in windows 10 is unnecessarily frustration? &nbsp;next computer is mac, if your building your own pc think mac these things SUCK....
