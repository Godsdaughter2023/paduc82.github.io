<h2>            Outlook 2016 Error 17099 on Mac</h2>
                    <p>We upgraded to Office 365 a couple of month ago. Outlook 2016 worked fine until a couple of weeks ago, where we started being unable to send messages. The error we are getting is 17099. I found loads of information about how to fix this issue with Outlook
 2011 however that is not applicable (at least I cannot find how to do it). </p>
<p>May be one of you can help.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<h2>            Grammar exceptions in Word&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Okay, so I am a court reporter, and I use the term "Your Honor" several hundred times a day. When time comes to clean up a transcript, I find the Spelling/Grammar check incredibly useful, EXCEPT for the fact that it sees "Your Honor" as grammatically incorrect,
 and keeps suggesting I use "You're Honor", which is incorrect by most any standard. So far I have found no way to get past this. There is only an option to IGNORE ONCE, so I still have to see it over and over as it clogs up my review of a document. Is there
 any way I can remedy this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I am on Word 2013 for PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

                    I made a mistake when setting up my Nokia Lumia 800, the year of birth going in as 2010 when it should be 1940! As a result, if I try to download an app from "App highlights", I get a message "Sorry you need to do this from your computer because your account
 indicates that you are a child". Could you please tell me how to find and correct the date of birth field. Thank you. Kasp1n &nbsp;

 I can figure out how to resolve this and possibly speak to a person at Microsoft Support to get this fixed. Does anyone know how to get in contact with someone at Microsoft Support?

                    <p>I'm running into some issues when recording narration on powerpoint (on PC). It's worked fine in the past, but this time, when playing back, some of the audio clips started automatically fast-forwarding partway through the clip, and becomes garbled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions for ways to fix this? I'd like to be able to salvage the audio.&nbsp;</p>

1. change your passwords <br />
2. manage your trusted devices <br />
3. enable two-step verification <br />

    <title>Windows Defender in Windows 10 keep crashing my system - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eleanormell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Defender in Windows 10 keep crashing my system</h2>
                    <p>I work out of my house on my PC that has Windows 10 Pro. I use a Licensed Software Package on my local drive. I transcribe audio files. With that said, every day about 1 hour into my work, the system crashes giving me a stop code error. It is extremely frustrating!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to turn Defender off, leave it on, run an update prior to working, stop and save when I see the hard drive LED with a solid light indicating that something is updating, removing programs, scheduling automatic scans at night via the Computer
 Management Task Scheduler, all of it is a waste of time. I have set the time to be AZ local time via the control panel hoping that the busy hours would kick in. Windows Defender seems to have a mind of it's own and it is creating a non-productive work environment.
 Is there anything I can do. I don't use Windows Defender, I have other protective software. To be honest, Windows Defender is one of the reasons I totally dislike being forced to use it. Does anybody know how to get around this problem? Windows doesn't seem
 to help, all it does is take me out to a list of suggestions that do not help as well.</p>

<p>
</p><p>1. Did the computer come with Win10 preinstalled, did&nbsp;you do a clean install of Win10,&nbsp;or did you upgrade a Win7 computer or a Win8.1 computer [&lt;=PICK ONE!]&nbsp;to Win10?

<p>Well, I've got a problem with that: Vista wasn't a valid upgrade path for Win10. Win7, Win8 &amp; Win8.1, yes - but not Vista or earlier.

            <p>You are speaking with Eleanor (Ellie) and Robert (her husband).</p>
<p>The upgrade to Win 10 Home from Vista (default image) was done thru the MS upgrade notification icon on the task bar. When Win 10 came available in June 2015(?) I ran the system compatibility check and it said the video driver maybe and issue. Knowing this
 I did complete the Win 10 Home upgrade on Ellie's system with no trouble, video even worked. I then reinstalled the NVIDIA driver off the HP downloads web page. Never had a single problem until Win 10 Pro upgrade was purchased and installed.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many times Windows defender takes off running updates or scans anytime it wants to, completely ignoring the set work hours and using up to 54% of the memory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears she has something causing memory leaks I have not found yet. I did increase the page file size setting manually and so far the BSOD error appears to stopped or at do not occur anywhere near as often. I also have not seen any critical errors in
 the event viewer under system and software sections.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try to keep you updated on just I run across to finally nail the problem down, even a complete clean reinstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so very much for your time trouble!</p>

    <title>KB4011614 &#40;Security Update for Microsoft Word 2010&#41; breaks - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> d. lawson  say:</h3>
<h2>            KB4011614 &#40;Security Update for Microsoft Word 2010&#41; breaks Goldmine PLUS connectivity</h2>
                    <p>Several of our Goldmine 8.5.2.8 users discovered that their Word 2010 documents linked to Goldmine via Goldmine PLUS (which automatically updates fields in the document with contact information from the active record in Goldmine) were no longer automatically
 updating this morning. I determined that security update KB4011614, which was released on 12/12/17 and automatically installed overnight, is the culprit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4011614/descriptionofthesecurityupdateforword2010december12-2017</p>
<p>
</p><p>"This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office that could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted Office file."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Uninstalling it resolved the problem and allowed the Word documents to update the fields linked to Goldmine as usual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While it is easy enough to hide the KB4011614 update in Windows 7 to prevent it from installing/reinstalling, the ability to hide individual updates has apparently been removed in Windows 10, so my (hopefully temporary) workaround for our Windows 10 workstations
 is to pause Windows updates so that KB4011614 doesn't automatically reinstall. This of course prevents any other Windows updates from installing, which is a less than ideal solution. I am open to other suggestions.</p>

            You will have to contact the manufacturer of Goldmine for an updated version of their software. Microsoft won't take responsibility for third-party products.

            We encountered the same problem with Goldmine 2017.1.0.384 and KB4011614. Within MS Word 2010 (File&gt;Options&gt;Add-ins), the Goldmine Plus add-in appears to be operational but does not function, no matter which method is used to merge the contents of Goldmine
 fields into a Word template. We found that uninstalling MS update KB4011614 re-enabled Goldmine Plus without requiring a reboot. We are on Win7 so hiding the update was simple. Windows 10 users may be able to hide the update - search for 'How to Hide or Show
 Windows Updates in Windows 10'.<br />

<br />
<p><span>To change DDE functionality in Word after installing the update, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>In the Registry Editor navigate to \HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\<strong>&lt;version&gt;</strong>\Word\Security &gt;&gt; AllowDDE(DWORD)
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>
Note</strong>: that <strong>&lt;version&gt; </strong>reflects the highest version shown in registry</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Example: \HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\<strong>16.0</strong>\Word\Security &gt;&gt; AllowDDE(DWORD)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>Set the DWORD value based on your requirements as follows:</span></p>
<p><span>AllowDDE(DWORD) = 0: To disable DDE. This is the default setting after you install the update.</span></p>
<p><span>AllowDDE(DWORD) = 1: To allow DDE requests to an already running program</span><span>, but prevent DDE requests that require
 another executable program to be launched.</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span>AllowDDE(DWORD) = 2: To fully allow DDE requests...'</span></em></strong></p>

I apologize for the late reply, but thank you for this. I can confirm that it resolves the issue on our version of Goldmine, and presumably other versions as well.<br />

<h2>            Word goes automatically to &#34;all markup&#34; after rejecting a comment, saving slow</h2>
                    Hi all,<br />
<br />
When I erase/reject a comment in TC, the document reverts automatically to All Markup though I work exclusively in Simple Markup. Not a big deal except that it takes a few moments for it to load with large documents, and sometimes the page comes up with a different
 paragraph in the window. It's annoying to wait and then click back to Simple Markup. Are there any preferences I can change to prevent this from happening? Also, with those same large documents (about 200-300 pages), saving can start to take way too long.
 The auto-save interrupts my work and makes it impossible to continue while it saves, which can take 5 or more seconds.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your time.<br />
Plisca<br />

Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Office Community.<br />
<br />
It is by design that the tracking option will automatically change to all mark up when you make any revision.<br />
<br />
Normally when you Accept\Reject any changes, it will automatically focus on the next change for review.<br />
<br />
Provide additional information:<br />
<br />
1) What is the size of the problem Word document?<br />
2) Are you experiencing this issue on a specific Word document or on all document?<br />

            <p>This is strange. As I wrote, simply deleting a comment does not change the markup view on my installation of Word 2013.<br />
<br />
If you delete a comment in a document where there is no tracked changes in the text, does Word still switch to All Markup?<br />
<br />
If you switch back to Simple Markup, exit Word, and then reopen the document, does that preserve the setting?</p>

<h2>            Issues with updating builds &#40;error 0xc000000f&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have following machine I want to update to 10061:</p>
<p>Motion Computing J3500 (Machine A)</p>
<p>i7 680U</p>
<p>Toshiba SSD 120 GB mSATA</p>
<p>Sierra Gobi 3000</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is that the updates everytime are failing with error 0xc000000f and resulting in a complete data loss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I have tried the same thing with another&nbsp;Motion Computing J3500 (Machine B)</p>
<p>i7 640U</p>
<p>Toshiba SSD 120 GB SATA</p>
<p>Sierra Gobi 2000</p>
<p>
</p><p>This time all updates was successfully!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I openend both machines to check, what is different. (See above)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I'm sure I can narrow this issue down to the SSDs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the machine A there is a <strong>mSATA</strong> base drive build in.<br />
In the machine B there is a standard SATA 2,5" build in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I'm believing that there are no drivers being loaded for the <strong>mSATA</strong> drive while the update procedure . Therefore the access to the mSATA drive is somehow getting lost. &nbsp;This would also explain the data loss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The mSATA drive is constructed in two components. The base board and the mSATA board. &nbsp;The base board is glued (!) to the main frame and can not get removed. There is no way to replace this component for testing with a standard SATA SSD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft need to fix this issue because there are many other computers with mSATA drives, which can fail any updates!</p>

            In the short: Either the reset as mentioned above was not necessary because the build updates was running fine. Or then it did not help at all. I guess there is an issue with mSATA in general.

<h2>            Users emails going straight to Drafts and unable to send</h2>
                    
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>I have 1 user who cannot send any email either to an internal address or an external address.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the users sends or replies to an email it goes straight to her drafts folder. When I go to send it from the drafts folder it comes up as "you do not have permission to perform this action"</p>
<p>I have checked her licence and mailbox permissions and they are as they should be. I have tried removing her license, waiting 15 minutes and re-enabling her licence but the issue still remains.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>Hi Ben,</p>
<p>Thanks for the updates.</p>
<p>Can you please confirm whether the user sends emails from her own account or from other account by changing the From address?</p>
<p>If from her own account, please remove NT Authority/SELF from the send as area in<b> Exchange admin center</b> and then use PowerShell to re-add the permission to check the issue. Here are the steps:</p>
<p>1. Sign in to <b>Exchange admin center</b> (<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/ecp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.office365.com/ecp</a>) with your admin account. Navigate to
<b>recipients – mailboxes</b>, double click the user. Under<b> mailbox delegation – Send as</b>, remove NT Authority/SELF and click
<b>save </b>at last.</p>
<p>2. Use PowerShell to re-add the permission.</p>
<p>a. <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj984289(v=exchg.160).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Connect to Exchange Online using remote PowerShell</a>.</p>
<p>2. Run the command below:</p>
<p>Add-RecipientPermission -Identity "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" -Trustee "NT AUTHORITY\SELF"&nbsp; -AccessRights SendAs&nbsp; -Verbose</p>
<p>Please replace *** Email address is removed for privacy *** with the user’s actual email address.</p>
<p>Wait for some time to send emails to check the issue.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time and efforts.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Robert</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 game bar breaking borderless windowed mode. Is there a way to disable it&#63;</h2>
                    So I just noticed that this stupid game bar is breaking my borderless windowed mode. After the little popup window appears my mouse will go to my second monitor all the time and it didn't until the latest update. It is driving me insane, is there any way
 to disable this worthless feature for people with multiple monitors?

            <p>Hello, thank you for the reply! I have since figured out the issue. It appears that the problem stemmed from the Xbox app. I don't have an Xbox live ID because I don't even have an Xbox, or plan on getting one. I had to create a login and in the settings
 turn off the Game Bar DVR type thing and everything was fixed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I see you are a Microsoft engineer, could I suggest allowing people to uninstall the Xbox app completely? It is literally just bloatware for people like me that don't use it, and it caused me days of grief figuring out what the problem really was. Or if
 you guys refuse to let us delete that without hacking the OS, at least make these kind of options accessible through the control panel like everything else? Hiding an option in an unused app that breaks the system isn't a good idea.</p>

<h2>            Unable to upload photo&#39;s on Gumtree Ad website using Internet Explorer 11.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Internet Explorer 11 will not allow me to upload photo's for my gumtree Ad...&nbsp; ?? All other 3rd party browsers will work "out of the box.." Any help please..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HI Windows 8.1 and Internet Explorer 11...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I cannot upload my advertisement pictures for my Gumtree Ads...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When I select "upload photo" I am successfully directed to my selling photos folder, but once a picture is selected (opened), I&nbsp;am returned to the main ad input page, but nothing happens...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>There should be a spinning circle representing the image upload process, but there is nothing..</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I really do not wish to use a third party browser.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Gumtree tells that some internet explorer users have no issue, but then some do, and I should change my browser..
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>A copy of the Gumtree transcript is copied below..</p>
<p><em><br />
</em></p>
<p><span><strong>Alexandra M:</strong> Hello, you are chatting with Alex, how can I help?
<br />
<br />
Kindly provide your ad id or email address if you haven’t already provided these details on the pre-chat form.</span><span><strong>You:</strong> hi windws 8.1 , explprer 11 I cant upload my pictures for my ad</span><span><strong>Alexandra M:</strong> Can you
 please try changing your web browser as Internet explorer often causes issues for user with regards to posting ads and uploading images</span><span><strong>You:</strong> I don't want to use a third party browser if possible</span><span><strong>Alexandra M:</strong>
 Do you have Mozilla firefox?</span><span><strong>Alexandra M:</strong> Or Google chrome?</span><span><strong>You:</strong> Internet explorer 11</span><span><strong>You:</strong> "" i dont want to use a third party browser ""</span><span><strong>Alexandra M:</strong>
 I understand however as advised Internet explorer causes issues, so you would need to change it</span><span><strong>You:</strong> There is no evidence of this online?? I have been googling for some time and if this was a common issue there would be records
 of it online..?? Please explain.</span><span><strong>Alexandra M:</strong> It is a technical issue</span><span><strong>Alexandra M:</strong> That is all there is to explain</span><span><strong>You:</strong> I see. I wonder why there is nothing online to support
 this? Also why doesn't Gumtree make it very clear that Internt Explorer 11 does not work with Gumtree?</span><span><strong>Alexandra M:</strong> As not all users encounter these issues</span><span><strong>Alexandra M:</strong> Is there anything else that I
 can help with?</span><span><strong>You:</strong> In that case it is not an internet explorer 11 issue that requires using a diffrent browser</span><span><strong>You:</strong> So suggesting that my only option is to use a different browser is Poor Advice.</span><span><strong>Alexandra
 M:</strong> I do apologise you feel my advice was poor, however all users who encounter these issues usually just change their browser and it works.</span><span><strong>Alexandra M:</strong> Mozilla firefox is the most compatible with our site and users tend
 not to encounter any further issues.</span><span><strong>You:</strong> As is said, I do not wish to use a third arty browser..</span><span><strong>You:</strong> Is there some one else I an speak with who has some strongr tech knowledge please?</span><span><strong>Alexandra
 M:</strong> If you prefer to speak to another agent you can email us on *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</span><span><strong>You:</strong> ok. Goodbye.</span><span><strong>Alexandra M:</strong> Thank you, have a nice weekend</span></p>

<h2>            damaged motherboard and cpu replacement - does that eliminate my insider activation by digital entitlement&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Greetings</p>
<p>
</p><p>My old homebuilt computer that I have been using for the insider preview program is dying. It alternates between failing to post or displaying a message right after post that the CPU is faulty or corrupt - I forgot the exact message.</p>
<p>Anyway, it&nbsp;was born in 2007 and lived a good problem free life until this start.&nbsp; The best part was the seeing performance improvement on an old computer with just enough memory when Windows 10 Pro was installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I might find a replacement socket 775 CPU but if the mother board is bad,&nbsp;&nbsp;what happens if/when I replace the motherboard and CPU as far as the insider preview&nbsp;digital entitlement?&nbsp;I've had to replace failed motherboards under previous Windows editions (eMachines)&nbsp;but
 the user agreement for Windows 10 is different.&nbsp; Is there any workaround and prep that might make the replacement easier to explain? Jumping forward&nbsp;8 or 9&nbsp;years in technology isn't invisible.</p>

            <p>Windows 10's activation and licensing comes in two pieces, one involving a license key (those you can buy), and a system hardware hash (which it generates from your installed devices).&nbsp; Now, if you replace the MBU, it'll read that you're on a completely
 different system, since in effect you are--the "brain" may be the same, but the "heart" is new, so to speak.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you replace the MBU, as long as it's compatible with Windows 10, boot cycle should be no problem.&nbsp; It will probably prompt you for activation though, which may or may not require you to call MSFT.&nbsp; Once done, that copy will now be linked to your new hardware
 hash.&nbsp; That's permissible since you're only using it in one place, as the EULA provides.</p>

<p>
</p><p>After November 11th Windows update, I can no longer open the modern IE on my Windows 8.1 tablet.</p>
<p>When touch on the IE tile, it just stuck at the initial loading screen. Further more, after clicking the IE tile and then go to the desktop, a desktop IE window is opened. On the other hand, the desktop IE works just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did anybody encounter the same problem after the update?</p>

            <p>I am having the same problem with Outlook 2010 (32 bit, 64-bit Win7 Ultimate) in that it gets stuck "processing" my outlook.com e-mails.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>It appears that this issue may have to do with an apparent limitation in Outlook 2010 or Outlook.com regarding length of folder names.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I was searching for a solution to the problem I was having, I started to compare the contents of my Outlook 2010 and Outlook.com (which should be synchronized).&nbsp;&nbsp; I noticed that a new folder that I had created just prior to experiencing the issue I highlighted
 (Outlook 2010 stuck on "processing") did not appear in Outlook.com.&nbsp; This folder had been created as a subfolder of another folder, both with fairly long names.&nbsp; Figuring that the folder might have been "corrupt" somehow, I moved its contents into the parent
 folder (which was showing up fine in Outlook.com) from within Outlook 2010 and deleted the subfolder.</p>
<p>After doing this, it was only then that I received an error message about folder names exceeding 30 characters and that error was referencing the folder that I had just deleted that had just been moved to my deleted items folder.&nbsp; When I emptied that particular
 folder from the Deleted Items folder (Shift+Delete), the original problem seemed to go away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will reserve judgment for a few days to see if this has actually resolved the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, I would recommend that Microsoft patch Outlook 2010 (or update the connector) to disallow the creation of folders&nbsp; (or the movement of existing folders to an Outlook account that syncs with Outlook.com) that exceed the 30 character threshold.&nbsp;&nbsp; A
 bit of error-trapping would also help because, prior to moving the offending folder to deleted items, I had left outlook running overnight while "processing" and it was truly stuck there.&nbsp; Lastly, can someone from Microsoft please indicate whether the 30 character
 limitation applies to a single folder name or the entire folder hierarchy taken as a whole?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that this has fixed the problem that I&nbsp; was experiencing and, if so, that the descriptions of my steps above can be helpful to others.</p>

                    I have a contact group in Outlook 2013 that has a blank entry at the beginning that causes an error when sending. However it is not there when editing the group. You can manually remove this before sending if you expand the group.

            The error is just thst it can't send and to try again later. But there are spaces and ";" in front if the first entry. This is the only group causing a problem and it did work fine before. We don't know where the "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ;" came from.

            I've seen this program before and it's not a virus. It's a browser plug-in. A lot of people seem to have it. I've seen it mentioned on other forums. You can disable it on their website. They have uninstall instructions on their website too - http://www.dropdowndeals.com/support.&nbsp;
 I'd email their customer support if you continue to have it come up. I'm sure they can help.

            <p>Thanks so much Jeseh,</p>
<p>&nbsp;I checked the plug in by going to page at the top and clicked on all accellerators for the page and clicking on plug inns and low and behold there it was.&nbsp; It is also a program I saw it yesterday by clicking on control panel and add and remove programs.
 &nbsp;I wondered what YONTOO was its the last program of course it does not want you to delete it because it is part of a virus my MSE - microsoft security essentials keeps detecting all sorts of Exploit and Vir Tools every time I scan.&nbsp; This Yontoo is the root
 of the problem.&nbsp; I thank you soo much. It's harder to keep a clean XP machine nowadays.</p>

<h2>            Outlook for Mac - indexing&#47;search</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just saw this question from Scott Lowe and would have liked to add to the conversation but was not allowed for some reason.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Scott wrote:</p>
<p>'I'm on the last straw with Outlook 2016 for Mac. &nbsp;Every couple of months, Outlook crashes and the index just gets blown away and search doesn't work. &nbsp;The only fix is to reinstall Office, resetup all of my accounts (I have 7) and get all of my
 signatures put back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is absolutely ridiculous and, frankly, I've had it. &nbsp;What is the fix for this beyond reinstalling Outlook once a quarter or more? &nbsp;It's either this gets fixed or I have to move to something else. &nbsp;I don't have time to constantly reinstall Office.
 &nbsp;It's beyond frustrating. &nbsp;I do IT for a living and I know how this stuff works and I can't fix it. &nbsp;Not cool.'</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having the same problem and do not work with IT. I have tried as much as possible to fix this and am getting nowhere. It is unacceptable that this microsoft product has this kind of flaw.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The answer provided to Scott is inscrutable to someone like me. '<span>Drag the folder or disk that you want to index again to the list of locations that Spotlight is prevented from searching. Or click the Add (+)
 button and select the folder or disk to add.'</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Which folder or disk would that be? If you know what the problem is then please be specific about which folder or disk I should be dragging around.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I too am sick of this but unfortunately do not have the option to move to something else.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Amrita,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I access it through both the browser and mail app.</p>
<p>2. I have one email that can still send/receive messages and when i send a message to my other emails it sends an email that says that my message has been delayed but then it sends me this:</p>
<pre><p>This is an automatically generated Delivery Status Notification.<br /><br />Unable
 to deliver message to the following recipients, due to being unable to 
connect successfully to the destination mail server.</p><p /></pre>
<p>3. it affects two of my emails which they have this domain: @xd.ae</p>
<p>4. It shows me <strong>Outlook.com</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really hope this doesn't have to do with my domain since i frequently use them.
</p>
<p>thank you.</p>

                    I would like all emails from my 2 email address to feed to the same inbox. How do I do that? They are set as IMAP. Thanks!

            <p><span>Hello Win,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for your reply.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please be informed that folders for different IMAP account can be grouped by similar items in Outlook 2016 on Mac.
</span><span>This means that inbox of different IMAP account will be&nbsp;displayed under same Inbox group but the folders would be listed different under that Inbox group.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In Outlook 2016 for Windows this option is not available, however you can drag and drop the email items to single folder or you can set the rule to move email from different account to single folder. Doing this in Outlook may cause sync issue for IMAP
 email accounts.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to post this as feedback from the <strong>Outlook</strong> &gt;<strong>File</strong> &gt;<strong>Feedback,
</strong>to improve it and provide the best possible experience.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Office in future.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you.</span></p>
