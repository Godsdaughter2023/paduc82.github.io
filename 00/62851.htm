            <p>Hello everyone. It has taken me a while, but on my end, I figured out how to stop Windows from trying to install the Bing Bar 7.0, which is not even visible on most of our HP's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This only works if you are running Windows 10 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to <strong>Start</strong> | <strong>All Apps</strong> | <strong>Store</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>When Store opens and you are logged in, click on your personalized icon and click on |
<strong>Settings</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then set <strong>Update Apps Automatically</strong> to <strong>OFF</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then Close the Store</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Reboot</strong> your system</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me it did not come up anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps for others.</p>
<p>Tim</p>

            <p><span>I, too, had the obnoxiously and repetitive installation attempts of Bing Bar 7.0 (KB2626807). Anytime Windows 10 performed a Check for Updates, there it was. When you viewed your update history, it
 would show that it successfully installed the Bing Bar update anywhere from 5 to 7 times in a row, every day since updating from Windows 7 to Windows 10 on August 9th. Sometimes it would show installation failed and then 5 to 7 successful installations. However,
 Bing Bar 7.0 never showed in IE 11’s Add-Ons, Control Panel’s Uninstall an Update, or Control Panel’s Uninstall or Change a Program.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Whenever I’d click on “Successfully installed on 8/XX/2015” and then clicked on “Support info”; it always took me to the website to download the Bing Bar; never to the Knowledge Base article. So, out
 of frustration, I downloaded the Bing Bar to my PC and then ran the installation file; it successfully installed (for real this time) on my computer and even appeared in Control Panel’s Uninstall or Change a Program as well as IE 11’s Add-Ons. I immediately
 disabled the Bing Bar and Bing Bar Helper in IE 11’s Manage Add-Ons and I no longer got the Bing Bar 7.0 (KB2626807) updates; thankfully.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After giving it a little time and since I was no longer getting the constant updates; with some trepidation I threw caution to the wind and uninstalled the Bing Bar through Control Panel’s Uninstall
 or Change a Program. So far so good, I’m not seeing a return of this obnoxious and repetitive update. Hopefully, uninstalling it removed whatever was triggering this update to show up.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>With Windows 7 I had the Bing Bar update hidden because I didn’t want it and I have to wonder if that somehow carried over to Windows 10 and it kept showing a need to update, but that doesn’t explain
 the continuous successful and failed installations and yet no evidence of it as an installed program or Add-On.</span></p>

            Hey Rick.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Here are steps to recover from failed Updates or Version Update install which causes Windows to fail to start: 
<br />
<br />1) Try whichever method works here to get into Advanced Startup Options to run System Restore if this is a Windows Update, or Go Back to Old Version if this is a version update.  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest is to restart or force shutdown the PC 3 times.  
<br />
<br />If you are able to access System Restore or Go Back and it fails, skip to step 3.
<br />
<br />2) If necessary create bootable installation media to access the repair options if  not accessible by any other method:   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Boot media by powering up the PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />You may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup to turn off Fast Boot if it won't allow the Boot Menu key to interrupt starting Windows:  <a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose UEFI version of media if offered, browse to second screen to Repair Your Computer link, then Advanced Troubleshoot options to run System Restore to a point before the problem began, or choose More Options to Go Back to Old Version if this was a version Update.
<br />
<br />If it rolls back then you can hide the Windows Updates and Version Upgrade responsible until they mature by installing and running immediately the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br /> 
<br />3) If this fails try a Startup Repair, or go back to Troubleshoot Options on the previous screen to Reset your PC which will save your files while reinstalling Windows. 
<br />
<br />4) If that fails you can use the booted media to Clean Install the latest version which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>  The link compiles the best possible install of Windows 10 that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given.  
<br />
<br />There is a step to rescue files from the same bootable media:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />The media provided for the Clean Install is Version 1803 and normally the problems go away with the Clean Install, however if they don't you can find earlier version media to use here:  <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>
<br />Burn to DVD  or create bootable 8+gb flash stick installer using this tool installed to Windows:  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56485" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/detail...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Then once you're back in Windows 10, you can block the problem Windows or Version Update using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br /> 
<br />Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until it's resolved.

http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a> <br />
<br />
Boot media by powering up the PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a> <br />
<br />
You may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup to turn off Fast Boot if it won't allow the Boot Menu key to interrupt starting Windows:
<a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-lis...</a> <br />
<br />
Choose UEFI version of media if offered, browse to second screen to Repair Your Computer link, then Advanced Troubleshoot options to run System Restore to a point before the problem began, or choose More Options to Go Back to Old Version if this was a version
 Update. <br />
<br />
If it rolls back then you can hide the Windows Updates and Version Upgrade responsible until they mature by installing and running immediately the Hide Updates tool:
<a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a> <br />
<br />
3) If this fails try a Startup Repair, or go back to Troubleshoot Options on the previous screen to Reset your PC which will save your files while reinstalling Windows.
<br />
<br />
4) If that fails you can use the booted media to Clean Install the latest version which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> The link compiles the best possible install of Windows 10 that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given.
<br />
<br />
There is a step to rescue files from the same bootable media: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> <br />
<br />
Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />
The media provided for the Clean Install is Version 1803 and normally the problems go away with the Clean Install, however if they don't you can find earlier version media to use here:
<a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>
<br />
Burn to DVD or create bootable 8+gb flash stick installer using this tool installed to Windows:
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56485" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/detail...</a> <br />
<br />
Then once you're back in Windows 10, you can block the problem Windows or Version Update using one of these methods:

            Yes, they are all in the steps I gave you.  They are sequenced so that if any of the steps fail, a later step will work.  You just have to keep working through them.  
<br />
<br />By now you should have created the bootable media on another PC to boot exactly as it says in the steps to try the Reset again, or if it fail proceed with the Clean Install tutorial.
<br />
<br />If you have problems performing any step then just ask back.  But you must focus on the steps and try to follow them.  If you cannot then do you have family or friend who can help you?  You can also take it to a store, but the minimum charge is normally around $150.  So it pays to focus intensely on performing the steps exactly as written, and if you do then I will help you complete them and will not let you fail.

<h2>            Keyboard doesn&#39;t light up, sound only comes from one speaker, and computer freezes makes loud buzzing noise when sound is played.</h2>
                    I have a Lenovo laptop, and when I go it, it was perfect. After about a year, I now have many problems. My keyboard doesn't have a backlight except at startup; when it's on for 2 seconds, then shuts off again. My speakers only work from the left, and don't
 shift back unless I apply pressure to the right side of the computer. (or hit it, in simpler terms) And everytime I play anything that has sound, my computer will freeze while making a terrible loud buzzing noise. after hitting it, it goes back to normal for
 a little bit. then it happens again. Help!

            Hi,
<div>Thank you for posting your issue on Microsoft Community Forums.</div>
<div>From the issue description, i understand that you are getting .NET Framework Initialization error.</div>
<div>Let me go ahead and help you with the issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Here are a few methods which you can follow to resolve the issue:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
Remove the traces of .Net framework from your computer and then install .Net framework components through Windows Update or by a standalone package and then check if you come across the issue.<br />
Refer to the link:<br />
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/astebner/archive/2008/08/28/8904493.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/astebner/archive/2008/08/28/8904493.aspx</a></div>
<div>Note: Some programs require lower versions of .Net Framework components, so you have to&nbsp;install all the .Net Framework components one-by one after removing the traces.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Refer to the section "Repair the .NET Framework"</div>
<div>See this article for proper sequence to reinstall .NET Framework components.</div>
<div><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/KB976982" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/KB976982</a>
<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong></div>
<div>Check if issue persists in clean boot.</div>
<div>Refer to the link:</div>
<div>How to perform a clean boot to troubleshoot a problem in Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 8<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></div>
<div>Note: Refer "How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot"</div>
<div>under more information to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Also get in touch with Steam support for further assistance:
<div><a href="https://support.steampowered.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.steampowered.com/</a><br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope this resolves the issue. If issue persists, you can write to us and we will be glad to assist you further.</div>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The most recent changes I made to my computer would be replacing an old power supply about 2-3 months ago. If you mean program wise, I think
 i toggled the .NET framework on / off a few times when I was trying to fix this problem 5-6 months ago.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 1:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I used your uninstaller from&nbsp;</span><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/astebner/archive/2008/08/28/8904493.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/astebner/archive/2008/08/28/8904493.aspx</span></a><span>,
 and it said .NET Framework was removed&nbsp;successfully.</span></p>

<h2>            Can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t connect to my network, please help.</h2>
                    
<p>Hey guys.</p>
<p>For about 2 weeks I haven't been able to use xbox live, I can't connect to my network and the error I get is "Can't connect to your network using a static IP address." My xbox is about a month old, it's the new black type one and I use wireless.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is when I type in all my network information manually, and I know it hasn't been typed in wrong. If i leave it to automatic, the IP address starts with 169 which leads me to believe something is wrong with it, which is why I do it all manually.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am no networking genius, but I sort of know what i'm doing. I have tried pretty much all the solutions on the xbox support site, my MAC filtering is off, my NAT is open etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, it works when I connect using wire, but disconnects the instant i take it out, and i don't know why. Also, for some odd reason, when I turned on my xbox lastnight at about this time, I was connected to xbox live. I hadn't tried anything that day,
 and I was so happy to see it had resolved itself. I played 2 games of Assassin's Creed Revelations online for the first time, and it was very fun. I also got to talk to some of my old buddies which I havent spoken to in some time. Unfortunately, I was eventually
 disconnected after about an hour, and it's gone back to being extremely frustrating and not working.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another thing I would like to point out, in my router wireless options page (I am using a DLINK router, model DIR-615) I can see who is connecting to it, and one of the MAC addresses there is my xbox. However, under "IP address" it has listed 0.0.0.0, and
 the signal strength is 29%, much lower than that of the others, even though my xbox is closer to my router than any of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have any information that might help me, please give it, or if you want to&nbsp;have an input, feel free to do so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your time.</p>

<p>And post back your details in full (the bits that are in bold on that post) so that people may help</p>
<p>If you are wireless can you also state whether you are using the white or black external adapter or the Xbox 360S Internal adapter</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>(I know you've provided some of this but helps to get the complete picture, please also post the version of firmware the DIR615 is using)</p>

<p>Sorry about that, here it is;</p>
<p>What Country/State/Province do you live in? </p>
<p>Australia/Victoria/Melbourne</p>
<p>Modem brand &amp; model number: &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thomson, ST536 v6</p>
<p>Router brand &amp; model number: </p>
<p>DLINK, DIR-615 (i'm not sure about the firmware, do you know how i could find out?)</p>
<p>If Wireless, are you using a white or black external adapter, or an internal (Xbox 360S) adapter?</p>
<p>Internal adapter</p>
<p>Things you have tried: </p>
<p>I've tried pretty much everything on the support site, and have turned off the modem/router and turned it back on liike a million times, please don't suggest this, but thank you if you were going to.</p>
<p>Is UPnP Enabled? Yes/no/Unknown</p>
<p>I'm actually not sure about this part.</p>
<p>Do you have a NAT error? If so, what is your NAT?</p>
<p>No problems.</p>
<p>Any Error Codes you encounter: </p>
<p>No error codes, just "Can't connect to your network using a static IP address)</p>
<p>Who is your ISP(Internet Service Provider)? </p>
<p>Bigpond</p>
<p>After you run "Test Xbox LIVE connection" press “Y” for "More Info”. In the pop-up that appears, what are the following values, if shown? (If a value below does not appear for you, just leave it blank.)</p>
<p>W:</p>

<p>I'd also like to point out that I believe DHCP is enabled, but I could be wrong. If it is not enabled, It could cause my automatic IP address to start with 169, which it does. However, on my router options page I have found this:</p>
<p>(Under WAN status)</p>

<p>Ummmmm.</p>
<p>Okay, so I can now connect to xbox live, and this is very, very odd.</p>
<p>I decided to set an alternate MAC addresses in "configure network &gt; additional settings" and I entered my laptops MAC address. I then found out that when my xbox was turned on, my laptop internet would not work, even though I still was not connected to xbox
 live. </p>
<p>So I decided it was a stupid idea, and once again set my alternate MAC address to nothing.</p>
<p>I am now connected to xbox live.</p>
<p>Even though I am really happy about it, I think its going to be the same as last night, where I had temporary connection to xbox live, because I can't see how what I did could have possibly fixed the problem.</p>
<p>I'd also like to say that I still have a problem, my NAT type is now strict, it has never been strict before and I'm not quite sure how I should go about fixing this problem. Any idea's, now that you have all my information?</p>
<p>Much appreciated, thanks.</p>

<p>Yes there's no need for an alternate mac address using your laptops mac address at the same time will cause issues as they have to be unique if used at the same time</p>
<p>As for your strict NAT that is your mode (Thomson) causing that, its actually a router so you are double NAT'ing, why did you buy the Dlink was it to get wireless? If so it would be better to replace the Thomson with a wireless modem/router (gateway) and
 just have one device</p>
<p>I would normally recommend you bridge the modem/router but with thomsons its not usually possible</p>

<p>Yes, i use the DLINK router to have wireless, there are multiple people who need the internet in my house and the thomson only has 1 port, and it doesn't have wireless. And I understand what you're saying, but up until now I have never had a strict NAT,
 it has always been open, which is why I don't quite understand that I need to replace it with a new device, but if thats the only option to fix it then thanks for your help.</p>
<p>also, do you know how I connected to xbox live in the way that I did? i just don't understand, and I feel that it will disconnect again soon :\</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>It might have said it was Open but it is impossible to be honest unless the Thomson is in bridge mode which I doubt (you can tell by posting the WAN/Internet ip address the Dlink shows on it status page)</p>
<p>If your ISP can supply a wireless modem/router for you, or you could ask if they are using PPPoA or PPPoE authentication, if its PPPoE and you can set the Thomson to bridge mode then you should be able to get this working without replacing anything.</p>
<p>So I would contact the ISP first to find out if its PPPoE or PPPoA or download the manual connect direct to the Thomson with your PC and check yourself

<h2>            Bootloader issues in windows 10</h2>
                    After installing the windows 10 fall creators update, I have had this issue where my laptop boots up to a black screen. Abruptly switching it off and turning it back on boots me to the login screen. However this has resulted in damage to the System files
 which now do the same thing again and again(boot to black screen) until finally giving me the login screen. I tried to perform a startup repair and it failed. Tried the safe mode route as well only to fail. Went through the cmd root where the bootrec /fixboot
 command says access denied. I found a solution to this but it said the efi must be fat32 type whereas mine was ntfs. I went through the hassle of reinstalling windows after recreating every partition from scratch but still the problem persists. Can anyone
 please help me out. The black scren issue leads to many further issues and is causing a lot if troubles to me. Thanks for the help.

<h2>            BSOD kernel_data_inpage_error, win32k.sys</h2>
                    I donated my old desktop to my sister-in-law last year and it has been crashing on a regular basis.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
It is running Windows XP 32-bit and is patched up to date.&nbsp; Rest of components are:<br />
<br />
Asus A8V-XE socket 939 motherboard<br />
AMD Athlon 64 X2 4400 CPU<br />
2 GB (1GBx2) Corsair PC3200 RAM<br />
Antec 500-Watt Power Supply<br />
MSI NX8800 GT Graphics Card<br />
Seagate Barracuda 320 GB Hard Drive<br />
<br />
The most recent bsod error message :<br />
<br />
kernel_data_inpage_error<br />
0x0000007A (0xE19306C0, 0x000000E, 0xBF8CFE95, 0x3X891860)<br />
win32k.sys - Address BF8CFE95 base at BF800000, Date Stamp 52706e3f<br />
<br />
It said it was doing a dump, but would just hang and not restart (maybe because I set it to not restart on crash?).&nbsp; I hard restart and can get back into windows for a minute or two before same thing happens.&nbsp; When it did this before, I removed the drive and
 installed into another computer and ran chkdsk and fixed errors, then ran again till no errors found (which is what I have done again).&nbsp; I've reinstalled the drive in the original computer and am planning my next moves.&nbsp; Before when I had to do this, I did
 a Seatools disk check and it passed all tests.&nbsp; Planning on doing again.&nbsp; Also planning on doing a sfc as well as doing a full sweep of several antivirus programs, as well as running memtest, prime, and kumbustor.&nbsp; Have also cleared the swap file system managed).&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
After I did the hard restart I looked to see if there was a dump folder/file, and could not find anything.<br />
<br />
any other suggestions?&nbsp; This is the second drive I have tried (other being a WD blue scorpio 250 gb) with similar results.<br />

            For some reason I am still not getting DMP files on bsods.&nbsp; However, here is my sys info file as well as&nbsp; snapshot of my event viewer for the past two days.<br />

I get these two errors often<br />
<br />
A parity error was detected on \Device\Ide\IdePort1<br />
<br />
The driver detected a controller error on \Device\Harddisk0\D<br />

            I am running Windows XP 32-bit and therefore some of your directions needed to be modified accordingly.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Here is a link to the contents of my Event Viewer (zipped) from sky drive.<br />
<br />
<br />
https://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=22895CD6A86DF87B!133&amp;authkey=!ALHxCrKI7gPvCkk&amp;ithint=file%2c.rar<br />
<br />
I have also set my page file to 3096 MB (min/max) as I have 2 GB of ram.&nbsp; Only one drive so page file is on OS drive.&nbsp; Confirmed WER is set to manual.&nbsp; Also, set crash/recovery to "kernel memory dump".&nbsp; Auto reset is unchecked.<br />
<br />
Ran scf and chkdsk and no errors found.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I have changed the sata cable to a known good cable.<br />
<br />
My computer specs were in my OP, however the HD I am currently using is a WD 250 GB Caviar Blue.&nbsp; I also have the Seagate as a spare.<br />
<br />
When I run the WD diagnostics extended test, I consistently get a bsod, but still no dmp file (although the bsod says its writing a dump file).&nbsp; The past two bsods messages have been different than the one in the OP.&nbsp; They are both similar and are as follows:<br />
<br />
1st&nbsp;&nbsp; stop 0x000000F4 (0x00000003, 0x89AEF020, 0x89AEF194, 0x805D22DA)<br />
2nd&nbsp; stop 0x000000F4 (0x00000003, 0x89AC2020, 0x89AC2194, 0x805D22DA)<br />

If you are not generating DMP files it is because of one of the reasons suggested in my previous post.<br />
<br />
Your event viewer logs are not logs but rather text files.&nbsp; (we need the actual log so we can search them)<br />
<br />
The F4 is a critical process has been terminated but we cant tell which or why without the DMP files.<br />

            when I open my event viewer, I do not have the 'Administrative Events" option.&nbsp; The only file types it allows me to save are csv or txt.&nbsp; In Windows 7 on another computer I have, I see the 'Administrative Events", but not on Windows XP.<br />
<br />
regarding the dmp files.&nbsp; As I have posted earlier, I have confirmed all of the items in your post regarding the requirements for generating dmp files.&nbsp; This is why I am scratching my head.&nbsp;

This is pretty easy to spot. Almost all of these events point to a HD controller error or file system corruption.<br />
<br />
I would run chkdsk &amp; a system file check<br />
<br />
<div><b>CHKDSK /R /F</b><br />
<span>Chkdsk disclaimer: While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found &nbsp;any data available on that sector might be lost so as usual backup your data.</span><br />

<span>Do this for each hard drive on your system.</span><br />
<span>When it tells you it can't do it right now - and asks you if you'd like to do it at the next reboot - answer Y (for Yes) and press Enter.</span><br />
<br />
<b><font color="#FF0000">Then reboot and let the test run.</font></b><br />
<span>It may take a while for it to run, but keep an occasional eye on it to see if it generates any errors.</span><br />
<span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/guide-to-using-check-disk-in-windows-vista/</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<i><u>&nbsp;See "CHKDSK LogFile" below in order to check the results of the test.</u></i><b><br />
<br />

<span>Go to Start and type in "eventvwr.msc" (without the quotes) and press Enter</span><br />

    <title>Background wifi downloads on &#40;instant on&#41; standby mode issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mindverse  say:</h3>
<h2>            Background wifi downloads on &#40;instant on&#41; standby mode issue</h2>
                    
<p>Can someone please confirm on their Xbox that doing a game download over wifi only once the xbox one is shut off dramatically decreases the download speed? If I hard wire my Xbox in the background downloads continue at same speed as when it is on but if
 I switch over to a wireless network the console has to be on to achieve maximum speed. Once I turn the console off in wifi mode it slows down to around 1gb per hour. I assume this is a lowered power function of the wifi chip but if hard wired it's not an issue.
 Please confirm my guess either way because I'm not sure if this is how all Xboxes were designed or if I got a bad one with a faulty wifi chip! Thanks in advance:)</p>

<p>I'm not so sure. My xbox one is still plugged in while I'm sleeping. I can't really track the Xbox's download speed while I'm asleep. I just know that If I start the download while I'm awake, then I turn off my xbox, and let the download finish while I'm
 asleep, it is definitely done by the time I wake up. I'm on a wireless network. I don't really have the position to put it on a wired network. I wouldn't be too nervous about turning off your xbox while you are downloading something as long as some of it has
 downloaded while the xbox is on. I'd say about 30%. Depending on the size of the file. And the length of the time that you sleep.</p>

<p>Can you clarify what you meant by my Xbox one is still plugged in means since you state you're on a wireless router? Also what is the model of your router? Thanks again.</p>

<h2>            &#34;WindowsUpdate_00000643&#34; &#34;WindowsUpdate_dt000&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I was told by PA Bear MS MVP to post a topic here.</p>
<p>Pretty much what happened was I reinstalled windows, a clean install, and I didn't do things in order, so I put my system in a "confused" state.</p>
<p>So I reinstalled windows and did things in order using the answer from PA Bear MS MVP..</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/thread/bc95f2f0-7968-4bd0-8de5-70b83db31fa6">http://answers.microsoft.com/thread/bc95f2f0-7968-4bd0-8de5-70b83db31fa6</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It found 84 updates, I left what it automatically checked checked, and decided to download and install what it already had checked.</p>
<p>It downloaded everything fine, but 3 failed to install.</p>
<p>The ones that failed to install are:</p>
<p>Security Update for Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Service Pack 1 Redistributable Package (KB2538243)</p>
<p>Update for Microsoft XML Core Services 4.0 Service Pack 2 for x64-based Systems (KB973688)</p>
<p>Security Update for Microsoft XML Core Services 4.0 Service Pack 2 for x-64 based Systems (KB954430)</p>
<p>Also there's an error in the update window, it says Code 643 windows update encountered an unknown error.</p>
<p>When I click "Get help with this error" a window pops up saying "18 results for<b>"WindowsUpdate_00000643" "WindowsUpdate_dt000""</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a Windows 7 Home Premium Service Pack 1 64 bit OS</p>
<p>It was a clean install of windows. So the only antivirus program on the machine is MSE.</p>
<p>The only firewall is Windows Firewall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I fix it so these updates will install? Thank you!</p>

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1. What is the exact error message that you get when you open Skype?<br />
2. Which version of Skype are you using?<br />
3. Were you able to connect earlier?</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>If you are using an older version of Skype, then uninstall and reinstall the latest version.<br />
<br />
You can download the latest version from the link below:<br />

    <title>edit group policy in home premium - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ickymay  say:</h3>
<h2>            edit group policy in home premium</h2>
                    with the lack of gpedit in home premium is there a way to perform the equivalent of this:<br />
<br />
In the Group Policy Editor under :-<br />
Computer Configuration,<br />
Windows Settings,<br />
Security Settings,<br />
Local Policies,<br />
User Rights Assignment.<br />
there is an entry hidden amongst all the noise called<br />
"Deny access to this computer from the network" and the user "Guest" was entered!<br />
<br />
then remove guest from "Deny access to this computer from the network"<br />
<br />
Is there a registry key to perform this action or a way of setting up the gpedit module/snapin in home premium ?<br />
<br />
thanks in advance.

            Here's a method that works in Windows XP.&nbsp; I haven't tried it in Vista, but I've modified the instructions to do what I think is necessary to make it work:<br />
<br />
1. Download and install the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=4544" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows 2003 Server Resource Kit Tools</a> .<br />
<br />
2. Click <strong>Start</strong> &gt; <strong>All Programs</strong> &gt; <strong>Windows Resource Kit Tools</strong> .<br />
<br />
3a. For Windows XP, click <strong>Command Shell</strong> .<br />
3b. For Windows Vista, right-click <strong>Command Shell</strong> and click <strong>
Run as administrator</strong> .<br />
<br />
4. Type these lines at the command prompt exactly as shown (case sensitive):<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>net user guest /active:yes</strong> <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>ntrights +r SeNetworkLogonRight -u Guest</strong> <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> ntrights -r SeDenyNetworkLogonRight -u Guest</strong> <br />
<br />
5. For Windows Vista, type these lines:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>ntrights +r SeNetworkLogonRight -u Everyone</strong> <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> ntrights -r SeDenyNetworkLogonRight -u Everyone</strong> <br />
<br />

    <title>Terrible Download Speeds for Xbox One - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> metanoiic  say:</h3>
<h2>            Terrible Download Speeds for Xbox One</h2>
                    <p>My install speeds for Xbox One games and apps seems to be having incredibly bad issues as of late. Throughout the entire time that I've had this console I've been able to install games the size of 70GB in a few hours, yet now it takes <strong>days</strong> to install 30GB. My download speeds used to be around 20MB/second yet now they fluxuate between 500KB/second - 3MB/second. At some points, the installs will stop entirely for a few minutes and then start again. I've tried hard resetting my router (I have a wireless connection for accessibility reasons) and also hard resetting/restarting my Xbox too. Furthermore, whilst these sluggish intalls are in process, the internet for my entire household gets puts on hold and becomes mostly inaccessible. Just for troubleshooting reasons, I'll state that I'm from the UK and not Australia as I've heard that this is a frequent problem down under. If someone could help me, I'd very much appreciate it!</p>

<h2>            No startup or shutdown sound in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Windows 8.1 &amp; 10 Sounds</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have never heard a startup or shutdown sound from both win 8.1 &amp; 10.</p>
<p>I have enabled it , but i am able to hear the startup sound only during a restart.</p>
<p>Does 8.1 &amp; 10 provide an easy startup that a XP &amp; 7 gives,</p>
<p>meaning normal startup , startup sounds , simple login and getting to desktop quickly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 Startup is really worse, first turning on pc, manufacturer logo , windows loading screen , windows 10 loading screen , lock screen , login screen ,password , Another loading and desktop .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cant i get an easier starup , just like in windows xp &amp; 7 like turn on , manufacturer logo, windows loading screen , login or desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its too tough to use and adjust with Windows 10 when compared to XP &amp; 7<br />
</p>
<p>Is there any solution to remove the login screen and password?</p>
<p>How to enable Windows 10 Startup &amp; Shutdown sounds ?</p>

<p>I was really going to back to Windows 8.1 , will it fix the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had noticed this issue the time i bought the pc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Windows XP PC which i bought in 2009, still works perfectly,efficiently and fastly without any problems.</p>
<p>My Dad bought Windows 7 Ultimate in 2011, and still works efficiently, powerfully and perfectly.</p>
<p>My Windows 8.1 PC that i bought on October last year had several issues. The problems started just after 1 week .</p>
<p>Then i upgraded to Windows 10 on November , it had a huge number of issues and even worse than Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is it like this. The Old generation was the best i think.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both Windows XP &amp; 7 have startup &amp; shutdown sounds.</p>
<p>But i never heard one from Windows 8.1, before and after enabling password.</p>
<p>I thought it may be because of fast boot. But i was wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really when does the startup sound come in both 8.1 &amp; 10 , during boot or at the moment computer logs in. I have heard the sound when pc logs in , in both XP &amp; 7.</p>
<p>But i am hearing this sound at lock screen in 8.1 and at the second load in 10. Why is this happening?</p>

</p><p>the issue could be because of system corruptions or incompatible drivers on the computer. Windows startup sound should be at the start up and not at the lock screen.

<p>I was so disappointed with Windows 10 10586 that i just downgraded back to the previous build , 10240.&nbsp;</p>
<p>!0586 kept corrupting files that i was not able open the whole drive.</p>
<p>After downgrade , i noticed that many of my videos of mp4 format became unavailable, when i opened properties it showed opening with TWINUI.</p>
<p>I tried but its not changing. It says it cannot find the file.</p>
<p>Windows Store is missing, and many other apps like mail,travel etc. are missing and show something like @(microsoftcommunicationapps).... .</p>
<p>I cant believe this, what type of OS is this junk.</p>
<p>Its already made ruined my childhood, as i havent used the pc for over 9 months. There is too much to study these days, and in the free time , i get this junk to use. Absolutely , i dont know what i should do. After buying the new one , i wished to get a
 good pc, i got it Windows 8.1 but i took the wrong decision upgrading to this junk.</p>
<p>I am fearing whether it will take out my other files , such as games,photos etc.</p>
<p>It works on its own , i cant control it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the reset, will my games , songs and files work?</p>
<p>Will i get my data back after the restore, or will it not work because i copied it from Windows 10.</p>
<p>Most of them are in Windows 10 Formats like Groove music,photos,edge etc.</p>
<p>What to do , if they dont work?</p>
<p>I asked because i have already seen what happened in 10240 , when i tried to open 10586 files.</p>
<p>Please Help?</p>

<h2>            &#34;Cannot find the item&#34; when trying to copy files to thumb drive</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: With some USB thumbdrives &amp; Windows Vista or 7, copying larger files gets a "Cannot find this item" error, telling me to verify file's location. Doesn't happen with XP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi, I've seen this problem posted as far back as 2008 in regards to MS Windows Vista and now MS Windows 7, but no solution anywhere that I can find. I bought a SanDisk Cruzer 8G thumbdrive (USB) a couple of weeks ago &amp; when I attempted to copy a .avi file
 to it (around 800Megs), it got midway into copying the file and then hung, giving me an error after a few moments stating that it "Cannot find this item. This is no longer located in C:\&lt;foldername&gt;\&lt;foldername&gt;.... Verify the item's location and try again."
 The buttons on that error box are "Try Again" and "Cancel". To try again does nothing but cause the computer to hang for longer. Once this error occurs, the thumbdrive can no longer be found in the computer listing of drives until I unplug it and then plug
 it back in. The file it was trying to copy is still intact where it originally was. I can copy tiny files, like maybe up to 100Mb or so, but not larger ones. I assumed the drive was faulty and returned it. I saw that they had 16Gig drives for a couple of dollars
 more and decided to go ahead and get a larger one while at it. I got home and the same thing happened again. This is when I began searching Google for similar experiences and found that MANY other people have had this issue when either moving and copying files
 to thumbdrives in these two operating systems. However, these two drives worked 100% fine in XP for me and everyone else (thankfully, as an IT person, I have several machines around.) Normally, my ability to research such issues would net me a quick fix or
 at the very least, a workaround. This time, it's gotten me nowhere quickly! I found a couple of posts where I was told that various, seemingly random hotfixes or updates to Windows were the cause of this problem, but uninstalling them or adding more/newer
 updates/hotfixes did nothing to rectify the situation. I am now at a total loss. I trust the brandname - SanDisk is a name I'd be comfortable recommending to others - yet I don't have this problem with PNY thumbdrives, A-data, or Kingston. Is there ANYBODY
 out there that has ANY idea why I can find no mention of this issue on the MS Knowledgebase or elsewhere with any kind of resolution to it and why it seems to be exclusive to Vista and 7? And more importantly, does anybody out there know what I can do to FIX
 the problem??? ANY help is VERY greatly appreciated!! - B. Keith Phelps</p>

            Thanks, Kevin! As "luck" would have it, the night before I got your reply, I ran across the reformat as NTFS solution elsewhere and decided to give it a try. BUT, before doing so, I checked my other thumbdrives that were not having any trouble to see if
 they were NTFS or FAT32, and they were the latter. Still, I went ahead with the reformat on the SanDisk drive. It did correct the problem... but the issue I have with this is that the NTFS format seems to slow down (dramatically) the speed of the x-fer of
 such large files to the drive now. It starts out moving the usual quick speed, but then a few seconds in, the remaining time stops jumping in the forward direction and suddenly jumps backwards (suggesting that the speed of x-fer has suddenly slowed for some
 unknown reason). This slow speed continues until the file has completely moved/copied (and I mean significantly slow - not just a little slower - I timed a folder x-fer containing 1 file inside at a size of 1.36GB, and for the PNY (FAT32), i

            <p>Hi <b>Keith</b>,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue could have occurred because there were some bad sectors on the thumb drive and a format using NTFS file system might have corrected it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reason behind slow transfer rate could be a background process/program, malware or the Universal Serial Bus Controllers (USB) date rate speed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to place the computer in Clean Boot state and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Step 1:</b> Clean Boot</p>
<p>Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. If yes, you may have to contact the program manufacturer for any updates or uninstall and re-install the program.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Refer the following Microsoft KB article for more information on how to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7:<br />

&nbsp;<br />
<strong><span>Note</span></strong>: After troubleshooting, make sure to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned in Step 7 in the above KB article.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Step 2:</b> Run a malware scan on the computer to make sure the computer is virus free.</p>

            Okay, Kevin - Got a WHOLE NEW issue, though it's still linked to the current one. I've done all that you recommended, though I already do a VERY thorough job of keeping the computer checked for malware of any and all kinds... (yet I still did a thorough
 check to verify all was well at this particular moment, to be sure.) So, here's what we've got - I can copy or move items, as I told you, but it takes FOREVER - as in over twice as long; BUT, I have now found that I cannot make use of files on the drive. What
 I mean by that is that if I have the movie on the drive, I cannot watch it b/c anywhere during the movie, it will suddenly lose the ability to read the file from the drive! This is very much akin to its ability to write to the drive and find the drive altogether
 suddenly disappearing, because when it happens (the reading problem, to be specific here,) I can no longer locate the drive on my "Computer" window (well actually, it's there, but when I double-click it, it shows nothing being there

            @PJR6164 - I'm sorry to report that I never got any solution to the problem! I just took the drive back &amp; bought a different brand of drive (Kingston), which I have never had any problem with. As far as the Sandisk thumb drives that were causing me problems,
 I had more than 1, &amp; each gave the exact same problem, no matter how they were formatted (FAT32 Vs. NTFS). After days &amp; days of trying w/o success to resolve the issue - including conversations with people in forums such as this 1, the only thing LEFT for
 me to do was to exchange for a brand that didn't have such issues. I would LOVE to know what causes this, but nobody seemed to have an answer. But I do feel at least somewhat better knowing that MANY other people were having the exact same problems on their
 systems, too. Evidently, Windows Vista &amp; the other newer systems have some type of an issue with some particular brands of thumb drive/external storage media, where Windows XP does not. It's a shame, really... You'd thin
