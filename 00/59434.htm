            If your Help and Support is complaining like this:<br />
<br />
Windows cannot open Help and Support because a system service is not running. <br />
To fix this problem, start the service named 'Help and Support'.<br />
<br />
There are lots of things that can break Help and Support, but start with easy stuff first.<br />
<br />
Look in the Services applet and check to be sure the Help and Support Service is listed, it is set to Startup type of Manual or Automatic and it has a Status of Started.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
To do that, click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
services.msc<br />
<br />
Click OK to launch the Services Applet and locate the Help and Support Service.<br />
<br />
Highlight the Help and Support Service, right click, Properties and set the Startup type to 'Manual' or&nbsp; 'Automatic', click OK to save the changes.<br />
<br />
Right click the Help and Support Service again and choose 'Start' and the Status column should change to 'Started'<br />
<br />
If that all works out, see if you can get into Help and Support now.<br />
<br />
I don't know how that might change your uninstall Silverlight (mine uninstalled just fine) or MSE problem, but you can look in the Event Viewer System log after you see one of those messages and look for Events like this after I disabled my Help and Support
 Service and tried to use Help and Support (and saw the error above):<br />
<br />
Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Error<br />
Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DCOM<br />
Event Category:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None<br />
Event ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10005<br />
Description:<br />
DCOM got error "The service cannot be started, either because it is disabled or because it has no enabled devices associated with it. " attempting to start the service
<b>helpsvc </b>with arguments "" in order to run the server:<br />
{833E4010-AFF7-4AC3-AAC2-9F24C1457BCE}<br />
<br />
To see the Event Viewer logs, click Start, Settings, Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Event Viewer.<br />
<br />
A shortcut to Event Viewer is to click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
%SystemRoot%\system32\eventvwr.msc<br />
<br />
Click OK to launch the Event Viewer.<br />
<br />
The most interesting logs are usually the Application and System.&nbsp; Some logs may be almost or completely empty.<br />
<br />
Not every event is a problem, some are informational messages that things are working okay and some are warnings.<br />
<br />
No event should defy reasonable explanation.<br />
<br />
Each event is sorted by Date and Time.&nbsp; Errors will have red Xs, Warnings will have yellow !s.&nbsp;&nbsp; Information messages have white 'i's.&nbsp; Not every Error or Warning event means there is a serious issue.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some are excusable at startup time when Windows is booting.&nbsp;
 Try to find just the events at the date and time around your problem.<br />
<br />
If you double click an event, it will open a Properties windows with more information.&nbsp; On the right are black up and down arrow buttons to scroll through the open events. The third button that looks like two pages on top of each other is used to copy the event
 details to your Windows clipboard.<br />
<br />
When you find an interesting event that occurred around the time of your issue, click the third button under the up and down arrows to copy the details and then you can paste the details (right click, Paste or CTRL-V) the detail text back here for analysis.<br />
<br />
To get a fresh start on any Event Viewer log, you can choose to clear the log (backing up the log is offered),&nbsp; then reproduce your issue, then look at just the events around the time of your issue.<br />
<br />
P.S In spite of what the Microsoft engaged Support Engineer "experts" say,&nbsp; the Help an Support Service does not have to be set to Automatic and starting and running all day with nothing to do - setting it to Manual is fine and then it should start on it's
 own if it is needed and not already running, but that is up to you.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 unresponsive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peterh12  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 unresponsive</h2>
                    <p>I've been using Windows 10 without problems for over 3 years on my Dell E7440 laptop. I rebooted Windows in response to a requst from Avast following a regular Avast update. My laptop booted up to my normal desktop screen showing all my screen icons/shortcuts
 without any problem. However, when I click on any application (eg WLM, Office) the cursor hangs and I sometimes get a message saying 'Microsoft Windows - The application is not responding. The program may respond again if you wait. Do you want to end the process?'
 If I wait nothing happens, if I click 'End process' the screen goes blank apart from some toolbar items appearing after a few seconds.&nbsp; Clicking on other screen icons to third party apps simply causes the cursor to hang. Clicking on links to folders displays
 the folder as normal. Also I can't select Settings, a page displaying just the word Settings in the corner appears but no Settings menu. If I select programs via the Windows icon or Windows key my curser displays for a few seconds but nothing happens. I've
 rebooted the laptop several times and I get my normal desktop displayed but the same thing happens as above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!</p>

            Hi Peter.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />See if you can get into Safe Mode with Networking, or Safe Mode:  <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>
<br />
<br />Uninstall Avast.  No expert in Forums where we see the most cases (by the tens of thousands) recommends Avast since it bloated up 7-8 years ago and started causing issues, but we do solve problems by having it uninstalled.
<br />
<br /> I would uninstall any 3rd party antivirus and try running only built-in Defender which gives adequate protection, least issues, and is from Microsoft who knows how to protect their OS best.   
<br />
<br />If you want the best on-demand scanners install and run Malwarebytes and AdwCleaner free scanners.  
<br />
<br />If problems persist go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />You can also try to  System Restore to a point before the problem began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />If the PC isn't functional enough to do the above you can access Repair Mode to attempt to System Restore or Reset, via one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>
<br />
<br />You may need to create the bootable media to try these repairs or  to wipe the drive and do the vastly superior Clean Install:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on second screen choose  Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Troubleshoot Options to System Restore or Troubleshoot Options to Reset.  
<br />
<br />If these fail choose Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi Greg</p>
<p>I've probably rebooted 20 times since I contacted you, all with the same problem. I hadn't been able to apply any of the fixes or remove Avast because of very limited functionality eg no access to Settings. However, laptop has
 Avast for now as I've used it for years without problem. I've also created a new system restore point. I haven't done anything else so far, in part because I'm abroad on holiday! I will leave machine running as I fear a reboot might bring back the problem.
 If there are other essential actions I should do while machine is running please let me know.</p>

<h2>            Original XBOX to XBOX 360 controller adapter&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello everyone.</p>
<p>I have a steering wheel controller for the original Xbox, but I have an Xbox 360. I wonder if there is a way to connect the steering wheel to the 360? I know there are adapters from original Xbox to USB for PC but, would they work for the 360? Would I need
 drivers or is it even possible to install drivers on the Xbox 360?</p>
<p>Any help will be greatly appreciated!<br />

            Hello Sumangal,
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question.
<br />
<br />Suggest you to run System File Checker scan:
<br />
<br />1. Search for 'command prompt' using Cortana or Windows Search.
<br />
<br />2. From results, right click on Command Prompt and select Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />3. Type sfc /scannow command and press Enter key.
<br />
<br />4. Let the command complete and then reboot the machine.
<br />
<br />If issue still persists, try resetting File Explorer (explorer.exe) Process:
<br />
<br />1. Press Windows Key + R and type SYSDM.CPL in Run. Click OK or press Enter key.
<br />
<br />2. In System Properties window, switch to Advanced tab, click Settings under Performance.
<br />
<br />3. Next, in Performance Options, under Processor scheduling, make sure that Adjust for best performance of: is set to Programs.
<br />
<br />4. Then in the same window, under Virtual memory, click Settings button.
<br />
<br />5. On Virtual Memory page, make sure Automatically manage paging file sizes for all drives option is checked. Click OK, then Apply, OK on rest of windows.
<br />
<br />6. Reboot the machine and see if issue is resolved now.
<br />
<br />Let us know if this helps!

<p>Dear Vijay, Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>I executed Both the Steps suggested by you. This did not work. I can not edit the File Properties still.Later when I tried removing&nbsp; 'Properties and Personal Information' From the File, It gave an error. Screen Shot of the error is enclosed.&nbsp; Error Is "An
 unexpected error is Keeping you from applying the Properties.,..,........... Error Code is 0x8007000D, The Data is invalid.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is seems the file is corrupt. Funny thing is it runs in Windows Media Player.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I searched for this Error on Net. I find there are paid third Party tools for fixing such error,which basically fix the Registry Errors. One Such tool is&nbsp; "Tech Utilities" From&nbsp;https://www.wiki-errors.com.&nbsp; I am not sure how reliable &amp; secure this tool is.
 I did not find any fix on Microsoft Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other safe, secure and reliable way this can be done?</p>

<h2>            Component Transfer Error &#40;ASUS Aura Sync&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have tried to use Asus's Aura Sync and it hasn't worked. To elaborate, it did work, but it would not identify my CPU's fan cooler. So, I tried to uninstall it and reinstall it. After several times of doing this, it would no longer uninstall and is showing
 this message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Component Transfer Error</p>
<p>Component: Main app</p>
<p>File Group:</p>
<p>File:</p>
<p>Error: Unspecified error</p>
<p>
</p><p>After showing this message it would close and I would have to try again. I've tried multiple times but this will not go away. Is there any other way to uninstall it rather than the main "Add/remove programs" application?</p>

<h2>            iso for both windows home and pro</h2>
                    <p>i wonder if one iso file is valid for both home and pro editions of windows 10</p>
<p>as microsoft said here </p>
<p>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO</p>
<p>so when i clean install windows 10 from that iso, how can i choose which version to be installed. in other words, how can i tell the pc which version to be installed? does it let me to choose between the 2 version during installation ? or when i enter my
 key, it will automatically install the appropriate version for that key?</p>
                </div>

            <p>If you look at the webpage you will see that you are in fact downloading the media creation tool, not an ISO.</p>
<p>Once you start the media creation tool and select to create an ISO or USB install it will ask you for the details like if you need Home or Pro.&nbsp; And after you have selected that it will then fetch the right download and create the ISP/USB install.</p>

            sir open the link above from non windows device (android as example) or open it in windows after changing the user agent of the browser to any thing other than windows, and it will let you to download iso directly not through the media creation tool and
 that iso is for both home and pro, notice the marked yellow area in the pic below<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8ba80422-6db3-450b-8152-b68a193bdcc7" />

            <p>OK.&nbsp; Since I opened your link on a Windows 10 machine I was directed to:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10, which is the media creation tool.</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>But looking at your question I think I got sidetracked, so let's see if I can answer everything you asked.</p>
<ol>
<li>As far as I know the Home and Pro installs can't be used interchangeably.&nbsp; I actually created an ISO for both because have both kinds of systems.&nbsp; I could be wrong about this, I certainly have not tested trying it using the "wrong one".&nbsp; I created my ISOs
 with the media creation tool and Home vs Pro are different.</li><li>There is no system to automatically pick them in the ISO install, the media creation tool on the other hand has a "update this system" option which would pick the right one to download and install.</li><li>You can tell what you need by seeing what your existing operating system is.&nbsp;&nbsp; Basically Home to Home and Pro to Pro.&nbsp; The table is given here:
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-specifications#upgrade" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-specifications#upgrade&nbsp;under Upgrade editions.</a></li><li>Note that you have to do the first upgrade from the running system (running the old version of Windows).&nbsp; You run setup, you do not boot to the install media/ISO.&nbsp; After the initial update you can do a clean install using the install media.&nbsp; And in that
 case you would skip the prompts for the product key and when you get to the point where you log into your Microsoft account, Windows will activate automatically.&nbsp; This is possible because on that first update when it activates automatically it registers the
 device with the Microsoft register servers.&nbsp; And when you install for the second time it uses that information to validate activating again.</li><li>I don't know what would happen if you used the wrong one.&nbsp; For instance trying to install a Pro version on an existing Home version.&nbsp; I'm sure it would block you at one point, which would hopefully be right at the start, but it might go all the way to a
 point where you are installed, but can't activate.</li></ol>

            <p>P.S. There is a lot of confusion about the old version's product key, and the new Windows 10 product key for that matter.&nbsp; The Windows 10 free upgrade never uses them.&nbsp; It doesn't use the Windows 7/8/8.1 product key.&nbsp; By requiring the update to be done from
 within a running system, that system has already validated the old key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the Windows 10 product key.&nbsp; For the case of the free upgrade everyone is getting the same product key, so it is not useful for installing.&nbsp; It is the fact that your device has been register during the update, that allows it to be automatically activated
 when you do another install on the same device.&nbsp; It activates when you get to the point where you log in with your Microsoft account.</p>

<p>I have the same problem. I went to get a glass of water and now I have this blue screen. I can get to the BIOS, but this is a tablet, it did not come with a windows 8 installation device nor does it have a cd drive....</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I even attempt to fix this?</p>

    <title>Quantum Break has disappeared from my library. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Quantum Break has disappeared from my library.</h2>
                    <p>I&nbsp;have a strange dilemma. I've been trying not to go public with this issue as I&nbsp;know how the gaming community is.&nbsp; The first reaction people have is that I'm lying and want a free game. Let me put that to rest right now. I don't need free anything, but I&nbsp;do insist that things I&nbsp;own, that I paid good money for, be safe and secure on my account without interference. I have proof of all purchase history, screen shots of my chats and Live Messages etc, all documented. I'm not sure if I need to seek legal action or what but I am getting fairly pissed off at the lack of serious attention Microsoft has given thus far.</p><p><br /></p>



<p>Now then...</p><p><br /></p>



<p>I&nbsp;bought the launch Xbox One back in 2013, wasn't a huge fan but held on to it for a while. I am mostly a PC gamer and thought the Xbox One was going to be a 1080p gaming console which turned out not to be the case. When Quantum Break was announced it was advertised as a play anywhere title. You buy it on Xbox, get a code to play it on Win10. I&nbsp;pre-ordered Quantum Break on my Xbox One console on February 29th 2016. The purchase is perfectly documented on both paypal and on my Xbox account online at the Microsoft store. Note... the Windows 10 version of Quantum Break was NOT available for pre-order. Microsoft literally forced people to buy it on the Xbox console digitally to obtain the code to get the Win10 version. My purchase of Quantum Break for use on Xbox Live was document on February 29th 2016..</p><p><br /></p>



<p>On March 10th 2016 I&nbsp;received an Xbox Live message on my console thanking me for my purchase of Quantum Break and included the code for Alan Wake's American Nightmare for X360. On April 11th 2016 I received another Xbox message on my console thanking me for purchasing Quantum Break and that one included the code for Alan Wake for X360.</p>



<p>So I played a few levels of the campaign on the Xbox One because, you know, I&nbsp;just bought it digitally on the Xbox One&nbsp;and thought the game was pretty good. I&nbsp;absolutely hated the low resolution graphics on my 4K&nbsp;TV so I held off on&nbsp;playing it as I&nbsp;wanted to see how it was on my PC.</p><p><br /></p>



<p>On April 12th 2016 I&nbsp;received my final Xbox message saying that my purchase of Quantum Break includes the Windows 10 version and the code was provided for that. Great, now I activated that code and played some of it on my PC....&nbsp;</p>



<p>I&nbsp;sold my Xbox a couple months after all that. Proceeded to stick with PC and PS4 till now. I&nbsp;bought the Xbox One X and it's fantastic, everything I wanted from the Xbox One. I&nbsp;love it.... However, I&nbsp;went to my game library and could not find Quantum Break. Roughly 62 other digital items including the Alan Wake bonus' were still in my library but Quantum Break just completely vanished. I tried all sorts of things on my console to get that title to appear in my games list including hard resetting my console and it was just gone. I went to the Xbox Store from my console thinking I just needed to grab it from there. All the games I&nbsp;owned already say "owned" when viewing them in the store. Quantum Break was listed as it's regular sale price. I'm thinking, what the hell is going on? I have a verifiable and documented history of buying this game digitally on my Xbox One but all signs point to it never happening.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I used the Microsoft support chat and the tech was not interested in any of my screen shots. The tech did access my account and did verify&nbsp;&nbsp;bought the game and did verify it's a play anywhere and was not able to figure out why my Xbox One X could not see the game or why my account was charging me for it again. His conclusion, instead of issuing a replacement licence was in so many words, to go screw myself and play it on PC, I&nbsp;never owned it on Xbox One.</p><p><br /></p>



<p>I tried to get help from Xbox Support on twitter through private DM's, over a period of two days, provided all my proof and account information and they blew me off too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>



<p>So what am I supposed to do? Seek a lawyer and make a spectacle&nbsp;out of this whole thing? Why can't Microsoft just accept all the evidence and proof that I bought this&nbsp;and fix this matter instead of trying every single possible thing they can think of to NOT help me get the game back. Seriously, I spent, with tax,&nbsp;over $65 on this game, it's mine, I own it, I&nbsp;have the legal right to play it on my Xbox One X if I want to and it was stolen from me because of some random glitch in this ridiculously over restrictive digital licencing world we are forced to live in.</p><p><br /></p>



<p>Do I take this matter to every public outlet like&nbsp;reddit, BBB, consumer affairs, etc?? Is that what I have to do to get Microsoft to hear me?</p>

            OK, we are getting closer. no its not formatted and then yes it worked. How did it work not formatted?
<br />
<br />
If it does not show up on another computer either, the USB case may be bad or has a problem. Open it and look for signs of a problem, loose connection (remove and re-plug in the 2 cables), Is the jumper on the drive set to Master (it needs to be). Smell like
 burnt plastic when opened? Look for burn or discoloation marks or exploded (really) capacitors (tiny round cans on the circuit card). Any problem, toss it and get a new one. If you have a friend with a USB case, try your drive in his. If the computer does
 not see the drive when pluged in it could be the Windows setup. But since another computer also can not see it, it is more likely the Drive or Case. Can you plug the drive into a computer directly to test the drive itself? Of course it needs to match, IE if
 it is SATA, you need a free SATA port (and cables), etc. Ah, and it could be the cables so see if you can try different ones.<br />
<br />
Do not know what else to tell you. Hang in there.<br />

<h2>            Why is it that NONE of our Windows 10 machines see one another on our network&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've been a long time Windows user since Windows 3.1. In my home environment I've always defined a workgroup within the properties for each desktop or laptop. Then they all "see" one another.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But not Windows 10. I'm using the same workgroup for each and every desktop and laptop we have. Not one machine sees any other machine. Even though I've given them the same workgroup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So please, tell me how Windows 10 does it now, because clearly how I've got it for the last 20 years isn't working anymore. And I've not seen any help as to how to resolve this problem. Probably if I knew how to ask, I'd find it, but I don't know what protocol
 I have to now use, etc. And I'd dearly love to know how to solve such a simple problem. (Or at least what I think should be simple.)</p>

            <p>After updating several home pc's and laptops to Windows 10 I also had this problem.</p>
<p>Here's what I did to resolve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. For each computer go to the home group window and leave the home group</p>
<p>2. Turn off all computers except the one that is your main that started the home group</p>
<p>3. On your main computer, start another home group with a new and different password</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;Turn on all the other computers and use the new password to connect to the home group</p>

<p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've run the network troubleshooter. It's response was, "Troubleshooting couldn't identify the problem".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The HomeGroup troubleshoot reports, "Troubleshooting couldn't identify the problem".</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it does mention that my son created a homegroup on his laptop. So now I ask, is this the way Windows 10 handles peer-to-peer networking? Should we use a HomeGroup? If so, should we delete the whole workgroup thing we created?</p>

<p>It appears that my son has created a homegroup on his laptop. It would be better if I did it on my desktop. I'll ask him about it, what the password is, etc.</p>

<br />
<br />If your TV has same network connection as of laptop and it supports projection, press Windows Key + P keys. You'll now have options to extend display. 
<br />

<p>Hi Richard, <br />
<br />
It depends, is that TV a Smart (Internet Enabled) TV? <br />
<br />
If so you can cast to that TV, otherwise you will need to connect to the TV via a HDMI cable .. .
<br />
<br />
Connect the TV and laptop via HGMI, then set the TV to HDMI input and on the laptop, press Windows Key + P and either choose Extend or Dupliate
<br />
<br />
If it is a Wireless TV and your laptop supports Miracast, full instructions on connecting to that TV can be found in this article:
<br />

<h2>            my WLM window will not stay where I put it</h2>
                    I'm running a clean install of Windows 7 from Dell and Windows Live Mail. &nbsp;I keep WLM running on my desktop and size the window to fit between my desktop icons and a chat program that I also keep running. &nbsp;However, when I wake my system after the screen
 saver comes on, my WLM window has inched over out of the position where I want it. &nbsp;It does this all the time and it's really irritating. &nbsp;Why doesn't it stay where I put it and how can I fix this annoying problem? &nbsp;Thanks.

I tried this and it seemed to work at first. &nbsp;I rebooted and launched WLM and it came up where I had put it, but when I switched users and logged back in again, the window had inched over again. &nbsp;it just moves about a half an inch to the right each time.

<h3> johnhenryhill  say:</h3>
<h2>            1.&#41; NMI&#58; Parity Check&#47;Memory Parity Error on booting WinXp AND 2.&#41; FAILED pre-Windows boot Video Hardware diagnostic test     September 1, 2010__</h2>
                    
<p><span>I have a<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Dell Inspiron E1705 laptop</span> with
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Win XP Pro, SP3</span> . <span>&nbsp;</span> I have 2 memory modules of 1 GB each for a total of 2 GB RAM memory.<span> It also has a<strong>dedicated graphics card: NVIDIA GeForce Go 7800</strong> (which has been replaced
 with NEW cards of same model TWICE, after they burned out due to its cooling fan failure).<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The system ran fine for several years until August 30, 2010 when the audio and video became intermittent (breaking up several times each second) until system froze - this happened
 while I was watching a news VIDEO on <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">FoxNews.com</span> via<strong>Adobe FLASH player</strong> .
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1.) On reboot, the system gets as far as the initial Windows startup screen, then I get the BLUE SCREEN with the following message:<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>***<strong>Hardware Malfunction</strong> ***</span></p>
<p><span>Call your Hardware Vendor for Support.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>NMI: Parity Check/Memory Parity Error</span></strong></p>
<p><span>***The System has Halted***</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>2.) I ran a BIOS pre-boot HARDWARE DIAGNOSTIC in which<strong>ONLY one of the VIDEO tests failed</strong> :</span></p>
<p><span>Error Code: 5300:0119</span></p>
<p><span>Msg: Detected a failure while writing and reading VIDEO MEMORY.Video mode: 0h (320x200x16)&nbsp; Address A0674h,&nbsp; expected to read 0h, but read 10000h instead.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>3.)&nbsp; In "Safe Mode" I attempted a BIOS flash re-install, then a BIOS flash update, but it fails every time with the message that the<strong>"BIOS cannot be installed while a
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">FLASH application</span> is running"&nbsp;</strong> (even though I have opened NO programs)&nbsp;&nbsp; MP061 BIOS FLASH A09</span></p>
<p><span>Application return error:&nbsp; 0x00000610</span></p>
<p><span>Windows return error: 0x0000043c</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>4.) Attempt to "restore" the Registry from several working registry backups (made with "Advanced Registry Optimizer 2008" (by SammSoft) and Windows "System Restore" failed to make
 any changes to the registry.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Is this a Virus, Trojan, malware, etc? [Searches for same using McAfee AV, Spyware Doctor,</span><span>Advanced Registry Optimizer 2008,
 and other software</span><span>have yielded nothing that corrects the problem.] A failure of the graphics adapter memory? Interference by a hidden process (FLASH program) running in the background?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THANKS !</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>P.S. I am an advanced user with 25+ years of PC and network administrator experience in large corporations.<br />

<p>Have you not heard of Google in the last 25+ years?</p>
<p>Here is the very first Google search result of: &nbsp;<strong><span>NMI:

<p>That sounds pretty good to me.</p>
<p>I would politely recommend you stop "trying" things unless you are feeling really lucky!</p>
<p>How are you doing these registry restores and other things if your system will not boot?</p>
<p>I don't think you can flash the BIOS in Safe Mode - how did you do that? &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Someone will likely suggest you "test your RAM" but not tell you how to do it, so I will also suggest you test your RAM and also tell you how to do it:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Run a test of your RAM with memtest86+ (I know it is boring and will cost you a CD).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Memtest86+ is a more up to date version of the old memtest86 program and they are not the same.</p>
<p>The memtest86+ will not run under Windows, so you will need to download the ISO file and create a bootable CD, boot on that and then run the memtest86+ program. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If even a single error is reported that is a failure and should make you suspicious of your RAM.</p>
<p>If you have multiple sticks of RAM you may need to run the test on them one at a time and change them out to isolate the failure to a particular single stick.</p>
<p>Always keep at least the first bank of RAM occupied so the test will find something to do and there is enough to boot your system.</p>
<p>Sometimes, reseating the RAM in the slots will relieve the error but a failure is still cause for suspicion.</p>
<p>The file and instructions are here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.memtest.org/</a></p>
<p>Here is a link that shows you have to create and use the memtest86+ CD:</p>

<p>If someone says to run memtest86, you can tell them to go pound sand and that you know memtest86+ supercedes memtest86 and here's why: &nbsp;</p>

<p>Jose,</p>
<p>I have heard that you can flash BIOS from Windows. I have to find that reference, but with new BIOS it is possible. I haven't flashed in that manner, but always from floppy or CD.</p>
<p>Sometimes I cannot run Windows' Memory Testing Program, but MemTest86+ alway have worked.</p>

<p>Making sure&nbsp;you do have data backed up,&nbsp;remove memory one card at a time and test it in all available slots.<br />
Second approach is to remove CMOS battery overnight. Then place new CMOS battery. I can't give exact explanation, but on two rare occassions I was able to fix computer and was able to re-flash the BIOS (of course I had backed up all data). CMOS battery usually
 last for 3 years if computer had been plugged into electrical receptacle wihout starting for weeks at a time. CMOS manufacturer, plus location weathr (high or too low) can affect CMOS lifespan. Have you seen video of a computer catching fire from CMOS (of
 course slighly old - 10 years ago)?</p>

<br />
<div>It looks to me as if you have a problem with the graphics hardware - so nothing you do in Windows is going to make ay difference, and flashing the BIOS won't help.</div>
<div>It' not uncommon for high-end laptop hardware to overheat - which is what would seem to nave happened to your first tow graphics cards, and which appears to be happening to this one.</div>
<div>Complain to Dell, and see if you can get them to replace the card again, for free.</div>

    <title>Surface Book using Surface Dock with Dell UltraSharp 24 Monitor - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> orgbrat  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Book using Surface Dock with Dell UltraSharp 24 Monitor &#8211; U2414H</h2>
                    <p>I have new Surface Book i7/16GB/512GB dGPU connected to the new Surface Book Dock then I have a Delll UltraSharp 24&nbsp;(U2414H) monitor attached to the dock with a miniDisplayPort to HDMI cable. According to Dell the optimal resolution is 1920 x 1080 at 60Hz
 which has been working fine for the Surface Pro 2 which I am replacing with the Surface Book. The issue I am having with this setup is that the U2414H monitor has a vertical 2 inch black bar on each side of the monitor. I can change the Surface Book resolution
 from 3000 X 2000 to 1920 X 1080 and the monitor is filled up but now the Surface Book has&nbsp;black bars on display.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So is there a solution for this issue? Is there a way to set-up this combination and get both the Surface Book and the Dell U2414H monitor to display correctly ( full screen ) on both devices? Or are these two display resolutions just too different to work
 together satisfactory?</p>
<p>

            <p>Is your intent to mirror the Surface to the Dell monitor? If so, the aspect ratios are completely different and one or the other will need to display "black bars" to match up.
<br />
<br />
The SurfaceBook will need top and bottom black bars, or the Dell monitor will require left and right side black&nbsp;bars.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If instead you want to extend your desktop onto the Dell, you can select that in display settings. Then the Surface keeps its display, and the Dell is an extension of the desktop. Both monitors would allow full screen use at that point.<br />
<br />
Hopefully this is helpful.</p>

    <title>Error E79 on 4GB Slim Xbox 360 error &#38;amp&#59; arbitrary reduced - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sammy99  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error E79 on 4GB Slim Xbox 360 error &#38;amp&#59; arbitrary reduced warranty</h2>
                    
<p>Recently got this error on my Xbox 360 4GB slim shortly after the 1 year warranty expired on the console. (Just over 2 weeks of expiring)<br />
Turned it on for the first time in a couple of days and got hit with the 4 red lights, after doing some reading on it it's usually an HDD error (which I don't have) or a NAND corruption or bridge failure which is more likely.
<br />
<br />
Seeing as this occurred shortly after the 1 year warranty period Micro$oft probably won't repair it evidently as their online repair center is seeking $80+ for repair costs DESPITE cutting the 12 month warranty down to 11 months without notification or just
 cause. Online website says console warranty expired on February 15th 2013 however my store receipt and credit card statement both list date of purchase as March 15th 2013.
</p>
<p><br />
Anywho, thank you for your OUT OF THIS WORLD level of customer service and ARBITRARY cutting of a standard warranty without cause or notice.
<br />

Bought March 15, 2012 from local Future Shop <br />
12 month warranty that ends on March 15, 2013...?<br />
April 1st 2013, Xbox 360 gets E79 error --&gt; Check repair site/warranty<br />
<strong>Warranty expired on February 15th 2013...</strong>Look at receipt and credit card statement....Both says it was purchased on March 15th 2012.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for arbitrarily cutting a month off warranty without notice or just cause &amp; being steller in offering a reduced warranty (from 3 years) on a lower quality product</p>

<p>Sorry to hear that. Even if the warranty expired on March 15th 2013 you didn't have the problem until April 1st. Sorry to hear that though.</p>

<p>That reasoning does not excuse let alone explain arbitrarily reducing a warranty/contract that stated I am entitled to 12 months of coverage from the purchase date.</p>
<p>The console breaking down shortly after the supposed 12 month warranty attests to the quality of Micro$oft's products. Reinforcing this is the reduction of their standard warranty from 36 months to 12 months to 11 months.

<p>I'm not sure, but the 36 months was for their older models that weren't as reliable. The newer S (slim) models are way more reliable so they shortened the warranty. Your system unfortunately happened to fail, but it can happen with any electronic device.

<p>Again, sorry that it happened as it stinks, I'm sure.</p>

<p>i would try bring it back to the store to try and exchange it. the manufacture date on the back form the time it sits on the shelf the warranty can expire.also it sounds like you bought a use console and the person who bought it brought it back and registered
 the warranty and then returned it .I would call Microsoft at 1-800-4myxbox to try and get a quote to see if what they tell you is the same as what the website told you.</p>

            Hi Leksinono, thanks for your question. I'm Graeme, a Microsoft Community expert and fellow user.
<br />
<br />It sounds like there's an error with a system file or maybe even a hardware problem, but either way the next step for you is to try a clean install of Windows.
<br />
<br />Here is a comprehensive set of instructions you can follow to clean install Windows 10:

<br />
<br />Here's the link to the media creation tool to make the installation media for Windows:

            On a working computer, create an Installation media of Windows 10 that allows you to repair existing Windows Installation.
<br />
<br />Create a USB Flash Drive

<br />
<br />Boot from the USB Flash drive-Make sure you have disabled Secure boot/Fast boot in BIOS Settings.
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-usb-drive-windows-10-pc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-...</a>

<br />
<br />Then open Advanced Startup options after the computer boots from USB. Click Repair your computer at the first screen that says Install now.
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-boot-advanced-startup-options-windows-10-a.html#option6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-boot-a...</a>
<br />
<br />Select Startup repair, let it finish the job and see if the computer can boot afterward.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help, consider doing a clean install after rescuing your files.

    <title>Combase.dll error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vassilipan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Combase.dll error</h2>
                    <p>I am hoping someone here has an answer, as Microsoft tells me this is not their problem yet the application tech support says it absolutely is a Microsoft issue. I have an application named "Perrla" that is used to write academic papers is a certain format.
 Earlier this week I had to reinstall Windows 10 to correct an error in another application, and the Perrla application had to be reinstalled. After I reinstalled Perrla, it would no longer run. I get as far as the application boot screen and the app crashes.
 Several calls to Perrla support narrowed the issue down to an (infrequent) error with combase.dll. and their tech support told me Microsoft would have to provide the fix; they had this issue with other users who had to contact support for Microsoft and eventually
 had their issue resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After three calls to Microsoft tech support I was finally told the issue is that I am using Word 2019 and Perrla does not support that version. The MS tech sent me back to Perrla, whose tech said it was BS; Perrla fully supports Word 2019. Regardless of
 which tech is correct, I documented a combase.dll error when Perrla starts, but the MS support people didn't investigate it. The log file follows, and I am hoping someone can tell me how to fix this so I can get my application working again.</p>
<p>

<p>No one here can get inside the Perrla representative's head to know what Windows issue they had in mind. If you ask Perrla to describe in some detail what the issue is, someone here may recognize it. Otherwise, you're hoping for a lucky guess or you'll receive
 time-consuming generic troubleshooting that may have nothing to do with the issue, whatever it is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here is my guess - it comes from Perrla's own website:</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is an excerpt: <em>"We have a brand new version that should help eliminate most of the problems with anti-virus software or Windows Defender."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. Best wishes on your paper.</p>

<p>Thank you. One of the first things the Perrla rep had me do was disable my virus program (Avast). This had no effect. Neither did running the install as an administrator, changing compatibility to Windows 8, and, from a MS tech, reinstall Windows (again).
 The Windows issue reported by the Perrla rep is a combase.dll error, as shown on the log file:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Faulting application path: C:\PERRLA\PERRLA.exe</span></p>
<p>Faulting module path: C:\WINDOWS\System32\combase.dll</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running sfc /scannow does not find any integrity violations.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi  vassilipan
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Could you try running the application or reinstall it using compatibility mode to see if it corrects the problem.
<br />
<br />Run Old Software on Windows 10 with Compatibility Mode - groovyPost
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-software-windows-10-compatibility-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-softwa...</a>
<br />
<br />If that does not work, this is likely a compatibility issue with Windows 10 1809, which would suggest, your best option would be to downgrade.
<br />
<br />
<br />Step 1: Go to another working computer with Internet access, download Windows 10 1803 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1803 
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy

<br />

<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1809 again. See instructions how to block it:
