<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Settings may not be retained or work properly if there are software conflicts happening within the system. We suggest that you perform clean boot for us to isolate if this is happening even with minimal drivers. To do so, please follow the steps found on

<p>Hi Katrina,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank for responding. I did what you asked me to do and the problem persisted. However, now that I i have restarted my laptop as usual, my auto rotate function no longer works regardless of if my rotation lock function is on or not</p>

<p>So Hi again</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided to look around online and I did a Bios update. That solved the new problems, but the old one still persists. No matter what I do, The "always ask" me function will not work. When I fold my laptop into a tablet the Scree auto rotates, but there
 is no prompt. The "do you want to switch to tablet mode" yes or no doesn't come up.<br />
<br />
I'm really hoping you can help me</p>

    <title>System Restore files deleted during Adobe Reader 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> skutflut  say:</h3>
<h2>            System Restore files deleted during Adobe Reader 10 install&#47;Reinstall</h2>
                    
<p>I recently installed Adobe Reader X&nbsp; (V10) on my machine.&nbsp; After the install,&nbsp; I noted problems opening certain PDF files in IE8 when those files were&nbsp;served by HTTPS servers.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have found a work around for that problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other BIG&nbsp;problem is that the Adobe Reader installation wiped all my system restore points.&nbsp;&nbsp; I get&nbsp;this error message&nbsp; in event viewer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The System Restore service has been suspended because there is not enough disk space available on the drive \\?\Volume{c571a863-a872-11dd-b12b-002215f181b9}\. System Restore will automatically resume service once at least 200 MB of free disk space is available
 on the system drive.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, how do I tell from the volume description above WHICH drive ran short of space?&nbsp; I have a 500 GB drive partitioned into 4 logical drives, (C,D,E,F)&nbsp; and all of them have plenty of free space on them,&nbsp; none less than 75GB.&nbsp; I actually turned off System
 Restore on the F drive&nbsp; (all data files)&nbsp; as that is the one with the least free space on it, (75GB free).</p>
<p>Any ideas as to why I am losing my restore points when installing/reinstalling Adobe&nbsp;Reader 10?&nbsp; &nbsp; As a temporary work around,&nbsp; I have started making copies of each drive's Sysem Restore folder once a day to avoid having nothing at all if something goes
 wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp; This problem is really exasperating!&nbsp;&nbsp; As a side note,&nbsp; I used to have a similar problem with restore points when I was running Webroot Spysweeper after installing the very last update&nbsp; in V5 (.147 i think it was) &nbsp;before they went to V6.&nbsp;&nbsp; The solution
 there was to revert back to V5.139.</p>
<p>Any help or answers would be appreciated!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>TIA</p>
<p>Skutflut</p>

<p><strong><span><span>Hi Skutflut,</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>Start the Disk Cleanup tool and free up space on the drive that has caused the problem. You can also free that space by deleting unnecessary files, folders, or programs from the
 drive</span></p>

<p>I did all those things already, the same day I discovered the problem.&nbsp; &nbsp; I thought the problem was solved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I uninstalled and then reinstalled Acrobat X two days later on the advise of Adobe (the same day I posted my message to this forum), due to the problem I had opening PDF files from an HTTPS source,&nbsp;and&nbsp;my restore files were deleted again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps you can tell me what low disk space the error is referring to?&nbsp; Is it telling me that&nbsp;the disk space allocated for system restore files&nbsp;is&nbsp;low?&nbsp; I have that set at the maximum 12%?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It certainly cannot have a disk space problem with the overall
 disk capacity,&nbsp; they all have at least 75GB of free space availabe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How to remove parental restriction on my account</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I recently reset my two week old Surface Pro 4 to the default installation of windows 10 due to some problems. Shortly after doing so I went to log into my microsoft account to purchase office but was prompted to either get an adult or verify my age
 through a credit card. I live in Canada and the only default region available for selection for the credit card is the U.S. so I cant verify my age that way. I am somewhat confused to how my account region and birth date was altered as it wasn't giving me
 any issues a few days ago. Is there a way or tech support I can contact to have this child restriction removed from my account as I cant log into it anymore? I'm 42. Am I able to create a new account and have that associated with my device?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The date of birth information on your Microsoft account may&nbsp; have affected your ability to purchase from the Store. To see if that is the case, we recommend that you go
<a href="https://account.live.com/editprof.aspx?amru=https://account.microsoft.com/profile&amp;mkt=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> and check if the birth year selected is correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also go to this <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/store/b/office?icid=CNavSoftwareOffice" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> to purchase Office products. That link will take you to the Microsoft Store for Canadian consumers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if it addressed your concern. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>What email do you want as your default, some can be kinda tricky to setup, you need there toolbar install and messengers, and in there settings you can set them as your default email, gmail is a good example of a email account that makes it almost to easy
 to setup, yahoo is ? so so. live&nbsp; mail ?</p>
<p>Click the start button and click on default programs, then click associate a file type and protocol&nbsp;with a program, go all the way to the bottom of that page until you see MAILTO listed, left click it and then click on change program, look at the list of
 installed email programs, it might be a short list, or a bunch of programs that don't qualify as email programs, if you see live mail or your email, left click it and click on close on the bottom of the page.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 Log-in Bug - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nklimov  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Log-in Bug</h2>
                    
<p>When I attempt to log into my account, the log-in page tells me that my password is incorrect. After I log in with Veriface, I go to the control panel to change my password.</p>
<p>If I type in random characters for my current password, it tells me that it is incorrect and will not let me change it. However, if I type in the password I attempted to use to log in, it accepts it as correct and will allow me to change my password.</p>
<p>So... the system accepts my password after I am logged in, but not in the log-in page itself. Bug?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additional info:</p>
<p>I have not changed my password in over 6 months - I know what it is and have not forgotten it.</p>
<p>I have run a scan of my system and have found no malicious programs.</p>
<p>This issue has occurred only in the past two days - I have not experienced any issues beforehand.</p>
<p>I have not done anything out of the ordinary in the past few days on my computer. I do not believe that I have downloaded anything onto it, and I do not recall visiting any websites other than those I go on daily. I did not install anything onto my computer.</p>
<p>No one uses this laptop other than myself - there is only one account on it, the Guest account is off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would greatly appreciate a quick response.</p>

I think that the </span><span>Veriface is causing some issues here.<br />
Are you completely sure that your PC is clean and that <br />

            This can easily happen when you have more than one keyboard language installed. You might have one keyboard layout at logon time and another that is valid for your own profile and that becomes effective only after you have logged on. You can easily confirm
 this by setting a keyboard language independent password such as 123456. Not a bug but entirely predictable!

<p>Sorry for the wait on the reply, I have been rather busy and I have made sure to test out all the theories provided here and elsewhere about this problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. No, Veriface is not the issue. The program was on this computer when I received it. It has never updated, and I have never had any problems logging in with it or by typing in my password before.</p>
<p>2. I have run a total of 4 virus scans from separate programs, and all have come up clean. As I said before, I have not downloaded anything or gone onto any unusual sites recently before the problem began. Also, if it was some sort of malicious software,
 I fail to see why my password would be intact and unchanged.</p>
<p>3. It is not a problem with multiple languages on my keyboard, which I do have. I set my password to a short 4-number code, and the problem ceased for a short time. However, it soon returned and I was still unable to log-in with the numeric password, even
 though it has remained unchanged.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As to some of my other discoveries that may be of use:</p>
<p>- Restarting my computer will remove the problem for the first log-in. I only have this issue if the computer goes into sleep or hibernate. [Note: I do not have any programs installed that affect either of these settings, including screensavers]</p>
<p>- If I repeatedly type in my password, eventually the computer will act as if it is logging me in. The picture and the password box are removed and the screen says "Welcome" with the loading circle to the side (as it normally does). After about 10 seconds,
 I receive the "Invalid password" message and am sent back to the log-in screen.</p>
<p>- I have created a password-less administrator account (for safety reasons), and I have no problems logging into it.</p>
<p>- Occasionally it seems that the computer will let me log in; however, this is very infrequent (perhaps around 2% of the time) and I cannot find any pattern as to when it does.</p>

            Since here are a few million Windows 7 installations out there that have no password problems, the odds are that there is some agent on your machine that interferes with its normal operation, regardless of the outcome of your numerous virus scans. I would
 now test if the problem persists under these circumstances:<br />
<ul>
<li>When booting into Safe Mode </li><li>When launching msconfig.exe and disabling each and every Startup Task and every non-Microsoft service under the Services tab. Note that this will not prevent Windows from starting.</li></ul>

<p>I have the same problem, every time I put my computer into sleep mode and try to log back in, I get password incorrect. I have tried pushing caps lock to see if that was turned on it wasn't. I tried turning on the numlock and that didn't work either. I only
 get this problem when my computer goes into sleep mode. I tried creating a new user profile as well to see if it was a bad profile, but that profile also shows the same issue. I am running Windows 7 home edition and have always had this problem, I have installed
 all the security updates and also run the virus scan and found no problems. Is there anything that I can do to fix this issue.</p>

<p>Hello - I have seen this issue as well in our test enviroment. Some of the users (who are using Windows 7 Ent.) when they put their laptops to sleep cannot log in when bring it out of sleep. It tells them they have the incorrect passwords. All are using
 the same hardware and software. Hibernate works just fine but sleep doesn't. They power it down completely and then start over.</p>
<p>I will try these and report back once I am done testing it.</p>
<li>When booting into Safe Mode </li><li>When launching msconfig.exe and disabling each and every Startup Task and every non-Microsoft service under the Services tab. Note that this will not prevent Windows from starting.
<p>Thanks</p>
I also looked into this: This can easily happen when you have more than one keyboard language installed. You might have one keyboard layout at logon time and another that is valid for your own profile and that becomes effective only after you have logged on.
 You can easily confirm this by setting a keyboard language independent password such as 123456. Not a bug but entirely predictable! And did not find another keyboard language installed. Just US.</li>

<p>Select Start, All Programs, Windows Update, View Update History. What updates have failed to install and what are the Failure codes?</p>
<p>Is the Windows 7 SP1 update installed.</p>
<p>You do not use System Restore to update the system! It does the reverse! It is also not the recommended way to uninstall an update if that was your intention.</p>
<p>Recently there have been some larger updates. The process of installing updates comprises downloading, installing and configuring. The computer often then has to be restarted and configuring is completed during the boot process. Where is it getting stuck?</p>
<p>When you get problems updating it can help to manually update by selecting Start, All Programs, Windows Update, Check for Updates. Check the boxes before the updates you want to install, click on Install and click again on Install in the next window and
 the process of installing starts. You should let the process proceed without interruption. The progress window will tell you what is going on. You need to be patient. If you have a number of updates to install break the task of updating into two or more tasks.
 It can also help to run Disk CleanUp (or better still cCleaner) and Disk Defragmenter ( or better still Defraggler) before installing any large download.</p>

<p>Hi, <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you for trusting the community on your concern. We really would love to help. However, it is not affordable for you to be mislead. But the program is only compatible with Windows XP. We are pretty sure this will not work with Windows 10, which supports
 the Visual Studio. For more accurate info in this regard, it would be best to ask our fellow developers in

<p>
</p><p>I recently had to reset my OS to factory conditions, and one of the (many) problems I've had thus far is the fact that some of my Notepad documents that were saved to my external hard drive beforehand open with unintelligible script. Others on the external
 drive work just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The file extension is normal, and I've tried opening the affected documents in WordPad, LibreOffice Writer and even Firefox, all to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to view these documents ASAP, how can this be done?</p>

                    <p><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Original Title: Windows 7 HP 64 bit

<p>
</p><p>I've performed a clean install of windows 7 HP 64 bit and reinstalled all my drivers and everything was fine except the Internet seemed to be a little slow, but then it speed up and was fine. Then, for a little while I was unable to update windows with an
 error code. &nbsp;I downloaded and installed steam and Baidu antivirus and all the games I had before and everything was running great. &nbsp;Then, perhaps a week later I was able to update windows, but when my PC was trying to install the important updates windows
 downloaded during shutdown, it kept saying it failed to configure or something like that, but it seemed they were all on there because for the next couple days I'd click check for updates and it said up to date. Then a day or so later when I try to open chrome,
 explorer, word, excel, steam, etc, a window pops up and says application error and it says the application was unable to start correctly (0xc0000005) how do I fix this? Please help? FYI this is a computer I built a couple years ago and only recently been having
 this issue.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are receiving error on multiple applications and I will be happy to answer your query.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There could be several reasons for this cause including virus on the computer. I do realize that you have using steam and Baidu antivirus on your PC. However, it is recommend that&nbsp; you use only one security software in PC otherwise using multiple security
 software may conflict with each other and not function properly. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As of now, I would suggest you to try the following methods to diagnose the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Method 1:
</span></strong><span>Start the computer in Safe Mode and check if the issue persists. If the issue does not persist in safe mode, place the computer in clean boot state and check.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Step 1:
</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Start the computer in Safe Mode
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Safe mode is a troubleshooting option for Windows that starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows
 are started. The words <strong>Safe Mode </strong>appear in the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode you're using.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Please refer to:</span><strong>

</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Place the computer in clean boot state to avoid any third party software conflict.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup
 is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow
 the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10  start up failure</h2>

<p>The Safe Mode will not accept the known and correct start up password.</p>

                    <p>
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">After upgrading to Windows 10 Pro I am getting an activation error it's&nbsp;telling me that my windows could not be activated because the specified product key has been blocked.</span></p>
<p>
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>I am upgrading windows 7 pro
</span><span>on a refurbished PC.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>I upgraded from windows 7 pro to windows 10 and got the message that the activation was blocked. I&nbsp;waited 14 days. I then reverted
 to Windows 7. At that point I verified that the windows 7 pro activation code used on my PC reflected the code on the windows sticker. It did not , so I updated the activation code for windows 7 pro and submitted the activation. I received confirmation that
 my windows 7 pro activated successfully. I then ran through the automated process to upgrade to windows 10. After completing the second upgrade I am still receiving the cannot activate message and again I have waited 10 days.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">How can I get windows 10 activated and is it possible that the first install based on a different windows 7 pro activation code could be causing my issues? If the first
 install is the issue, what can I do to resolve it?</span></p>

            <p><span>Hi Bruce,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>I regret the inconvenience caused to you. Let me help you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In order to understand the issue in a better manner, please share the details.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>How did you perform Windows 10 upgrade?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Do you see any error code along with the error message?</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>A Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key cannot activate Windows 10. Windows 10 uses its own unique product key.
</span></p>
<p><span>By default, Windows 10 builds are pre-keyed, meaning, you do not have to enter a product key and should not be prompted to enter one as long as you upgraded from an activated Windows 7 or Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 license or Windows 10 Preview build.<br />
&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you perform a clean install on first attempt, you will have to start over from an activated Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 installation.</span></p>
<p><span>If you are prompted to&nbsp;enter a product key, click Do this later and give it a few days, Windows 10 will activate automatically.
</span></p>
<p>

            <p>Thank you for the rapid response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I performed the upgrade the same way both times, clicking the windows 10 icon on the task bar and &nbsp;following the dialog to download and install windows 10. Both installs performed without error, and in both cases I ended up with a Windows 10 is not activated
 message. The current code is 0xC004C003, indicating the activation code has been blocked. &nbsp;The difference between the two installs was that after the first install did not activate for 14 days, I reverted to windows 7 pro and confirmed my windows 7 activation
 code. It did not match, so I updated the code and submitted an activation request for windows 7 pro. I received a confirmation that windows 7 pro was activated. I then proceeded to goo through the windows dialog to download and install windows 10. And I still
 cannot get it activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the link you indicated the options that seemed applicable included options for "forcing an activation" and "reseting my license status".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I be trying one of these options? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Should I un-install windows 10 again ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you&nbsp;</p>

            <p>One week after my last post , windows 10 pro performed some automated updates, rebooted and now my system is indicating that windows 10 pro is activated. &nbsp;Apparently it needed even longer than I thought to get through the back log.</p>

                    <p>When I attempt to start any of the games in the daily challenge I just get a white screen appear. The only way out is to shutdown the app. This has been happening for the last week - I am unable to access any of the daily challenges. What is the fix for this problem, and if there isn't one when will one be available?</p>

    <title>802.1x - Computer authentication with multiple certs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> btinnc  say:</h3>
<h2>            802.1x - Computer authentication with multiple certs</h2>
                    <p>My Windows 7 computer has two computer certificates on it set for client authentication. They were issued by different CA's within our environment (it's a unique PKI environment).</p>
<p>In my certificate store I have two computer certs with the same name, but signed by CA-1 and CA-2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are also using dot1x. The Radius server trusts CA-2, but not CA-1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go in to the 802.1x settings for my adapter I set it to use 'Computer Authentication', but it does not allow me to select which certificate to use.</p>
<p>The problem is that when I go to authenticate, Windows 7 is automatically trying to use the cert signed by CA-1. I do not know which mechanism Windows uses to make the decision on which certificate to use. The only thing I can guess is that the cert signed
 by CA-1 is the first in the list because CA-1 is before CA-2 alphabetically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to select which cert is used for 802.1x authentication, or change the process Windows uses?</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<p>Yes, I can see my purchases but how can I receive a pdf of it as I need to claim back the money from my employer.

<p>I didn't receive an email of my purchase either which I would have expected anyways.</p>
