                    When downloading Programs for the Surface Pro, should I download the 32 bit or the 64 bit versions?

            The Surface Pro is a true 64-bit machine running 64-bit Windows 8. That means it can run either, just like a Dell laptop.

<h2>            New Skype Features&#40;There is no any&#41;</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
No need to say that I am very disappointed with new Skype version and forcing users to use it. But anyway, since u guys act like any other big company, not caring for ur client wishes, all is left to me is to ask these questions hoping for help:<br />
<br />
1. On new Skype all contact are mixed together, contact requests are together with conversations i used before, no line that devide them.<br />
How can I fix that?<br />
2. There is no hide option. I have 600 contacts and all of them are showed in the left side since I cant hide any of them. All I can do is to delete conversation and then it is hidden but also my chat history is deleted. How to fix that?<br />
3. There is no more option to run mulitple instances of Skype. How to fix that?<br />
4. No more reject button, so all i can do is to BLOCK or accept contact request. Pointless. How to fix that?<br />
5. Privacy settings is maximum reduced, u should be ashamed of that. I cant anymore forbid calls from persons that are not in my contacts anymore. I can receive calls from anyone. Only options is to hide my name for all users on skype. How to fix that?<br />
There are much more problems with new Skype version but these ones are the most annoying.<br />
<br />
I STRONGLY BEG u not to answer me with some ****** automated message. I beg u to answer me on these questions like a real person.<br />
We all know here that there is never any useful help on links that u post as answers.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance, with hope that u will not totally ruin Skype service.<br />
Milos.

<p><span>Hello Milos, </span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for the feedback. We appreciate the points you've raised and will forward them to our developers. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>1. On new Skype all contact are mixed together, contact requests are together with conversations i used before, no line that devide them. How can I fix that? –</span></strong><span> Unfortunately, there is no way to separate them. I will take
 note of your concern. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>2. There is no hide option. I have 600 contacts and all of them are showed in the left side since I cant hide any of them. All I can do is to delete conversation and then it is hidden but also my chat history is deleted. How to fix that? –</span></strong><span>
 We regret that there is also currently no option for this. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>3. There is no more option to run mulitple instances of Skype. How to fix that?
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>- You can run the app and use <a href="https://web.skype.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>4. No more reject button, so all i can do is to BLOCK or accept contact request. Pointless. How to fix that? -</span></strong><span> Those are the only available options.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>5. Privacy settings is maximum reduced, u should be ashamed of that. I cant anymore forbid calls from persons that are not in my contacts anymore. I can receive calls from anyone. Only options is to hide my name for all users on skype. How
 to fix that?</span></strong></p>
<p><span>- Can I have the specific Skype version you have installed on your device?<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>

<p>You seem to have moved it elsewhere. To find out where it is, create a desktop shortcut for notepad.exe. Now right-click it, then left-click&nbsp;<em>Properties</em>, then click

            Hi, I have a C5180 HP all in one. I had to reinstall the program and it works ok now. The only problem is when it asks if there is another page to scan and i say yes it freezes. I get around this by pressing the button on the printer to start a new scan
 and it tells me a scan is is progress and&nbsp;completes&nbsp;the scan. Doesn't matter how long I wait this is the only way to complete the scan. Thanks for your help

Hi Rick,</p>
<p>I&nbsp;did a search for OCR&nbsp;and it doesn't look like I have it.&nbsp; The scanner worked fine previously, so I wonder if I inadvertently deleted it.&nbsp; HP wanted me to do a factory reset of my computer (they said nothing about OCR).&nbsp; Is this something I can do without
 going through a factory reset as that would be a major pain, I'm sure.&nbsp; Thanks!</p>

The OCR Program usually comes on the Printer disk. Because of royalties, the OCR Program is usually not available for download.
<br />
<br />
There is <a href="http://download.cnet.com/SimpleOCR/3000-2070_4-10073196.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Simple OCR</a> that can be used but it's not like using the original OCR Program.<br />

Thanks Rick.&nbsp; I reinstalled the printer software and confirmed now that the OCR is on there, but it's still not working.&nbsp; Decided I'm going to take it to a local tech support place that I trust and have them fix it.&nbsp; If the fix is something I can share that
 would be helpful to others, I'll share it on this thread after I get it back.&nbsp; Thanks so much!&nbsp; Sue

<p>As you see, that is a temporary system error at the server, so there's probably not much you can do about it. However, BT accounts are notoriously temperamental when accessed from a mail client as opposed to via webmail. You may, though,&nbsp;be able to take
 a few steps to make this sort of fault less likely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first is to make sure you've entered the new password on the <em>Servers</em> tab of the account's properties dialogue. To open the dialogue, right-click on the account name in the folder pane and select Properties.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, it's wise to do a bit of housekeeping at the server end. Sign in to the account at
<a href="https://bt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">bt.com</span></a> and start by emptying the folders for spam and deleted items. Create a new folder or folders and move all of the messages out of the inbox and into the
 new folder. When the inbox is empty, select the account from the dropdown list on the bottom half of the send/receive button in Windows Live Mail.
<p>
</p><p>Assuming you were able to connect to an empty inbox, return to webmail and&nbsp;move half of the messages that haven't yet been downloaded by Windows Live Mail back into the inbox and again try send/receive for this account in Windows
 Live Mail. If the fault recurs, we now know that there's a dodgy message and also which half of the messages&nbsp;it's in. Repeat the process, taking half of the messages each time until the dodgy message can be identified and dealt with in webmail.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Don't use the webmail inbox as a storage folder. Move any messages for keeping on the server</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>into archive folders, leaving only a few days' worth of messages in the inbox at any one time. Empty the spam and deleted folders
 regularly.</span></p>

<h2>            Last update bricked my Console</h2>
                    
<p>My XBONE downloaded an update thats about 256mb in the background and the next time i turned on the console I got a black screen and e100 error. after countless chats and a phone call they want me to pay 115 dollars to replace the unit. Then through some
 random act of god, I came home today and turned on the console and it booted like nothing happend. Of course it forced me to do the update again and again it bricked. I cant get it back again and offline doesnt work. theres definitley a poison pill in that
 update. Something has to be done. I know I cant be the only one.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have to respectfully disagree with tech supprt et all who are saying this is hardware simply because it throws a code. I was able to revive my console twice now. The second time i factory reset, declined the upgrade and have zero issue. as soon as i accept
 the upgrade i have a brick. this is software related not hardware with all due respect.</p>

<p>I had this same problem. I was livid when Microsoft wanted me to pay for their screw up.
</p>
<p>I did this. Go to this site. </p>
<p><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-CA/xbox-one/system/offline-system-update-diagnostic-tool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../offline-system-update-diagnostic-tool</a></p>
<p>Use the Restore Factory Default. It fixed my issue. I tried the above files as Xbox Customer Support told me to do but didn't work. I didn't want to pay $115 since it was their error so what did I have to loose? Was about to phone customer support and freak
 out on them since the Customer support I chatted with online. </p>
<p>It worked for me. Hopefully it will work for you. </p>

<p>unfortunately none of the three offline recovery files were recognized by my console. and quite honestly i dont see why we should have to take such measures to fix an obvious software realted issue. As of now my console is up and running at home with auto
 update off. I will check in with it when i get home from work. amd i will not take an upgrade until i see microsoft fixed this</p>

<p>I hate to say it, but it's funny how a lot of people are having the same issues as us. I think it's time for a class action lawsuit against microsoft.</p>
<p>It just *** me off to no end for my 360 I got circular scratches on my disc and Microsoft tries to blame me for it and I never EVER had my 360 on it's side. I find it funny how there are many more 1000's of people with the same issues and now there is a
 class action lawsuit against Microsoft now because of it. Sadly I can't be part of that lawsuit but I wonder if we can do something about it now or have to wait 10 years to get our issues resolved now.</p>
<p>I also hate to say it, but if my Xbox One frags up again, (can't install some games now, so worried when I buy a new game again.) I will just get a PS4 and Microsoft will have just lost my business.

    <title>Xbox won&#39;t turn on. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> contemplates  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox won&#39;t turn on.</h2>
                    
<p>I read Mister Fitzer's post about if your console won't turn on. Well I'm pretty sure my Xbox is completely done since the power supply bar has the orange light on but my 360 won't turn on, so I'm just wondering if anyone knows anything that could fix this
 without me having to send it my console.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically, for the past 2 days my Xbox power supply has been getting that red light, but it was usually fixed by just switching my power supplies (I have two). Though today I moved my console to a different room in my house, I played it, had no problems,
 played for around 4 hours, then shut it off for around 5 hours. I went to turn on the console again, when it won't turn on. The power supply light is orange, and whenever I switched power supply cords, I just had the same problem. I plugged it into a different
 outlet, same result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone know a way to fix it without sending it in? It's not even under warranty and I don't wanna wait the 30 days for them to fix it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or should I just get a new console? I wanna just get one of those $200 Xboxs, but of course Microsoft makes the HDD built in for *** whatever stupid reason.&nbsp;</p>

<p>yeah I think your power brick might be broken it could of over heated or just malfunctioned. if you cant get it to turn on anymore then as much as it sucks you might want to buy a new one, or you could try waiting a few days and see if it fixes it self

<p>My power supply was orange and when I hit the power button it would make a noise I looked online for fixes found it could be a USB port could have a shorted wire. Not so with mine it was the TV, switched the plug to another HDMI port and it worked.</p>

<p>Basically, for a downloaded game, this error can happen for one of two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are not signed into the same gamertag/profile that was used to purchase the game.
</li><li>The system has trouble reading files on the hard drive -- signifying that the HDD could be going bad.
</li></ul>
<p>Hopefully, this helps!</p>

<h2>            Computer Restarts itself.</h2>
                    My systems restarts itself without warning. It freezes then restarts. It occurs randomly at anytime. even in safe mode.
<br />
If I shutdown the system, it will restart itself several times before windows will Boot up again.
<br />
There is no external connections or CD's inside my PC it just behaves this way. system recover to an earlier date does not work.
<br />
I need help. <br />
What are some approaches I can take? <br />

            <p>Hi Vinlee_texe,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting the issue on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per the description provided, it looks like the computer restarts itself automatically.</p>
<p>However, we need some more information about the issue to assist you better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help me answer these questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Did you try to update the BIOS?</p>
<p>2. Have you made any changes to the computer prior the issue?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a couple of steps which should assist you with this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have made any changes to the BIOS set&nbsp; it to&nbsp;default and check for the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you have multiple ram's installed, try to check with the alternate ram. As it maybe an issue with the ram.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Method 3:</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You may also try to perform a check disk from the Windows Recovery Environment and check.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p><span><strong><span><span>Run chkdsk from Windows Recovery Environment. Follow the steps from this link to boot into Windows Recovery Environment and open the command prompt:</span></span></strong></span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-are-the-system-recovery-options-in-Windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-are-the-system-recovery-options-in-Windows-7</span></span></span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a) Click on command prompt.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b) In the command prompt window, Type in the commands listed below i.e. (/f, /r, /i, /c).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In the command prompt, type chkdsk volume: Option (volume should be replaced by drive letter and option should be replaced by the commands provided below) and press Enter.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Type One of these Commands to Run Chkdsk:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>i.</span><span> </span></span></span><span>/f = The /f switch is the most common of the chkdsk switches. It tells chkdsk to try and fix any errors it finds.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>ii.</span><span> </span></span></span><span>/r = The /r switch tells chkdsk to attempt to recover any bad sectors of the hard drive if any are found. A bad sector is a spot on the hard drive that cannot hold saved data anymore. (See
 screenshot below)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>iii.</span><span> </span></span></span><span>/i = The /i switch tells chkdsk to perform a less detailed but faster disk check. (See screenshot below)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>iv.</span><span> </span></span></span><span>/c = The /c switch tells chkdsk to skip the checking of cycles within a folder structure which reduces the scan time.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> During the restart process, Windows checks the disk for errors, and then Windows starts. You may loss data in bad sectors while windows trying to recover the same</span></span></span></p>

                    <p>Recently the HP has an inminent HDD failure, so l decide to change the hard drive and do the upgrade to windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>First the HP support site offers just a few driver, basically just the audio, video and spam programs, however no touch screen driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>after 2 days of searching, l manage to find the correct driver, is the "NextWindow Touch Screen Driver", but the company its no loger working and the driver it´s old but makes the touch screen work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so right now the touch screen is working but when you touch goes crazy, making touches everywhere and not where you put your finger</p>
<p>
</p><p>please help</p>
<p>
</p><p>note: allready contact HP Support, no luck there (no warranty no help is given)... sucks!!!</p>

</p><p><span>I would like to inform you that drivers are always provided by the manufacturer of the device and HP is unable to provide the required drivers. Regrettably Microsoft cannot help in this issue, as
 the drivers are not designed and coded by us. The last resort is to search online. However these third party drivers downloaded and installed may not work as expected (Which you have already experienced) or can cause damage to the computer.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><em>Note:

    <title>Controller disconnecting on full battery - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davebtw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Controller disconnecting on full battery</h2>
                    <p>So i'm trying to play the GTA stunt races and all of a sudden, I get a black screen saying my controller has disconnected. I get that for around 1-2 seconds then its back. This happens 2-3 times every minute and as you can imagine, it's really annoying. At first I thought, the batteries must be low. They were, I changed them. Brand new, fully charged batteries. Same thing is happening. I figure I'm sitting too far away from the xbox so I move closer, literally around 1.5 meters away, facing the xbox straight on. Same thing is happening. Of course I will try a new controller but I have a worry nagging in the back of my mind that this could actually be the xbox and the sensor isn't working correctly anymore which could be a costly fix or may even result in me needing a new console.</p><p><br /></p><p>Has anyone else had an issue like this?&nbsp;I have searched it and saw a few posts about the day one controllers but this is just a standard one, less than 1 year old from Amazon.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>I am having a strange issue regarding the My Computer icon on my desktop in Windows 7. &nbsp;When I right click on it, the menu item to open the file manager is showing Chinese characters then the default English. &nbsp;When I select it, it does open the file manager,
 but not seeing the default English is annoying. &nbsp;</p>
<p>

<h2>            How to move, not copy, files from a USB drive&#63;</h2>
                    I have music stored on a USB drive (I recently upgraded to Windows 7 from Windows XP), and when I try to&nbsp;<strong>move</strong> my music, it copies it to the computer. However, when I take out the USB and try to play the music, it says that Windows can't
 find the file.<br />
I know this is because the original file is on the USB still.<br />
But I need to know how to move, instead of copy, my music to my computer.<br />
<br />

            When you click and drag I will use the right mouse button that way a menu will pop up when you release the button. Then you can choose "move files".

<p>Hi Darren,</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Windows 10, you may view a list of all devices that have been connected to your device through the
<strong>Settings </strong>app. If you no longer need to connect to a device, you may remove it through the
<strong>Settings </strong>app. Here's how to remove a connected device from Windows 10:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Start </strong>button, then select <strong>Settings </strong>
&gt; <strong>Devices</strong>.</li><li>Click the device you want to remove.</li><li>Click <strong>Remove Device</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Yes </strong>to confirm that you want to remove this device.</li><li>Restart your device, and see if the device is still connected to your computer.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If you need further assistance, feel free to ask us.</p>

<h2>            Skype problems - Kuwait</h2>
                    Hello, <br />
<br />
I am an online teacher and I have regular student in Kuwait. <br />
<br />
However it has become impossible to use Skype to communicate. The connection breaks every five minutes and it is often difficult to reconnect.
<br />
Two weeks of discussion with the support did not help. <br />
The student is one the most regular of all of mine students. <br />
<br />
Does anyone know how to solve this? <br />
<br />
We tried viber, imo, discord, all of that but we could not establish a decent connection.
<br />
<br />
I have good connection with all other students worldwide he has only problem with some of his other teachers.
<br />
<br />
Thanks for any kind of advice. The situation is dire.

            I recommend you go back to the classic version, since a lot of the functionality in Skype 8 is still maturing.
<br />
<br />Microsoft has listened to customer feedback and is allowing users who are comfortable with Skype Classic to continue use it for the foreseeable future until all the issues in Skype 8 are sorted out.
<br />
<br />The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report, then reinstall the classic version.
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-can-i-send-my-usability-feedback-to-skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-ca...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect will happen, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week.

            Thanks so much Andre,<br />
<br />
I will be sure to try this out but I don't think this is the case.<br />
<br />
The thing is, we have the same problems both with skype and other communication software.
<br />
My student has a very good connection however he will change the provider just to see if this helps.<br />
<br />
The strange thing is I don't have problems with other students so it must be something with Kuwait, but he has a good internet, fast one plays video games and everything.<br />

<h2>            Windows 8 app names &#40;on tiles&#41; are not in my language</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've had this problem where all my built-in apps (weather, news, people, etc.) were in English. Following the tips I found here, I changed my primary language to French and it partially worked: the content of the built-in apps is now in French, however,
 their name are still in English. The result is that my start screen shows a "Weather" tile instead of the expected "Météo", and even app search doesn't find the weather app if I search for "Meteo". The Windows Store, however, shows the French names for my
 installed applications.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How can I get app names to be in my language on the start screen and in the app search?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks.</div>
                </div>

<p>...and nobody told me!? Usually this sort of thing gets posted here! How come nobody did!? This is big news! ...and it's been out for a week!</p>
<p>I just finished trying out the new fall update for Battlefield 4 and it's huge. The developers have gone on record saying that it's the best network code they've ever had for a BF game, and OMG, it shows! And that's just the tip of the iceberg! If you own
 BF4, you owe it to yourself to go check it out! This game is, for&nbsp;all intents and purposes, is FIXED - yeah, you heard me right. ;)&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want more info, you can go to BF's official site (I'd post it here, but I'm currently on my console, which doesn't allow for copying and pasting of links).</p>
<p>It's awesome! *goes to play more Battlefield*&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for the update Geek. I think I'll be getting EA access soon so BF4 with it. I'll definitely try it out. I liked the game on the 360 but even then, it was unplayable at times. Glad to hear they sorted some of the issues out.

<p>The news of the week has been FORZA HORIZON 2. Came out 2 October for Australia and NZ, and 3 October for the UK. You should try it!! In mine and some others opinions, the graphics are more gorgeous than in Forza 5 and NFS Rivals on Xbox 1, games I have.
 Race trains and planes. I haven't seen you play it, just Destiny. Minecraft is also a biggy too. I haven't played BF4 for, well, at least a month. What's more is my friends who I was in a party with today on 360, complained having to download a Happy Wars
 update. Wait til she sees how big updates are on the Xbox 1. </p>
<p>I have these Xbox 1 games: Zoo Tycoon, Minecraft, COD Ghosts, BF4, NFS Rivals, Tomb Raider, Kinect Sports Rivals, Powerstar Golf, Project Spark Beta, Titanfall, Kinect Sports Rivals. I spend way more time on 360 still as most of my friends are still there.
 When I am on Xbox 1, it's Minecraft, Forza Horizon 2, Zoo Tycoon, Youtube, watching movies, and Skype, is what I mainly do. Read somewhere Project Spark full version is due this month and Happy Wars is coming to X1. Halo MCC is also announced for around the
 middle of next month. Only about 12 of my friends own an Xbox 1. Also because most of my favourite friends don't have an X1. Tho some of them are planning to get one in December.

<p>I wouldn't say its bug free just yet but it's definitely more playable than it has been, still get the occaisional big spikes but no where near as frequently, most of the guns have been tweaked aswell and as such some useless ones have become usable tho
 i feel most would still stick to familiar tools of the trade lol</p>
<p>I wish they would do something about the soflam diamond when in a LAV tho it only shows up on my screen &nbsp;after a recon has used the binochs or the soflam for some wierd reason which is annoying considering i normally go about in a soflam/tow missile two
 man combo lol</p>

<p>I was under the assumption that the campaign save issue was fixed months ago - you guys are still suffering from it? I would contact EA about that...</p>
<p>As for the update, now that I'm on my PC, here's the official list of changes:</p>
<p>[quote user="Battlefield 4 Fall Update"]GENERAL</p>

<p>• Crosshairs/Optics scale tweaked and visibility against light backgrounds improved.</p>
<p>• Helicopters and jets now affect trees and bushes which are set up to react to wind.</p>
<p>• Various collision fixes and other performance improvements have been made to Dragon’s Teeth maps.</p>
<p>• Uniform soldier aiming allows the use of procedural aim rate instead of the original preset numbers.</p>
<p>• Fix for elevators on Dawnbreaker being active on the Domination, Squad Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch and Defuse game modes.</p>
<p>• High latency indicator tweaked to give players a better idea of when they are experiencing lag.</p>
<p>• Fixed a rare issue where a second Commander would spawn over the already existing one in a certain scenario, resulting in 2 Commanders on the same team.</p>
<p>• Fixed the missing kill card issue for hardcore and anytime the killcam is off.</p>
<p>• Increased the Chain Link game mode round timer to 30 minutes. Ticket bleed rate has also been changed to be 40% slower.</p>
<p>• Fixed an issue where a player trying to join a full server would get an incorrect error.</p>
<p>• Added “Classic” Server presets.</p>
<p>• Increased the gunship cooldown for Commander to 60 seconds.</p>
<p>• Fixed an edge case where a Commander asset will never get "activated" for a team if the Commander is under a Proxy Attack.</p>
<p>• Fixed a crash related to the Riot Shield.</p>
<p>• The high frequency update is now on by default and cannot be turned off. It now also supports PlayStation 3/Xbox 360.</p>

<p>• Made 100 tickets the default Rush ticket value.</p>

<p>• Visual Recoil: Close range sights (except iron sights, IRNV and FLIR) and all Medium range sights have been changed to no longer be affected by animation AKA Visual Recoil. The removed random effect has nothing to do with real weapon recoil and doesn’t

<p>CARRIER ASSAULT IMPROVEMENTS</p>

<p>• When the first crate is destroyed the defender team is moved back into the boat but the attackers still will only be using the parachute spawn.</p>
<p>DRAGON’S TEETH MAP IMPROVEMENTS</p>
<p>• General collision fixes.</p>
<p>• Glitches/Exploit fixes for high places.</p>
<p>• Added out of bounds for rooftops to support restricted areas and prevent exploits.</p>

<p>• Improved the “stall” behavior of jets when reaching max vehicle height.</p>
<p>• Fixed issues where attack jets’ cockpit geometry was clipping/obstructing the HUD</p>
<p>WEAPON TWEAKS AND FIXES</p>
<p>• Fixed an issue with inaccuracy on the RPG and XM-25 where if after shooting a player very quickly it switches to another weapon then switches back, then the dispersion is large until after the first shot.</p>
<p>• General weapon tweaks: Reduced suppression recoils. Removed recoil modifier for zoom. Made a 75% reduction in hip recoil.</p>
<p>• Muzzle Brake: Lowered the overall impact of this attach. Both its positives and negatives have been reduced.</p>
<p>• Heavy Barrel: Lowered the buff it gave to minimum moving spread, and moved some of that bonus into reduced spread increase. The Heavy Barrel should now be a good option for longer range tap firing.</p>
<p>• Lasers: Added a small buff to standing hip fire accuracy.</p>
<p>• Corrected spread increase values that were previously incorrect. (This primarily affects expansion pack weapons).</p>
<p>• Added missing bullpup modifier to SAR-21.</p>
<p>• Bullet velocity increases: Improved bullet velocity for Slugs and nearly all suppressed weapons. Selectively improved base velocity for weapons that were too slow for their intended range.</p>
<p>• Damage model: Many weapons have had their maximum and minimum damage adjusted slightly. It may take one extra bullet to kill at extremely close engagements and long range combat.</p>
<p>• Trigger Delay: Removed from all revolvers.</p>
<p>• Desert Eagle: Bullet velocity and minimum damage reduced.</p>
<p>• Adjustments have been done to slower rate of fire weapons to make them easier to use at longer ranges vs higher rate of fire weapons.</p>
<p>• Carbines and PDWs now have unique bullpup modifiers that give improved bonuses over the rifle counterpart.</p>
<p>• Ammo: Gave more ammo to the weapons that were short a mag compared to their counterparts.</p>
<p>• PDWs: Improved moving minimum spread.</p>
<p>• LMGs: Improved moving spread of mag fed LMGs vs their belt fed counterparts.</p>
<p>• DMRs: Audio when being shot at by a DMR has been improved.</p>
<p>• SKS and M39EMR no longer allow you to hold breath.</p>
<p>• Bullet velocities increased.</p>
<p>• Bolt Actions: Some bullet velocities increased. Gol Magnum rate of fire slightly reduced.</p>
<p>• SMAW: Slight increase to top speed and acceleration.</p>
<p>• MBT LAW: This underwent a big change based on community suggestion. You will need to aim slightly more accurately to engage the tracking. It is much harder to have it track a random vehicle between you and your target. It will no longer lock on targets
 behind cover. It has been slowed down slightly. It now begins tracking at 100m instead of 15, this gives the target slightly longer to react to the lock warning.</p>
<p>• SLAMs: Damage and blast radius reduced slightly. Three Slams will no longer take out a MBT on their own. The disabled MBT will need a single rocket to be finished off.</p>
<p>ANIMATION BUG FIXES AND IMPROVEMENTS</p>
<p>• All pistols: Removed randomization of iron sights fire animation on most pistols per CTE feedback.</p>
<p>• All automatic pistols: Shortened duration of slide animation during firing animations to prevent slide appearing to not cycle when firing quickly.</p>
<p>• Automatic rifles: Fixed missing trigger pull animations.</p>
<p>• Unica 6: Fixed hammer getting stuck on iron sights fire animation. Shortened reload threshold so magazine registers as full, faster.</p>
<p>• CS5: Fixed magazine going invisible if reload is interrupted. Fixed problem where bolt action animation wouldn’t play when firing near the end of the tactical reload animation.</p>
<p>• G36C: Fixed charging handle position during full/tactical reload.</p>
<p>• CZ-805: Fixed charging handle position during full/tactical reload.</p>
<p>• AWS: Enabled semi-automatic fire.</p>
<p>• XM25: Fixed fire animation; including reciprocating charging handle.</p>
<p>• Bulldog: Fixed problem with tiered reload.</p>
<p>• M60E4: Adjusted reload interrupt branches to match other LMGs; ammo box now stays mounted on interrupt.</p>
<p>• L96A1: Added missing interruptible reload branches.</p>
<p>• JNG90: Adjusted reload threshold to prevent bypassing re-chamber animation at the end of empty reload.</p>
<p>• SR338: Fixed bug where fire animation could be skipped by firing at a certain cadence. Raised reload threshold.</p>
<p>• L85A2: Adjusted foregrip position so Angled Grip attachment doesn’t clip through the trigger guard; fixed reload animation bug that could cause accessories to shift on the weapon during animation.</p>
<p>• RPK-74M: Reduced both reload times by .3 seconds to better match animation.</p>
<p>• COMPACT 45: Removed hammer position mismatch between idle and ADS.</p>
<p>• ACW-R: Reduced time to register reload.</p>
<p>• QBU-88: Fixed clipping issue in deploy animation.</p>
<p>• SR2: Added reciprocating bolt fire animation.</p>
<p>• SR2: Fixed missing bolt on empty reload animation, fixed sprint pose clipping issue in water.</p>
<p>• 870: Fixed blending issue after zoom fire/pump action animation.</p>
<p>• M16A4: Fixed mismatched bipod pose, broken dust cover on model.</p>
<p>• RFB: Removed extra shell that moved when firing with a bipod and iron sights.</p>
<p>• MK 11 MOD 0: Opened dust cover to prevent jamming. Removed incorrect rotation during bipod fire animation.</p>
<p>• All DMRs, M82A3 Battle Pickups: Fixed bipod fire issue that skipped fire animation at higher rates of fire.</p>
<p>• M412 Rex, .44 Magnum: Adjusted fire animations for new trigger delay values, corrected trigger discipline while running.</p>
<p>• All belt-fed LMGs: Added “last few rounds” ammo visibility system to ADS fire animations.</p>
<p>• AWS: Fixed foregrip position to be on-rail in 1st person.</p>

<p>[quote]I wouldn't say its bug free just yet but it's definitely more playable than it has been...[/quote]</p>
<p>Lol. This should be E.A. s new marketing campaign,"Not bug free...but definitely more playable!". I quit buying E.A. games after Battlefield Bad Company II (I made a tiny exception with Titanfall.) because I got tired of paying for broken games. Glad to
 hear that almost a year after release it's more playable though. ;-)</p>

<p>I'm on the optional mission where you complete 4 levels of security 'tests'. I'm trying to complete the last part where you have to deactivate the robots from behind. I sneak up behind the robots but no option to disable? I'm science level 90 but no option
 to deactivate is available. Any help?</p>

<p>Maybe you need the robotics expert perk. I already had it, but I did wonder what it would do if you didn't have it. It's pretty useful so you wouldn't be wasting a perk getting it, You get extra +25% damage on all robots as well as the deactivate option.</p>
