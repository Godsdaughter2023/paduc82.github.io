<h2>            Unknown user suddenly appears in Family &#38; other people</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10, version 1703</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last week I started having issues with my PC where I couldn't type anything in the search box.&nbsp; I'd type 2 chars then the search box would go away.&nbsp; I found others with the same issue and tried their solutions but nothing fixed it for me.&nbsp; I then started
 wondering if i got a virus/malware so I started looking around.&nbsp; I found a user in "Family &amp; other people" that I didn't recognize - *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.&nbsp; I got concerned and checked with my companies IT admin and he was very concerned.&nbsp; I wiped my box and re-installed
 and life is good.&nbsp; Yesterday I thought I'd check out "Family &amp; other people" and I'll be damned - *** Email address is removed for privacy *** is back!&nbsp; Next to it is the text "can't sign in" and when I click on the user I don't get an option to remove it.&nbsp; Only "Allow" is enabled when
 I click on the user.&nbsp; I looked around a little on how to delete the user and found where I can go into Computer Management/Local Users and Groups and remove it, which I did.&nbsp; I then go back to Family &amp; other people and still see the user.&nbsp; I then click on
 something else, such as "your info" (while still in Settings), then back on Family &amp; other people.&nbsp; The user is still there.&nbsp; I go back to Computer Management, refresh the users and the user that I deleted is back!&nbsp; In fact I've deleted 2 users in Computer
 Management; jbrag and guerr - the first 5 letters of my last name.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I have a virus/malware?&nbsp; I'm running both Defender and Webroot Security Anywhere and both say I'm clean.&nbsp; So What's up with this user and why/how do they keep coming back?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<h3> outlookuser3656  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Won&#39;t Boot After Windows Update Error 0x80070002</h2>
                    <p>I attempted to help a relative with her HP Pavillion with Windows 7, today, and noticed she hadn't done any Windows or Microsoft Updates since 2016.&nbsp; So after I got through helping her with something else, I attempted to run an automatic update, and it simply
 never loaded.&nbsp; So then I downloaded a Windows Updat automatic fixing program or something that diagnosed and fixed the error, and it seemed to have done the trick.&nbsp; She had 48 updates so I let them download and install.&nbsp; I was kind of surprised they seemed
 to have been successful, because the diagnostic said that an error was still present.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I got to the part where you're supposed to restart.&nbsp; So it restarts, but there is something wrong and it takes me to the boot windows normally or repair.&nbsp; So I decide to do the repair.&nbsp; It can't do the repair because of the error, so I try to to
 a system restore.&nbsp; All the restore points fail, so I try to run sfc /scannow, but that can't run because it says a repair is pending (and of course the repair can't finish, so it's useless).&nbsp; So then I try chkdsk and it says the drive is protected or something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since windows came with the computer, she doesn't have a restore disk or anything, but I doubt that would solve this, anyway.&nbsp; What in the world happened from just downloading what you think are updates to help your computer, but actually render it unusable,
 and how can I fix this?&nbsp; I've looked high and low, and there doesn't seem to be a way to fix this.&nbsp; Anyone have any work-arounds or fixes or tips or tricks?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel just awful that I was helping a older relative update her computer, and she gets it back completely broken.</p>

<p>I try to fix this every now and again. The best solution is to just dual boot into Ubuntu (back up first), and check if this gets fixed every now and again. I made the mistake of installing the Update for 2019, which basically bricks win7 for my machine.
 You are not alone, as I have discussed this issue with several other system admins.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recommend going to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/thank-you?country=US&amp;version=18.04.2&amp;architecture=amd64" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/thank-you?country=US&amp;version=18.04.2&amp;architecture=amd64</a>&nbsp;if only to get the machine
 working again. Install an extra harddrive and install to that. Then load up the old harddrive to export.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also try&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)"><strong>Bootrec /RebuildBcd</strong> but that is about it if you don't have restore points /
 media. Check&nbsp;</span><a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/3ea8bd02-c641-47d5-9329-b961a691a2c9/windows-7-doesnt-boot-or-repair-or-restore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/3ea8bd02-c641-47d5-9329-b961a691a2c9/windows-7-doesnt-boot-or-repair-or-restore</a></p>

<p>Thank you so much, genuinely.&nbsp; I will see if one of these works.&nbsp; I don't have any extra (or external) harddrives, so I'll only be able to test the second thing you've talking about.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to have to spend hundreds of dollars to try and get an old computer to work if I don't have to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: Okay, the other one requires you to have the Windows disk, too, and I don't have that.&nbsp; Oddly, I've been able to run the "Start-up Test," and it's showing its passing the memory and hard disk and SMART checks.&nbsp; Weird that everything looks fine, but
 Windows won't properly boot, nor can I bring up a restore point.</p>

<p>Yeah, none of this is going to be useful for me, right now.&nbsp; I keep trying to do sfc /scannow but get the message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"There is a system repair pending which requires reboot to complete.&nbsp; Restart windows and run sfc again."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, just in case anyone ever comes across this again to rule out certain proposed solutions, and to finish off my questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; I really should have mentioned that while attempting to automatically fix the error with Automatic Updates, I downloaded a program called "Error Fixing Registry Cleaner" (https://errorfixing.com/).&nbsp; I ran the program, and it only fixed a few errors (maybe
 a handful or so) for free and then asks you to pay to fix the others.&nbsp; I didn't do this.&nbsp; This may very well have had something to do with the problems I subsequently experienced.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Is there anything I should try to do in Regedit, manually, or anything I should search for that may help solve this without the other things you've suggested?&nbsp; Is there a way without the start-up disc or another harddrive to do this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. During system restore attempts (of which there are 5 points, 1 or which is before installing Error Fixing), I get the same error as if I was trying to run Automatic Update in windows (0x80070002).&nbsp; Why is that, particularly when I run it on the restore
 point way back in January?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: Just tried a DISM.exe cleanup in the command prompt, but still getting a message when I try sfc /scannow that a action is still pending.</p>

</p><blockquote>
<p>I attempted to help a relative with her HP Pavillion with Windows 7, today, and noticed she hadn't done any Windows or Microsoft Updates since 2016.&nbsp; So after I got through helping her with something else, I attempted to run an automatic update, and it simply
 never loaded.&nbsp; So then I downloaded a Windows Updat automatic fixing program or something that diagnosed and fixed the error, and it seemed to have done the trick.&nbsp; She had 48 updates so I let them download and install.&nbsp; I was kind of surprised they seemed
 to have been successful, because the diagnostic said that an error was still present.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I got to the part where you're supposed to restart.&nbsp; So it restarts, but there is something wrong and it takes me to the boot windows normally or repair.&nbsp; So I decide to do the repair.&nbsp; It can't do the repair because of the error, so I try to to
 a system restore.&nbsp; All the restore points fail, so I try to run sfc /scannow, but that can't run because it says a repair is pending (and of course the repair can't finish, so it's useless).&nbsp; So then I try chkdsk and it says the drive is protected or something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since windows came with the computer, she doesn't have a restore disk or anything, but I doubt that would solve this, anyway.&nbsp; What in the world happened from just downloading what you think are updates to help your computer, but actually render it unusable,
 and how can I fix this?&nbsp; I've looked high and low, and there doesn't seem to be a way to fix this.&nbsp; Anyone have any work-arounds or fixes or tips or tricks?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel just awful that I was helping a older relative update her computer, and she gets it back completely broken.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When it came to the screen Normally or Repair, .... did you try NORMALLY ???</p>
<p>If it does not try SAFE MODE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To get into SAFE MODE.</p>
<p>Re boot the computer.</p>
<p>Immediately or after the first Beep Tap the F8 Key at 1 second intervals.</p>
<p>A selection screen appears.</p>
<p>Select SAFE MODE and see if it boots into SAFE MODE.</p>
<p>SAFE MODE can be used for&nbsp; trouble shooting / diagnosing issues.</p>
<p>SAFE MODE only loads essential executable modules and disables devices except for the ones that are necessary.</p>
<p>If this works i would them do a re-boot and see if it will then boot normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am suspecting that since it has not been updated since 2016 that there are some important updates missing such as SSU ( Servicing Stack Updates ) which were required and possibly some other important updates in relations to WINDOWS UPDATE for Win 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Without these Win 7 SSU Updates Windows update failed to function properly and sometimes not at all.</p>

<p>It does not boot properly in any mode.&nbsp; It simply loads a black screen.&nbsp; I can move a the cursor around, but there is nothing to click on.&nbsp; When I hit any button, it dims the screen.&nbsp; I then have to manually turn off the computer and start again.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Evaluation upgrade</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently evaluating Windows 10 for our office environment, I have an evaluation iso of Windows 10 x64 Enterprise and would like to attempt to perform an in-place upgrade keeping all applications, files and settings on a Windows 7 x64 Enterprise environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My downloaded iso, which I have checked matches up with the en-gb locale and is x64 tells me when I run it that I can only perform a clean install as the editions don't match up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to go from Win 7 Ent x64 to Win 10 Ent x64 Evaluation?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            No it is not sorry.
<br />You can't upgrade a licensed copy to an evaluation copy.
<br />You will need a full licensed copy of Windows 10 to upgrade to.

I would guess that the link that is just incorrect as the giveaway runs every month.&nbsp; If you want to verify you could go to the rewards page and scroll towards the bottom, click on Contact Microsoft Rewards Support.&nbsp; They should be able to confirm and/or resolve

<h2>            Issue with Start menu, clock and all the running programs in the small box after installing Windows Update</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Windows Update Issue</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the last 3 days I've started having what to me seems like a major issue. &nbsp;All of a sudden the clock and all the running programs in the small box are no longer there. &nbsp;Also the Start menu no longer pops up when you click on the Windows icon on the lower
 left of the screen. &nbsp;I'm not a wiz the computer, but I fiddled around finding a way to get onto my browser and did a search in the hopes to find help. &nbsp;I was actually searching for how to start the computer in safe mode with Windows 10, but came across a website,&nbsp;http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/has-your-windows-10-start-menu-stopped-working-here-are-four-ways-to-fix-it-11364000314532
 , that turned out to help fix the problem albeit I found only temporarily. &nbsp;I followed the instructions:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(28, 26, 26, 1)">Check and repair corrupt Windows files</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(28, 26, 26, 1)">1. Launch Task manager</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(28, 26, 26, 1)">Press the&nbsp;<strong>[Ctrl] + [Alt] + [Del]&nbsp;</strong>keys on the keyboard at the same time, or right click the Taskbar, and select&nbsp;<strong>Task manager</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(28, 26, 26, 1)">2. Run a new Windows task</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(28, 26, 26, 1)">When the&nbsp;<strong>Task manager</strong>&nbsp;window opens, click the&nbsp;<strong>More details</strong>&nbsp;option to expand it, then select&nbsp;<strong>Run&nbsp;</strong>new task from the&nbsp;<strong>File</strong>&nbsp;menu.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(28, 26, 26, 1)">3. Run Windows PowerShell</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(28, 26, 26, 1)">When the&nbsp;<strong>Run new task</strong>&nbsp;dialog box opens, type&nbsp;<strong>powershell</strong>, tick the box for<strong>Create this task with administrative privileges</strong>&nbsp;and click&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(28, 26, 26, 1)">4. Run the System File Checker</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(28, 26, 26, 1)">Type&nbsp;<strong>sfc /scannow</strong>&nbsp;into the window and press the [Return] key. The scan may take some time and will end with one of three results.&nbsp;<strong>Windows did not find any integrity violations</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Windows
 Resource Protection found corrupt files and repaired them</strong>&nbsp;mean there are now no corrupt files, but&nbsp;<strong>Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some (or all) of them</strong>indicates a problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(28, 26, 26, 1)">In this latter case, type (or copy and paste)<strong>&nbsp;DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth</strong>&nbsp;into the PowerShell window and press the<strong>&nbsp;[Return]</strong>&nbsp;key. This will download files from Windows Update to
 replace the corrupt ones and, again, this may take some time.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Unfortunately, or fortunately, no corrupt files were found.&nbsp; So I moved on to the next set of instructions to Reinstall all Windows Apps</strong></span><strong>:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(28, 26, 26, 1)">1. Reinstall Windows apps</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(28, 26, 26, 1)">Launch the Task manager and open a new PowerShell window with administrative privileges, as explained above.</span></p>

 + [V]</strong><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span>on the keyboard:</span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(28, 26, 26, 1)">Wait until the app download and installation process completes&nbsp;—&nbsp;ignore any red text that appears —&nbsp;and restart Windows</span></p>
<p>This fixed the problem, but only for a day as after the next Windows 10 Update I was back to having the same problem. &nbsp;I ended up following the same steps above that fixed the problem and then came straight here to hopefully find a fix that doesn't have
 me having to fix the issue by reinstalling the Apps after every Windows Update. Can someone please give me a way to fix this so I'm not needing to deal &nbsp;with this problem daily? &nbsp;Also remember I'm mostly a novice when it comes to dealing with computer issues
 so please put any help in terms or easy to follow instructions.</p>

            <p>I went through method 1 before realizing, and wondering, if I first needed to wait until the problem showed it itself again? &nbsp;Otherwise I'm not sure how it could troubleshoot or detect a problem that isn't there because I already temporarily fixed it. So
 for Method 1 I'm in waiting mode to try it the next time the issue shows up. </p>
<p>
</p><p>***I did notice when following the instructions for a Clean Boot in Step 5 of the link you gave me it wouldn't allow me to disable Avast Antivirus in the Task Manager Startup section. &nbsp;So I'm not sure how that's going to affect everything when I troubleshoot
 using method 1 the next time the problem pops up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for Method 2 I do already have my wife on this laptop with her own user account and when the problem pops up it's on both of our accounts. &nbsp;Still I did create a new user account just to be doubly sure and I'll check it if the problem happens again.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> ipaulie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 IRQL_Not_Less_Or_Equal</h2>
                    <p>Let me just start off by saying that I am not tech savvy, big words confuse me. I need my hand held when my computer doesn't act normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, lately I've been running into this problem where my computer randomly crashes, giving me the dreaded blue screen and the error message IRQL_not_less_or_equal. It's happened during various things, playing games like Smite, watching Netflix, and even internet
 browsing.</p>
<p>I can still boot the computer, and it seems to work normally besides it being extremely slow after rebooting from the crash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've run memory diagnostics as suggested on another similar question, and nothing was found.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also cannot perform an Automatic repair, as that requires the windows 8 disc. I don't own it and my computer doesn't have an optical disc drive.</p>
<p>I also cannot afford an external one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked under the Event viewer, and the event says the source is Kernel-Power and the description says "The system has rebooted without cleanly shutting down first. This error could be caused if the system stopped responding, crashed, or lost power unexpectedly."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having this problem with a Inspiron 7000 15 inch. It's running an intel core i5 processor and I haven't made any changes with the hardware, I've never taken it apart. I've had it for 3 months now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone please help me?</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
</strong></span><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>1. </strong>Navigate to the %systemroot%\Minidump folder.<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Copy any and all DMP files in the Minidump folder to your Desktop and then zip up these files.<br />
<br />
<strong>3. </strong>Upload the zip containing the .DMP files to Onedrive or a hosting site of your choice and paste in your reply. Prefered sites: Onedrive, Mediafire, Dropbox, etc. Nothing with wait-timers.<br />
<br />
<strong>4 (optional):</strong> The type of .DMP files located in the Minidump folder are known as Small Memory Dumps. In %systemroot% there will be what is known as a Kernel-Dump (if your system is set to generate). It is labeled MEMORY.DMP. The difference
 between Small Memory Dumps and Kernel-Dumps in the simplest definition is a Kernel-Dump contains
<em><strong>much </strong></em>more information at the time of the crash, therefore allowing further debugging of your issue. If your upload speed permits it, and you aren't going against any strict bandwidth and/or usage caps, etc, the Kernel-Dump is the best
 choice. Do note that Kernel-Dumps are <em><strong>much larger </strong></em>in size due to containing much more info, which is why I mentioned upload speed, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/skydrive/add-photos-files-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Upload photos and files to Onedrive.</a><br />
<br />
<strong>Please note that any "cleaner" programs such as TuneUp Utilities, CCleaner, etc, by default will delete .DMP files upon use.</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>1.</strong> Start &gt; type %systemroot% which should show the Windows folder, click on it. Once inside that folder, ensure there is a Minidump folder created. If not, CTRL-SHIFT-N to make a New Folder and name it Minidump.<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Performance &gt; Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; Ensure there's a check-mark for 'Automatically manage paging file size for all drives'.<br />
<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Startup and Recovery &gt; Settings &gt; System Failure &gt; ensure there is a check mark next to 'Write an event to the system log'.
<br />
<br />
Ensure Small Memory Dump is selected and ensure the path is %systemroot%\Minidump.<br />
<br />
<strong>4.</strong> Double check that the WERS is ENABLED:<br />
<br />
Start &gt; Search &gt; type services.msc &gt; Under the name tab, find Windows Error Reporting Service &gt; If the status of the service is not Started then right click it and select Start. Also ensure that under Startup Type it is set to Automatic rather than Manual.
 You can do this by right clicking it, selecting properties, and under General selecting startup type to 'Automatic', and then click Apply.
<br />
<br />
<br />

            <p>You did just great, thanks! Glad my instructions were clear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have two bug checks:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL (a)</strong></span><br />
<br />
<em>This indicates that Microsoft Windows or a kernel-mode driver accessed paged memory at DISPATCH_LEVEL or above.</em><br />
<br />
This bug check is issued if paged memory (or invalid memory) is accessed when the IRQL is too high. The error that generates this bug check usually occurs after the installation of a faulty device driver, system service, or BIOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL (d1)</strong></span><br />
<br />
<em>This indicates that a kernel-mode driver attempted to access pageable memory at a process IRQL that was too high.</em><br />
<br />
A driver tried to access an address that is pageable (or that is completely invalid) while the IRQL was too high. This bug check is usually caused by drivers that have used improper addresses.

<p>
</p><p><strong>Unfortunately, that's about all we have to go regarding information in these dumps. It's
</strong><em><strong>possible </strong></em><strong>this is hardware, but let's be sure by enabling Driver Verifier:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Driver Verifier:</strong></span></span><br />
<br />
<strong>What is Driver Verifier?</strong><br />
<br />
Driver Verifier is included in Windows 8/8.1, 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 to promote stability and reliability; you can use this tool to troubleshoot driver issues. Windows
 kernel-mode components can cause system corruption or system failures as a result of an improperly written driver, such as an earlier version of a Windows Driver Model (WDM) driver.
<br />
<br />
Essentially, if there's a 3rd party driver believed to be at issue, enabling Driver Verifier will help flush out the rogue driver if it detects a violation.<br />
<br />
<strong>Before enabling Driver Verifier, it is recommended to create a System Restore Point:</strong><br />
<br />
Vista - START | type rstrui - create a restore point<br />
Windows 7 - START | type create | select "Create a Restore Point" <br />
Windows 8 - <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html</a><br />
<br />
<strong>How to enable Driver Verifier:</strong><br />
<br />
Start &gt; type "verifier" without the quotes &gt; Select the following options -<br />
<br />
<strong>1.</strong> Select - "Create custom settings (for code developers)"<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Select - "Select individual settings from a full list"<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Check the following boxes -<br />
- Special Pool<br />
- Pool Tracking<br />
- Force IRQL Checking<br />
- Deadlock Detection<br />
- Security Checks (Windows 7 &amp; 8)<br />
- DDI compliance checking (Windows 8)<br />
- Miscellaneous Checks<br />
<strong>4.</strong> Select&nbsp; - "Select driver names from a list"<br />
<strong>5.</strong> Click on the "Provider" tab. This will sort all of the drivers by the provider.<br />
<strong>6.</strong> Check EVERY box that is <strong>NOT </strong>provided by Microsoft / Microsoft Corporation.<br />
<strong>7.</strong> Click on Finish.<br />
<strong>8.</strong> Restart.<br />
<br />
<br />
- If Driver Verifier finds a violation, the system will BSOD. To expand on this a bit more for the interested, specifically what Driver Verifier actually does is it looks for any driver making illegal function calls. When and/if this happens, system corruption
 occurs if allowed to continue. When Driver Verifier is enabled, it is monitoring
<em><strong>all </strong></em>3rd party drivers (as we have it set that way) and when it catches a driver attempting to do this, it will quickly flag that driver as being a troublemaker, and bring down the system safely before any corruption can occur.<br />
<br />
- After enabling Driver Verifier and restarting the system, depending on the culprit, if for example the driver is on start-up, you may not be able to get back into normal Windows because Driver Verifier will detect it in violation almost straight away, and
 as stated above, that will cause / force a BSOD.<br />
<br />
If this happens, do <strong>not</strong> panic, do the following:<br />
<br />
- Boot into Safe Mode by repeatedly tapping the F8 key during boot-up.<br />
<br />
- Once in Safe Mode - Start &gt; Search &gt; type "cmd" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- To turn off Driver Verifier, type in cmd "verifier /reset" without the quotes.<br />
・&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart and boot into normal Windows.<br />
<br />
If your OS became corrupt or you cannot boot into Windows after disabling verifier via Safe Mode:
<br />
<br />
- Boot into Safe Mode by repeatedly tapping the F8 key during boot-up.<br />
<br />
- Once in Safe Mode - Start &gt; type "system restore" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- Choose the restore point you created earlier.<br />
<br />

<strong>How long should I keep Driver Verifier enabled for?</strong><br />
<br />
I recommend keeping it enabled for at least 24 hours. If you don't BSOD by then, disable Driver Verifier. I will usually say whether or not I'd like for you to keep it enabled any longer.<br />
<br />
<strong>My system BSOD'd with Driver Verifier enabled, where can I find the crash dumps?</strong><br />
<br />
They will be located in %systemroot%\Minidump<br />
<br />
Any other questions can most likely be answered by this article:<br />

            <p>Hello, so sorry for the late reply!</p>
<p>I've had Driver Verifier on for a few days now, since I haven't bothered to turn it off, and my computer did not BSOD.</p>
<p>I decided to play a powerful game to see if that was triggering it or something, and though it never crashed, it kept doing these little lags and the sound distorted for about a second each time it happened, It almost felt like It was about to crash but
 never did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does this mean there's a problem with my hardware?</p>

            <p><em>Maybe</em>, but it's very hard to say without a crash dump. It may have just been a side effect of verifier, so let's disable verifier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ensure you have the latest video card drivers. If you are already on the latest video card drivers, uninstall and install a version or a few versions behind the latest to ensure it's not a latest driver only issue. If you have already experimented with the
 latest video card driver and many previous versions, please give the beta driver for your card a try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After doing so, please run Memtest for NO LESS than ~8 passes (several hours):</p>
<p>
</p><p>Memtest86+:<br />
<br />
<strong>Download Memtest86+ here:</strong><br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.memtest.org/</a><br />
<br />
<strong>Which should I download?</strong><br />
<br />
You can either download the pre-compiled ISO that you would burn to a CD and then boot from the CD, or you can download the auto-installer for the USB key. What this will do is format your USB drive, make it a bootable device, and then install the necessary
 files. Both do the same job, it's just up to you which you choose, or which you have available (whether it's CD or USB).<br />
<br />
Do note that some older generation motherboards do not support USB-based booting, therefore your only option is CD (or Floppy if you really wanted to).
<br />
<br />
<strong>How Memtest works:</strong><br />
<br />
Memtest86 writes a series of test patterns to most memory addresses, reads back the data written, and compares it for errors.<br />
<br />
The default pass does 9 different tests, varying in access patterns and test data. A tenth test, bit fade, is selectable from the menu. It writes all memory with zeroes, then sleeps for 90 minutes before checking to see if bits have changed (perhaps because
 of refresh problems). This is repeated with all ones for a total time of 3 hours per pass.<br />
<br />
Many chipsets can report RAM speeds and timings via SPD (Serial Presence Detect) or EPP (Enhanced Performance Profiles), and some even support changing the expected memory speed. If the expected memory speed is overclocked, Memtest86 can test that memory performance
 is error-free with these faster settings.<br />
<br />
Some hardware is able to report the "PAT status" (PAT: enabled or PAT: disabled). This is a reference to Intel Performance acceleration technology; there may be BIOS settings which affect this aspect of memory timing.<br />
<br />
This information, if available to the program, can be displayed via a menu option.<br />
<br />

<h3> coolandalsogood  say:</h3>
<h2>            100&#37; Packet Loss fixed by disabling uPnP</h2>
                    
<p>So I have been experiencing 100% packet loss issues for the past month or so. I can connect to live and everything works fine except for some multiplayer and Destiny, which I cannot even log into. I discovered that by disabling uPnP on my router I was able
 to get packet loss back to 0% and play all of my games fine. However due to a home automation system it is unrealistic to leave uPnP disabled.</p>
<p>I have tried everything from changing power settings, port forwarding, and DMZ but nothing has worked. A simple setting on the xbox that would allow us to turn off uPnP would fix this problem, but unfortunately we have not been gifted with such a thing.
 So I am here to ask for any suggestions/solutions that anyone has come across. I am knowledgeable with home networking an am using a Luxul XBR- 4400 router with the latest firmware.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Did you make any software or hardware changes prior to the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1 Run system file checker to check the integrity of system files.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes this kind of unexpected behavior shown by Windows due to some missing or corrupt important system files. I would suggest you to rum Microsoft Safety Scanner SFC /SCANNOW to scan the system integration and fix system file corruption (if any).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The sfc /scannow (System File Checker) command scans all protected system files, and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files.</p>

            Hey Prof.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Default Mail app only works (if at all) with Windows 10 Mail app or Office Outlook.
<br />
<br />Try adding your Gmail to the Windows 10 Mail app.  Mail app is quite good with a large Inbox you can merge all of your Mail Accounts into (or keep them separate), and a huge ad-free Reading pane that makes it compelling.  See here how to set it up:  <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/how-get-started-mail-app-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowscentral.com/how-get-started-...</a>
<br />
<br />Then it should appear to choose as Default and should work to send Mail from even if you want to keep using your other mail app for day-to-day  reading of mail.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi  Jacqueline, you may be in Tablet Mode . . .
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + A
<br />On the Resulting Flyout, if you cannot see the Tablet Mode Button, click 'Expand'
<br />If the Tablet Mode Button is not gray, click it so it becomes gray
<br />This will turn off tablet mode

                    <p>
</p><p>Dont tell me to install drivers cause it was all working fine thus the issue is with the windows 10 installation. I believe you guys need to find a workable solution without the users suffering. Im unable to play PES2015 and I am a very unhappy person with
 Windows 10 without any solution being offered. Many thanks,<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/85c1b372-1dc2-44eb-a652-aa9f217a353b" /></p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community Forum. I appreciate your effort towards resolving the issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1.Did you make any significant hardware or software changes to the computer prior to this issue?<br />
Out of these two graphic cards ( nVidia and Intel), which one is the default graphic card?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2.Have you recently added this additional graphics card?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This problem can appear if the video card is not installed properly in the PCI slot and as a result the card is not detected in device manager. Check the physical
 connections again, reinsert the card properly in the PCI slot and then install the drivers from the manufacturer’s website.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the video card is installed properly in Video card but still the problem persists, let’s try these methods below and check if that solves the problem.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Sometimes, some devices in device manager are hidden due to corrupt or missing drivers.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Follow the steps below to show hidden devices in the device manager and troubleshoot accordingly.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1.Press the Windows key + X</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2.Select Command Prompt (Admin)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3.Type set devmgr_show_nonpresent_devices=1 and hit enter</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4.Type Start DEVMGMT.MSC and hit enter.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5.Once in Device Manager hit the View<span>&nbsp;
</span>menu and select show hidden devices.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>From here, remove each instance of the Nvidia card you see as well as each unknown device. Exit Device Manager and reinstall the latest drivers you can find for your
 graphics card.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>http://www.nvidia.in/object/product_geforce_310m_in.html</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If methods suggested above does not help, I would recommend you to contact computer manufacturer to get chipset, BIOS, graphics card, drivers installed properly.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Also check with graphic card support site or refer the manual regarding the changes to make on the BIOS.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>BIOS Disclaimer:Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from
 booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Kindly get back to us with the information and results to assist you better.</span></span></p>

<br />
<br />3. Find the “Turn off Power Throttling” policy on the right panel and double-click on it to open it.
<br />
<br />3. In the policy properties window, select the radio option “Enable” and then click on the “OK” button to save the changes.
<br />
<br />Restart windows.
<br />
<br />

headphones use OMTP standard for 3.5mm audio jacks but Xbox One uses the CTIA

    <title>Skype hangs up call from one account but no another - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> c hanmer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype hangs up call from one account but no another</h2>
                    Recent Skype calls e.g. to echo test&nbsp; start to ring but instead of answering it hangs up immediately. This happens both from windows 10 laptop running Skype 12.1807.264.0 and from my android phone, and on two different wireless systems. I created a new
 Skype account and this works absolutely fine for test calls from both phone and computer. What could be wrong that calls from the original account are not connecting? It can't be the software, hardware or the internet connection as these are the same for the
 account that hangs up and the account that works fine. I tried settings -app- reset and rebooting a few times and that made no difference.

            As I explained in my original post, the account does&nbsp; not work with 2 different wireless internet connections WHILE MY NEW ACCOUNT WORKS FINE so I can't see how an two different internet connections which work fine for one account would cause a problem

                    <p>Hi There,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you please advise if Skype, in Australia, use an ARN or ABN to remit GST to the Australian Taxation Department.&nbsp; Please advise what this number is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see that you charge GST but I'm unaware if you do it via ARN or ABN.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have an ARN, in Australia we are unable to claim the tax credit.&nbsp; The process would be to provide you with our ABN and tax status so that you do not charge us GST.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have an ABN we can claim the GST.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you please confirm.</p>

<h2>            Missing Bluetooth service on windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello<br />
I recently upgraded from <strong>windows 7 professional to windows 10 (64 bit).</strong> Before the upgrade i was able to use my laptop speakers and microphones as Bluetooth hands-free during a phone call.<br />
<br />
Now I can no longer do that because the option to connect or use PC as hands free setting is missing from from the Bluetooth control panel. &nbsp;I am only able to music from my mobile but not phone calls.<br />
<br />
I have <strong>hp 250 G4 notebook Broadcom 43142 Bluetooth 4.0 adapter.</strong><br />
<br />
I have tried updating Bluetooth drivers and windows said i have the best ones installed.<br />
I checked to see if the hands free service is enabled on my device and it is.<br />
I realize that when i right click on the speaker icon on the task bar and selecting recording device it says headset microphone Bluetooth hands-free audio is disconnected. I checked its properties and it says use this device (enable) I am not sure if this is
 significant but can someone please help me?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>Hi Oshane,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the added information, I suggest that you check if the settings in your phone which allows the above feature to execute is enabled. To know about the settings related to the same, kindly contact the manufacturer of the device or refer to the user
 manual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I suggest that you uninstall the Bluetooth and re-install the latest available for Windows 10.&nbsp;&nbsp;To do so, refer to the article provided below which outlines the procedure in detail</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_devices/how-to-install-and-update-drivers-in-windows-10/a97bbbd1-9973-4d66-9a5b-291300006293">How to: Install and Update drivers in Windows
