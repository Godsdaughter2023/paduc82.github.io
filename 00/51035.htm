<h2>            How can I change my Microsoft accounts secret answer&#63;</h2>
                    I have searched so many different forums and the information was either outdated or their wasn't any at all. &nbsp;I did figure out however that there is supposed to be a change security question option on my Windows live security and privacy manager, but I
 don't have that. &nbsp;Supposedly it is below close Microsoft account, but there's nothing there. &nbsp;I started my Microsoft account on my brothers xbox 360 and got a new gamming PC for my birthday with windows 8.1, &nbsp;and on the xbox I didn't really use it much so
 I came up with a secret answer on the fly and now I want to set it up more efficient and secure secret answer but I cant figure out how.

<h2>            Verify that the burner is connected properly and that the disc is clean and not damaged while burning a blank audio cd</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Cannot burn from a burn list</p>
<p>I'm trying to burn from a burn list onto a blank&nbsp;audio CD and Media Player&nbsp;appears to race through the task in seconds before giving the message that it detected a problem, suggesting that&nbsp;I should&nbsp;"Verify that the burner is connected properly and that the
 disc is clean and not damaged." The disks are brand new and this has happened with 2 of them. The screen suggests all burns are 'completed', but when I try to play the disk on my normal music system the disk cannot be detected, so clearly there is no music
 on it.Any ideas?</p>

            <div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would suggest you to perform the following methods and check if it helps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1</strong></div>
<div>For connecting the CD/DVD burner to your computer, you may follow these steps.</div>
<div>A. If you are using an external CD/DVD burner, connect the CD/DVD burner to the computer.</div>
<div>B. Plug in the power cab and check if the power light is on.</div>
<div>C. Install the burning software. Insert the CD, a program will pop up and guide you through the installation process. Generally it will let you name your drive, tell you when to connect your external CD/DVD burner to your computer via usb, and update the
 software for your external CD/DVD burner.</div>
<div>D. Then check if you are able to burn CD/DVDs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2</strong></div>
<div>You may follow these troubleshooting steps and check if it helps.</div>
<div>A. Try to burn a CD in Windows Explorer and check if it works.<br />
Burn a CD or DVD in Windows Explorer</div>
<div>B. You may also run the ‘Playing and Burning CDs, DVDs, and Blu‑ray Discs troubleshooter’ which checks for common issues, such as what kind of disc you've inserted in your disc drive and whether the drive supports playing or burning content to a disc.<br />

<h2>            Random Resets after Fall Update</h2>
                    <p>This was a problem my old computer had too. I've had a couple of random resets. these aren't automatic updates that are forcing a reset or anything, the computer is just crashing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had this exact same problem on my old computer, and the constant resets did a lot of damage before I finally had to replace the thing. However, with this new computer, I didn't have this problem at all. I don't know if it's because its a fairly new model
 or what, but I've had no bugs or issues with Windows 10. Until I got that Fall update. And now I'm having problem again. I'd rather not have to lose this computer too just because that update was broken.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any solution to these random crashes other than just waiting for another update? And when they bring out another major update, is there any way to block it indefinitely? Or at least a few months, until they work out the kinks?</p>

                    i just set up a child account for my son on Windows 10. The web browsing safeguards and notification all well and good but when he logs in theres an open invite to him to create an email using the mail client in the apps menu. He’s too young to have one
 and i don’t want him tempted, can I hide or disable this option? Thanks&nbsp;

            Hi Andrew,
<br />
<br />Do you want to disable the mail app totally on that PC for everyone?
<br />
<br />Of so, right click your Start Button, choose Powershell (admin)
<br />
<br />Paste this command into Powershell and hit Enter:
<br />
<br />Get-AppxPackage *windowscommunicationsapps* | Remove-AppxPackage
<br />
<br />When that completes, close Powershell
<br />
<br />That's It - Mail gone!       
        </p>

    <title>Close Other Apps. It looks like another app is using a camera already. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sergiocali corleo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Close Other Apps. It looks like another app is using a camera already. If you need it, here&#8217;s the error code&#58; 0xA00F4243&#40;0xC00D3704&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have finally worked out why my windows 10 camera app suddenly does not work any more despite Windows Hello and my Logitech Brio webcam working perfectly fine.</p>
<p>It has NOTHING to do with another program locking the webcam device I checked using Microsoft Sysinternals&nbsp; process explorer confirming my device was not in use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the root cause was upgrading the ASMedia USB Controllers</p>
<p>
</p><p>The default versions Windows 10 installs are the ones below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>ASMedia USB 3.0 extensible Host Controller - 1.0&nbsp; &nbsp;(Driver Version&nbsp; &nbsp;1.16.38.1)</p>
<p>ASMedia USB 3.1 extensible Host Controller - 1.10&nbsp;(Driver Version 10.0.16299.15)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reinstalled windows 10 and tested windows Camera App and it worked fine with the Brio webcam&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>as soon as I updated device drivers for the USB controllers using device manager windows updates the drivers and breaks the Camera app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure if this will be the same for other systems and webcams but it is something worth checking if you have the same problem</p>
<p>
</p><p>good luck</p>

<p>I have the same problem. Also ASMedia USB 3.1. I have tried multiple driver versions, but i cannot get the Windows Camera App to use my camera. Always says it's in use by another application.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I plug my BRIO in to a USB 2.0 port, it works fine, but only gives me the lower resolutions (not acceptable), and if I plug it in to one of my Intel USB 3.0 ports, the camera app DOES work, and allows "4k/30fps" but the image looks horrid. When plugged
 in to the USB 3.0 ports, it doesn't matter what resolution I use, the image looks noisy and grainy like an upscaled low res image.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Strangely, the BRIO does work within the Logitech Camera configuration application when plugged in to the ASMedia 3.1 port, and the picture looks amazing! Crystal clear!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I am so frustrated with this, as Logitech says it's Microsoft's problem, and Microsoft says it's Logitech's problem.&nbsp;<br />
Other apps like OBS and XSplit DO show me images when plugged in to the ASMedia USB 3.1 ports, but they crash when I try to set the resolution to 3840x2160. Only a very select few resolution settings work without crashing the apps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I plug the cam in to the Intel USB 3.0 port, all resolutions work in both OBS and XSplit, but again, the image looks absolutely horrid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I KNOW I'm not the only one having this issue. I have tried a multitude of things to fix it, but absolutely nothing works. Deleting the USB drivers and reverting to default windows ones (v10.0.16299.15 and v1.16.26.1 - I think. Close to this number anyway)
 made absolutely no difference.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even tried re-installing the default drivers from my motherboard manufacturers website (Asrock - X99 Taichi- v1.16.35.1 and 10.0.16299.15) but again, no difference what so ever.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I've even tried updating to the latest driver (v1.16.48.1) but same issue. I really wish someone could help with this issue. Why are OBS and XSplit and the Logitech app able to use my camera on this port with crystal clear image, but the Windows Camera App
 can't? Why do OBS and XSplit crash when I change the resolution to 3840x2160 or other resolutions?<br />
<br />
<br />
Please Microsoft... Help us. I'm 100% certain this has to do with the Anniversary/Creators/Autumn Update. I paid $240 for this webcam, and it's essentially a useless lump at present. I don't care about Hello for login, all I want is to be able to record 4k
 video in the camera app, and do timelapses. If by some miracle your fix stops OBS from crashing, that would be great, but not the biggest worry to me.&nbsp;<br />

<p>Hi dondalinger, </p>
<p>
</p><p>did you try a clean win 10 build to see if that resolves the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>i had tried uninstalling and re installing drivers before and it did not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you can do is take an image of your current build (win 7 backup) and reinstall Windows 10 and plug in your external devices one by one and let windows find the right drivers for each device. The Brio was the only external device i had plugged in during
 the OS installation to get windows hello configured and working during the build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the first thing i checked after compleating the build and updates was the windows camara app and it worked. Added all the other external devices and installed their drivers also ok. It was only when i upgraded the Asmedia controllers that it broke.</p>
<p>To roll it back i did not just uninstall the drivers but uninstalled the devices completely and &nbsp;let windows rinstall them with the default drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I repeated the process twice to make sure it is a stable solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i’m not sure if the hardware configuration is also part of the underlying problem. And it could be the case that this is not an universal solution. But after months of not being able to use the Brio to record video it is progress and a clue to the underlying
 cause.</p>
<p>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
It is a possibility that one of the installed application is causing the conflict.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1.</strong></div>
<div>We can check by placing the computer in clean start up to find that application. For more information about clean start up refer to the article below:<br />
<strong>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</strong><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2.</strong></div>
<div>We may also find the defaulty module causing this issue by looking the logs in event viewer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Type eventvwr.msc /s</strong> in the address bar.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; List any events that are listed as "Error" in the main window when you go to "Windows Logs" and "Application." There are often a lot of them. Send us whichever ones you see listed for the last couple days. (Please also do for the logs in "System"). When
 you do, provide us the name of the "Source" and whatever is listed in the description box below the list of logs when you click on one.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>For more information about event viewer refer to the artcles below:<br />
<strong>Open Event Viewer</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-Event-Viewer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-Event-Viewer</a></div>
<div><strong>What information appears in event logs (Event Viewer)?<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-information-appears-in-event-logs-Event-Viewer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-information-appears-in-event-logs-Event-Viewer</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope this helps.</div>

<h2>            Constant Disconnect from party chat. 0x8923401C</h2>
                    <p>For a while now I have been experiencing an issue where I can't connect to my friends party chat without disconnecting. The same is true of when they try to join me (especially one friend in particular). This is usually accompanied by a message that says my network setting are blocking party chat (I have been over all of it several times and checked&nbsp; many different settings. I could find nothing wrong) and an error code "0x8923401C" Please can someone help me. This has been going on intermittently for over a year now, but has gotten severe lately.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Nova,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using the Windows operating system, the .NET Framework may already be installed on your computer. Specifically, the .NET Framework 4.5 is included with Windows 8 and installed on your computer with the Windows 8 operating system. Similarly, the
 .NET Framework 4.5.1 is included with Windows 8.1.<br />
<br />
There is no download for the .NET Framework 3.5 for Windows 8 or Windows 8.1. You must enable the .NET Framework 3.5 in Control Panel.<br />
<br />
If you are trying to enable .NET Frame work from control panel and if you are getting the error message, then I would suggest you to try the steps from the following link:<br />
<br />
Installing the .NET Framework 3.5 on Windows 8 or 8.1</p>
<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh506443%28v=vs.110%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh506443%28v=vs.110%29.aspx</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please follow the steps below to enable .NET frame work 3.5 from Control panel:</p>
<ul>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong>, choose <strong>Program and Features.</strong></li><li>Click on <strong>Turn on Windows Features on or off</strong>.</li><li>Check if .NET Framework (includes .NET 2.0 and 3.0) is enabled.</li></ul>
<p>Hope this helps. Let us know if you have any other issues with Windows in future.

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you would like to make changes in the screen as shown in the screenshot. For this, you may want to check with the display driver's manufacturer for this specific setting since unfortunately, Windows does not have this setting in-built.
 Windows operating system does give you interface that you can personalize it according to your requirement using 3rd party utilities.
</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 keeps downloading when I don&#39;t want it</h2>
                    I initially tried to download Windows 10 and my cursor kept disappearing or freezing. Returned my PC to factory settings. Now Windows 10 keeps trying to download every time I start my computer. I even went as far as turning of the automatic updates and
 update checking. It still starts the download no matter what I turn off!!! Any ideas on how to get it to stop?

</p><p>I ran the Norton &amp; McAfee removal tools yesterday and the Microsoft Update Troubleshooter today. &nbsp;It claimed to have fixed several issues however when the Update ran shortly afterwards it told me again that it had been unable to install the update and that
 it was rolling back to the previous state.</p>
<p>There is obviously and ongoing source of corruption within the Update System if the Troubleshooter Fixes the matter but the Updater can't work because it's become corrupted again.</p>

<p>
</p><p>There appears to be a problem within Windows 10 which is obviously not resolved by making changes to the Windows Update System. &nbsp;When the Update System is supposedly repaired by whatever method is used it then becomes corrupted again before updates can actually
 be installed. &nbsp;WHY IS THIS HAPPENING? &nbsp; AND WHY IS IT TAKING AS LONG TO FIX? &nbsp; &nbsp;PERHAPS SOMEONE WHO KNOWS WHATS GOING ON COULD ADVISE EVERYONE WHO CONTINUES TO EXPERIENCE PROBLEMS HOW TO FIX THINGS SO THAT THEIR PC'S WORK AS INTENDED.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>I have just tried some of the fixes again including Renaming Windows Update Folders. &nbsp; This appeared to be going well until Windows restarted twice. &nbsp;Thereafter it appeared to be installing the Net Framework &amp; KB4022715 Updates however after several minutes
 it reverted to not being able to complete the updates and rolling things back to where they were when it started.</p>
<p>This is proving to be a complete waste of time and effort on my part as nothing has been achieved over several hours of reading comments on various websites, trying supposed solutions none of which have worked and no one has come up with a resolution to
 all the problems a lot of Windows 10 users are experiencing and, like me, are likely to be thoroughly fed up with Windows 10 and the constant Upgrading then not Upgrading regime that now exists for a lot of Windows 10 users.</p>
<p>I can understand why a lot of people move to Linux or Apple systems as they don't appear to have problems like this with their installations.</p>
<p>It's about time Microsoft took responsibility for these problems and actively did something about sorting them out once and for all.</p>
<p>I am totally fed up with this whole Update Fiasco and will stop using this Windows 10 machine until such time as I hear about or receive some indication that this matter has &nbsp;been fixed.</p>
<p>It would on reflection have been better to remain on Windows 7 at least it appeared to work without major problems affecting its day to day use.</p>

<div>It was not legitimate, and your details *are* now unsafe. You have</div>
<div>been scammed. My recommendation to do both the following immediately:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Reinstall Windows cleanly. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>2. Change your e-mail password and any other user-ids and passwords</div>
<div>(banking, credit cards, Amazon.com, etc.) that you use on the</div>

<p>I received some&nbsp;Winzip pictures files. I downloaded them onto my desktop. When I clicked on one of them, another window opened up asking me to choose the supporting program to open up the Winzip file. By&nbsp;clicking on Windows Media Center I seemed to have
 caused (virus) spread of Windows Media Center icon all over my computer. Every icon on my desktop and in my list of programs has been changed to Windows Media Center and anything I open (other than Internet Explorer) opens in Window Media Center. And that
 is where all end.</p>
<p>I'm using Windows Vista. Please help!</p>

            No, you have no virus invasion. Not that serious.<br />
<br />
You just messed up the exe file associations, that's all.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I suspect that anything that involves importing to the registry by use of regedit.exe is just going to start media center again. If that is the case, there are instructions to get around this problem here...</p>

<h2>            Wireless Network Problem - Connection okay but no Internet Access</h2>
                    
<p>Hi Folks,</p>
<p>I'm new here, so apologies if this is in the wrong place! (or someone has already answered the same question, but I did search for similar items and couldn't find an answer)</p>
<p>I have a Samsung R590 Laptop running Windows 7 which has been brilliant for the last 6 months, and I use BT for my ISP with a Home Hub 2.0 which again has been brilliant since it was installed in November.</p>
<p>My wife and kids each have their own laptops, all running Windows Vista and are not having any problems at all connecting to the internet.</p>
<p>Last Friday, I switched my laptop on and it connected quite happily to the network via a wireless connection but was unable to connect to the internet - I can connect to the other laptops in the house (and transfer data to/from them) and to the network printer
 (and print to it) but I cannot get an internet connection via wireless.</p>
<p>If I plug in a network cable, evereything works fine.</p>
<p>I have tried all the usual methods to restore the connection, restarting the router, updating the device drivers on the laptop, deleting the wireless card from the laptop and re-installing it. I know that there's nothing wrong with the internet connection
 as the Vista laptops all work fine.</p>
<p>I have searched the internet and found lots of people posting similar problems, but no one seems to be able to come up with a fix (or if they have I haven't seen it)</p>
<p>In case it helps... The R590 uses a Broadcom Wireless Card, and the diagnostic test result is as follows:</p>
<p>"The wireless router/AP for your network is working, but your computer is not able to use an IP address to connect to the Internet. You will not be able to connect to the Internet, although you might be able to connect to your local network. Contact your
 network administrator or wireless router/AP installer for assistance."</p>
<p>It's not like I don't have a clue what I'm doing as I worked in ICT as a Project Manager for years, and now I teach ICT in a secondary school so I'm used to working with computers, but this has beaten me (for the moment at least!) so any suggestions would
 be gratefully received!</p>

            <p>Hello MrC_TheTeacher,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check that the "Default Gateway" setting (which is the IP Number of your router) is set correctly on your machine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have been using a wired connection but then want to connect wirelessly&nbsp;remove the wire (ethernet cable),&nbsp;and&nbsp;reboot before attempting to use the wireless connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check that the wireless Security Key set on your computer&nbsp;is the same as that currently set on your router.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check that the wireless security which is&nbsp;set on your router is compatible with your computer. Routers are now usually set to "WPA2"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you tried a different web browser?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this will assist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            winscomrssv.dll error at startup</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I just started up my laptop, and I've had this laptop for about 8-9 months now. Today was the first time I received this error at startup, and I tried to reboot to see maybe if that would fix the issue, but no luck there either. Has anyone else had this
 issue and is there a solution for this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried a quick google search, but literally only 1 result came up that wasn't even very helpful.</p>

            Hi Mushy J
<br />
<br />That is definitely left over from some malware that has been removed from your PC, the dll is not recognized library, there must be some reference to that in your Startup processes - you need to remove that 
<br />
<br />Task Manager and indeed Msconfig offer only limited control over Startup items . . . 
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download a small free utility that does not require installation 
<br />
<br />When the file downloads, unzip it. 
<br />
<br />Depending on your system, run Autoruns or Autoruns64 as Administrator 
<br />
<br />With that utility, on the initial list and on the Logon Tab, look for any reference to winscomrssrv.dll, then right click and delete that reference . ..

<h2>            After installing update KB3201845, Windows Start menu and default Windows apps don&#39;t launch anymore</h2>
                    <p>After installing KB320145 I cannot open the Start menu anymore. It appears that all standard Windows apps like OneNote, Edge, System settings, that I had pinned at the taskbar will not launch too. &nbsp;Fortunately all other apps and programs still work fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already restored my system two times and then installed KB3201845 again with the same result.</p>
<p>As far as I understand KB3201845 was aimed to repair a WIFI issue. Ironically my desktop PC does not have WIFI. So, this update, that my PC did not need, broke it. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for answering so quickly. I've decided to disable the automatic updates and wait for next patch thuesday that will be within three days from now. Hopely installing then first KB3201845 and thereafter the patchupdates will make a difference
 and let all apps neathly working again. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this not works I will try your methods to see if they cure the problems. Anyway I will let you know how this works out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I know that disabling the automatic updates for a long time is not recommanded but I think a few days will not cause much harm. &nbsp;</p>

            I'm experiencing the same freaking issue which frustrated me so much, I'd take back all the compliment I had for Windows 10 previously. Worst still it affects my productivity alot (can you imagine a Windows without Start menu requires me to find everything
 manually from Window Explorer).<br />
<br />
And I'm pretty sure this bug comes in before&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">KB3201845, I have developer mode turned on (but not the beta channel), ... I had MS Visual Studio 12.0 and 14.0 installed, and I noticed the problem comes after
 that, what about you?</span><br />

            <p>OK, this morning I installed KB3206632. The installation went smoothly and after that the login screen was presented. However, after typing my password the circling balls started and they never stopped. After half an hour I decided to reboot my PC and now,
 after typing my password, my desktop appeared and I was able to start programs. (I remember now that this happened the same way with KB3201845).</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, again, the start menu does not react on clicking and all windows apps like Search, Store, OneDrive, Edge, System Settings, that are pinned at the taskbar opens shortly and close than inmediately.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>As the search app also does not work I cannot even run a command prompt to give your fixes a try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the main problem is that logging in after the updates results in a system hangup. Hopely this is a known problem and can be fixed. If not, I will disable the automatic updating again and have to wait for the Redstone 2 update that is expected to be available
 in early march 2017 and hopely will install an entire new system without these flaws.</p>

            <p>This morning I manually installed cumulative update KB3213522 and hoped that it would repair the problems. The login went without any problems so I was hopeful that the problems were fixed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However also this one left me with a Start&nbsp;that not responded to my left mouse clicks. So the Start Menu does not show and as a result I cannot run any System app, also including the Settings app. The System apps that I have pinnend on my task bar open very
 shortly and close immediately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This all started with KB3201845 and&nbsp;searching the Internet I&nbsp;learned that lots of people are suffering from the same problem. Also the fact that 17 people&nbsp;reacted on my initial post&nbsp;having this same problem tells me that this is a&nbsp;problem with the update
 mechanism and Miscrosoft should investigate this seriously and come up with a solution!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to be able to use my PC without a problem I restored the situation as it was before KB3201845 and disabled the automatic updates again. So, no more&nbsp;updates for me, I will wait for the big Redstone 2 update in march that hopefully will install a
 complete new Windows 10 without this flaws on my system. </p>

<h2>            Steps to uninstall Windows 10 and go back to Windows 7 due to hardware incompatibility</h2>
                    Upgraded to Windows 10 a couple of weeks ago and I like it. Unfortunately, my Toshiba Satellite Laptop L755-S5216 is apparently not compatible and Audio glitches, gaps &amp; buzz issues during playback are a constant. I would like to uninstall Windows 10 and
 go back to Windows 7 until I can upgrade my PC. I just want to be sure I do it right. I am backing up my files to an external hard drive, now... Thank you.

            <p>Hello Blue,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you search Toshiba's support website for an updated driver for your sound card?</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://support.toshiba.com/support/modelHome?freeText=3025152" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.toshiba.com/support/modelHome?freeText=3025152</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you try reinstalling the sound card driver?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Here is a link to a Microsoft page explaining how to go back to Windows 7.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>If you need further help, feel free to ask.&nbsp; I'll be happy to assist you.</p>

            <p>I followed the link and instructions but my OS did not return to Windows 7. It installed Windows 10 and I still have the sound glitch during video/audio playback. I've uninstalled/reinstalled/updated the audio device drivers. What else can I try?</p>

            <p>Look to see if the Windows.old folder is still on your C: drive.&nbsp; Open File explorer and navigate to your C: drive and click&nbsp;to expand&nbsp;it.&nbsp; Do you see the Windows.old folder there?&nbsp; This folder is automatically deleted after 30 days or it might disappear
 sooner if you have used Disk Cleanup.&nbsp; This folder has to exist in order to go back to your previous version.&nbsp; Could you have installed the upgrade more than a couple weeks ago?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There is something else you can try.&nbsp; Install the existing driver in Compatibility mode.&nbsp; Here is more information about Compatibility Mode.&nbsp; Mr. Da Costa's Wiki Article contains good information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_devices/how-to-install-and-update-drivers-in-windows-10/a97bbbd1-9973-4d66-9a5b-291300006293">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_devices/how-to-install-and-update-drivers-in-windows-10/a97bbbd1-9973-4d66-9a5b-291300006293</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I would attempt installing the driver in Compatibility Mode first.&nbsp; I would take the most recent soundcard driver. Download it to your computer.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Run the Hardware and Sound Troubleshooters.&nbsp;&nbsp;Right Click on Start &gt; Control Panel &gt; Troubleshooting.&nbsp; In the Hardware and Sound category, run the first 4 troubleshooters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Also, System File Checker might find some corrupt files that cause issues with sound.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right Click on the Start button, then click on Command Prompt (Admin).<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Type sfc /scannow and click Enter.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restart your computer when the scan finishes.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Try this link, too.&nbsp; Other Toshiba users might have the same sound problems as you.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://forums.toshiba.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forums.toshiba.com/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Your other option is to use your Windows 7 media and your Windows 7 product key and reinstall Windows 7. Ask if you need help.</p>
