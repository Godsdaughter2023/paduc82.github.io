<br />
1. Do you get any error message?<br />
2. What is the make and model of the phone?<br />

<h2>            Surface Pro 4 - No Start Menu, Search, Cortana, Edge</h2>
                    <p>I have a surface pro 4 and recently did a totally clean re-installation for Windows 10.. Machine is just over 12 months old.. and all of the below items don't work:</p>
<p>
</p><p>* Start menu inaccessible</p>
<p>* Search bar doesn't do anything</p>
<p>* Cortana doesn't work</p>
<p>* Microsoft edge doesn't work (took me half a day to finally connect to a working browser through cmd accessing old iexplorer.. Edge shows problem of file system error "-2147219196")</p>
<p>* Can't access windows update "package not registered"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have tried all the below commonly listed solutions:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">* sfc / scannow</p>
<p class="contentStandard">*&nbsp;Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}</p>
<p class="contentStandard">* reinstalling device drivers</p>
<p class="contentStandard">* DISM cleanup / restore</p>
<p class="contentStandard">* re-installing windows 3x..</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Very frustrated - Windows 98 was better than this.. at least the start button worked.. and computers lasted for more than 12 months. Glad I paid 1K for useless piece of junk from microsoft.</p>

</p><p>Try starting Narrator&nbsp; (Win+Ctrl+Enter). &nbsp; Maybe it can "see" those things and tell you about them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not as crazy as it sounds.&nbsp; I know of two cases where it was necessary.&nbsp; First, there once was a case in an early preview in which the XAML was not being rendered on the Display but was being detected by Narrator.&nbsp; Eventually by being able to navigate
 blindly through the UI with Narrator's help the UI remarkably started appearing the way it was expected to.&nbsp; More commonly, the symptom can depend on what else you have visible on your Taskbar.&nbsp; Since these details are rarely revealed by the poster I can just
 assume for the purpose of the hypothesis that they aren't there.&nbsp; Then we can assume that the user is seeing their monitor being treated as a secondary with the missing elements being rendered off screen on the (possibly phantom) primary.&nbsp; In that case, you
 would be guessing that the Display configuration was set to Extend.&nbsp; Then using the Project dialog to switch to Duplicate could make the missing elements appear.&nbsp; So, try pressing Win+P, CursorUp, Enter.</p>

 this action.”</p>

            Running the diagnostic did nothing. Said computer was fine which is obviously not the case given that such critical functions like start menu, update, and setting are not working nor accessible

<h2>            Windows 10 1703 problem&#63; HDMI&#47;DVI monitor not available on 1703 system, but works on 1607 system</h2>
                    My Dell SE198WFP monitor, which I previously occasionally connected to my Asus Zenbook UX305CA Signature Edition via micro HDMI to DVI, fails to show up.&nbsp; The Zenbook is Windows 10 64 bit 1703.&nbsp; My old HP Netbook, Windows 10 Pro 32 bit 1607, still can
 connect HDMI to DVI, so I suspect something ugly happened in the 1703 update on the Zenbook.&nbsp; How can I get my Asus Zenbook to detect the Dell SE198WFP Monitor Driver?

<p>Hi, Joan Pin and anyone else who read about my problem --&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem solved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know exactly why, but I do know exactly how.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a Windows 10 Display panel setting that has a button to Detect an external monitor.&nbsp; Needless to say, no amount of fiddling enabled that to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, I discovered, there is an Intel HD Graphics Control Panel that also has a Detect button.&nbsp; And it works!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Intel HD Graphics Control Panel does not appear in the Windows Start menu, nor does it appear in the settings.&nbsp; It does however appear as a right mouse click context menu from the Desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know why the Windows 10 Display setting Detect button didn't do what the Intel HD Graphics Control Panel successfully accomplished -- looks to me like a missing feature or perhaps a bug in Windows 10.&nbsp; That's enough puzzling for me, for now.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I now have access to my occasionally used external Dell monitor.</p>

<h2>            Stuck on blue screen with rotating white dots for hours</h2>
                    <p>I have an Alienware Alpha and a couple of days ago, I started having this problem that whenever the PC was restarted or turned off, upon turning back on and after the computer booted Windows back up, I would be stuck at this blue screen with rotating white
 dots in the center. The only way out of it was pressing ctrl+alt+del and that brought me to the login screen but there was no field for the password or anything, just the icons for internet, accessibility and power in the bottom right hand corner.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I scanned other articles online and the consensus was that it was a problem with a cumulative update released by Windows and that the way to fix it was to let it sit for a few hours until it lets you log in, and then disable fast boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it still doesn't work. It still makes me sit at the blue screen with the rotating dots for at LEAST 2 hours before it lets me log in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know how to fix this and it is super frustrating because I haven't been able to use my PC for a few days now and I can't seem to find a solution to this problem. &nbsp;Any suggestions?</p>

<h2>            C&#58; drive has nearly 200Gb of unaccounted for disk space.__</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I am using Windows 7, and I have a C: of size 295Gb, but I have very little space left. ('General' tab on the c: drive properties shows Used space of 287Gb)<br />
Running a few freeware disk space analyzer tools, the total size of files on the c: comes to only 93Gb.</p>
<p>How on earth is the extra 200Gb being used?</p>
<p>Yep, I've tried Disk Cleanup, (only freed up about 130Mb...)</p>
<p>The only other possible thing that might be affect this, is my PC has had hibernation issues recently, so perhaps there's lots of space taken up with backup/restore files? If that's the case, how can I find these and remove them?</p>
<p>Does anyone have any idea how to find out how this 200Gb is being used?</p>
<p>(and why on earth does MS have to make it so cryptic and difficult! Just tell me how my space is being used damn it!)</p>

            This is about as far as I can go in this question/answer exchange. I now see these options for you:<br />
a) See if another respondent picks up the thread, hopefully with some fresh ideas.<br />
b) Ask a computer-savvy friend to assist you in person.<br />
c) Back up your data, then reload Windows.<br />
d) Take the machine to a service shop to get professional assistance.<br />
e) Make a fee-based service call to Microsoft.<br />
f) Live with the problem.<br />
g) Let me have a look at your machine with remote support, using TeamViewer<br />
(www.teamviewer.com, using this file: http://www.teamviewer.com/download/TeamViewerQS.exe)<br />
If you wish to consider option g), send a note to pegasusDOTfnlATgmailDOTcom.<br />

<div><span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)"><br />
</span></div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>This is my first post on here since I built my new PC, I'll get down to business. Okay so the problem is with the Windows 7 feature Aero Peek. I really enjoy this feature and I like how it
 looks when alt-tabbing in Win7 as opposed to Win XP. the Main problem lies when playing a game called League of Legends. Now for some reason up until about 3 days ago, I could alt-tab perfectly fine while playing in "Borderless" mode with no window in the
 background; simply alt-tabbing to the desktop. But recently, with no warning or anything, my client is not allowing me to alt-tab to the desktop. I have even noticed that the alt-tab box reverted back to looking like it did in Win XP. I have been told that
 I'm having this issue because when in game my pc automatically shuts off aero peek to improve performance. The only issue I have with this is, my PC can run games like LoL and DotA2 perfectly fine on max settings. The only thing I can think of that I've installed
 lately is Dead Island which I purchased off of Steam. This really baffles me because I've searched all over for an answer and just can't seem to find one.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Also - I have checked and the Aero Peek checkbox is checked so I know it is enabled</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If anyone could help me with this I would greatly appreciate it, Thanks!<br />

            <p>If the game shuts off Aero automatically, it is not necessarily an indication that your computer isn't powerful enough to run both the game and Aero together.&nbsp; In some cases (actually, the majority), the game needs exclusive access to the video card and
 Aero needs to turn off to allow that (because under Aero, the entire visual environment you see is rendered as directx surfaces and then composited together by Aero, which is why the non-marketing name of Aero is "desktop composition").&nbsp; But I digress.</p>
<p>Does Aero work fine after you exit the game?&nbsp; If yes, then there may have been an update to the game that changed how it uses graphics.</p>
<p>If Aero doesn't work at all anymore, make sure you are using an Aero theme (maybe another got selected?)</p>
<p>You mentioned though, that it was fun until you installed Dead Island. Have you tried uninstalling it just to see if that's the cause?</p>

<h2>            Windows 7, Can&#39;t save anything in most programs</h2>
                    Hi guys<br />
<br />
I'm having a problem with saving files, I'm running windows 7 on my alienware m17x laptop.<br />
<br />
I cant save a new file in almost any program, for most programs including Microsoft office when i click save as nothing happens, no save window appears or anything the program just continues as if i i closed the file menu. This happens in any program that makes
 a new file, e.g. I cant save new scenes in Unity, some games cant save new files<br />
<br />
&nbsp;If i quit the program it comes up with the "do you want to save changes" window, all three options are there however only the text appears not the buttons outline, clicking save once again does nothing.<br />
<br />
This is only happening on new files, I can change&nbsp; existing files in any of the effected programs without issues. Notepad is unaffected by this it is the only program I've found that can still save new files.<br />
<br />
I've tried scanning my PC with McAfee, and have run windows startup repair wiht no results.<br />
<br />
Any help/suggestions would be appreciated <br />
<br />

Return the system to factory defaults, update all drivers from their respective manufacturer web sites, install all your applications from their respective media and restore your files and such from your latest backups.

            <p>Hey again!</p>
<p>Just wanted to drop by and let you all know this issue appears to be resolved. If you're still having trouble please try a full power cycle by holding down the power button for 10 seconds (or until the Xbox One powers off completely). Once you get a power cycle out of the way try installing or launching the game again, you should be good to go!</p>
<p>Keep us in the loop with how it goes.</p>

<h2>            ASUS X555LD Qualcomm Atheros Bluetooth not compatible on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Brand: ASUS X555LD Corei5</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>My notebook has built in bluetooth. The Qualcomm Atheros.</p>
<p>Since Windows 10 is free, I installed it. At first, I'm a little hesitant because it is just new and I know somehow, it has something more to be developed in Windows 10 since it is new.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I install the Windows 10, it seems cool. I downloaded a song and decided to transfer it on my phone. It usually automatically connects on my phone when I turn on my bluetooth(phone). And now, using Windows 10, my bluetooth(Q.A. Bluetooth on my notebook)
 can't connect on any phones now or anything that has bluetooth.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I tried removing some devices but I failed. It says "Removing failed".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me how to repair the bluetooth in my notebook? Or even bring back the built in apps here? The DoTA 2 isn't opening too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, I returned in Windows 8.1 hoping that the built in apps would be okay but it's not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still using Windows 8.1 Single Language</p>
<p>I'm really not going to Windows 10 anymore :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

            <p>Hi Jazmine,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We regret the inconvenience. I can understand that Bluetooth was not compatible in Windows 10 after the upgrade and now it is still not working even after returning to Windows 8.1. I will be happy to answer your query.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This could be due Bluetooth driver incompatibility in Windows 10 after the upgrade. You could install the latest driver downloaded from the computer manufacturer's support website and install it in compatibility mode for previous version of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, since you are back to Windows 8.1, you can still visit the computer manufacturer's support website and install the latest driver available for Windows 8.1 for the same computer model as yours.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future</p>

            Btw, another problem, since i've upgraded it to windows 10 and back to 8.1, the fn+f9, which is the smart gesture is not functioning now. I tried it too many times but still won't work.

<h2>            Chkdsk c&#58; &#47;f &#47;x  fails even as a boot up scan</h2>
                    Hi<br />
<br />
My windows 7 has become unstable, I get blue screens maybe once a day with different reported issues (Pagefaults and srtsp64.sys) and now windows update is failing to install updates and chkdsk is failing to run chkdsk.<br />
<br />
The windows update failure maybe related to this but I have asked that in the Windows 7 Update forum in another post, here is the CHKDSK issue......<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Chkdsk cannot run because the volume is in use by another<br />

<br />
This volume will be checked the next time the system restarts.<br />
<br />
C:\Windows\system32&gt;<br />
<br />
when I reboot it starts the chkdsk before windows boots and says:<br />

Autochk cannot run due to an error caused by a recently installed software package.&nbsp; Use system restore....<br />

Checking file system on C:<br />

An unspecified error occured (766f6c756d652e63 3f1)<br />
<br />
Then windows will load normally.<br />
<br />
I have Norton Internet Security 2010 installed but no idea how to disable it (without un-installing it)<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks

            Solved<br />
<br />
I inserted the&nbsp; Windows 7 Pro DVD and restarted the machine, it booted off the DVD and gave me two options, I selected number 1 which I think said "System start up repair (recommended)"<br />
<br />
It then automatically run a series of tests, starting with fixing volume errors, it finished and asked me to reboot, I took the DVD out, rebooted into windows, opened a command prompt and run "chkdsk" which now ran the entire way to 100% with no errors found.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<h2>            Opening Word &#40;.doc&#41; files while using Vista</h2>
                    Having problems opening Word (.doc) files. Have downloaded the Word Viewer as recommended on this site, but just can't seem to get any further. The downloaded 'wordview_en-us' file is sitting in my program files folder, but when I double click to open
 it I merely get taken through the install procedure again. Although not dim, I don't really know much about the internal workings of the computer and rather hoped that merely downloading the Word Viewer would miraculously allow me to view the documents, but
 this hasn't been the case. Any suggestion as to what I'm doing wrong. Answers in simplified English greatly appreciated!!!

    <title>Driver power State Failure - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> grumpyguy2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Driver power State Failure</h2>
                    I have been occasionally getting a Driver power State Failure followed by an automatic reboot of my Windows 10 desktop. I have searched answers for this error and found that you need mini-dump files and a system information file to diagnose my issue.&nbsp;
 I have those files uploaded to my OneDrive. I believe that I need to first initiate a question here. Then I will need your further instructions about supplying a link to my OneDrive folder.

=====================================================<br />
<br />
This "could" be a power supply problem though it is not the most common cause.</span></p>
<p><span>9f is&nbsp;likely a driver issue.&nbsp;Antivirus/antispyware/security programs can also cause
<br />
these issues.<br />
<br />
Have you added devices lately or updated drivers - be sure to check in Windows <br />
Updates to see if a driver was updated prior to this occurring. This could also be
<br />
caused by a loose card or cable and even a weak power supply.<br />
<br />
That error means a driver is not handling the power state properly. Check in <br />
Control Panel - Device Manager to be sure major drivers are not shut off <br />
during sleep - double click Display Adapter - NIC and WIFI - Sound and <br />
others - Power Management tab - uncheck Allow computer to turn off power. <br />
Maybe only one has an issue.<br />
<br />
<strong>(Use RUN&nbsp;instead of Start - Search as used on Vista or Windows 7)<br />
<br />
WINKEY + X - RUN - type in MSCONFIG.exe<br />
<br />
General Tab - check Diagnostic Start&nbsp; - APPLY / OK&nbsp; -&nbsp; REBOOT<br />
<br />
Try it now. If it still blue screens think Video Driver. If not think NIC, Wifi, <br />
Sound, or.....(and it still could be video interacting with something else). <br />
See&nbsp;troubleshooter link above for my generic driver update methods.<br />

</span></p>
----------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<strong>This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :</strong><br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<strong>&nbsp; Run DriverView</strong> -<br />
<strong>set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers </strong>- update those without Dump in their
<br />
names.&nbsp;(<strong>also update the BIOS and low level chipset drivers</strong>)<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your&nbsp;system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address&nbsp;of the driver, description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and&nbsp;more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 170, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the <br />
most&nbsp;current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down<br />
the make and&nbsp;complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's <br />
tab - write down the&nbsp;version info. Now click Update Driver (this may not do <br />
anything as MS is far behind&nbsp;certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -
<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the driver&nbsp;stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and <br />
Keyboard if&nbsp;3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other <br />
major device drivers you&nbsp;have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) <br />
and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get <br />
their latest versions.&nbsp;(Look for BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System <br />
Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT <span>After each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing&nbsp;actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed&nbsp;(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot
<br />
- check to be sure it is&nbsp;installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER <br />
– </span><span>Check manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<p>&nbsp;_____________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
After doing ALL the updates you can, and if the issue continues, then run <br />
DriverVerifier.&nbsp;(Remember to use the Windows 8/8.1 methods posted at the <br />
top&nbsp;of the original reply above.)</p>

<p><br />
WINKEY + X - RUN - type in -&gt; verifier /reset&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hit enter to disable</p>
<p><br />
Use BlueScreenView to see if there is a driver specified in the error message. <br />
Also check with&nbsp;MyEventViewer at the time of the BlueScreen.<br />
<br />
If Driver Verifier creates a minidump upload it and post the link here so we <br />
can analyze it. </p>

<h2>            Missing Fullscreen 16&#58;9 DVD-playback on Blu-Ray app</h2>
                    The feature of playing DVD movies in Fullscreen 16:9 rather than in 4:3 Letterbox, has been a missing feature on XBox One since the first XBox One was released. It used to be a feature on XBox 360's DVD player. Now this feature is greatly missed in latest
 Blu-Ray app updates on XBox One. PLEASE include the option of playing any DVD movie on 16:9 Fullscreen again. It would be great :)

            Even an administrative account must provide authorization to delete certain global and/or system files. As an aside, you should not be running as administrator for your daily work. See the end of this post for information about that.<br />

<br />
</span><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline; font-weight: bold">General Recommendations For Setting Up Users In Vista:</span>
<br />
<br />
You absolutely do not want to have only one user account. Like XP and all other modern operating systems, Vista is a multi-user operating system with built-in system accounts such as Administrator, Default, All Users, and Guest. These accounts should be left
 alone as they are part of the operating system structure.<br />
<br />
You particularly don't want only one user account with administrative privileges on Vista because the built-in Administrator account (normally only used in emergencies) is disabled by default. If you're running as Administrator for your daily work and that
 account gets corrupted, things will be Difficult. It isn't impossible to activate the built-in Administrator to rescue things, but it will require third-party tools and working outside the operating system.<br />
<br />
The user account that is for your daily work should be a Standard user, with the extra administrative user (call it something like "CompAdmin" or "Tech" or the like) only there for elevation purposes. After you create "CompAdmin", log into it and change your
 regular user account to Standard. Then log back into your regular account.<br />
<br />
If you want to go directly to the Desktop and skip the Welcome Screen with the icons of user accounts, you can do this:<br />
<br />
Start Orb&gt;Search box&gt;type: netplwiz [enter]<br />
Click on Continue (or supply an administrator's password) when prompted by UAC<br />
<br />
Uncheck the option "Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer". Select a user account to automatically log on by clicking on the desired account to highlight it and then hit OK. Enter the correct password for that user account (if there
 is one) when prompted. Leave it blank if there is no password (null).</span> <br />

<h2>            uk keyboard</h2>
                    <p>I must confess, I am experiencing feelings of exasperation where Microsoft is concerned. It seems to me that every time windows 10 updates (a process I have little control over) something goes wrong on my beloved PC. The latest example (2018 updates) is
 my keyboard mapping. It seems to me I have a US keyboard layout now. When I type @ I get ", and when I type &nbsp;" I get @. for example. I have encountered this before on a Linux VM. It was easily solved. But no matter what tutorial I follow on windows I can't
 get a uk keyboard layout. To be honest, it's not a big deal, I have learned, like the slavering dog that I a am, to substitute the relevant keys. But, I beg you...…..STOP UPDATING WINDOWS 10.</p>

            Hi Miles, option 1 below will fix this issue, option 2 will permanently turn off updates, if that is what you want:
<br />
<br />1.
<br />Use this workaround to set your preferred input language:
<br />
<br />Right click your Start Button, choose Powershell (admin) 
<br />
<br />Run this command to get a list of installed languages on your PC 
<br />
<br />Get-WinUserLanguageList 
<br />
<br />Note down the LanguageTag of your preferred language 
<br />
<br />If say, your preferred language is US English, run this command and hit Enter:
<br />
<br />$1 = New-WinUserLanguageList en-US 
<br />
<br />Then run this command to set the order of installed input languages 
<br />
<br />Set-WinUserLanguageList $1 
<br />
<br />Close Powershell and restart your PC
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />2. 
<br />Permanently Stop Windows Updates:
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type services and hit Enter
<br />
<br />Scroll down to find Windows Update Service
<br />
<br />If it is Started, double click it and stop that service
<br />
<br />CLose the services App
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type cmd, right click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator'
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />sc delete wuauserv
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt
<br />
<br />Restart your PC
<br />
<br />
<br />If you also have the Update Assistant installed on your system:
<br />
<br />The Update Assistant in Windows 10 cannot be uninstalled, but you can get rid of it 
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type Task Scheduler and hit enter 
<br />In the left Pane, navigate to: Windows - Update Orchestrater 
<br />Right Pane double click 'Update Assistant' 
<br />Click on Triggers Tab 
<br />On each of the triggers ( At login . . . etc.) double click and uncheck 'Enabled' 
<br />
<br />Under 'Update Assistant, there is another event 'Update Assistant CalendarRun' 
<br />Do the same for all triggers on that event 
<br />
<br />Restart your system, that's It!
<br />
<br />When finished and after a system restart, open the services app and make sure the Windows Update Service is now gone . . .

<p>If your system is working and you want it to keep working never accept hardware driver (chipset, video, audio, network, printer) updates from Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's why:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you mean you are seeing something like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/357f7bd2-8031-4f8a-aafc-da8ea26b2498" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/357f7bd2-8031-4f8a-aafc-da8ea26b2498" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>That message is telling you that the driver update offered from Windows Update is an older or lesser version than the currently installed driver or has a lower compatibility rating than the installed driver.&nbsp; That means you probably don't want that update
 and you should be glad the installation is failing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is generally not a good idea to accept hardware driver updates (video, audio, network, printer) offered by Windows Update and if you ever see them it is best to hide them so you never see them again.&nbsp; Only get hardware driver updates from your hardware
 manufacturers WWW site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just because Microsoft offers you a driver update does not mean you have an out of date or afflicted driver and it certainly doesn't mean you have to install the driver updates MS offers - it is generally best NOT to install hardware driver updates offered
 by Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Accepting hardware driver updates from Microsoft is one reason there are so many topics in the community that start with "Windows update broke my computer...".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me assure you with 100% certainty that these ideas for things to try that are usually suggested by the Microsoft engaged alleged "experts" will not help:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Safe Mode</p>
<p>Clean Boot</p>
<p>DISM</p>
<p>SFC&nbsp; (System File Checker)</p>
<p>Windows update Troubleshooter</p>
<p>
</p><p>One rule of thumb (especially for hardware drivers) is "if it ain't broke don't fix it" so if you are not having a problem with hardware devices (video, audio, network, printer) don't accept or install those driver updates offered from Microsoft.&nbsp; If you
 are having a problem like that you should only get driver updates from the hardware manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you see and can recognize those hardware driver updates offered you should right click and hide them:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ac1f86e4-1fca-471b-a37b-14ae2736c025" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Pretty soon you might have quite a few hidden hardware updates:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f5f3b09b-cddc-49aa-8381-d29660edc24a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f5f3b09b-cddc-49aa-8381-d29660edc24a" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows has a way built in to not allow these kinds of updates and I'm not 100% sure it works as advertised but this is a safe adjustment that may prevent a whoops event in the future and how you might undo them if they happen:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7 has built in ways to disable driver updates from Windows Update that you can read about here:</p>

    <title>mini display port to hdmi can&#39;t get 5.1 sound and refresh rate - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tmagritte  say:</h3>
<h2>            mini display port to hdmi can&#39;t get 5.1 sound and refresh rate issues</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried connecting my Surface Pro 3 to my Sony TV using a Startech mini displayport to HDMI adapter. While I do get sound output, I can only configure it for stereo speakers, I don't see any option for 5.1 surround output. I also find that the sound won't
 output immediately - I need to either unplug and replug the adapter or play some sound a few times before it finally comes through. Then it works okay but I also notice a slight delay - not enough that I can't adjust to it when watching video but it's noticeable
 at first. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I attached the HDMI cable to the TV, which then outputs audio through another HDMI cable to the receiver/speakers.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to understand if the lack of 5.1 audio is an issue with the TV or TV setup or a problem with the surface. Does the adapter itself play any role in this? Would an official Microsoft adapter behave any differently?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other issue I noticed is that the default video is 1920x1080 at 60Hz. The TV seems to recognize this as PC output and replaces the normal picture settings with only "text" and "video" and few adjustment options. The result is video looks awful - I think
 the gamma is too high or something. If I manually set the refresh to 30Hz interlaced then the TV treats it as a normal video input and video looks good. But I can only do this in extended or external only modes. If I want to duplicate the screens it won't
 work. I think it's trying to set the built in display to 30 Hz too which isn't supported. Is there any way to set the refresh rates independently in duplicate mode? Also, will it recognize different external displays or treat them all as the same display?
 If I connect to a real computer monitor, will it remember what I set for the TV and output at 30 Hz interlaced or will it recognize it as a new display and output at 60Hz, which would be appropriate?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
