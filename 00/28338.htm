    <title>word wrap in notepad - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            word wrap in notepad</h2>
                    <p>I am using Windows 7 and having a problem with notepad.&nbsp; When I open a file with it, and then turn word wrap on, it seems to delete the end-of-line or CR's instead of ignoring them as it used to do.&nbsp; Now, if I turn word wrap on, or it is already on by default
 based on the last time I used notepad, the line breaks are now erased and my file is now permanently broken -- no way to restore them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is my version of notepad broken, or is there some way to make it work as before?</p>
<p>

<h3> apogee42  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook web site sign in - no password required</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of about a week ago, Outlook email on our laptop suddenly crashes every time we open it.&nbsp; Until we can solve that issue we are relying on the web-based Outlook.&nbsp; We are puzzled and disconcerted by finding that when we go to the Microsoft account sign-in
 page and click on "sign-in" in the top right corner, we see our primary account listed and it is signed out.&nbsp; When we click on that, the account opens without asking for a password.&nbsp; This means that if someone else got hold of our laptop, they would be able
 to access our account and our email.&nbsp; Could you please advise how to prevent this automatic sign in?&nbsp; We sign out of email and out of our account each time, but it makes no difference.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Mark</p>

<p>Thank you.&nbsp; I read the item you suggested and found it useful.&nbsp; I understand that Mail App is the software I use on the laptop to access email via the Outlook icon on the desktop.&nbsp; So, when I am not online, I can still look at all the email I have already
 downloaded into Outlook locally.&nbsp; I am satisfied with the fact that I do not need to enter a separate password for that purpose.&nbsp; That is not, however, the situation I asked for help with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently the Mail App on the laptop crashes whenever I open Outlook (it doesn't crash when I am working offline, mail still comes in but I can't send messages).&nbsp; That issue happened suddenly about a week ago and I have yet to solve it.&nbsp; As a result, I currentl
 rely instead on email access via the web, at Outlook.com.&nbsp; Although I sign out of email there whenever I finish, and then also sign out of my account at Outlook.com, when I return again I am not asked for my password, even though my account shows as "signed
 out".&nbsp; I am not aware of checking any box to stay signed-in.&nbsp; Perhaps I am overlooking that option somewhere?&nbsp; I'd be glad of any further help on that score.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd also be grateful if you could tell me how to be sure that all the email I see in the Mail App (i.e. locally on the laptop when working offline, rather than "live" on the web at Outlook com) has downloaded permanently.&nbsp; I have a linked account and imported
 all the mail from that into Outlook on the laptop.&nbsp; I want to terminate the linked account and be sure I won't lose the emails from that account which I see on the laptop.&nbsp; In short, are all the emails really on my laptop, or am I just viewing them online
 via the Mail App without being aware of the fact?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your patience.</p>

<p>Hi Karina:&nbsp; Just had a problem sending my reply, so I will copy it below in case it didn't reach you. I'll just add that we did successfully follow the instructions to update profiles sent some months ago by Microsoft, and we had an email confirming we had
 done so.&nbsp; Best, Mark</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your message.&nbsp; In reply:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; We are using Outlook 2016.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Yes, I did clear cache and cookies, as well as browsing history, downloads etc.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; We use the Microsoft Edge browser, so I assume this is what opens Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We've had no issues prior to the past few weeks.&nbsp; I speculate that recent server changes have created a glitch with Outlook settings or our email profiles.&nbsp; Our primary profile/account is the Apogee one, but we also have a second Outlook profile too.&nbsp; The
 second profile may have become detached from the primary since I don't see both listed on one profile page when logged into Outlook.com, and I think we did originally (although it's hard to remember by now).&nbsp; Also, in the Mail app on our laptop, when I check
 the email account details, the primary account (Apogee) plus the BT linked account seem to be together under our User name, whereas but the second Outlook account is listed as another entry under "Outlook".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you can follow that description o.k.&nbsp; I have thought about trying to reset profiles or account details, but I'm worried I might make the problem worse when I am unfamiliar with doing so.&nbsp; Like most people, I set these details up once when initialising
 Outlook and then so much time passes that it means starting from scratch in figuring it all out whenever something goes wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your patience.</p>
<p>Regards, Mark</p>

<p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Office Configuration Analyzer Tool (OffCAT) is a free tool to help you analyze Office and pinpoint problems. OffCAT scans Office to report issues such as missing updates, problematic add-ins, and even system problems that could affect Microsoft
 Office. We suggest that you use this tool by following the steps on this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2812744/office-configuration-analyzer-tool-offcat-information" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hello Karina,</p>
<p>Thank you.&nbsp; I have run the Tool and have worked through some of the results.&nbsp; So far there is no improvement to the problems I described, but I still have more checks to do.&nbsp; I can't work on this for a few days but will do so asap.&nbsp; AutoDiscover mismatch
 sounds promising as our Outlook secondary profile shows separately from our primary in the Outlook Accounts dialogue box.&nbsp; However, we do not receive any warnings as per the KB article.&nbsp; Also, curiously, our Office is set to update automatically but apparently
 is not doing so.&nbsp; We have updated as a result of the Tool, thanks.</p>

<p>Hi Karina:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apologies for not replying sooner.&nbsp; I have been away - twice - with just a single day in between when I came home to find the Router was kaput.&nbsp; I had to wait five days for the Engineer but now have a shiny new updated Router.&nbsp; I didn't have connectivity
 while away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your suggestions about passwords and profiles.&nbsp; As I mentioned in earlier posts on the problem, I do wonder whether I have a corrupted profile or one that has got disconnected from our primary profile, but I'm not familiar with all the OUtlook
 and Server settings that relate to that.&nbsp; I downloaded some info about profiles but haven't got to grips with that - nor the remaining Analysis Tool items yet.&nbsp; I aim to do so during the coming week as the Outlook problem is really inconvenient and time-consuming.&nbsp;
 I will post the results.&nbsp; In the meantime, can you tell me how I can be sure that the email I look at in the Mail App on my laptop has downloaded permanently.&nbsp; I'm worried that modifying profiles and/or account settings might mean I'll lose the emails.&nbsp; I
 wish it was all more obvious and straightforward!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again,</p>
<p>Mark</p>

<p>Hi Karina:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went through some hoops re-setting our email passwords this week but Outlook continued to crash.&nbsp; Then, mysteriously, this afternoon it suddenly stopped crashing.&nbsp; I am utterly bemused, hugely relieved, and desperately hoping Outlook will now for some
 reason work as normal.&nbsp; I notice that the secondary Outlook email profile is no longer visible in the account settings in Outlook, whereas it had been listed separately from the Primary account under an entry titled "Outlook").&nbsp; Why it has suddenly vanished
 I do not know but email from the secondary account is arriving o.k.&nbsp; I guess that particular problem is "solved", although I don't know how, nor why it happened.&nbsp; Fingers crossed!&nbsp; Thanks for your suggestions along the way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd still be grateful if you could point me to information or a method to determine whether the emails I see in the Outlook Mail App on my laptop have downloaded locally or not.&nbsp; I want to close my third party email account but not risk losing the emails
 I imported into Outlook over the past year or two.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also wonder why Office is not automatically updating when it says it is set to do so!</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Mark</p>

    <title>Build 10130 Continually Crashes With Clock_Watchdog_Timeout Error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> howardwelch  say:</h3>
<h2>            Build 10130 Continually Crashes With Clock_Watchdog_Timeout Error</h2>
                    <p>I had been running Win10 TP on my homebuilt desktop pc since November with no installation or update problems until automatic updates started trying to install build 10130 - when I would check windows update for status, I would get a message that attempts
 to install build 10130 encountered problems, but windows would try again later. I finally tried to do the update manually, but every attempt resulted in a BSOD with the above error. Attempted clean install with bootable usb iso would reach the setting things
 up stage, then fail with the same error. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to emphasize that the hardware on my pc has not changed during the time I've been testing the preview builds, and build 10074 was running just fine until the attempts to upgrade to 10130. &nbsp;I reinstalled 10074 from the iso and it runs fine, but now
 all attempts to update (including security updates) fail with the same error message. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I totally erased the hard drive and the the build installed - it took me through all the usual business of signing into my MS account, setting a pin number, and booting to the start screen - I was elated - then deflated- because any attempt to open a program
 results in the BSOD with same error.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Now comes the real fun part. &nbsp;None of the repair options on the bootable usb are appropriate for the problem I'm having, and I have no way to boot into safe mode to see if I can fix the problem. &nbsp;And I can't give feedback to microsoft, because the feedback
 app only works on Win 10. &nbsp;When I posted a request for help a couple of nights ago, one person posted a response suggesting it might be a problem with my nvidia drivers, but disabling them didn't solve the problem</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the kind of cluster f___k that could drive a guy to &nbsp;run only linux.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm guessing that build 10130 introduced some change or changes to the windows update app that disagree with something in my pc, but I can't figure out what and microsoft has left me with pitifully little in the way of self-help options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anybody out there have any clues about this problem, are is just a freak anomaly restricted to my computer?</p>
<p>

<p>No, the problem was not with the system bios, it was with windows update and if you read all of this thread you would know that the problem was solved by some change in a later build - there was no need to mess with my system bios at all.</p>

            <p>Hi RVD,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>0x80070005 is an Access is Denied error this is because either an application or executable does not have the necessary elevation to invoke a specific action. One possibility is you are trying to do this or did the update or installation as a standard user
 instead of as an Administrator - especially if you are using XP. Login to an Admininstrator account to proceed. This is not always required and I'm not sure about your circumstances or configuration or operation system, but given that error we should err on
 the side of cautiion and use the Administrator account here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's start with some possible troubleshooting ideas and solutions from others who also experienced this error code:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please see if the answer in the following thread helps: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/error-code-0x80070005/1e5cc042-2fcc-4ca1-a489-b44b1343e224">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/error-code-0x80070005/1e5cc042-2fcc-4ca1-a489-b44b1343e224</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If not try the answer and the other suggestion in this thread: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/0x80070005/563455d4-5ec5-4e8f-a8d3-b6a4005b189d">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/0x80070005/563455d4-5ec5-4e8f-a8d3-b6a4005b189d</a>. It is similar to the above, but includes another link which may apply depending on your version of Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not sure where you are or where you got the download or what you've done, so if the above didn't help, let's just start from scratch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Start with the following compliments of Dr. Strangelove:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that you have removed all other real-time antimalware products that were ever installed on your PC, including free/trial products that were installed when the PC was purchased (Norton, McAfee, TM, AVG, OneCare, Malwarebytes (paid), etc).
 Then, use the cleanup tools here: </span></strong><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>List of anti-malware program cleanup/uninstall tools</span></b></a>.
 You MUST use the cleanup/removal tools to get rid of these programs properly as the normal uninstall process leaves remnants behind that cause problems with any other AV product you install later including MSE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>NOTE: If you have installed Adobe FLASH, and you already had the Google toolbar, you were presented with the option to install “McAfee Security Scanner”, which is selected by default. If you were caught by this, and unknowingly/accidentally
 installed McAfee, uninstall it and use the McAfee cleanup tool in the list above. Other programs "package" deals like this as well with this or other products and if you've recently done a clean install (a restore to factory conditions) you may have also re-installed
 trial software that you long since forgot was there.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that your PC clock is correctly set. If not, correct it. If it is wrong, you may also want to either synchronize with a different internet time server or replace your CMOS battery (which keeps the clock running when you turn off the
 PC and like any battery can eventually run down).</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that you are up-to-date with SERVICE PACKS and updates (including .NET and IE). Yes, it can take some time to do this.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Then, restart your PC.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because we don't know how much of what installed is good or possibly corrupted (or what that malware may have done even if it was removed), we need to first uninstall and then re-install MSE. To uninstall MSE, proceed as follows:<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4</a>
 or<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2483120" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2483120</a>. NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;Pay particular attention to the manual methods here if it still doesn't work and be sure to follow the steps exactly and precisely in order
 and that should do the trick.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To re-install, check out this article and follow ALL the procedures: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/check-list-for-installing-microsoft-security/bf757e6a-e320-4a67-92bc-767e6acb26c4">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/check-list-for-installing-microsoft-security/bf757e6a-e320-4a67-92bc-767e6acb26c4</a> - but also check out the next paragraph before you begin the download.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do or ever did have any other AV program installed on your computer (even if you didn't use it), you need to make sure they are all uninstalled and fully removed before you install. To fully remove them, check out this listing of removal tools<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91</b></a>
 or the listing in that article at the bottom under troubleshooting steps (why this link isn't at the top near things to do first where it discusses removing all the prior and current AV programs is beyond me) or, if not on the lists, go to the website of the
 AV software and get and use the removal tool for that product.<span> </span>You cannot just uninstall these programs – you MUST also use the removal tool – even if the uninstall was years ago but you didn’t use a removal tool at the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To install, go to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx</a> and click on languages and locales&nbsp;and then choose your language and the appropriate version for your operating system. When you download, save it to the desktop (rather than running it). When
 finished, right click on the installation icon and click run as Administrator (even if you’re logged in as an administrator) as I’ve found this sometimes helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then you need to configure your settings, set a scheduled scan, enable real-time protection, update MSE, and then run a quick scan (or a full scan if you have time).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also recommend the following setup for MSE (though the decision is yours - I've just found this helpful and the most effective and best way to set it up and is how I have mine configured):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure that ALL threat levels are sent to Quarantine where you can then decide whether or not to allow them or leave them there, or remove them. It is the safest solution for having the most options for dealing with the situation. Quarantine is as safe
 as removed, but in some cases you may want to remove them to be more certain - and with this one I would remove it (when the time comes). To do this, open MSE, click on the Settings Tab, and for each of the threat levels, set the action to be Quarantine and
 save.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the History tab and click on allowed and unless you specifically placed something in allowed, remove everything else from the allowed category. Only put things there that you ABSOLUTELY know are not problems (are "false positives") and triple-check
 before you do it as doing this could allow a real threat to bypass security and infect you and it won't be detected or rather won't be reported or acted upon by MSE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on Real-time protection and check all the boxes and save.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on SpyNet and click on Advanced and save. This is not at all dangerous to you and no information sent will be used by Microsoft to identify you even if some minor identification information is sent in terms of defining the
 infection, but it can sometimes help with new threats by initiating an immediate update to deal with the problem if it is in the SpyNet database (and it helps Microsoft update definitions to provide you and everyone else better protection).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on Advanced and check the box for save Quarantine items and change it from one month to three months so you have more time to decide if you want to restore something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*************************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't help, then there's a good chance you may be infected by malware. Please proceed as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, try the following programs if you haven't as they may help. I recommend you download, install, update, and run full scans with Malwarebytes:<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a> and SuperAntiSpyware:<a href="http://superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://superantispyware.com/</span></a>
 and then run a full Safety Scan from Microsoft:<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security/default.aspx</span></a>. These may or may not remove the infections, but will probably not repair
 any damage caused by them. Even if they or your current AV software seem to work or indicate you aren't infected, you shouldn't completely trust them and need to continue with the recommendations that follow (so it's up to you if you want to try them first
 or just skip over all of this and get the expert help you really need as described below).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Properly and completely removing such infections can be complex and often require manual removal procedures (which may or may not be entirely effective either). Even if they work, I'd suggest the following anyway, so we may as well start there (you can ignore
 the above removal methods if you want as this is really the way to go, but it won't hurt to try them).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please follow these recommendations compliments of Stephen Boots - MVP:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Start here - </b><a href="https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/</span></b></a><b> and select the link that says - I think my computer is infected - and then select the
 support option for phone, chat or email (options will vary by Region)</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>If you are in North America, you can call 866-727-2338 for free help from Microsoft for virus and spyware infections.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>In other regions not served by the link above, go here:</b><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/security" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>http://Support.microsoft.com/security</span></b></a><b>and go to the “assisted support” or contact us menu.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>********************************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If malware was found and removed, then you need to again uninstall and re-install MSE as it will never work properly if installed on an infected system (which we didn’t know at the time).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully, one of these solutions (or a step in one of these answers) will resolve the problem. If not, then open a support case describing the problem starting at:<a href="https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/</b></a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>

            <p>Hi Vann,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would have lost a lot of money betting it was the battery if you didn't say it was good.&nbsp; If that's the case and given the symptoms you're describing, I have to suspect a problem with the motherboard (which may no longer be seeing the battery).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being unable to sync can be normal if the times are off by too much.&nbsp; You need to get them close and then sync will work.&nbsp; But if time stops when the computer stops, then it is not being powered by the battery - and I've never seen that be anything but hardware-related
 (in fact, I've never seen it be anything but a battery).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recommend you contact the computer manufacturer's technical support group for assistance as&nbsp;this time issue&nbsp;truly sounds like a hardware rather than a software problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

    <title>Update to reoccurring meeting shows as &#34;not current&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> edmondswriter  say:</h3>
<h2>            Update to reoccurring meeting shows as &#34;not current&#34;</h2>
                    I have a number of reoccurring appointments on my calendar sent to me by my boss who is on Outlook 2010 with MS Exchange Server. I have no problem receiving the original reoccurring meeting request to my personal Outlook 2010 (I am a vendor and my personal
 version is not on Exchange Server) but if there is an update, it now comes to me as "Not Current".
<br />
<br />
The update information IS in the request so I have to manually note it, then email/call my boss to confirm this is the new time. There is only one meeting organizer and these instances have occurred when there is only one update acted on a single occurrence
 of the meeting (no change to the series). <br />
<br />
This problem started recently and as I am now the only one experiencing this problem (everyone else is on the same Exchange Server) I'm assuming the problem is a setting on my Outlook 2010. Curiously enough, when this meeting is automatically forwarded onto
 my calendar on the same Exchange server (I have forwarded the meeting notice to my public calendar on the network so that people can see my available/free time), the update comes through correctly (no "Not current" message seen).<br />
<br />
An Internet search shows that other people are seeing this problem but I have not seen a published resolution.<br />
<br />
Details:<br />
<br />
Organizer is using Outlook 2010 w/ Exchange Server<br />
Update to single instance of reoccurring meeting<br />
Recipient is uses stand alone version of Outlook 2010 (no Exchange Server)<br />
Updates show as "Not current"<br />

            <p>This is an issue for me as well. &nbsp;It happens at work where all email accounts involved are Exchange accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If my manager sends a meeting update for a recurring meeting, occasionally the update is not reflected in my calendar. &nbsp;The meeting update email says "not current" at the top and also displays the informational message that "this meeting request was updated
 after this message was sent" which isn't the case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Consequently I have to make sure to take note of whatever info was changed in the meeting update email so that I don't either go to the wrong conference room or go at the wrong time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've searched for solutions for this issue online and have seen users describing this same issue exactly as it occurs today since 2011. &nbsp;That's four years without a solution. &nbsp;</p>

            Microsoft has done nothing to fix this. This makes all the money and time spent building Exchange a waste of valuable IT resources and also budget. Microsoft will simply not admit it's cash cow does not work, and is in fact responsible for hundreds of
 thousands of missed executive meetings and untold frustration in corporate offices around the world. You pay big dollars, waste thousands of IT budget just to find out it does not even work like it should. There ought to be a law putting people that knowingly
 allow this in jail.

            Microsoft Exchange and Outlook does not actually meet the requirements of an Implied Warranty of Merchantability because there are hidden bugs in it which stop it from working correctly.

<div>Technically it wasn't removed. IE9 is all new and they just didn't have time to put that feature back in. I know from a user standpoint the result is the same - the feature is missing, but there was no intent to remove it, it just didn't get added to the

<p>I changed timeout Dword to 120000, for 2 minutes. Tried the <em>How to optimize IE</em> steps earlier with no positive results. I also tried adding a timeout Qword.</p>
<p>Uploading data to Careerbuilder has been very slow for the past week. They just 'fixed' something yesterday to improve upload speed, so I can no longer test any possible resolutions. I suppose the problem could have been their server timeout value?</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for the input.</p>

</p><p>When I sync my Outlook.com calendars to Outlook 2013 on my PC, it creates two calendars: Personal and Work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the issue: I also use OneNote 2013 extensivly for note taking at work. When I go to OneNote and look at my upcoming meetings, it shows only the meetings on my Personal calendar, not my Work calendar. Likewise, when I create tasks/follow-ups it assigns
 them to my Personal calendar rather than Work</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to get the appointments from my Work calendar to show up in OneNote?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>View the PDF at 200%. Using the Adobe snapshot tool to highlight and copy all of the content you want in the slide. Paste into PowerPoint. You'll need to resize the image to fit the slide (the larger you view the doc in the PDF, the larger it will be when
 pasted into PowerPoint.&nbsp; Note that these images cannot be compressed with PowerPoint's compression tool (unless you Cut the image you just copied from the PDF and repaste it as a png or jpg.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for your response. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue seems to be occurring due to a corrupt installation of Office 2010. I would suggest you to completely uninstall Office 2010 and reinstall it.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow these steps to uninstall Office 2010:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>We will uninstall Office 2010 completely by running the Office 2010 FIXIT tool.</li><li>Download/install and run the Office 2010 FIXIT tool from the following link: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971179" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p><span><span><strong>Note</strong>: Before you uninstall Office 2010 please make sure to take a backup of all your Office data: All Word, Excel, PowerPoint, documents and files. Also, in case you have been using Outlook 2010 for your email, calendar, contacts
 and/or tasks, make sure to take a backup of the Outlook information. Also, make sure that you have the installation disk for Office 2010 and the Product Key before uninstalling Office 2010 from your computer.</span></span></p>

            <p>The only way I found to "FIX" this "preparing to install" problem is this:</p>
<p>Delete the existing shortcuts and create <strong>NEW</strong> shortcut from the *.exe file.
</p>
<p>My path is: C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office14</p>
<ul>
<li>WINWORD</li><li>EXCEL</li><li>POWERPNT.EXE</li></ul>
<p>I had to reinstall powerpoint because a "dll" got screwed up. Typical</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why? I don't know. Never did find any MS people to fix this. Everyone just guesses and try this or that. BS!</p>
<p>Poor support but typical Microsoft methods. Release the sw and let the users find the bugs. You would think after years in the field that these kind of flaws would be well documented and fixed.
</p>
<p>I <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em><strong>NEVER </strong></em></span>get the first release of any MS product because of their buyer beware philosophy. IE is notoriously buggy on first release.
</p>
<p>I know businesses that routinely delay updates for years because of this. They don't want to waste time making IE * work again.

<h2>            WLAN problem on Nokia N91</h2>
                    Hi<br />
<br />
I have recently purchased a nokia n91 and I am having problem in connecting my n91 to my laptop via wireless.<br />
<br />
I have read through the manual and it states that if I do the following I will be able to search for any wireless connection available.<br />
<br />
Connect. &gt;&gt; Conn. mgr. &gt;&gt; Availab.WLAN<br />
<br />
When I do this nothing seems to appear apart from "(no available WLAN networks)". From that screen if I select option the only thing that comes up are Help and Exit.<br />
<br />
I have also tried searching for any wireless device on my laptop to see if it finds my n91 put there is no luck with that aswell. I have change the wireless setting on my n91 so that it shows it availability.<br />
<br />
Can anyone guide me in how to get my wirless working<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />
<br />

I don't think just because your laptop has a wireless adapter that you can connect them just as easily. It's like connecting two ethernet cards, it doesn't work directly.<br />
<br />
You have to go through a switch or a router.<br />
<br />
I don't have any more information

            Hi,<br />
<br />
if you wish to use connection between 2 WLAN devices which are not access points you need to use Ad Hoc mode and not Infrastructure (that is most propable reason why you can not find your computer with your N91 and vice versa).<br />
<br />
I think that you can only share web connection with your computer over WLAN with your N91. As I have not found any other app than the web browser in N91 that would support WLAN connectivity (so no file sharing).. So how to do it (I think at least with a PC
 in theory):<br />
<br />
With your computer:<br />
- you need to be connected to internet via cable or via other media than WLAN<br />
- define your computer WLAN so that it is in Ad Hoc mode and share the web connection or set up a web server on your computer<br />
<br />
In your phone:<br />
Menu - Tools - Settings - Connection - Access Points and from the select Options - New access point - Use default settings. Now select following:<br />
<br />
- Connection name: xxxx<br />
- Data Bearer: Wireless LAN<br />
- WLAN netw. name: xxxx<br />
- Network Status: Public / Hidden<br />
- WLAN netw. mode: Ad Hoc (= computer to computer)<br />
- WLAN security mode: Open network / WEP<br />
- WLAN security sett:<br />
- Homepage: None<br />
<br />
Now start web browser in your phone and select your new Ad Hoc WLAN network and surf..<br />
<br />
I have not been able to do this myself as I use Mac (PowerBook G4 12 inch with built in WLAN...) and for some reason this does not work between N91 and Mac :-( if someone knows hot to do it please help :-)<br />
<br />

<br />
plesae select "Infrastucture" that should solve the problem. "Ad Hoc" mode is meant only for WLAN connections between two devices (data exchange).<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

go to internet,<br />
go to web,<br />
click on options,<br />
where it says access point, change to always ask,<br />
go back,<br />
click on web-site and on select access point click on search for WLAN,<br />
search for one then connect to it...<br />
<br />

            To communicate directly with another wifi network adaptor you'll need to make sure the connection is ad-hoc.

            Hi there,
<br />
<br />MS office 2019 and 2016 can not run simultaneously, so my suggestion would be that you do not install the updates. These updates are being suggested since you have an MS Office subscription and 2016 is still considered the 'standard'. 
<br />
<br />Further Information about Office 2019 can be found here:-

            Hi Bob,
<br />
<br />I disagree and would suggest that you do allow the updates. Microsoft is very confused in its labelling. This is not the first time.
<br />
<br />In fact, Office 365 (2016) is Office 2019. Updates being pushed for Office 365 would apply to 2019.
<br />
<br />Office 365 is the most up-to-date version. It contains features not in the perpetual license Office 2016 but is still labeled as Office 2016 until the release of Office 2019 next month.
<br />
<br />I hope this information helps. Please let me know if you have any more questions or require further help.
<br />
<br />Regards       
        </p>

<p>
</p><p>That was my initial thinking as well. I think we will let the VM continue the updates, and if it completely screws up, we can roll back to a previous checkpoint and just prevent it from getting updates down the road.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The VM doesn't have 2016 (O365 or otherwise) installed on it, so there is no possibility of 2016 and 2019 coexisting as a previous poster suggested.&nbsp;</p>

            I see this from time to time, even on a computer where I only have the mobile versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint installed. I will see updates for Office 2013 or Office 2016 when I have neither of those products installed.
<br />
<br />You are gonna see this for a while, especially in preview. Office 2019 Pro Plus (which I am also running in a VM) still uses the Office 2016 branding throughout. I guess when Microsoft releases near final builds or the general release, you will stop seeing updates for Office labeled as 2016.

            Right now Office 2019 is just one of the later builds of Office 2016 for Office 365 users, which is updated each month. Let the updates apply. There is no official "office 2019" yet. I am on insider fast, and it is still Office 2016, version 1810 (Oct
 2018) build.
