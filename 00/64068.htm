<h2>            Several updates fail - KB2918614, KB2798162, KB2893519 and KB3000988</h2>
                    <p>I just did a fresh install of Win 7 Pro x64 on a Gateway GT5644E. &nbsp;Everything went fine until I got to the above mentioned updates. &nbsp;They are the only 4 that come up when running "Windows Update" and they all fail with error code 800B0100.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to install one at a time and I ran "Fix It" from MS. &nbsp;When I tried to install directly from MS website, a message appeared stating that "this update in not for this system" or something like that. &nbsp;If these are not pertinent to this system,
 why are they showing as needed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure what to do. &nbsp;Please help.</p>

<h2>            Medal of Honor Airborne bugs</h2>
                    <p>Hi there!

  </p>

<p>&nbsp;

  </p>

<p>Great that MOH Airborne is the free Gold game. Now I finally can play with and against others to get the multiplayer achievements. Unfortunately the bugs inside the game makes this almost impossible...&nbsp;

  </p>

<p>&nbsp;

  </p>

<p>Yesterday I completed several games and set some score which were visible in the "stats" menu. Now almost all score are back to 0 or almost 0 again! Beside the reset trouble, a game often stops because a "connection lost". At the moment I'm playing for like 2 hours without any completed game. Another thing is when I search for a specific game mode or map, this request can be ignored.

  </p>

<p>&nbsp;

  </p>

<p>Achievements like play on every map once, get x kills and x objective points and get x 1st, 2nd and 3rd places are pretty impossible is the game is not saving. 

  </p>

<p>&nbsp;

  </p>

<p>Xbox, thanks for another free game, but maybe&nbsp;you can do something about this issue?

  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I am very sorry to hear this. But any bugs in the game would be an issue for the developer to take care of. I would suggest reaching out to EA or&nbsp;EA&nbsp;DICE. I am very sorry about this issue. But as it is a game issue the developer would need to take care of it. Just to set you up with the right expectations don't expect much. The game came out in&nbsp;August 28, 2007 so its very old and so its very unlikely a patch will happen. Also, its EA.</p><p><br /></p><p>Hope this helps, Happy Gaming!!!</p>

<h3> emmaclark992  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface pen tip</h2>
                    I just purchased a brand new Surface 3 from a Microsoft store. My pen came with the pen tips kit and I just tried replacing the tip but it would not come out. I followed the instructions provided and tried using both my hands and the provided tool to change
 the tip, but it would not budge.My sister also has a Surface 3 and her pen tip came right out when I tried hers. The tip still work fine, but I cant change it. Do I have to go to a Microsoft store and have them take the tip out or replace my pen? Please help!

</blockquote>
<p>Back in the days of DOS, the PrtScn key used to print the screen. But<br />
in all versions of Windows, this works differently, and the name of<br />
the key is now an anachronism. The key does <strong>not</strong> print the screen.<br />
PrtScrn captures the whole screen, and Alt-PrtScrn captures the active<br />
window.</p>
<p>Either one captures the image to the Windows clipboard. Once it's in<br />
the clipboard you can paste (Ctrl-V) it into any application that<br />
supports graphics (Windows Paint, other graphics programs, even your<br />
favorite word processor). You can edit or add to the image as you<br />
wish, then print it.</p>
<p>This ability to manipulate the image in a program before printing it<br />
is an improvement over the original DOS method of just printing it.<br />
But if you'd like that old facility back, there are several<br />
third-party freeware/shareware programs that can do this, such as<br />

<h3> samjoex  say:</h3>
<h2>            My old laptop is experiencing an infinite loop of disk repairs. It will not boot successfully. How can I resolve this&#63;</h2>
                    <p>A laptop I've used many times has had some kind of serious disk error. When I start up my computer, Windows initiates the Automatic Repair Process, and reboots around 10 seconds after the "Repairing disk errors. This might take over an hour to complete."
 message appears. I have done pretty much everything so far. I used a Windows 10 Media Disc, and none of the options have done anything. I had no restore points saved, so System Restore was rendered useless. Search for System Image also did nothing. The Revert
 to a previous build operation encountered an error, rendering it useless. Repair Boot Errors was almost no different from the infinite loop without the disc, with a blank Blue Screen appearing for a fraction of a second, and then a reboot. Finally, the Command
 Prompt procedure for this issue was of no use, as it wouldn't recognize the directories I typed in. I typed in DIR, and the C: Drive directory appeared with 0 bytes of used space, showing a file name of "0 Recovery.txt", which was 0 bytes in size. Free space
 was over 63,000,000,000 bytes. The Reset your PC option did not appear. I am about to attempt to find a Windows 7 installation disc I used earlier, as Microsoft no longer supplies Windows 7 ISOs, even when I entered my product key. Is there any way to resolve
 this issue?</p>

            I found my Windows 7 Installation Disc, and ran a Startup Repair from there. It was a bit more useful than Windows 10's repair. Although it did not resolve the problem, it allowed me to see the details from the repair attempt. Unfortunately, one of the
 reports said the partition was corrupted, so I ended up performing a fresh install of Windows 7. Consequently, data dating back to 2010 was lost. I'm pretty sure many of the non-replaceable items are backed up, though.

                    When I convert a Word 2007 document to a PDF file and then print both, the PDF has much larger margins and has shrunk each page of the document. How do I make the PDF file print with the same margins and font-size as the Word document?

<h2>            Windows 10 unable to add traditional Chinese.</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can neither download any traditional Chinese language nor add it by lpksteup (I got the language pack for the net)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been searching for similar questions in the past few hours and it seems that some people had the same problem at win 8. The resolutions are "to download by adding tra-Chinese(Hongkong)" . But today at win 10 i cannot add it neither by hongkong nor
 taiwan. Actually, none of the tran-Chinese is available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it my computer's fault or not? I bought it in Shanghai and the system is simplified Chinese .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me? There is a very important software i need that only run in traditional Chinese. Deeply thank anybody for his(hers) assistance who come to solve the problem.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 NMI hardware failure when installing video card driver</h2>
                    I have tried to update from windows 7&nbsp;to windows 10 and seems where ok until driver installation part in which I'm getting nmi hardware failure (or nmi hardware malfunction). With some research I figure out that it was caused by video card I pulled it
 out and successfully installed it on integrated video card ( which is sis 900). Thing is that currently my pc will only work properly if&nbsp;you wont install video driver, because after windows 10 was deployed I have installed back video card (ati 2400hd) and
 it worked fine on windows basic video adapter but when I tried to install driver from ati site or via drive update in device manger it get's nmi hardware fail bsod. I've tried 3 different video cards ( ati 2400, 7770 and r7 250) and all 3 have same issue when
 it comes to driver installation, thou all 3 video card works fine on other pcs. Bios update and fail safe didn't help either. Also windows 10 upgrade advisor didn't&nbsp;detect any
<span>compatibility</span> issue with updating to win10&nbsp;on this pc.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm also having similar issues. Windows 10 successfully upgraded, but randomly my graphic card (Nvidia GT430) will hang/fail and the NMI error shows, which forces me to hard reboot. I'm quite concern about my workstation, because it is an old unit HP xw4400
 Workstation, and the hardware might not be able to endure the hard reboot each time. I wasn't having the problem at all before the upgrade. I'm kind of disappointed with the product, to find out many users are facing the same problem. Appreciate if Microsoft
 would be able to rectify it the soonest. Thanks.</p>
<p>Regards</p>

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>Nope. It didn't work. Its still doing the same thing after I uninstalled the driver and redo it in the compatibility mode. Videos from internet keeps on hanging every now and then. Any other methods? I've deleted my old windows 7 installation files to safe
 disk space, now I have no turning back and stuck with it here...</p>

            <p>Hi there - I have the exact same intel board - with Xeon processors - The E5450 3,0.</p>
<p>Did you find a solution? - I have had many issues lately - with crashing. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Im pretty sure is a hardware issue - since it happened also few times in windows 7 pro and now in 10 pro - but lately it have also happened once inside the bios or during startup.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done many stress tests - but temperature etc. does not seems to be high - and it is not always in high cpu/gpu usage that it crashes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Nvidia geforce GTX 670 - and it crashed more when i have two monitors on it = i consider that the reason - but its bit bad if i first go and buy a new graphics board - to find out that it is the maybe the cpu or ram or mainboard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In windows it made this error - NMI hardware - this was after i restored bios to default settings - (all except that i use some raid setup) - and before i did this it also once made a WHEA_UNCORRECTABLE_ERROR</p>
<p>
</p><p>So any help would be appreciated to try finding the reason/bad hardware - that i need to replace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot in advance.&nbsp;</p>
&nbsp;

            <p>Same at my Desktop PC</p>
<p>I had an Matrox Grafix Adapter with 4 (four) 1080p Displays and W7 Professional. I was informed via W10 Update the Grafix Adapter is not supportet.</p>
<p>So i changed to an NVIDIA 610. Everything fine under W7 Prof. After the Upgrade to W10 freezing situation. Only the native Microsoft driver are working with an poor screen resolution and only ONE Display.</p>
<p>OK Changed to an ATI Grafix Adapter (540) an also only the Microsoft default driver is working with an poor resolution also and only one display. I would be fine with 2 Displays but one is not acceptable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>THE NMI hardware error ist still there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my opinion this is an case for an compesation. The Upgrade Checker from Microsoft told me with the NVIDIA Adapter everything is fine under W7 Prof----upgrade now!</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that the Problems began.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anybody who has Contact to Microsoft an NVIDIA/ATI ?</p>
<p>Do they work on that issues?</p>

    <title>External HDD disconnects when writing to it mid-way - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> muhammad usama_9  say:</h3>
<h2>            External HDD disconnects when writing to it mid-way</h2>
                    I've been having this issue that when I plug my usb 3.0 external HDD (Hitachi hts547550A9E384 SATA-300 in a WD Elements SE Portable HDD enclosure) to a usb 3.0 port, the copy fails mid way and shows either "Error:&nbsp;0x8007045D", "Error:&nbsp;0x80070037" or just
 a dialog box which says that the destination doesn't exist. However, on the usb 2.0 port the copy successfully executes. I've tried other USB 3.0 ports. I've tried checking the hdd for bad sectors and a "sfc scannow" but that didn't help. The external hdd
 works fine on my other computer with usb 3.0 port. Please help. Thanks!

</p><p><strong>"Error 0x8007045D: the request could not be performed because of an I/O device error"</strong> and
<strong>"Error 0x80070037: the specified network resource or device is no longer available”</strong> means that the external HDD gets disconnected when trying to copy files from your computer. Since the issue doesn't occur on the other computer's USB 3.0 it
 means that your computer's USB 3.0 is failing. With that being said, its best that you reach out to your Original Equipment Manufacturer's support web page for more in-depth troubleshooting of the issue.</p>

    <title>Activate Two Finger Scrolling - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lenala39  say:</h3>
<h2>            Activate Two Finger Scrolling</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just installed Windows 8.1 and now I want to enable Two Finger Scrolling on my Touchpad. I have a windows ps/2 (compatible) mouse on a Lenovo ThinkPad E330.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I dont have a Synaptics driver, I cant use the TFS-programm. And I dont know, if I can install a Synaptics driver for my mouse. I already tried it, but when I try to install it, I just get the error message: installation failed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also downloaded the "AutoScroll" driver from the lenovo site. But after installing and restarting my laptop nothing changes.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And when I got to my Mouse settings, I cant update or change the driver anymore.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope there is a way somebody can help me!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Windows Media Player Registry Damage</h2>
                    A portion of the registry for Windows Media Player was removed from my Windows Vista OS. As a result, All aspects of WMP still function except video display. Can this be repaired without reinstalling the OS? Perhaps by manually entering the missing registry
 entries into my registry from a functioning Windows Vista OS.

<p><span>Hi Asha52075,</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Windows Vista Answers Forums!</span></p>
<p><span>First you can try to run a
<strong>System File checker tool</strong>. This tool will fix the system files that are corrupted.</span></p>
<p><span>Steps to perform SFC scan:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Click the Start button</span></p>
<p><span>2. From the Start Menu, Click All programs followed by Accessories</span></p>
<p><span>3. In the Accessories menu, Right Click on the Command Prompt option</span></p>
<p><span>4. From the drop down menu that appears, Click on the 'Run as administrator' option</span></p>
<p><span>5. If you have the User Account Control (UAC) enabled, you will be asked for authorization prior to the command prompt opening. You may simply need to press the
 Continue button if you are the administrator or insert the administrator password etc.</span></p>
<p><span>6. In the Command Prompt window, type: sfc /scannow and then press Enter</span></p>
<p><span>7. A message will appear stating that 'The system scan will begin'</span></p>
<p><span>8. Be patient because the scan may take some time</span></p>
<p><span>9. If any files require replacing SFC will replace them. You may be asked to insert your Vista DVD for this process to continue</span></p>
<p><span>10. If everything is okay you should, after the scan, see the following message "Windows resource protection did not find any integrity violations"</span></p>
<p><span>11. After the scan has completed, close the command prompt window, restart the computer and check.
</span></p>
<p><span>You may also disable the Security software and check whether the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful.</span></p>

<p>Ok so I've tried these steps and still no luck! I now get a error message "error applying security" an error occured while applying security information ACCESS DENIED!!!<br />
Is there any other suggestions???</p>
</blockquote>
<br />
Here is an easy way and fool-proof way. Use the tutorial below. Use Method One.<br />
After you have the Take Ownership of a File option in your Context Menu, go back to the file you want to remove.<br />
Highlight the file, then Right click on the file, click Take Ownership. You will be prompted to confirm the action, click Continue or enter admin password. Now try to delete.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
You need to give permissions to the File/folder, follow the steps below:<br />
<br />
# Right-click the file and select Properties.<br />
# Click on the Security tab.<br />
# Click Advanced in the lower right.<br />
# In the Advanced Security Settings window that pops up, click on the Owner tab.<br />
# Click Edit.<br />
# Click Other users or groups.<br />
# Click Advanced in the lower left corner.<br />
# Click Find Now.<br />
# Scroll through the results and double-click on your current user account.<br />
# Click OK to all of the remaining windows except the first Properties window.<br />
# Select your user account from the list up top and click Edit.<br />
# Select your user account from the list up top again and then in the pane below, check Full control under Allow, or as much control as you need.<br />
# You’ll get a security warning, click Yes.<br />
# On some files that are essential to Windows, you’ll get a “Unable to save permission changes… access is denied” warning and there’s nothing that you can do about it to the best of my knowledge.<br />
<br />
$ Good Luck $

<p>That said, someone using Hotmail and receiving smut is not the same as someone using Hotmail and distributing smut.&nbsp; I suspect your situation is the former.&nbsp; Microsoft can do little about that except to beef up the junk mail scanning.&nbsp; However, the&nbsp;<a href="http://windowslivehelp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows

<h2>            flying RCXD&#39;s and other issues.</h2>
                    
<p>okay so me and my clan were playing last night just team death match. now our RCXD's all ran forwards and backwards on the floor but the other teams RCXD's flew left and right through the sky. is this a glitch?</p>
<p>also can someone tell me how a level 1 player can have a flame thrower plus second chance pro?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>he started with the flame thrower in each match (as he was on our team at first) and when he was shot he hit the ground the revive badge thing above his head popped up. how can he do that?</p>

<p>i don't have a youtube account. but yeah i'll try. will have to see if my clan members can go through all their vids as well as it wasn't just me that saw it. i forgot to mention the other team we were playing against kept sending us messages to go back
 into their game after we got fed up and left. been going through the internet and it seems that the RCXD problem is quite common also theres links to hackers and things...</p>
<p>[View:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXgx3N_dFCs]</p>
<p>this is one that i have been linked to, it's not flying rcxds but it's a hacked black ops game.</p>

<p>also further search of youtube showed me many flying RCXDs this is one of them.
</p>
<p>so i wasn't imagining that now, now the other question of how a level 1 can have a flamethrower and last stand pro which i am still trying to figure out.</p>

<p>My problem with YT is that's where all the crap is. What I've seen on YT, I have yet to see in my 14+ days playing the game. Linking a bunch of YT videos doesn't really convince me anything. That's where people(not everyone) go to show off and boast about
 stuff like that imo. People watch that garbage on YT long enough and they'll believe anything they see is a cheat, mod or hack everytime they die.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not calling you a liar and I'm not saying these things don't exist. I'm just saying they're not as common as some claim them to be. I can count on one hand how many times I ran into a hacked or modded lobby in MW2 and the worst thing I've experienced
 in Black Ops is where a team locks down all but a couple of spawns and spawn kills the other team repeatedly, and that's only a built-in flaw in the game imo.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd like to see your footage.</p>

<p>i'm not saying they're hacks, the flying RCXD looking at it looks like a glitch, i just wanted to know if they were known hacks or glitches because the game was horrible and unplayable by the end.
</p>
<p>the idiot with the flamethrower threw me he is the only thing i can't find looking up. all i wanted to know is were they glitches not to be asked to prove it or it didn't happen. like i said i can only access 2 gamertags (this one and the BFs) and i will
 look into it and post the footage i can, i know i have footage of flying RCXD's and of the flamethrower but my Clan buddy in Germany was the one that revived him. &nbsp;this is the first time i have seen it. which is why i am asking.</p>
<p>plus the guys that the flying RCXD's &nbsp;kept sending us messages to get us to go back to the game.</p>
<p>one has already been reported (this isn't his actual tag, but most of it.) Mike Oxlong. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Surface won&#39;t turn on</h2>
                    <p>I've had my surface pro 3 for a bit over a year now, and the other day it shut off and would not turn back on. I finally got it back on with the two button force restart. However two days ago it did the same thing, and nothing will get it to come back on.
 I've tried EVERYTHING. When I plug it into the charger, the light on the charger indicates it is charging. If I try to restart it at all, nothing happens. No flashing, no screen, no lights. It's like I'm not doing anything.</p>
<p>I really can't afford to lose the data on this laptop, and I do back it up but not nearly as frequently as I probably should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if anyone has had this problem or has any suggestions.... please help</p>

<h2>            Boot problems - Can get to UEFI screen but after save and reset, blue screen with keyboard and mouse</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Surface Pro 3 started acting up a few days ago. It started with the computer turning completely off anytime the power cord was disconnected from the computer. &nbsp;I went to the power and realized that it was plugged in and wasn't charging. &nbsp;So I started
 through the debug for that at the following page.&nbsp;https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/warranty-service-and-recovery/surface-wont-turn-on-battery-wont-charge?os=windows-10&amp;=undefined</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I only got to Solution 1 which was to power down windows and charge it for 30 minutes. &nbsp;I did that and when I did, I started to see a "Critical_Process_Failure" or something close (it flashed on the screen) as it was continuously rebooting. I let is charge
 for another 30 minutes and then when i hit the power button, i got sent to the UEFI setup screen. &nbsp;When I hit save and reset, I get sent to a blank blue screen with a mouse and keyboard icon in the top right corner. &nbsp;When i click it a smaller keyboard shows
 up and I can hit function buttons and regular keys but it doesn't do anything. &nbsp;If I leave it alone, it times out pretty quickly and shuts down. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to get out of that screen without using a recovery USB drive? &nbsp;I'd rather not lose my settings and apps if possible.</p>

            <p>Hi Renee,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting this question in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to check if Quickbooks 2002 is
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/win8/CompatCenter/ProductViewerWithDefaultFilters?TempOsid=win8&amp;Locale=en-us&amp;TextSearch=quickbooks%2B2002&amp;Type=Both&amp;CurrentPage=0&amp;TotalPages=1&amp;ShowCriteria=0&amp;SortCriteria=Relevance&amp;Compatibility=Unknown&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">compatible</a>
 with Windows 8. You may try running the program in <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">compatibility mode</a>
 and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also contact
<a href="http://support.quickbooks.intuit.com/support/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Quickbook support</a> for any updated version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps and do let us know if you need further assistance. We will be glad to help.</p>

            <p>I have had QB 2002 Pro running both on Windows 7 &amp; 8. &nbsp;Despite Microsoft stating that it isn't compatible, this is what I did:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>You must have kept the last QB Backup file onto a separate HD (I use an ext HD for all files, which are shortcut onto my Laptop. &nbsp;</li><li>Insert your original QB CD &amp; run it as Administrator. &nbsp;Hopefully, you have kept your Registration details?</li><li>Once downloaded, open a New Company with similar name to your previously used &amp; go through the Set up procedures, which may only be roughly entered because this will change when you restore from your Backup.</li><li>Once that new company is setup, just click File - Restore and select your previous company last Backup. &nbsp;Hey presto, you've now done it!</li></ol>
<p>With Windows 8, whenever you want to access your QB file, it will always ask if you want it to change settings - just click YES!</p>
<p>
</p><p>As yet, I have not loaded 8.1, purely because I'm not sure if the above procedures will would allow me to continue using my QB 2002 Pro. &nbsp;When I am brave enough to try it, will let you know the outcome!</p>

            Hi Robert, <br /><br />When you say email page, what email client do you mean? Are you using outlook? Are you using a web browser (what one? Edge, Chrome, Etc.) to access your email? <br /><br />Let me know! <br />- Charlie (btw “on vacation” has me laughing. I’m going to steal that from you, ha!)
