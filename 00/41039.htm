</span></span></span>When exactly do you get this error message?</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>What is the complete error message?</p>

<p>lsasrv.dll: Microsoft Local Security Authority Server&nbsp;is an important security DLL which decrypts all local password hashing schemes on the computer. lsasrv.dll is a system process
 that is needed for your Windows system to work properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Run System File Checker scan and see if that helps you.</p>
<p>Check this link for information to do this:
<b><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310747" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310747</a></b></p>
<p><b>Description of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 System File Checker (Sfc.exe)</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>You need to perform repair installation of Windows XP to fix this issue if SFC scan doesn’t fix the issue. If you have an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) installation of the
 Operating system (OS) on your computer, I'd suggest you to get in touch with the manufacturer to obtain the installation CD or the recovery CD to fix this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Note:
</b>Make sure you take the backup of all the important data before repairing Windows XP</p>

            If you are seeing a message like this:<br />
<br />
lsass.exe - Unable To Locate Component<br />
This application failed to start because LSASRV.DLL was not found.&nbsp; Re-installating the application may fix this problem.<br />
<br />
Then when you click OK, you have nothing but a moveable mouse cursor.<br />
<br />
If that is the case, you will not be booting into any kind of Safe Mode either.<br />
<br />
Let's look at the Microsoft Engineer replies, shall we?<br />
<br />
It <span style="font-style: italic">is</span> a good copy/paste that does not help you.<br />
<br />
 like this:<br />
<br />
Windows File Protection could not initiate a scan of protected system files.<br />
The specific error code is 0x000006ba [The RPC server is unavailable.].<br />
<br />
You cannot start the RPC Server in Safe Mode either.<br />
<br />
Finally running sfc /scannow will not replace the file since that is not what sfc /scannow does.<br />
<br />
 problem is or how to fix it".<br />
<br />
Plus, the KB article contains this dire warning which should send you running in the other directions as fast as you can:<br />
<br />
<b>Important</b><span style="font-style: italic"> Reinstalling the Windows operating system or performing an in-place upgrade of your operating system is an extreme troubleshooting step that you should only take if you fully understand the ramifications and
 risks involved. If you decide to take this step, make sure that you have the original Windows XP installation media and product key that was included with your operating system. If you are not comfortable trying to reinstall or repair the Windows operating
 system, you might want to contact your computer manufacturer for help or bring your computer to a professional repair shop.&nbsp;&nbsp; This operation reinstalls Windows XP to the same folder on your computer where it was originally installed.</span><br />
<br />
That means you will essentially be stating from scratch with your system and have to do considerable downloading, reconfiguring, and reinstalling of many things.&nbsp; It also assumes you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD (many people do not).&nbsp; That does
 not sound like to much fun to me.<br />
<br />
What will work with that error?&nbsp; That depends on how you answer the following questions that should have been asked automatically by the MS Answers forums when you created your new question - then you would probably be done by now.<br />
<br />
Since the Microsoft Answers forum does not prompt for any kind of system information when a new question is asked so we know absolutely nothing about your system.&nbsp; Not knowing fundamental information about a problem prolongs the frustration and agony of resolving
 these issues.<br />
<br />
Thank you MS Answers, for making the resolution of simple problems as frustrating and time consuming as possible.<br />
<br />
Please provide additional information about your system as best you can:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
Does your system have IDE or SATA drives?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?&nbsp; (this includes plug pulling, power buttons, removing the battery, etc.)<br />
<br />
Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive (internal or external)?<br />
<br />
Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD (this is not the same as any Recovery CDs that came with your system)?<br />
<br />
What do you see that you don't think you should be seeing and when do you see it?<br />
<br />
If the system used to work properly, what do you think might have changed since the last time it did work properly?<br />

            You should go into Desktop mode and then install. Then you can come back to tablet mode.
<br />
<br />Windows Key+A &gt; Tap Tablet mode to come out (and come into) tablet mode.

            <p>If you were banned for one day or 24 hours there is nothing you can do. However if the suspension was longer then a day you can file to have your case reviewed by the enforcement team. That way they can hear your side of the story. If you are interested in doing this Here is how to do it.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /></p><p>You will need to go to <a href="http://enforcement.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://enforcement.xbox.com</a> sign in and click the orange hammer in the top left of the site.This will take you to your enforcement history page. Find the current enforcement effecting your account. Next to it on the right you should see a link that say submit a case review. Click on that and follow the prompts.</p>

<p>added the dump file with Driver Verifier has (Verifier added on the end of it). It was the same BSOD error though (BAD_POOL_CALLER). Also wiped my OC on my CPU &amp; GPU while re-booting after enabling Driver Verifier. Will do the memtest while waiting on your
 response, thanks.</p>

            <p>Ran the memtest and it came back with nothing. Also reinstalled Windows 10 Pro x64 and it didn't fix the issue either. After I turned on driver verifier it wouldn't boot past the windows loading screen without blue screening posting the error message "Verifier__Detected_Violation
 (mvxxmm.sys)" but it didn't produce any dump files for these blue screens (let it do it about 8 times before booting into safe mode and resetting verifier settings.) Here are about 7 BSOD dump files from the past hour.&nbsp;</p>

            Have you tried removing the profile and then reloading it?&nbsp; You could also try performing a hard reset EXACTLY like this. Hold the power button on the console for 8 seconds or until the power shuts down completely.&nbsp; Unplug the power cord from the back
 of the console for 5 minutes.&nbsp; Plug the power cord back in and restart the console.<br />

Hi II Vegas Man II,</p>
<p>1. Have you installed .NET programming tool on your computer?<br />
2. Did you make any changes prior to the issue?</p>
<p>We don't think there is a default password set. However try entering the administrator password and check the result.</p>
<p>If the computer boots to the desktop, then try the following steps and check the result.<br />
<strong>Step 1:</strong> Remove password entry option<br />
a. Login as an administrator.<br />
b. Click Start, type run, click Run, type "control userpasswords2" and click ok.<br />
c. Uncheck ""Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer" option and click ok.<br />
d. Restart the computer and check the difference.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> If you're unable to boot the computer to the desktop, then restore the computer using Vista DVD.<br />
a. Insert the Windows installation disc in the disc drive, and then start the computer.<br />
b. Press a key when you are prompted.<br />

</p><p>But it wouldn't hurt to go to your manufacturer's site to update all firmware &amp; software drivers. Current BIOS version is also in MSInfo32. Compare versions to what is in Device Manager. If greater at the site, first try to update it using Device Manager

            Yes I knew I forgot something there. it was working real good until about a month or so ago. in fact I have burnt about 150- 200 DvD's with it already. it was working really good. I took a little break on DVD burning for a few days. when I got back to
 burning some more DVD's. I burnt 2 disc and it was kind of acting up a bit burning those last 2 disc's. and then boom it would not recognize D drive or ext. hard drive and burner and at one point I could not even print anything. it stopped recognizing the
 printer too. but ya I will have to reboot and go in to bios and check on that. And all that burning I was doing. I was not even using any windows programs for that and it was working just great. why it did a sudden 180 on me I have no idea. ok I was in the
 bios in config. there was USB, serial ATA(SATA), Intel (R) AMT. the UEFI BIOS date 8-8-11. does have a bios update option. Model#424049U. But it said I had to be a supervisor to get in to the boot order.&nbsp; as far as listing an actual DVD di

<h2>            Legality of Windows 10 Generic Key</h2>
                    <p>Hi Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First time posting here, hope you don't mind my curiosity.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Scenario:<br />
</strong>Recently a friend of mine bought about 70+ desktops for their company from Vendor X. Initially, the advertisement included "Desktops with preloaded Windows 10", however they found out that the desktops was only installed with Windows 10 Generic Key,
 all of them was installed with key 8PTT60RNW4C-6V7J2-C2D3X-MHBPB. The vendor did gave them a set of activation keys via printed paper but it cannot be activated. Due to complication of vendor not able to provide CoA, my friend had to purchase Windows 10 license
 from an official reseller.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I have not dealt with Microsoft licensing before (I am from Support background, primarily Security &amp; Wireless, but have not handled Desktops nor Servers before), hence my queries here:</p>
<p><em>1. What are the implication of using the generic keys? Will Windows prompts "please activate Windows"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>2. What will happen to a corporation or individual if they are found out using generic keys by Microsoft? (fine? reputation impact to corporation? etc. etc.)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>3. I read from random sources online (non-Microsoft) that these keys are used to complete the installation of Windows BUT it can be used for Home and / or&nbsp; VMs, is this true?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>4. What are the impacts to Microsoft? (aside from financially affected)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your time.</p>
<p>

            Hi,
<br />generic key gives no usage rights, it serves for internal purposes for installation only. Even if someone will activate Windows using this key it does not mean legality. See EULA: You are authorized to use this software only if you are properly licensed... Successful activation does not confirm that the software is genuine or properly licensed. 
<br />
<br />Seller had to give COAs with product key. Here is a part of Microsoft document for OEM: So you may require a refund.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cce1e98f-f2c7-40bd-b9c1-389b6786d5a5?upload=true" />

            Hi N.Cat,
<br />
<br />The generic keys will deactivate within a period of time, they can only be used for installation of Windows, not as some form of permanent actiation
<br />
<br />It is a myth that those keys can be used to permanently activate Windows Home, VM's or any other Edition of Windows
<br />
<br />Your friend needs to acquire legit licences for those PC's and apply those licences, if he is still using those licences, he is breaking the End User Licence agreement and is liable for prosecution . . .

<h2>            How do I add a program to &#34;All Apps&#34; in the start menu after I have once removed it&#63;</h2>
                    I deleted Opera from the All Apps section of the start menu by opening its file location and deleted it there. I've tried putting it back into that location but it won't allow shortcuts to be made there and instead reroutes it to the desktop. If I put
 the .exe into that location, all I get is a pinned tile for Opera, but it's not in the All Apps section nor can it be found through searching.

            <p>I had a similar but different question -- I just wanted a stand-alone .exe file to show up in that list.&nbsp;&nbsp; In my case, Putty.exe, a simple terminal program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With some hints from <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/225654/how-to-organize-and-add-shortcuts-to-the-all-apps-list-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
howtogeek.com</a>, I think I figured out one simple way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To add this as a "this user only" app, it seems you could add it to</p>
<p>
</p><p>c:\Users\&lt;YourUsername&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE:&nbsp; the AppData folder is hidden.&nbsp; And "Start Menus" has a space.&nbsp; Plus, of course, you'll have to put in your username as it is encoded</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case, I added a folder named Putty, then created a shortcut to Putty.exe and moved it into that folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now it shows up under "All Apps".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another way that would make it accessible to all users would be to add it to C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE:&nbsp; This requires admin access.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, note that C:\ProgramData is a hidden directory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that helps.</p>

            If you didn't get a driver installation disk with the computer, go to the manufacturer's web site and download the drivers for your computer model.&nbsp; Use another computer, if necessary, and copy the drivers to a flash drive or CD.

<p>New computers that come preinstalled with Windows 7 often have what is called a recovery partition. This is used to reinstall the operating system in the event of a system crash. To access it, you will need to boot into when you start your computer by pressing
 a function key. This can be either F1, F2, F9, F10, F11, F12 or even DEL or Tab key. Consult the owners manual that came with your PC for instructions about how to reinstall Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is how the recovery partition is accessed for the most popular makes..</p>
<p>For Dell, press CTRL + F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p>For HP, press F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p>For LG, press F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p>For Toshiba, press and hold '0' BEFORE and during the power up</p>
<p>For Acer, press and hold ALT + F10 as soon as you see the logo</p>
<p>For Asus, press F9 as soon as you see the Asus logo.</p>
<p>For Samsung, press F4 at power up.. </p>
<p>For Fujitsu, press the F8 key repeatedly directly after powering up</p>
<p>For Advent, restart your computer. Then Press F10 repeatedly until the message "Starting System Recovery" is displayed</p>
<p>For Sony VAIO, restart and press "F8" or "F10" repeatedly until the "Advanced Boot Options" screen appears.</p>

                    <p>After I installed windows 10, I am having problems with all my programs not responding. After 8 days or research on how to fix the problem, I thought I found a final good solution: to "clean" restart.</p>
<p>The problem continues, however. Now, I cannot even get to open a program. Windows explorer freezes and is not responding or it is very slow. But in the end, I cannot&nbsp; open the document of program I need to work on.</p>

            <p>Why-o-why did I change to Windows 10 from 8.1? I had got used to to 8.1 with all it's foibles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I too have <strong>HUGE problems with Windows 10</strong> - it very frequently gives a program "<strong>not responding</strong>" message - and the only way out is to crash/close the offending program either directly or through Task Manager. The problem happens
 mainly when a program like Excel wants to load a file, but a CAD program, 123D, crashes right at startup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect the problem to be associated with Win10's installation. It took 2 attempts at downloading and installing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am scared to revert to Win8.1 because I suspect that the problem would be carried back from Win10.
<br />
</p>
<p>Restarting Windows offers some help sometimes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A solution is <strong>URGENT.</strong></p>

            <p>Hi Lumisa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10 and sorry to hear about the inconvenience caused.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What do you mean by clean restart?</li></ul>
<p>This problem seems to be with outdated chipset and also with program compatibility.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We might have to check with the computer manufacturer website for updated BIOS and chipset drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you don't find it in computer manufacturer website, try to visit the mother board manufacturer website and check for updated drivers.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Vinz,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am desperate for some help here, but MS seems to be bogged down with the many problems caused by Windows 10. I shall have to revert to Win8.1 unless this can be resolved soon (I understand this option is only valid for a month).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please tell me if:</p>
<p>
</p><p>* The bug that causes programs to crash in Win10 will carry back to Win8.1 if I take this route?</p>
<p>
</p><p>* Having gone back to Win8.1, will the free upgrade to (a debugged) Win10/Win10.1 still be available to me?</p>

            Hi liannawright 
<br />
<br />My name is Sarah Kong and I am an independent adviser that is here to try and help you with your issue.
<br />
<br />TwinUI is actually a bug so it's good that it is gone from your machine.
<br />Probably a recent update fixed it.
<br />However you might want to check for corruption.
<br />
<br />You can try a couple things.
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />In Command prompt type sfc /scannow and press enter.
<br />Restart the computer.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work then try this, 
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />
<br />In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. 
<br />Press Enter key after each command:
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />
<br />Important: When you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that are required to fix corruptions.
<br />To close the Administrator: Command prompt window, type Exit, and then press Enter. 
<br />Restart your computer.

            Hi liannawright ,&nbsp;
<br />My name is Lucia. I am an Independent Advisor. Thanks for contacting us.
<br />
<br />TWinUI — or Tablet Windows User Interface — is included in Windows 8 and newer. It’s not a program on its own, but rather a system library that is part of the Windows Shell that provides a set of functionality — including starting applications to Windows itself and other programs. TWINUI is often mistaken for a built‐in PDF viewer or email client in forums and discussion online. This is most likely because most users will only encounter the name “TWINUI” when they either open a PDF file from their browsers or click on a mailto:, call:, or other protocol link recognized by the Windows app launcher.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/what-is-twinui" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/what-is-twinui</a>
<br />
<br />Because you already have a program to open your PDFs, then the system knows that you should no longer use it.
<br />
<br />I wish I had helped you.
<br />Best regards

<h2>            Upgrading to Windows 10&#58;  Flashing Colors</h2>
                    I have a less-than-one year old Dell Inspiron desktop.&nbsp; Despite several attempts to upgrade to my free Windows 10, it gets to a certain point and then there's this incredible flashing of colors all over the monitor.&nbsp; With the lights off it looks like the
 Kill Room.&nbsp; The first time it occured, I turned off the monitor, went to bed and 8 hrs later, it was still going strong.&nbsp; There's no way to get it to stop unless I hit the power button on the tower, which I absolutely hate to do.&nbsp; Then when I restart, I get
 a message and a scolding that I didn't shut the computer down properly.&nbsp; What gives? Why won't Windows 10 install and play nice?

<h2>            WiFi Change Does Not Allow Skype App to Work from my Laptop</h2>
                    <p>I bought an annual subscription for calling from my laptop. It works fine from my home, through my WiFi through my internet provider. When I visited my sister and tried to run Skype through HER WiFi and internet provider, the Skype App would not login and
 did not recognize my ID. I gave up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm about to go visit her again, so I thought I would ask the question before I leave - has anyone ever had a similar problem - is there a settings issue authenticating my Skype account because I am not connected to my home internet provider/because I purchased
 my subscription through a local company?</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to the Skype Community Forum.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Will you be using the same laptop to log in to Skype and connect to your sister's Wi-Fi? If so, it clearly indicates that your sister's internet connection has a restriction.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Some networks are likely to have a firewall, and it may have been configured to block all access to exactly the ports Skype is trying to use. Try disabling your
 personal firewall altogether and connecting to Skype -- if it still doesn't work, the network you're using is likely to be at fault. In this case, you'll have to get in touch with her network administrator and/or service provider to know how to solve the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have further questions kindly reply to this thread.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Regards,</span></span></p>

    <title>Absolute worst customer service - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nicolemcintosh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Absolute worst customer service</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft Surface Support has the absolute worst customer service I have ever dealt with. Ever. I’m not sure if the problem is a broken system or employee incompetence but the customer experience is horrible!</p>
<p><strong>Problem</strong>: Surface Pro 3 with cracked screen. I did not drop it. I was in a work meeting and couldn’t figure out why my touch screen wasn’t functioning. Looked at it at another angle and noticed the crack. I dropped my previous tablet so I
 already know this is probably not under warranty and probably going to cost me $350.00 to replace. Fine.</p>
<p><strong>Replacement Attempt #1</strong>- I called the support line and spoke to “Jean.” She said that because I didn’t drop it, the devise might still be under warranty. She processed the request to have it inspected using my gmail account. She assured me
 that after the inspection, if it was found not to be under warranty, the service department would call me so I could pay the $350.00 for the replacement. I finished the request and shipped it out through FedEx. Nobody ever called. I just got the tablet back
 still broken. I emailed “Jean” using the email that she had previously responded to me and never got and answer.
</p>
<p>Call time: 40 minutes</p>
<p><strong>Replacement Attempt #2</strong>- I called the support line again; spoke to unknown male (Person 2). I told Person 2 what had happened and he refused to help me until I “verified my Microsoft account.” This was the first time I was asked for this
 and I did not have access to that email account at the time. I gave him my name, my service request number, my device serial number, and the gmail account that I had used to process the request and he still refused to help me. He said he could see the information
 but he “wasn’t able to help me” unless I got access to that microsoft account and gave him the 8 digit verification number that he wanted. He told me to call back when I had it; then he hung up on me.
</p>
<p>Call time: 30 minutes</p>
<p><strong>Replacement Attempt #3</strong>- I called the support line again immediately and spoke with “Valein.” She was unable to figure out who I was speaking with before and who hung up on me. Valein started helping with the replacement and never mentioned
 any verification at all. It never came up. Valein, however, kept putting me on hold to “check the details.” After about 20 minutes of on and off holds so she could “check the details” I told her she could probably just ask me for whatever information she was
 looking for. That helped a bit. When we finally got to the payment portion Valein could not figure out the difference between a “shipping” address and a “billing” address. I had to explain it three times because she kept reversing it as she tried to run my
 card for the $350.00 and kept getting error codes. She said I needed to call my bank and get the authorization code, then call back (with a completely different person) and complete the process. I was not having it! She agreed to call me back in 1 hour at
 which time I would have the authorization code. </p>
<p>Call time: 40 minutes</p>
<p>I called my bank for the code and they said that no transaction ever attempted! So I don’t know what Valein was doing, but apparently she was not charging my card for the $350.00. The bank said she needed to check the numbers and do it again. Valein did
 not call in 1 hour as agreed. At this point I am beyond fed up. So I got online and figure out how to do the replacement process myself. I paid and shipped it through FedEx. Another 2 hours after that, Valein finally calls when I can’t answer and leaves a
 message. Then she sends an email with instructions on how to complete the process online (which I’ve already done) and says “<span>I tried to call you on the number you provided over the
 chat. However, I am unable to reach you. Please feel free to respond on this email if you need further assistance or you may contact this no:<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(17, 85, 204, 1)">1-800-642-7676</span></span>.”
</p>
<p>I responded to Valein’s email that she called 2 hours late when I was no longer available. I further explained that I had done the process on my own, paid for everything and sent the device out and she should not try to charge my card again. Just in case
 she figured out how to correctly charge the card. </p>
<p>Three days later!!!!! I get a call from Valein asking if I figured out how to do it online. … So now I know she either didn’t receive or just didn’t read my response email. When I asked why she didn’t timely call me back she blamed it on the time difference.
 … Pretty sure “in one hour” is the same in any time zone but okay. </p>
<p><strong>Confirmation Attempt</strong>- It had been 8 days since I sent in the device and I still hadn’t received confirmation that Microsoft had received it. I called the support line again and spoke to “John.” John CANNOT HELP ME UNLESS I VERIFY MY MICROSOFT
 ACCOUNT!!!! Apparently, only the male support agents want this information. It’s okay, I know how to play this game now; I was ready. All I want to do is verify that it was received. It took John 20 minutes to answer this simple question. 20 minutes on and
 off hold while he “checked the details.” I really shouldn’t take 20 minutes to find out whether support has received the tablet.</p>
<p>The answer was yes, they received it 4 days ago. &nbsp;Great! When am I going to receive the replacement? John has no idea. He doesn’t know if it will take a week, or two weeks or a month! According to John, Microsoft is out of stock of my specific model so they
 are going to hold my tablet INDEFINITELY until corporate or a store receives one. And he has no idea how long that will take. **** excuse me??!!!?</p>
<p>Mind you, the Surface Pro 4 has been out about 3 months now so I don’t think they are even making the Pro 3 anymore. So what happens if they don’t get another 3?? John doesn’t know. Then why don’t they send me another model; I paid the $350.00 for the replacement?
 John says that is against policy. &nbsp;This is NOT how customer service is supposed to work! If Microsoft doesn’t have one they should send me a different model, not hold my tablet “indefinitely!”
</p>
<p>I asked to speak to a supervisor. I was placed on hold for about 10 minutes until&nbsp; a recorded message said “We’re sorry. Your call could not be complete. Please hang up and call the toll free number again.”</p>
<p>Call time: 40 minutes. </p>
<p><strong>Microsoft Store</strong>- I called the local Microsoft store and explained what I’ve been dealing with. They said they couldn’t help at all because the support line is a completely different system. He offered to do an in store exchange for me…but
 this of course depends on my being able to get my table BACK from Microsoft! He took all the information I had on the transactions and said he would pass it on to the “resolution center” and they will give me a call. I won’t hold my breath for that call.
</p>
<p>So now Microsoft has my money ($350.00 for replacement) and my tablet (worth $1,000.00) and I don’t know what else to do! There is no complaint phone number. I haven’t been able to speak to a supervisor. The store can’t help me because the systems are different!
 Who is going to fix this problem!!!</p>

NicoleMcIntosh,</a></p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>First of all, I'm very sorry to hear about your experience. That's not how we want our Surface users to feel after contacting support.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately&nbsp;I'm unable to look into this from a forum point of view&nbsp;since the exchange order contains sensitive information and has to be handled by the technical support,&nbsp;but you should definitely contact&nbsp;the
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Surface Support</a>&nbsp;via phone or chat and provide them with your reference number and have access to the Microsoft&nbsp;account that the order is created on so they can investigate further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason for verifying the account is to protect your information but I have full understanding of your frustration&nbsp;after the time you've spent trying to get answers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you contact the support team&nbsp;again,&nbsp;they should be able to give you information if there&nbsp;are&nbsp;order updates available or at least get back to you when they have more information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope your further contact with us will be a positive experience and I hope the issue will be resolved quickly.

</p><p>I would suggest you to try the methods below and check if it helps:</p>
<p>

6. Click "<strong><span>save changes"</span></strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Method 2: System Restore</span></strong></span></p>
<p>You may have recently made a change on the PC that may have caused the hang. If so, you can resolve the problem by returning the PC to a previous configuration using System Restore.

<p>
</p><p>I apologize for the delay in responding. If you are still facing the same issue and if you haven't tried System Restore, then I suggest you to remove the updates that were installed before the issue started and then try installing the update one by one and
 check if the issue persists. This is to check if this issue is caused due to any update related issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the steps remove updates:</p>
<p>a. Press <strong>Windows </strong>+ <strong>X </strong>keys and click on<span>&nbsp;<span><strong>Control
</strong><strong>Panel</strong></span>, clicking <strong><span>Programs</span></strong>, and then, under
<span><strong>Programs </strong><strong>and Features</strong></span>, click
<strong><span>View installed updates</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>b. </span>Select the update that you want to remove, and then click
<strong><span>Uninstall</span></strong>.&nbsp;<span>If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span> c. Restart the computer and then try
 installing the updates one by one.</p>
<p>
