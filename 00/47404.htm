            <p>I looked here at different spanish (and french) keyboards layouts (<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/goglobal/bb964651.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/goglobal/bb964651.aspx</a>) but none had a letter where the question mark is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Install the US International keyboard. <i>Start - Control Panel - Regional And Language Options - Languages - Details - Add</i>. While here review the Key Settings to switch keyboards or turn on the Language Bar (Advanced Text Services must not be disabled).
</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This works in two modes. <b>Right Alt</b> or <b>Shift + Right Alt</b> + another key and also by pressing dead keys (such as accents). On non US Keyboards the
<b>Right Alt</b> key is called <b>Alt Gr</b>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Right Alt</b> is the same key as <b>Ctrl + Left Alt</b> on the US International keyboards, and on almost all keyboards except the standard US keyboards where left and right keys are treated the same . This is a reason why
<b>Ctrl + Alt</b> should not be used to set hotkeys. Also <b>F12</b> should also not be used for hotkeys as it's reserved for attaching a debugger.</p>

    <title>How do I roll back from Creators Update after 10 days&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I roll back from Creators Update after 10 days&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've been using the Creator's Update for some time now. I was actually one of the first to download it. Everything was fine until I downloaded a couple of games, all of which experienced horrendous lag spikes to a point they became unplayable (Dota 2 &amp; Sims
 3).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to this <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/how-to-recover-restore-your-previous-version-of/94368560-9c64-4387-92b9-82a9234216ad">
article</a>, I can only do so after 10 days. But what if I wanted to roll back after 10 days?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything is updated. BIOS, drivers, Windows 10--everything.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Good news, good news!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hey everyone, so I had a chat with someone from Microsoft. He used my computer remotely to download some files and changed some settings in services.msc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Afterwards, he downloaded a 'WindowsCreationTool' from tinytinyurl.com/windowsis10 (or something, I'm not sure if my memory serves me correctly).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was a Windows media installation for Build 1607!!! This is completely awesome! It works just as he said. Just simply start the app and make sure you choose to 'Upgrade this computer'. I was not able to save any files or apps doing this,&nbsp;but I synced everything
 to my online drive beforehand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you would like to download it, it's <strong><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5U5J2oqSk-haU1IYkI5cUc3a2M/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>. I have not experienced any issues thus far.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Thank you Microsoft! </strong></p>

</li><li>Windows 10 Single Language - contains install files for <strong>Windows 10 Home Single Language</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>The ISO downloaded containing your corresponding edition, will detect and install the correct edition during setup.</strong>

<p>The only way to go back to exactly the way you were after the 10 days have passed is to restore an image made before you were upgraded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An alternative is to do a clean install of the same version of Windows that you had before, but that means redoing everything from scratch, then reinstalling all your software and setting that up from scratch, which is a good way to kill an afternoon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if you do that, since updates are mandatory in Windows 10 and cumulative, it's just a matter of time before your computer will install the Creators Update again. (How long that will be I do not know.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The advantage to rolling back, or restoring an image, or reinstalling from scratch, is that they give you an opportunity to figure out what might be wrong with your system that is causing it to fail after an update is installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the author of several spectacular failures, may I share my findings in the hope you might benefit?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running Windows (or any OS really) on hardware that isn't compatible with the operating system is a time bomb waiting to go off. Had a few
<em>kabooms!</em> myself. Running software that isn't supported on Windows 10 can also cause problems. (Merely being updated is not going to help - your software should be supported on Windows 10.) Also, making configuration changes without doing the research
 to make sure you're doing the right thing and in the right way will land you next to me on the Dell Wall of Shame.</p>

<h2>            Need TV Capture software for USB 2.0 TV Box... &#39;Enter USB TV Stick&#39;.</h2>
                    
<p>I have a tv tuner of the brand Enter which is compatible with vista but the cd that came along doesn't have drivers for vista 64 bit. The manufacturers website list serveral such devices in its download section and I don't know which one is mine. Now, I
 let vista automatically download drivers for the tuner from the internet and it is listed as USB2.0 TV Box in the device manager. So I guess I'm read to use the device. However, as my version of vista doesn't have media center, can someone recommend me a free
 video capture/media center software that would work with this tuner? My cable subscription is in India.</p>

<p><span>-&gt; This is called "painting yourself into a corner". Here are two methods to solve this problem:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Use your spare admin account to re-activate the Administrator account, same as you would use your spare house key after losing the main key. If you do not have a spare admin account then this is a good time to think
 about creating one.</span></li><li><span>Use a Windows Repair CD to boot the machine into Windows Repair Mode, then use System Restore to set Windows back to a point before you disabled your one and only admin account. You won't need a password.</span></li></ul>
<p><span>Ask a friend to burn the repair CD on his Windows 7 PC, via the Control Panel / Backup and Restore.</span></p>

<p>Hi Robert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We would like to isolate the issue that you're having right now. We suggest that you try to uninstall and reinstall the driver this time and see if will make any difference. In case you're still having the issue please try to
<span><span>use the System File Checker tool to scan your system files and to repair missing or corrupted system files. The sfc/scannow command (System File Check) scans the integrity of all protected operating system files and replaces incorrect, corrupted,
 changed or damaged versions with the correct versions possible. You may refer to this<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>link<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></a><span><span>for
 more information.<span> </span></span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply. &nbsp;The Touchpad on the first computer stopped working 5-20-2017, the second 5-22-2017.</p>
<p>There was a windows update done on the first computer immediately before it stopped.</p>
<p>Both computers have had SFC scans that came back ok.</p>
<p>Both computers have had driver versions changed from Synaptics 19.1.3.6 to 15.1.6.0 and back to 19.1.3.6.</p>
<p>Still not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just noticed that the malicious software removal tool was installed on 5-20-2017</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>I ran the programs you suggested.</span></p>

<p>Hi Robert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Yes, it's possible that it can be overwritten with Windows update depending on the drivers that will be installed on your computer. For every update, it has a different description. You can check this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4000825/windows-10-windows-server-2016-update-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> for the latest update.</p>

<h3> jsphwtsn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Live Party Chat not working after 24 hour com ban</h2>
                    After fulfilling a 24 hour com ban, I'm no longer able to talk to people in party chat. I'm able to message people, join parties and invite people to parties, however when I speak into the mic it doesn't pick up any sound. I know this isn't an issue with
 the mic itself, as I've tested this by plugging the mic into my phone, calling a friend through FaceTime audio and seeing if they could hear me, which they could. Has anyone else had this problem and is there a way to resolve it? Thanks.<br />

            I know that sometimes there might be a slight delay after a comm ban, I would suggest rebooting your console as well.&nbsp; If the issue persists I would recommend reaching out to MS Customer Support to help get your comm privledges restored.

 is this performed?</p>

<p>I do not want to store a payment method under my Childs account as, it would lead to trouble I'm sure.</p>

            Windows 8 Marketplace will not sell adult-rated games

<div>
<div>
<p>The Windows 8 Marketplace will not be able to sell any apps or content with an adulting rating, including video games that are rated 18+, according to the<a href="http://http//msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh694083.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> Windows Store guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>Under section 6.2 of the Windows 8 app certification requirements, apps with a rating over PEGI 16, ESRB Mature, or a corresponding rating under other ratings systems as described by the table in the guidelines are not allowed.</p>
<p>A Microsoft representative confirmed with <a href="http://kotaku.com/5950787/you-wont-be-able-to-buy-adult-games-on-windows-8s-marketplace" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Kotaku</a> that the guidelines also apply to video games.</p>
<p>While this doesn't mean that adult games won't be playable on Windows 8, it does mean that games with adult ratings will not be available from the Windows 8 Marketplace, which could potentially mean that players will miss out on special Windows 8 functionality
 for certain games.</p>
<p><a href="http://kotaku.com/5950787/you-wont-be-able-to-buy-adult-games-on-windows-8s-marketplace" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Kotaku</a> noted that while few games in North America are given a rating beyond "Mature" (the PC version of
<i>Manhunt 2</i> and <i>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</i> being a few exceptions), this is not the case in Europe where many best-selling games are given the PEGI 18 rating.</p>
<p>Games in Europe that have received this rating include: <i>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, Mass Effect 2, Mass Effect 3, Dishonored, Deus Ex, Fallout: New Vegas, Assassin's Creed: Revelations, The Walking Dead, Sleeping Dogs, LA Noire, Spec Ops: The Line, Max
 Payne 3, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</i>, and more.</p>
<p>In Australia, where an R18+ classification is due to kick in on January 1st, 2013, it is also yet to be seen how this will affect the availability of certain games on the Windows 8 Marketplace in Australia.</p>

    <title>Windows Live Mail takes ages to start after installing updates - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Live Mail takes ages to start after installing updates</h2>
                    <p><span>I am running Windows 8.1. with Windows Live Mail as my email client.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I am unable to understand why now it takes WLM ages to start up.<span>&nbsp; </span>
Before it used to startup in less than half a minute.<span>&nbsp; </span>Now from the time that I click the icon on my desktop, almost 10 minutes elapses before it starts up.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>Is it probable that the latest Windows updates (which I had just downloaded) could be the culprit as previously, on two occasions, after downloading Windows updates, I had similar problems (the machine would not even boot) and I was advised to Refresh
 but that deleted all my email messages in both the POP and Imap accounts.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In consequence, I had to re-create all my accounts afresh but when I connected to the internet and downloaded the messages, only message headers were recovered when imported but not the tax.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I therefore do not wish to Refresh yet again.</span></p>
<p><span>What could be the problem?<span>&nbsp; </span>If the only solution is to Refresh once more, how do I backup all the messages in the respective folders of all the accounts (I have two POP accounts and three Imac accounts) and then, after a Refresh and re-creating
 all the accounts yet again, how do I restore the messages in the respective folders?<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>I have even run a scan with Malwarebuytes Antivirus as well as with Windows Defender but the results were negative.<span>&nbsp;
</span>No threats were detected.<span>&nbsp; </span>What then could be the problem?</span></p>

            Further to my email, the situation has gone worse.&nbsp; Windows Live Mail now also repeatedly fails to respond and simply freezes.&nbsp; If I uninstall Microsoft Essentials and then re-install, would all my messages currently in the respective folders (particularly
 INBOX and SENT) also be deleted or will&nbsp;they&nbsp;be restored when I re-install Microsoft Essentials?

<h2>            Can Search Indexer be set to run only when computer is idle&#63;</h2>
                    <p><span>Microsoft Windows Search Indexer (SearchIndexer.exe)</span></p>
<p><span>Microsoft Windows Search Protocol Host (SearchProtocolHost.exe)</span></p>
<p><span>These processes seem out of control.<span>&nbsp; </span>Heavy use of hard drive resources at startup when I want to do other things.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Also heavy use of hard drive resources at other times when I want these resources for what I want to do.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I really like the indexing for searches so I do not want to shut it off.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I just want it to run when I am away from my computer.<span>&nbsp; </span>My computer does sit idle for periods of time.<span>&nbsp;
</span>How do I set these to only run when my computer is idle?<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span>I searched for an answer to this question before I posted.<span>&nbsp; </span>
The only answer was a manual approach.<span>&nbsp; </span>It involved a bat file to shut off the indexing and a bat file to turn it back on again.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have to believe win10 pro can calm down these search processes automatically without having to manage it manually.</span></p>
<p><span>I have some rudimentary<span>&nbsp; </span>experience with regedit.exe and services.msc if needed.</span></p>
<p><span>I am running Win10 Pro on a i7 tower 16GB memory 2TB HD.</span></p>

<h2>            Using disk image on another computer</h2>
                    <p>There are many desktop applications and Windows 8 applications on my Dell Inspiron 5537 I don't want to lose when I get a new computer. My current computer is holding up fine, and I won't replace it until 2018 at the earliest. If I saved everything on my
 hard drive as a disk image on the computer I have now and transfer the data to another computer when I get a new one, would everything on my would-be old computer work on my would-be new computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The storage device I plan on using for this disk image is a 1.5 TB portable USB hard drive from Seagate. It has been tested compatible with Windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have emailed numerous software companies about their policy on transferring the licenses from one computer to another. They said I'll have to email them about the change so they can increase the number of computers the license is valid for. Would a disk
 image save me that trouble of writing all those emails?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I save all my books, documents, movies, pictures, TV shows and videos to my OneDrive. I play all my music in the iTunes application through iCloud. A disk image will include those files, but will there be any issues when I my would-be new computer downloads
 those files from OneDrive like it usually does?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Dell Inspiron 5537 runs Windows 8.1, and I plan on upgrading it to Windows 10 later this year. There probably will be another version of Windows by 2018, but the big idea behind this question is, if I upgrade the operating system on my Dell Inspiron 5537
 to the latest version again in 2018, would everything work on the would-be new computer? I certainly don't want to find myself in a situation where my would-be new computer was downgraded to Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless a disk image saves specific information about one particular computer that would cause problems on another, this is probably what I should do.</p>

            <p>Windows 10 has not been released yet but you should be able to directly upgrade to 10 (Data and applications) however some of your application may not be compatible with Windows 10 and may need to be upgraded, in any case perform an Image Backup just prior
 to upgrading to Windows 10 as a safety net in case something goes for for whatever reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for 2018, that too far out to predict at this time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there going to be any show stopper type of problems with Windows 10 and whatever version of Windows becomes it successor it will most likely be the lack of Device Drivers for your PC.</p>

</p><p><strong>No, specifically because of the partition layout from the Dell and the drivers bundled with it would probably prevent it from booting successfully on a new computer, especially if its a different brand. However, you could give it a try, but I would
 at a minimum create a system image of the new computer before restoring the system image from the Dell on the new computer.</strong></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>The only way you would be in compliance is if the Dell and the new computer are running the same edition. If they are not, then that adds an issue to migrating the image to a new computer. If they are not the same, then I would not recommend it.</strong></p>

<p><strong>As long as you long in with your Microsoft Account, they would be synced to the new computer. I would as a precaution though deauthorize the iTunes account on the Dell before I start using it on the new computer.

            <p>Ok, you can ask for a Microsoft badge now since you obviously work in Microsoft's strategy department.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Who would have guessed Microsoft would make Windows Phone OS free?</p>
<p>- Who would have guessed Microsoft would&nbsp;Windows free for devices 9 inches and smaller?</p>
<p>- Who would have guessed Microsoft would make available a specific SKU called Windows 8.1 with Bing free to OEMs?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to that, you clearly don't understand how Windows is monetized. Microsoft has a Software subscription program, its called Software Assurance that large Enterprise companies pay Microsoft for Windows Licensing every 2-3 years to maintain access
 to support and&nbsp;upgrade rights to new&nbsp;versions. In fact, companies paid for this years ago even when there were no new releases.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft makes most of its revenue through Enterprise licensing versus consumer software. You still don't understand what I mean by big bang either, you won't have another major revision of Windows going forward. The cadence has changed, you are still in
 the mindset thinking there will be a Windows 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. Accept it, there won't be anymore. This was discussed officially too.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is how Microsoft will continue to monetize Windows in both Enterprise and Consumer:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Consumers - services, Windows Store,&nbsp;add ons, example, Skype, XBOX Live, maybe even options like Ad Free Outlook.</p>
<p>- Enterprise - Update 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, these will be released over a period of time, maybe every quarter, every year, every couple of years. If you want to access these Updates, your Software Assurance contract will have to be current, or you just won't get
 access to it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Updates are not like Service Packs of the past either, as clearly evidenced by Windows 8.1 with Update 1 which introduced signicant user experience improvements such as Power options on the Start Screen.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the direction of Windows in the future. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10, 8.1/8.0, Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows XP, Windows 2000. These releases over the years have been demanding on both consumers and Enterprise IT, the upgrade threadmill takes it toll. When you look at how something like Chrome OS works, its
 transparent and users like it and that evidenced by the popularity of Chromebooks on amazon.com and popularity in education. Updating a Chromebook is invisible to the user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft realizes, Windows also has to move in that direction. Its less head ache for IT, you don't end up with install bases that are running unsupported releases like Windows XP, users and even businesses are more interested in updating faster too, instead
 of waiting for the 'SP1' to arrive. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sorry this future is hard for you to accept, maybe because it also reduce the amount of forum post in the future for Install, Upgrade and Activate, but this is how an industry like this works, its ever changing. For someone like you has been in it for
 50 years as you claim, I find strange you can't see this change that is coming, even when its been confirmed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The future has changed too, even the company's CEO, Sataya said, the most important API the company has is the Office 365 API. 15 years ago, it was the Win32 API.

            <p>But Microsoft went instead with Windows 10 because they wanted to <strong>signify that the coming Windows release would be the

</span>, rather than pushing out new major updates years apart. Windows 10 will have a common codebase across multiple screen sizes, with the UI tailored to work on those devices.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>You can't discredit her either, because she was at the event and confirmed it with Terry.

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, the Preview Build Update setting in Windows 10 is not a unique feature for the Preview, this is something you will see in Windows 10 even when its commercially released. That is why Microsoft was against .ISOs for Windows 10 initially, but relented
 based on how many persons still requested it. The company wants testers to really test it, because this is how incremental revisions to Windows 10 will be delivered in the future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft is now communicating that there will be&nbsp;three different modes for updates, based entirely on customer choice:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Opt-in</strong> – This mode means that Windows 10 will be updated on a fast-moving pace (i.e., when Microsoft rolls 'em out). This is defined as a consumer-type updating mode. These include security updates and fixes, but also new features and OS
 updates.</li><li><strong>Lock-down</strong> – Locked-down mode is for mission critical environments (i.e., businesses) where updates are managed centrally. This will work similar to the way things happen now and will not include feature updates, only security updates and
 fixes. Organizations will still be able to utilize their normal patching mechanisms since updates will still be delivered to WSUS servers.</li><li><strong>In-between</strong> - Businesses will have an in-between option for systems that aren’t mission critical, but need to keep pace with the latest innovations without disrupting the flow of business.</li></ul>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can confirm the above too, since I saw an official presentation from Microsoft discussing the type of update cadence.</p>

<p>Oh really? I never heard Microsoft say any such thing. I have heard Microsoft&nbsp;describe&nbsp;a new version of Windows&nbsp;as&nbsp;'the&nbsp;best version of Windows yet'.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can also confirm former Windows Program Manager Jim Allchin describing Longhorn as a platform on which Microsoft will base Windows on for the 10 years (that is certainly true (Windows 7, Windows 8.0/Windows 8.1 and even Windows 10 are based on the foundation
 of Windows Longhorn).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, the last time Microsoft made a major revision of the Windows kernel was Vista, which was version 6.0, Windows 7 is 6.1, Windows 8 (6.2), Windows 8.1 (6.3). Windows 10 was version 6.4 until recent leaked builds are now showing as version 10.0.

            <p>"Fundamentally, we are changing how we will deliver Windows," Microsoft director Stella Chernyak told InformationWeek at Tuesday's Windows 10 event. She said many customers want to use the most current releases and to see Microsoft quickly respond to feedback.
 "At the same time," she continued, "we have businesses [that] may have mission-critical environments where we respect the fact [that] they want to test and stabilize the environment for a long time."</p>

</p><p>Rather than the historical offer-everything-to-everyone updating policy -- which has relied on security patches during the approximately three years between each edition of Windows -- Microsoft will create three different "tracks" that customers can essentially
 subscribe to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Windows 10 will be delivered in a way that gives more choice and flexibility to businesses," wrote Jim Alkove, the head of Microsoft's Windows enterprise program management team, in the Tuesday blog. "As a result, a business can pick the speed of innovation
 that is right for each group of its users, rather than apply a one size fits all solution."</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking at the specs for the Versa program, it seems to be fairly old: <a href="http://www.rolanddg.com/product/archives/sp-540v_300v/spec.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.rolanddg.com/product/archives/sp-540v_300v/spec.html</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You could try running the "Program Compatibility Troubleshooter" to see if that helps. You'll find it by right clicking the "Action Center" icon on the taskbar (looks like a flag) and click "Troubleshoot a problem".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the menu which opens, click the link on the left to "View All" and you'll find the troubleshooter in there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't help, uninstall the Versa program and reboot. Then right click the setup file and go to Properties. Click the Compatibility tab and choose to run the installation in Compatibility mode for Windows Vista. Checkmark "Run As Administrator" and
 then click Apply/OK. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Then run the installation again and hopefully it'll work. </p>

<p><span>b. Click <b>Start</b>, type in “<b>cmd</b>” and right click to <b>Run as Administrator</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Go to <b>Program Files\Windows Sidebar directory</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Type "<b>takeown /f wlsrvc.dll</b>" without quotes.</span></p>
<p><span>e. Right click on <b>wlsrvc.dll</b> file, go to <b>Properties</b>, click
<b>Security</b> and click on <b>Edit</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>f. Click on <b>administrator username</b> and tick to gain full control of the file then click
<b>Apply</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>g. Backup <b>wlsrvc.dll</b> and paste the same file from RC build 7100.</span></p>
<p><span>h. Launch <b>StocksPlus</b> gadget.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The problem is down to the latest file <b>wlsrvc.dll in RTM build 7600</b>,
<b>StocksPlu</b>s worked fine with the old file from RC build 7100.</span></p>

<p>I figured this out. I have a Microsoft account associated with Word, etc installed on my phone, but the Skype account I use is under a different account. I have to log out of the account automatically associated on my phone and log in using the user name
 (not email address) associated with the Skype account I actually use for work. You can go into setting on your Android and remove permissions to access your contacts.</p>
<p>

            If you do some searching on the internet, there are many people with the Sim Launcher is not responding.
<br />
Look at the thread here as it does have some suggstions. <br />
<a href="http://en.kioskea.net/forum/affich-103732-the-sims-3-not-responding" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://en.kioskea.net/forum/affich-103732-the-sims-3-not-responding</a><br />
<br />
It is up to you to decide if the solution will work for you since it is not from a Microsoft site.
<br />
<br />
Thanks, <br />

            <p>hi- i had the same problem and mines fixed heres how i did it</p>
<p>if your problem is that you double click your sims icon and it doesnt load, then thats what mine did.</p>
<p>1-&nbsp;first restart your computer, then x out of any pop ups that come on like skype or msn or a stage bar - these can lock up sometimes and when loading a game like sims it can block it from being opened.</p>
<p>2- double click your icon of sims ( note if you got the sims world travels then sometimes &nbsp;you have to use the sims 3 disc with the sims travel icon to open up the launcher)
</p>
<p>3- wait. wait for about 5 mins sometimes theres just lots to load, it may be boring but it'll be worth it when you get it open</p>
<p>4- if this doesnt open it then restart your game, dont worry you can keep all your files and sims</p>
<p>-- if it does work then click uploads and if you got well over 20 lots or 75 items note that this slowed down my game overall, and delete what you dont need .</p>
<p>otherwise go on and play your game!</p>

<h2>            Library and library folders not appearing on desktop Only in taskbar</h2>
                    Hi!&nbsp; When I try to open my library or control panel or folders in my library, it looks as if it is open as it is appearing in the task bar, but when I restore the window or maximizing, it is not showing on my desktop.&nbsp; It acts as if it is OFF screen.&nbsp;
 I tried resetting my resolution but that window is doing the same thing.&nbsp; I tried a system restore but it failed.<br />
Does anyone know how to fix this please?&nbsp; I am at a loss.

<p>Hi jasv13,</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Answers!</p>
<p>First, I suggest you to check the following setting:</p>
<p><strong>Method 1</strong>: Right click on the application, select Properties, under the shortcut tab-&gt; select from the drop down menu for Run as "Maximized window”. Click OK.</p>
<p><strong>Method 2</strong>: If this does not help, perform a clean boot.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps. We strongly recommend that you do not use the System Configuration utility to modify the advanced boot options on the computer
 unless a Microsoft support engineer directs you to do this. Doing this may make the computer unusable.</p>
<p>a. Log on to the computer by using an account that has administrator rights. <br />
b. Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER to start the System Configuration Utility. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.
<br />
c. On the General tab, click Selective Startup, and then click to clear the Load startup items check box. (The Use Original Boot.ini check box is unavailable.)
<br />
d. On the Services tab, click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box, and then click Disable all.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Following this step lets Microsoft services continue to run. These services include Networking, Plug and Play, Event Logging, Error Reporting, and other services. If you disable these services, you may permanently delete all restore
 points. Do not do this if you want to use the System Restore utility together with existing restore points.
<br />
e. Click OK, and then click Restart.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> Reset the computer to start as usual</p>
<p>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:</p>
<p>a. Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.
<br />
b. On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK. <br />
c. When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.</p>

            I have started having this problem, too. It started just after the most recent Windows update. I'm running Windows 7 update from the control panel, but my system is running Windows 10. Windows 10 recently installed a very big update that changed the whole
 look of the computer, and ever since then, I can no longer run backup without getting the BSOC with the vhdmp.sys error ATTEMPTED TO WRITE TO READ ONLY MEMORY. How do I fix this?

            <p>Snuffy, I have just given up on WIndows backup entirely.&nbsp; It was always a bit fragile even in W7, but in W10 awful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since my post, I have also given up on Windows backup for the system image as this was problematic as well.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use AOMEI for everything.&nbsp; Very good and hardly ever any problems.&nbsp; I run the free version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is simply not worth the time trying to get Windows backup to work.</p>

                    <p>this watermark keeps showing up and i can't get rid of it. some problems i tried got rid of it only to show it again, some involve previous versions of windows ( i didn't upgrade, i built a desktop and bought a windows 10 installation disk, and some require
 the product key, which i don't have, i bought the installer from b&amp;h photo and maybe i missed it some where, but i check the disc itself, the envelope it was shipped in, even the shipping order found in the box, and NONE of them had the product key. i even
 tried asking b&amp;h 2 maybe 3 times through email and they were no help.</p>
