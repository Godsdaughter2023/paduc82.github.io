    <title>My touchpad driver is missing&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            My touchpad driver is missing&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Lenovo Yoga 720, just bought it today. It's the i5 7200U.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought it first earlier today and when I brought it home, the touchpad worked fine. Then I did all the updates to set up the device and all of the sudden the touchpad didn't work and there was an error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went back to best buy and exchanged it, having them get me a new one and set it up in front of me. This took four hours of my time. The touchpad worked after the update and when I got home and opened the laptop up to use it, it didn't work anymore. I'm
 very frustrated. This took up LITERALLY my whole day and I was patient but my patience is really waning. I've been a long time apple user and I'm hard pressed to return this and never touch another Microsoft product again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I brought the laptop in and he did the updates on the new one (the one I have now) the same error message appeared. It was basically saying that there was some small file that was not working and that it needed to be replaced with another update. So
 he ran this update and it took forever. When it was done, the touchpad worked. I got home. The touchpad isn't working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can go back tomorrow but I'd like to see if I can get some sort of explanation on here. Or assistance. This is infuriating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.   
<br />
<br />Can you use a mouse to try to repair this so it can be done in Windows without needing to access Repair Mode?  
<br />
<br />This is believed to be caused by the recent Cumulative Update for Version 1709:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4074588/windows-10-update-kb4074588" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/407458...</a>.  I will give you steps to recover from both Windows and in Repair Mode that uses different drivers and should work if Windows won't.
<br />
<br />I would try uninstalling it at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History.  If that doesn't fix it I'd uninstall any others that were installed before this happened.
<br />
<br />You might also be able to get back before it via System Restore:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Then if it reinstalls and causes the same problems, uninstall it again and block it using Method Two here:  <a href="https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automatic-updates-install-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automat...</a>.  If it requires blocking a whole group of Updates you might just want to use one of the methods to turn them off until you get time to sort them out.  
<br />
<br />If necessary you can perform these operations in Safe Mode:  <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>
<br />
<br />But if you can't get into Safe Mode try Advanced Startup Options by whichever method works here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a> 
<br />
<br />If no other method works it may be necessary to create  Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Boot mode uses different drivers so mouse and keyboard should work.
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />After it loads, on second screen, choose Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Troubleshoot Options, then System Restore.  
<br />
<br />If System Restore fails access the Command Prompt to try Option Five here to unlock F8 Advanced Boot Options in Windows 10 to reach Safe Modes:    <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>
<br />
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: appwiz.cpl
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click View installed updates
<br />
<br />If the following KBs are are installed, right click each then click uninstall:
<br />- KB4074588
<br />
<br />Restart then check if its working...
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />A failed Windows Update is the likely cause of this problem.
<br />
<br />Try these options:
<br />
<br />Option 1: Perform a repair upgrade:
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-perform-a-repair-upgrade-using-the-windows/35160fbe-9352-4e70-9887-f40096ec3085">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Option 2:
<br />
<br />Power on and off your computer three times
<br />On the third time, your computer will boot into the Advanced Recovery environment
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />
<br />Click Command Prompt (Admin)
<br />
<br />Confirm the drive letter for the Windows image. Usually D: –&gt; dir d:
<br />
<br />    Run the following to view the installed packages which will also show a date of install.
<br />
<br />    Dism /Image:D:\ /Get-Packages
<br />
<br />    Find the package(s) that were just installed by date. Run the following command on the last installed package:
<br />
<br />    example: dism.exe /image:d:\ /remove-package /packagename:Package_for_KB4014329~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~10.0.1.0
<br />

<p>Okay so now my issue is this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can get my trackpad to work but only if I restart my laptop. If I restart it, the touchpad is completely fine. But if I put it to sleep or close it, it's not available at all and the hot-key doesn't help either. I don't want to have to restart my laptop
 every time I open it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are these options you've both posted still viable or do I need to do something different?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And honestly, it's a little ridiculous that this is a brand new laptop and I'm having an issue with it already.</p>

<p>I tried the first thing and it didn't work. When I pressed the power button to put the laptop to sleep and then woke it up, the touchpad didn't work anymore. Still no touchpad driver actually ON my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also understood none of what Greg said to me. So I can't try any of his options. And the second option you gave me, Andrea, I wonder if you still think I should try it knowing what I posted just before this.</p>

            I would give option 2 a try, but here are the exact updates you need to uninstall:
<br />
<br />Power on and off your computer three times
<br />On the third time, your computer will boot into the Advanced Recovery environment
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />
<br />Click Command Prompt (Admin)

<br />
<br />    Run the following to view the installed packages which will also show a date of install.
<br />
<br />    Dism /Image:D:\ /Get-Packages
<br />
<br />    Find the package(s) that were just installed by date. Run the following command on the last installed package:
<br />
<br />    dism.exe /image:c:\ /remove-package /packagename:Package_for_RollupFix~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~16299.248.1.17 
<br />
<br />If you are running 32 bit Windows, run this command instead:
<br />
<br />dism /online /remove-package /packagename:Package_for_RollupFix~31bf3856ad364e35~x86~~16299.248.1.17
<br />
<br />    Reboot.

<p>No need to worry, your files or pictures will not be deleted. Its only apps you installed from websites and DVDs will be removed. Apps that came with your PC and apps you installed from the Windows Store will be reinstalled. Windows puts a list of removed
 apps on your desktop after refreshing your PC. You can try the refresh option.</p>

<div><br />
<div>I am trying to go back to Windows RT 8 using your guidance but after the refresh I get back the same 8.1. I tried both refresh and reset recovery options but neither of them works. After the update internet connection is close to nothing so I need to go
 back the original version. Is there another way?</div>

<h2>            Remember Folder Options ala WinXP</h2>
                    I have tried to find a way to set Folders Options to remember folder settings like always display only small icons, etc.&nbsp; Despite M$ claim this is not possible, The Wondows Club Forum has a Ultimate Windows Tweak that can do this.&nbsp; So there must be a registry
 bit to set,&nbsp; Anyone know what it is?<br />
UWT is not right for me for other reasons.

<p>The reason the option is gone is because Windows 7 will <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">

<h2>            microsoft solitaire collection daily challenge.</h2>
                    <p>In the last few days of using daily challenge when you complete a game&nbsp;you receive your coins then when you click on the next game it loads only to the blank screen of the game but not to the screen where you are told of the challenge and&nbsp;asked to "play
 or "cancel". you can't do anything on the screen other than click on options or exit the program. I then re-enter&nbsp; the microsoft solitaire collection game wait&nbsp;to connect to the daily challenge and enter the game. sometimes this fixes the problem and some
 times I have to exit the program and come in again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Robyn.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />That sounds like the Fake Virus scam which can emanate from a mistyped URL it occupies.  If you have a shortcut for Favorite/Bookmark of the site be sure to delete it.  It may have also set itself as your Home page or be lodged in your Browser Add-Ons or Extensions so you'll want to check there and run the scanners I give below.
<br />
<br />Close the Browser window using whichever method is necessary, as it cannot escape the browser unless you download something from the page.  
<br />
<br />If you cannot close the browser window, right click the Task Bar or press Ctrl + Alt + Delete keys to open the Task Manager, choose Show Less Details, highlight the browser and choose End Task. 
<br />
<br />If this fails hold the power button to Shut Down.  If you do this Edge may reload the page when it starts back up, but it will also give you an option to Start Fresh to avoid opening the previous tabs.  
<br />
<br />Also in Edge, if you try to X out of the browser WIndow, it may present a dialogue box to end the session.  The webpage is allowed to put text in the box but cannot stop it from closing the Windows when you choose OK, so that is safe to do.  
<br />
<br />If you called the scammers and they installed anything on your PC, open Settings&gt;Apps &amp; Features, choose Sort by Date, uninstall anything on that date you didn't install yourself. Then run a full scan with Malwarebytes.   In MB settings tell it to search for rootkits. You can turn off the trial version later in it's Account Settings.
<br /><a href="http://filehippo.com/download_malwarebytes_anti_malware/tech/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://filehippo.com/download_malwarebytes_anti...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Clean up anything found.  If you are seriously infected with Trojans or Rootkits that show up again when you re-run the scan after cleaning, post back for further instructions.   
<br />
<br />Then check System files for damage with System File Checker from <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow-to-repair-windows-system-files-2626161" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow...</a>
<br />
<br />If you paid them anything, notify your bank that you were scammed.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.

<h2>            Files are now readonly after updating Win7 to 10</h2>
                    <p>I finally got Win10 update (no notification though - had to use windows update and search manually)</p>
<p>Updated Window 7 Home Premium to Windows 10 Home - didn't take too long and no errors.</p>
<p>Then, when I tried to open a file it says it's readonly.&nbsp; I can't modify and save it.&nbsp; I looked at Documents and the whole folder is marked as readonly.&nbsp; I tried changing the attribute to all sub folders/files, but this didn't work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What use is upgrading Windows when it marks your files as readonly???</p>

            <p>I have the same problem. Your suggestion did not work. What else have you got? All we're hearing from Microsoft is the soft chirping of crickets.
<br />
<br />
I can edit files and save them to my desktop but not into any file folders, and they save as some kind of generic Windows Office file. I can't just click on the file and have it choose Excel and open the file. I have to open Excel, then find the file I've saved
 to my desktop and open it from there. I have Microsoft Office Professional 10, however this is not merely an Office problem. Seems my PrintShop files are also now read only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What a mess. I've been on with support from Windows 10. They sent me to support for MS Office. The sent me back to support for Windows 10. There did seem to be a solution that worked temporarily, but when I went back in to work on a spreadsheet that had
 appeared to be "fixed" it was once again read only.<br />
<br />
I cannot save all my documents and spreadsheets to my desktop! I was considering reverting back to Windows 7, but from posts here it appears that will not solve my problem either. People are asking me if they should update and I'm telling them to hold off as
 it appeared to bollix up all my files.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help!</p>

    <title>Gave X1 a shot, but it really is going to be lagging behind this Gen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> warlok9  say:</h3>
<h2>            Gave X1 a shot, but it really is going to be lagging behind this Gen</h2>
                    
<p>I have given this system a shot (2 months) and it continually disapoints me on almost all aspects, especially in comparison to the competition. After playing Titanfall (an exclusive) and many other titles, launch and after, I have come to the conclusion
 that X1 is clearly #2 in graphical performance. All these announcements of multi platform and exclusive titles coming to Xbox One with less performance (IE 720p and/or 30fps) is just going to continue. And YES, there is a huge difference between a game that
 runs at 1080p 60fps vs. a game that runs 720p 60fps or a game that runs 1080p 60fps vs.a game that runs 1080p 30fps. I realize Titanfall is an Xbox exclusive, but the fact that the game is only 720p and is also an exclusive title with months and months of
 extra development time, truly means they are maxing out the X1's capabilities. Yeah sure, over time they will learn tricks to get framerates up, but the bottom line is, on PS4 they don't have to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And to those of you that keep saying "who cares about resolution and framerate, it's all about how the game plays." To you I say, what if it is the same game? Can anyone really say Battlefield 4 or Assassins Creed 4 play worse on PS4? Didn't think so. But
 they sure look and perform better, which effects gameplay as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am angry at Microsoft this gen, They simply dropped the ball. How in the world could they end up with the weaker system?? They have nearly endless resources at their disposal and yet the X1 is underpowered. I truly like Kinect if they would utilize it
 properly, but I think X1 developers put too much of their development time into the Kinect experience and the system performance was secondary. Why didn't they just go balls out on the performance? This is Microsoft people! Why did they keep the specs on the
 conservative side? Makes no sense to me. And please stop with MixterMedia or whatever he is. That is just stupid.</p>
<p>Anyways, I am reconsidering a PS4 purchase once again. I have had some time to sit with the system and it just feels better. Games look and run better too.</p>
<p>Here is a list of things that make me mad about Xbox One:</p>
<p>1. Kinect. For as much time as they spent talking this thing up, it is severely underutilized. You cant even take a picture with it or use it to record video messages. The best use of it so far is the "xbox record that" feature. Other than that it is totally
 useless to me. Where are the character customization features, etc?</p>
<p>2. Controller Build quality. As an adult gamer that never broke a controller in my life, both of my X1 controllers are "breaking". My Day one has a bad left stick (weird dead spot) and the right bumper and trigger are somehow messed up where you push the
 trigger and the button above it partially goes in as well. My Play and charge controller has an issue with the left stick plastic being "ground away" to a rough surface where the stick touches the casing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. TV integration and no Passthrough. I simply cant use the tv integration because they did not make it a passthrough. The X1 has to be on to watch TV. Fine for me, but BAD if you have a wife and kids.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Storage. Why cant I look at my saved games and move them, or delete them or do whatever I want to? Why can't I look at my hard drive contents? Because of this I have to start BF4 campaign from the beginning for the 5th time! Yeah, I know this is an EA
 problem with that particular game, but if I simply had the ability to save my game locally it would be a non-issue.</p>
<p>5. Performance. It's hardware WILL struggle for the next 5-7 years running games at a comparable level to the competition. I have to ask myself, "am I ready to accept lower quality multiplatform games for the next 5-7 years?" I WISH this were not true. But
 it is. I did not want to believe this for a long time. I wanted X1 to be the most powerful console or at least equal. But it is not and never will be. "Do I want to play Destiny (a title I am looking forward to) at 720p or 1080p?" The answer to that question
 made my decision to reconsider the PS4.</p>
<p>6. No Dolby 5.1 through optical. What!?</p>
<p>7. Games literally take 6-8 hours to download. That is insane.</p>

<p>Some things I like about Xbox One:</p>
<p>1. It is quiet and feels well built. (except for the controllers)</p>
<p>2. Kinect 2.0 is amazing and Auto Sign in is cool.</p>
<p>3. The game clip record features.</p>
<p>I know I will get flamed by most of you for this post. Actually I don't even know why I am posting it. Maybe to help the few of you see the truth of the situation here. If you can afford to have both, I guess get both consoles. (thanks Halo) But if you can
 only have one console and Halo isn't a deciding factor, then PS4 is a better choice if you want to play the best versions of games. ( and please, PC superior race people, no comments from you. I have a PC and it won't play any of these games)</p>

 trolling for pageviews (Digital Foundry).</p>

<p>Also, as far as point 5 goes: saying that the console will struggle is ridiculous. The Xbox 360 was underpowered when compared to the PS3, but even still, at the end of their generation it matched and in some cases bested the PS3s superior hardware. While
 I agree, hardware IS important, it is by no means a guaranteed measure of how the system will perform over its lifespan, and further than that, the difference in hardware is nowhere NEAR as big of a difference as it was previous generation. Your comments are
 misguided, misinformed and just plain silly.</p>

<h2>            How can I get a replacement for my Windows 10 Pro software after losing my hard drive&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have lost my hard drive and I do not have a system backup copy. I originally had Windows 7 Pro and upgraded to Windows 10 Pro when the offer was made available. The only proof I have of owning the software is the product key code from my Windows 7 Pro
 installation on my Dell computer. Is there a process for me to recover a copy to load on a new hard drive?</p>

<p>

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What is the reason why do you need to run <strong>DISM </strong>and <strong>SFC</strong>?</li><li>Are your Windows 10 is up to date?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the message "The operation completed successfully". It should work well now. We also suggest that you restart your computer and try your Windows apps and Windows store to verify if it's already working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>

<p>I was using the link before I found this this question and its thread.&nbsp; Running</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth</strong></p>
<p>didn't give me a clear indication that something was wrong and that the /RestoreHealth needed to be run to fix the problem.&nbsp; The link didn't discuss what the command's expected outputs should be, and the screen shot is incomplete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the command including /RestoreHealth just for the heck of it, since there didn't seem to be a problem from /ScanHealth, and when it finished it indicated that there was indeed a problem, and that it fixed it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would recommend that the link be updated to give a more comprehensive discussion on the topic.</p>

    <title>Windows .png photo icons and png application icons not displaying - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jamalrobertsiakpere  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows .png photo icons and png application icons not displaying</h2>
                    <p>All of my photo thumbnails turned into a blank icon (see screenshot below) which is not even the typical icon that you'd get for your image files. I have visited the folder option and the option for showing thumbnails instead of icons is checked though it
 didn't do anything. Please help as it is getting really annoying.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Although, regardless of these thumbnails not showing correctly, the images open, What i noticed is that the thumbnail for .jpeg images shows correctly but .png images doesnt. Same for application icons that have their icons in .png.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started noting this error when i updated my windows 10 OS (this is about 3 weeks ago, the windows update that came with a "task view" feature on the task bar).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run troubleshooter to correct the os install , the troubleshooter ran and completed, and the problem persists. Please help. This is really frustrating. Thank you.</p>

            I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

    <title>Windows 8.1 disable the wifi adapter - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> enulesculaurentiu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 disable the wifi adapter</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I need help. I have an ThinkPad Edge E130. The laptop&nbsp;had Win7 when i buy-it and win8 Pro Recovery discs. All Works fine on win7.&nbsp;I instal the win 8, do all the updates and then upgrade to win8.1 pro. All this time i use lan connection. When i try to connect
 the wifi i discovered that&nbsp;the on-off button it was deactivated and&nbsp;his color was gray.&nbsp;I can't enable it. In device manager the wifi adapter&nbsp;is enabled. I try to reinstall the driver. That was in vain. I try to solve the&nbsp;issue with Windows to scan for problems.&nbsp;The
 scan discovered that the adapter is disabled and i have to push the keyboard on-of button for wifi. Don't work..</p>
<p>I have another laptop Dell Latitude 4200.&nbsp;It was working fine. Today i find same issue on Dell to. The wifi dosen't work. That's very odd.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;log on both laptops with same hotmail account. I think&nbsp;that when i install win 8.1 on lenovo&nbsp;maybe i misconfigured something or it is a problem with the new win8.1 update.</p>
<p>I don't know i can do anymore.</p>

<p>Non of the 3&nbsp;methods works.</p>
<p>I find on couple forums some posts with the same problem and no solution. I think the problem is from one of the recent Windows updates. I say this because my dell latitude has win 8.1&nbsp;pro x86&nbsp;instaled from last november and work fine until last win. update
 (on lenovo i have x64). I am a computer engineer and i know when a problem is hardware or software.</p>
<p>I'm gone keep looking.</p>

</p><p>It's unfortunate to know that the issue still exists and I understand that it might be an issue with the update. However, to rule out the possibility of a third party firewall intervention from a security software, I would suggest you to once, temporarily
 disable the anti-virus program and check if the issue is reproduced.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I resolved the problem for Thinkpad. In bios i had&nbsp;enabled the wireless wan. I don't have the 3g module installed on MB. I<span>t seems that this</span>
<span>was the problem</span><span>,</span> <span>but</span>
<span>I had no problems</span> on <span>windows 7.</span></p>
<p><span>On the other hand</span><span>,</span> <span>
the</span> <span>problem</span> <span>still</span> <span>
persists</span> on D<span>ell. </span><span>I have no</span>
<span>Bluethooth</span> <span>and</span> <span>
no</span> <span>WWAN</span> <span>enabled in bios.</span></p>
<p><span>I'm gone</span> <span>load default settings</span>
<span>in</span> <span>bios and see if the problem persist.</span></p>
<p><span>I thought</span> <span>that</span> <span>
Windows</span> <span>8.1</span> <span>will</span> <span>
do</span> <span>fewer problems</span><span>, </span><span>but for this</span>

<h2>            How to stream video from PC to XBox One X &#63;</h2>
                    <p>I&nbsp;have a shared folder on my PC where I&nbsp;keep all my videos.&nbsp;&nbsp;PC name is ASUS.&nbsp;&nbsp;Share is "movies".</p><p><br /></p><p>PC and Xbox One X &nbsp;(XB1X) are on same LAN on my home network here.</p><p><br /></p><p>How can I display the contents of my shared PC folder on my XB1X, so I can select the file and play the video?</p><p><br /></p><p>I have another HTPC right next to the Xbox. &nbsp;The HTPC is hooked up to the same TV as the Xbox, so what I'm doing now is boot up that PC then stream the videos from the PC in the other room.&nbsp; (PC on other room (bedroom) is much daily workhorse... PC in the TV room is an older one that I just use for HTPC purposes now, and has a MASSIVELY loud set of fans in it).</p><p><br /></p><p>Ideally I'd like to just boot up my Xbox, find the shared folder on the PC in my bedroom, and play the videos on my Xbox and TV.</p><p><br /></p><p>Both PCs are running Win7 Pro.<br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Ideas?<br /></p>

            <p>Xbox does not support reading network shares, which is kinda odd considering it runs Windows and it should be able to join Homegroups created by Windows when you think about it.</p><p><br /></p><p>So your options are</p><p>1) Get VLC from Xbox app store, it can read SMB network shared folder under "browse" category.</p><p><br /></p><p>2) Install a DLNA media server on your PC like Serviio or Mezzmo and use that to stream to Xbox stock media player which supports DLNA.</p><p><br /></p><p>3) Install a media server like Plex or Emby and use there clients available in the Xbox app store, to play the media that way, Plex/Emby do also double as DLNA servers too but their app clients are a better way to access the media.<br /></p>

    <title>Icon Animation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robertnash3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Icon Animation</h2>
                    <p>I use Windows 10, build 17134.165. There are times when my desktop icons animate themselves (a folder icon will animate open then animate close, other icons may change to a slightly different icon then change back to the original, for example). They do not
 change positions on the screen, they just animate. And they do not do this all the time, just occasionally. Please, any ideas anyone as to why this is happening?</p>

            Hi Robart, this is not a function of Windows 10 . . .
<br />
<br />Do you have any 3rd party software that may be causing this?
<br />
<br />Do you have your desktop background wallpaper set to a picture or a slideshow?

            First, try restarting your graphics driver:
<br />Press Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + B
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.” 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />You might need to update the display driver from the manufacturer of your computers website.
<br />
<br />If you have an nVidia, AMD ATI video card or Intel HD graphics installed, you can download the latest drivers from their website. 
<br />
<br />First, determine what type of graphics you have installed. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />
<br />Once you have determined the graphics driver, go the vendors website and search for the driver in the download section:
<br />
<br />Intel - Downloads for Graphics Drivers - Drivers &amp; Software - Intel
<br /><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/...</a>

            You may want to check your firewall and IE settings. The standard security should not cause this issue. If you can post a screen shot that would be great. (the link to tinypic)

            Hi  Vignesh, 1703 is no longer the latest version of Windows 10, 1803 has been released, you should go straight to that version to bring your system up to date and make all previous updates obsolete . . .
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Uninstall any 3rd party Anti-virus - this is a known issue with 1803
<br />
<br />Then, double click it and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .       
        </p>

            Hi,
<br />if you have 1703 version you may install it. If not - unfortunately there are no legal ways to obtain it now. But pleas note, the 1703 support will end next month, see <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13853/windows-lifecycle-fact-sheet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13853/...</a>
<br />So it is much better to install 1803 version, just check if your hardware supports it.
