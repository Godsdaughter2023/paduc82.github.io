<h2>            Unable to permanently delete mails from outlook</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have searched for a solution for my problem and found that other users also&nbsp;have an issue with deleting emails in outlook.com. I will directly refer to the same problem here&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/oemail-ocleanup/disable-recovery-or-permanently-delete-emails/ad6f29df-8938-4eb4-91f1-37ef45fa6ddb">same
 problem</a>&nbsp;, neither one of the proposed solutions worked for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no advanced settings, and if I delete mail, there is still an option for recovering it. I don`t want that behavior. What about privacy issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is my problem also&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>First, sorry for my English. It is not my native language. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This is an unwanted feature. If I decide to permanently delete mail than&nbsp;same should be PERMANENTLY removed. I am very disappointed&nbsp;by fact that Microsoft does not want to consider dissatisfaction of customers with mentioned "feature". The feature should
 bring some usefulness to the product, this behavior&nbsp;of outlook is terrible! Look
<a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/284136-outlook-com/suggestions/14719089-turn-off-recover-deleted-messages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this thread&nbsp;</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a scenario: I use outlook account for years, there is a lot of ticklish content. For some reason, I had to give access to the account to another person to do some important job. I have previously deleted everything and were in peace. Hahaha, nothing
 was deleted! </p>
<p>And do not tell me that is my obligation to not give access to my account to anybody else. In previous years of usage, I were capable to actually delete my mails. Analogon of outlook and similar services in real life is letterbox.&nbsp;
 If I have a letterbox&nbsp;in front of my house when I pop letter(s)&nbsp; letterbox is EMPTY! If I want better, bigger letterbox, I can sell the old one to somebody, or give it to a friend.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is more like a bug&nbsp;than the feature.</p>

<h2>            That Microsoft account doesn&#39;t exist. Enter a different email address or get a new account.</h2>
                    I've been using my windows live account on outlook daily for a while now and today I get this message:
<div><br />
</div>
<div>"That Microsoft account doesn't exist. Enter a different email address or get a new account."</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I know it's because I was playing around and changed the email address to a new one, then changed it back to the original (as i kind of thought i was adding a secondary email address), and this all worked fine - even after testing sending emails etc. &nbsp;then
 i logged out, and i cannot sign back in, even though i CAN sign in with the same details into messenger!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I cannot go down the "forgot my password route" or anything that microsoft offers for "cant login" helpfuls as I have to enter my ID - which it thinks does not exist. &nbsp;even though it does, as i can login to it via messenger.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>PLEASE HELP! :(</div>

    <title>Why I cannot access Baidu verification code in my hotmail&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> james b smith  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why I cannot access Baidu verification code in my hotmail&#63;</h2>
                    I found many had the same question, so I just post it here, and I hope my question could be solved.
<p>Right now in China, there are millions of people cannot get Baidu's messages from our hotmail doxes, and we are so stressed about that. Personally, I am quite depressed and desperate. There are the reasons:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) People like us who forgot their Baidu cloud accounts passwords REALLY need to get the verification code from our hotmail, but none of us can get that code anymore :(((((.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2)We tried so many other ways to verify ourself, but Baidu claimed that they need us to provide our PRIVATE INFORMATION ( includes PERSONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION such as credit card number, Citizen ID number!!!!, phone number, and other private information
 which makes me feel so insecure) to Baidu (which they never asked for us before we created baidu cloud accounts, as baidu cloud is for free, otherwise I could never use that bloody cloud account to store my family photoes and academic research materials, too
 stupid! ) to get our accounts back!!! which is quite unfair and absurd, as I think baidu just takes the opportunity to ask our valuable private information to id us personally, which I even think that smells toooo fishy.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, please, please, let the baidu send the bloody verification code to us, please, the materials in baidu cloud is too valuable for me to loose, but I don't want the Baidu win to get all my valuable private information!!! Please! tell me what I can do?</p>

            <p>Hi James,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you checked the Junk/Spam folder if Baidu's email was sent there? It's a possibility that Baidu is filtered as junk/spam that's why you're not receiving it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We also recommend you contact Baidu for this particular issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need anything else.</p>
<p>

            Thank you for replying. I also contacted Baidu. Now I can receive verification code from Baidu. But I still do not understand why all this happened. Anyway, only if it works!

    <title>Internet Explorer 11 degrading after Windows 10 Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bison frames uk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internet Explorer 11 degrading after Windows 10 Update</h2>
                    <p>I am evaluating whether to upgrade my company to Windows 10. With this in mind I have allowed my Windows 7 Pro 64 bit&nbsp;computer to upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Friday 27th 2016 over a week after upgrading I opened Internet Explorer 11 and waited over a minute for Google to load. All pages&nbsp;suffer extensive delays. This forum page took over 30 seconds from initial display to being able to scroll or type. The more
 complicated the layout the longer the wait.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another user I have spoken to upgraded his notebook to Windows 10 six months ago. He came to me to ask why IE11 was slowing down on the same day that I noticed mine had problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not using Edge for two reasons:</p>
<p>1. Our manufacturing software uses an intranet written specifically for Internet Explorer. It checks for it, and will not run on any other browser. They have no plans to rewrite it.</p>
<p>2. There is no ad blocker for Edge. I am not exposing my users to malvertising risk under any circumstances.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Manage add-ons in Internet Explorer</span> </p>
<p>Add-ons are apps that Internet&nbsp;Explorer uses to interact with web content like videos and games. Toolbars and extensions are also types of add-ons. Some common add-ons are Adobe Flash, Quicktime, and Silverlight. Internet&nbsp;Explorer is designed to provide
 an add-on free experience, and will play HTML5 and many Adobe Flash videos without needing to install a separate add-on. You'll only be able to install and use add-ons Internet&nbsp;Explorer for the desktop. If you're trying to view a page that requires add-ons,
 view it in the desktop: swipe up from the bottom of the screen (or right-click) to bring up the app commands, tap or click the
<span>Page tools</span> button <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres1.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2f6.2%2fmain%2fd50762c3-4e14-4514-99da-27d5eff160f5_7.jpg" />, and then tap or click

<p>
</p><p>I have deleted browsing history and cookies. When started without add-ons IE11&nbsp;shows no improvement.</p>
<p>The page is displayed after 20 seconds. IE11 then freezes and returns control to me after another 30 seconds.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can reset Internet&nbsp;Explorer settings to return them to the state they were in when Internet&nbsp;Explorer was first installed on your PC. This can be useful for troubleshooting problems that might be caused by settings changed after installation. Resetting
 Internet&nbsp;Explorer isn't reversible, and all previous settings are lost after reset.</p>

<p>Windows Phone supports Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR. With this enhanced version of Bluetooth, Windows Phone has a simplified pairing procedure which reduces user input and automates pairing with Bluetooth devices.

            <p>You will find that the link posted does not answer the question of why "crawl In" doesn't appear in 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The answer is fairly simple. Crawl In is basically the same as a very slow Fly In. Just add fly in from left and set the duration to either very slow or manually set it to more than 5 secs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<strong>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>User accounts are required when you wish to share your computer with several people at home, but, still you wish to have your own files and settings. We can say that a user account is a collection of information that tells Windows what files
 and folders a user can access, make changes and manage the personal preferences of an user in Windows.</p>
<p>Each user can access their user account with a user name and password. There are three different type of accounts namely, Standard User, Administrator and Guest. User Accounts are created by the Administrator and most common type allocated
 for a person is Standard User.</p>
<p>This document is prepared in earnest to shed some light on home computing environment and requirements for setting up and using Parental Controls when sharing computing resources at home.</p>
<p>　</p>
<strong>
<p>1. User Account Control (UAC)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>User Account Control is a new feature in Windows Operating System that can help prevent unauthorized changes to your computer. UAC does this by asking you for your permission or an administrator password before performing actions that could
 potentially affect your computer's operation or that will change settings that will affect other users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>UAC will be displaying an alert message requesting confirmation to ensure the action or program that's about to start is one that you intended to start. UAC does this primarily to prevent malicious software and spy ware from being installed
 and making changes to your computer without permission. You can also change the behavior of the User Account Control message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As recommended and to protect your computer, you create standard user accounts for all the users who share the computer. If a user has a standard account tries to install software, Windows will ask for an administrator account's password
 so that software can't be installed without your knowledge and permission.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Standard Account user can surf the Internet, send e-mail, and use a word processor. However, if you want to perform an administrative task, such as installing a new program or changing a setting that will affect other users, you need not
 switch to an administrator account. Windows will prompt you for permission or an administrator password before performing the task.</p>
<p>　</p>
<strong>
<p>2. Standard Account User with Parental Controls</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parental Controls is a classification of user account assigned to a standard account user. It cannot be assigned to an Administrator. This classification is necessary because it is normally assigned to identify users who require some control
 or guidance when using computer. This feature has to be turned ’On’ by the administrator. Parental Controls will help you to manage how your children shall use the computer, by setting limits on your children's access to the web, the hours they can log on
 to the computer, and restricting which games they can play and programs they can run.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Parental Controls blocks access to a webpage or game, a notification is displayed that the webpage or program has been blocked. Your child can click a link in the notification to request permission for access to that webpage or program.
 You can allow access by entering your Administrator account information.</p>
<p>　</p>
<strong>
<p>3. Parental Control in Windows Implementation&nbsp;</p>
<p>The above paragraphs would have given a brief understanding on UAC and Parental Control features available in Windows. Here let us see in more detail about where and how the Parental Control feature is available in Windows and some problems
 faced in implementing the Parental Control feature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a parental control to be set up you first have to create a Standard User and then for the created standard user account you have to set the individual Parental Controls by Clicking the Parental Controls: 'On'. If, Activity Reporting is
 required you can Click it ‘On‘. Activity reporting will collect information about the computer usage and the report will be reminded at the frequency we set, for example : Weekly or daily.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After which, options for Windows Settings are required to be set up. Let us see these options and how they are required to be set up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;1. Windows Vista Web Filter</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The web filter works by rating the content of websites and blocking some websites based the content categories I decide as objectionable. By turning this 'On' the filter may reduce the number of objectionable websites viewable but, it cannot
 be absolute protection. The reason being the objectionable content are subjective and universally well known.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this option we(as Parents) are required to control allowed websites, downloads, and other use. We have to opt to specify, “Which parts of Internet can the USER visit?” .</p>
<p>. Block some websites or content (or)</p>
<p>. Allow all websites and content</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we select first option above then we have the option to specify the list to</p>
<p>Allow and block specific Websites. In this we can Edit the Allow and block list and then we can opt to allow only the websites which are on the allow list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can also Choose the restriction level to Block web content automatically. The restriction level are categorized as .High .Medium .None .Custom . In custom level we need to choose content categories to block specific content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An option to Block File downloads can also be clicked in order to disallow downloads.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>　2. Time Limits</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this option we can Control when and at what Time our children will be using the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>　3. Games</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this option we can control games by rating, content, or title by specifying whether the USER can be allowed to play games. If 'Yes' then we need to allow or block the games by rating and content types. This has to be done by Setting Game
 Ratings. Different type of ratings are available and the access to these Games will be allowed or blocked based on the Okayed Game Ratings which we require to set up. By default the ratings available in my Computer was supported by ESRB. Once this is set we
 can also Block (or Allow) any game on your computer by name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>　4. Allow and block specific programs</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this we can specify the programs which can be used by the USER. When we specify these options we can Allow (or) block any programs on your computer. The available options are</p>
<p>. USER can use all programs</p>
<p>. USER can only use the programs I allow</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By default the first option is selected, but, if you require to specify and control only the programs which you allow, you need to select the second option. When the second option is selected a list of program will be shown from which you
 can select and Check the programs that can be used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After all the above options are set, Click ‘OK’ for the user and the Parental Control will be activated when the USER log on the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>　</p>
<strong>
<p>3. Problems faced with Parental Control in Windows&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would be more appropriate if I could explain what are the problems faced when trying to implement the Parental Controls and in enforcing it in the Home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Scenario for Typical Home</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am a home user and recently purchased a Home PC with loads of OEM software and goodies and the OS was Windows Vista Home Premium. We both are working parents and have two children. Eldest son is High School Grader and youngest daughter
 is First Grader. We decide to share the Home PC and as recommended we started by creating individual User Account for everyone at home. This would mean default 1 (One) Administrator User Account and 4 (Four) Standard User Account with 2 (Two) to be set with
 Parental Controls. The default Administrator User Account would be assigned the first time when you start operating the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Logged in as Administrator I created, initially 2 (Two) Standard user account meant for us, the parents. Then, I started creating 2 (Two) Standard User Accounts with Parental Controls to be Clicked ’On’.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then for each user account I started Setting the individual Parental Controls respectively. I clicked the Parental Controls: 'On'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For Activity Reporting, I clicked ’On’ and frequency I selected for Activity Viewing initially was every day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>
<p>Problem !!&nbsp;</p>
<p>As recommended, we created a Standard User Account for us Parents. We as User will be accessing the computer using our individual login id. The Administrator User will not be frequently used for log in and will be used mostly when installing
 application programs and when performing other set ups.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We could not understand this .</p>
<p>i) How and who will be assigned to view Activity reporting ?</p>
<p>ii) How and why should an Administrator be assigned as a parent, to view Activity reporting of our Children?</p>
<p>iii) Any other standard user also cannot be considered as a parent !!</p>
<p>iv) Why as a parent using our individual User Account we are not able to view our Childs Activity Reporting and why we should use an Administrator Account?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Finally, we decided to click ’Off’ for Activity Reporting, as we thought it may not be needed at this stage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Continuing further, we proceeded with setting the options for Windows Settings. The options chosen by us and problems faced are given category wise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>　1. Windows Vista Web Filter</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For setting this we entered our option, by turning this Filter ‘On’ by clicking ‘Block some websites or content’. We did not enter any specific websites as we were not sure which site contains what content. We decided to use the ‘Block Web
 Content Automatically’ and the default set rate as Medium. Downloads were not checked for blocking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>
<p>Problem !!&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. We felt that we would be facing issues when downloading huge content using Web. We also will not be able to control on, which content is being downloaded, from where and whether it contains malware etc. But, instead of totally blocking
 all downloads we decided to leave this issue open.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. What will happen to the downloaded contents by Standard User which is available in the Public area and Disk space. ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. For searching contents in Web and in controlling the Web search there had already been known issues. How can we control the objectionable content from being returned by the Web search engine ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. How to stop irrelevant Advertisement content and Shopping sites not suited for my children ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Now, the big question is., how will the Web Site or content manager be able to decide to age of my children ? Search engines like Bing, Yahoo, Google obviously will not be able to check the age group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Why, as a Parent, I am not being notified for download requests?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. Why am I (Parent) not being allowed to decide what is the content of the downloads immediately after a download is completed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally we decided to leave everything to default.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>　2. Time Limits</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This option seems to be Okay and we decided to leave it for now and did not set any Time Limits for accessing the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>　3. Games&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here, we had to specify which types of Games the USER (the user with Parental Controls) can play and this can be controlled by rating, content or title. Our chosen options was 'Yes', USER can play games. After which we have the option of
 choosing which type of games USER can play and choose whether we have to Allow (or) Block games by rating and content types. For this we have to Set the game ratings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First we have to choose whether USER can play games if the game does not have a rating. We clicked to . Allow games with no rating</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then we have to specify which ratings are ‘Ok’ for USER to play. By default the rating is always positioned at 18+ or ADULTS ONLY rating. Then we have to choose which games has to be blocked based on the content it contains. We chose to retain
 the default values.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, we have the option to 'Block or Allow specific games' . When we clicked this option we were shown the Games which came pre-installed by the Microsoft Games. Other games provided by the OEM did not show up in the list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>
<p>Problem !!&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Here also, the age of my children is not taken into consideration as it is not requested to be filled in by the parent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. When games developed and rated by external agencies it is not available in the list of ‘Block or Allow specific games’.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. There is no way to identify that the software or application being installed belongs to the entertainment category or Games category.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. The UAC already defines that Administrator permission is required to install a new software. But, the activity reporting does not show the new application or games installed as the distinction between administrator and parent is not available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Why when installing a new software of unrated content the parent or administrator is not notified to identify the content and rate it accordingly ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Why am I (Parent) not being allowed to decide and rate the contents of entertainment or video content when no ratings are available ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;　</p>
<p>4. Allow and block specific programs&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this we had to select the options whether to Allow or Block specific programs. We initially chose to Block some programs and allow the USER to run only the programs we allow. Okay, the computer took some time in displaying all the programs
 installed. We then had to click which programs are to be used by the User.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>
<p>Problem !!&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. The list of programs displayed were not in program groups as is normally shown in the Start Menu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. The list included some programs which should not be present there at all. For example</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) lot of files named setup.exe from locations including Install Shield</p>
<p>b) shutdown.exe</p>
<p>c) My Antivirus software (Norton) and all its executables</p>
<p>d) On verifying with my Laptop I found that Touch Pad and its executables also</p>
<p>showed up in the list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Application executable files from common shared locations were included in the list to be allowed to be blocked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Why am I not asked when I install a new application what type of application is it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, we decided to select the default , .USER can use all programs</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Is any solution available to make the Parental Controls more parent friendly?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>
<p>2. Solution&nbsp;</p>
<p>If only we could make the Parental Control better addressing some of the problems.!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. We should understand that Administrator is and cannot be always take the role of a parent. When a parental control is being set for a standard account an exclusive link between Parent user account and Child user account is also required.
 When a parent user account is assigned to a child user account (with parental controls) then the parent should be able to view the activity reporting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>2. When assigning Parental Controls to a Standard User Account the age group of the child for whom the control is being set up is required to be updated or filled in by the Administrator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>3. When age group of the child is available more control on the search results can be made by blocking objectionable contents and blocking of irrelevant advertising content and shopping sites can be done. Only relevant web sites suited for
 the age can be visited by the user.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>4. Presently there are only two options to control downloads. Either to allow or block downloads. Instead of completely blocking so as to control the downloads from the web, a notification to download can be sent to the assigned parent. Then
 the parent can either allow or block the download, and meanwhile the child user (with parental controls) who started the download can be alerted that the download is in progress with priority.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>5. As a parent, whenever a download is completed the content rating has to be decided by me (Parent) and I should be allowed to update the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>6. Most importantly, access to the /User/Public space is decided by UAC and is depending on 'Authorized User Account'. I agree with this, but, what if the child user account is able to modify or delete the files already being shared by other
 users. This should not happen and requires guidance before the child user account can venture into /user/public space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>7. In setting the Games rating, the default games ratings has to be selected based on the Age Group of the child user account, which the parent is supposed to enter when the parental controls are set 'On'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>8. Any application or software before being installed has to classified as whether it is a Game, Entertainment or Software by the administrator (or) parent. This would always ensure that more control can be made available for games.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9. When for an entertainment software, games or video no ratings for the content is available the parent (or) administrator should be allowed to decide and rate the contents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10. The Windows Media Center program can direct access to Servers(for TV/Video/Media) which has only content suited for the specified Age. This would be more appropriate and helpful instead of blocking the program itself. As a parent I will
 not object to a Cartoon movie, Superman movie or Spiderman movie from being watched if it does not require subscription.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>11. When Blocking or Allowing specific programs, the programs being listed should be displayed under Program Groups like the way it is appearing in start menu. This would make it more easy to identify the program. System(0) programs should
 not be shown.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>12. If the user is a Standard User with parental controls, the user Desktop should be void of programs which requires registration, warranty etc. This can be avoided by allowing the administrator to select the program icons to be displayed
 in the Desktop when creating a user account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>The above solutions are only indicative of possible ways or means for problems referred to given in this document.</p>

<p>After all the above options are set, Click ‘OK’ for the user and the Parental Control will be activated when the USER log on the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>　</p>
<strong>
<p>3. Problems faced with Parental Control in Windows&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would be more appropriate if I could explain what are the problems faced when trying to implement the Parental Controls and in enforcing it in the Home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Scenario for Typical Home</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am a home user and recently purchased a Home PC with loads of OEM software and goodies and the OS was Windows Vista Home Premium. We both are working parents and have two children. Eldest son is High School Grader and youngest daughter
 is First Grader. We decide to share the Home PC and as recommended we started by creating individual User Account for everyone at home. This would mean default 1 (One) Administrator User Account and 4 (Four) Standard User Account with 2 (Two) to be set with
 Parental Controls. The default Administrator User Account would be assigned the first time when you start operating the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Logged in as Administrator I created, initially 2 (Two) Standard user account meant for us, the parents. Then, I started creating 2 (Two) Standard User Accounts with Parental Controls to be Clicked ’On’.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then for each user account I started Setting the individual Parental Controls respectively. I clicked the Parental Controls: 'On'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For Activity Reporting, I clicked ’On’ and frequency I selected for Activity Viewing initially was every day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>
<p>Problem !!&nbsp;</p>
<p>As recommended, we created a Standard User Account for us Parents. We as User will be accessing the computer using our individual login id. The Administrator User will not be frequently used for log in and will be used mostly when installing
 application programs and when performing other set ups.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We could not understand this .</p>
<p>i) How and who will be assigned to view Activity reporting ?</p>
<p>ii) How and why should an Administrator be assigned as a parent, to view Activity reporting of our Children?</p>
<p>iii) Any other standard user also cannot be considered as a parent !!</p>
<p>iv) Why as a parent using our individual User Account we are not able to view our Childs Activity Reporting and why we should use an Administrator Account?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Finally, we decided to click ’Off’ for Activity Reporting, as we thought it may not be needed at this stage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Continuing further, we proceeded with setting the options for Windows Settings. The options chosen by us and problems faced are given category wise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>　1. Windows Vista Web Filter</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For setting this we entered our option, by turning this Filter ‘On’ by clicking ‘Block some websites or content’. We did not enter any specific websites as we were not sure which site contains what content. We decided to use the ‘Block Web
 Content Automatically’ and the default set rate as Medium. Downloads were not checked for blocking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>
<p>Problem !!&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. We felt that we would be facing issues when downloading huge content using Web. We also will not be able to control on, which content is being downloaded, from where and whether it contains malware etc. But, instead of totally blocking
 all downloads we decided to leave this issue open.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. What will happen to the downloaded contents by Standard User which is available in the Public area and Disk space. ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. For searching contents in Web and in controlling the Web search there had already been known issues. How can we control the objectionable content from being returned by the Web search engine ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. How to stop irrelevant Advertisement content and Shopping sites not suited for my children ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Now, the big question is., how will the Web Site or content manager be able to decide to age of my children ? Search engines like Bing, Yahoo, Google obviously will not be able to check the age group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Why, as a Parent, I am not being notified for download requests?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. Why am I (Parent) not being allowed to decide what is the content of the downloads immediately after a download is completed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally we decided to leave everything to default.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>　2. Time Limits</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This option seems to be Okay and we decided to leave it for now and did not set any Time Limits for accessing the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>　3. Games&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here, we had to specify which types of Games the USER (the user with Parental Controls) can play and this can be controlled by rating, content or title. Our chosen options was 'Yes', USER can play games. After which we have the option of
 choosing which type of games USER can play and choose whether we have to Allow (or) Block games by rating and content types. For this we have to Set the game ratings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First we have to choose whether USER can play games if the game does not have a rating. We clicked to . Allow games with no rating</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then we have to specify which ratings are ‘Ok’ for USER to play. By default the rating is always positioned at 18+ or ADULTS ONLY rating. Then we have to choose which games has to be blocked based on the content it contains. We chose to retain
 the default values.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, we have the option to 'Block or Allow specific games' . When we clicked this option we were shown the Games which came pre-installed by the Microsoft Games. Other games provided by the OEM did not show up in the list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>
<p>Problem !!&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Here also, the age of my children is not taken into consideration as it is not requested to be filled in by the parent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. When games developed and rated by external agencies it is not available in the list of ‘Block or Allow specific games’.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. There is no way to identify that the software or application being installed belongs to the entertainment category or Games category.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. The UAC already defines that Administrator permission is required to install a new software. But, the activity reporting does not show the new application or games installed as the distinction between administrator and parent is not available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Why when installing a new software of unrated content the parent or administrator is not notified to identify the content and rate it accordingly ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Why am I (Parent) not being allowed to decide and rate the contents of entertainment or video content when no ratings are available ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;　</p>
<p>4. Allow and block specific programs&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this we had to select the options whether to Allow or Block specific programs. We initially chose to Block some programs and allow the USER to run only the programs we allow. Okay, the computer took some time in displaying all the programs
 installed. We then had to click which programs are to be used by the User.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>
<p>Problem !!&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. The list of programs displayed were not in program groups as is normally shown in the Start Menu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. The list included some programs which should not be present there at all. For example</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) lot of files named setup.exe from locations including Install Shield</p>
<p>b) shutdown.exe</p>
<p>c) My Antivirus software (Norton) and all its executables</p>
<p>d) On verifying with my Laptop I found that Touch Pad and its executables also</p>
<p>showed up in the list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Application executable files from common shared locations were included in the list to be allowed to be blocked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Why am I not asked when I install a new application what type of application is it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, we decided to select the default , .USER can use all programs</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Is any solution available to make the Parental Controls more parent friendly?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>
<p>2. Solution&nbsp;</p>
<p>If only we could make the Parental Control better addressing some of the problems.!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. We should understand that Administrator is and cannot be always take the role of a parent. When a parental control is being set for a standard account an exclusive link between Parent user account and Child user account is also required.
 When a parent user account is assigned to a child user account (with parental controls) then the parent should be able to view the activity reporting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>2. When assigning Parental Controls to a Standard User Account the age group of the child for whom the control is being set up is required to be updated or filled in by the Administrator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>3. When age group of the child is available more control on the search results can be made by blocking objectionable contents and blocking of irrelevant advertising content and shopping sites can be done. Only relevant web sites suited for
 the age can be visited by the user.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>4. Presently there are only two options to control downloads. Either to allow or block downloads. Instead of completely blocking so as to control the downloads from the web, a notification to download can be sent to the assigned parent. Then
 the parent can either allow or block the download, and meanwhile the child user (with parental controls) who started the download can be alerted that the download is in progress with priority.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>5. As a parent, whenever a download is completed the content rating has to be decided by me (Parent) and I should be allowed to update the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>6. Most importantly, access to the /User/Public space is decided by UAC and is depending on 'Authorized User Account'. I agree with this, but, what if the child user account is able to modify or delete the files already being shared by other
 users. This should not happen and requires guidance before the child user account can venture into /user/public space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>7. In setting the Games rating, the default games ratings has to be selected based on the Age Group of the child user account, which the parent is supposed to enter when the parental controls are set 'On'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>8. Any application or software before being installed has to classified as whether it is a Game, Entertainment or Software by the administrator (or) parent. This would always ensure that more control can be made available for games.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9. When for an entertainment software, games or video no ratings for the content is available the parent (or) administrator should be allowed to decide and rate the contents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10. The Windows Media Center program can direct access to Servers(for TV/Video/Media) which has only content suited for the specified Age. This would be more appropriate and helpful instead of blocking the program itself. As a parent I will
 not object to a Cartoon movie, Superman movie or Spiderman movie from being watched if it does not require subscription.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>11. When Blocking or Allowing specific programs, the programs being listed should be displayed under Program Groups like the way it is appearing in start menu. This would make it more easy to identify the program. System(0) programs should
 not be shown.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>12. If the user is a Standard User with parental controls, the user Desktop should be void of programs which requires registration, warranty etc. This can be avoided by allowing the administrator to select the program icons to be displayed
 in the Desktop when creating a user account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>The above solutions are only indicative of possible ways or means for problems referred to given in this document.</p>

    <title>Action button stop working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> phantomwr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Action button stop working</h2>
                    <p>
Just to recap my story about Powerpoint. I have many videos in my presentations, and some are non&nbsp;compatible with PPT, so I can't insert them (also for the size).</p>
<p>
So, before, I used to insert an image and link it to my folder videos, to a specific video.</p>
<p>
Problems: when you move or rename something the link is broken; in addition, window shows a warning about external files every time you click on a link.</p>
<p>
So I changed to "action". I assign an action to the image, then "run program" and changing from "program" to "all files" I am able to start the video just clicking on the image.&nbsp; I used to get a warning&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/66a12dab-99d3-4753-baf4-3adc9bd87220" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/66a12dab-99d3-4753-baf4-3adc9bd87220" /></a></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
only the first time I click for this "Enable all", but after the first time no other warnings and everything goes fine.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
In the Trust Center I put the folder of the videos in a trusted location, </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6389bd98-c1fc-47cb-b9f8-0f52101775f5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6389bd98-c1fc-47cb-b9f8-0f52101775f5" /></a></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
I enabled "all macros" not recommended </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/df262d95-43c2-4579-b578-5614d6ab06b8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/df262d95-43c2-4579-b578-5614d6ab06b8" /></a></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
and enabled all&nbsp;the "activeX" even if not reccomended.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e7bbc799-c91b-40f9-88c7-0567a595e6d1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e7bbc799-c91b-40f9-88c7-0567a595e6d1" /></a></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Last week I had a presentation without any problem, but yesterday, using the SAME presentation clicking on the image.. nothing happened. And that is for all my presentations: no more action when clicking the images.</p>
<p>
I can see the "action" path when passing over with the pointer, </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3122d684-2224-4539-bb4c-7910d4ea1ab0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3122d684-2224-4539-bb4c-7910d4ea1ab0" /></a></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
but clicking on it doesn't start anything. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
It seems that the first warning coming out when I click for the first time in a presentation (see first pic), is not appearing anymore, so I can't click on "enable all macros" and keep going with the presentation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
And I set the enable messages in the trust center</p>
<p>
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1668ab7f-c9b2-401f-8346-3a952f063322" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1668ab7f-c9b2-401f-8346-3a952f063322" /></a></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
So ,maybe if we are able to make&nbsp;this message coming up again we fix the issue.</p>
<p>
I tried the same presentation on another computer and it works fine; so it must be a setting in mine.. some recent update...</p>
<p>
I have office 365 pro and windows 10</p>
<p>
Thank you<br />

    <title>Inoperative PowerPoint 2007 Pointer Options - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> k7sem  say:</h3>
<h2>            Inoperative PowerPoint 2007 Pointer Options</h2>
                    <p>The Office 2007 PowerPoint pointer options feature has stopped working on my install.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I can right click and see all of the options, -- the highlighter, the felt tip pen, the pen etc.<span>&nbsp;
</span>But when I try to select an option, the pointer simply stays a pointer.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>I've run the Office repair utility, removed and reinstalled the software twice and looked all over the internet for solutions.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I see dozens of posts complaining about this issue but no confirmed solution.</p>
<p>One solution recommended here is to choose the run all from computer option for PowerPoint, but that's the way I've always used the software.</p>
<p>At one time it did work correctly.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Something changed, perhaps a service pack update, and the pointer option feature stopped working for me.</p>
<p>If anyone has any insight on this, I would really like a solution or a suggestion.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It's not a show-stopper to me if it's not corrected, but it is an annoyance to lose this feature.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I use PowerPoint a great deal and have developed a habit of using this tool during my presentations.</p>
<p>I can see that *Many* people are having the same issue.</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Until that time…</p>

<h2>            Excel 2016 for Mac SQL Server ODBC issues with connecting to SQL Server</h2>
                    <p>I am having trouble connecting to a SQL Server via the new Excel 2016 for Mac SQL Server ODBC New Database Query feature. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to follow the Office Support info available on this link:</p>
<p>https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Import-data-from-a-database-in-Excel-2016-for-Mac-bc139dc9-861f-4435-9f0d-82c6121dcea5#feedbackText&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I successfully manage to query the same SQL server in Windows using ODBC connections to the SQL server on our LAN. However, I try the same or similar settings with my Mac's Excel 2016 and I do not succeed in making the connection. &nbsp; I do the following:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/beb0a73c-6b13-4871-8d57-d5460dc59193" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/beb0a73c-6b13-4871-8d57-d5460dc59193" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I started with the following settings (and error message resulting below)</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0b999c20-c42a-4e6e-b690-8d77a5e4e9d6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0b999c20-c42a-4e6e-b690-8d77a5e4e9d6" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see the Login failed for user 'crystal'. :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then found some support that stated that I need to specify the Port number for the server (60198):</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/409315e4-2b84-430d-81ee-62722543e776" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/409315e4-2b84-430d-81ee-62722543e776" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the error code changes from 28000 to HY000 and the message reads "Connection broken unexpectedly". &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried without specifying the actual Database name with the same result:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e1e008c8-4c63-439b-90ea-e5e86ff9c184" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e1e008c8-4c63-439b-90ea-e5e86ff9c184" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate help with understanding where I am going wrong with my recipe to create the New Database Query.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help.</p>

            <p>Hi Victor,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue is always related to the authentication mode to SQL server and Windows. Given this situation, I would suggest you post to our
<a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/sqlserver/en-US/home?forum=sqldataaccess" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
SQL server data access forum</a> for depth assistance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Here is an article for your reference:
</span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/kb/2121736" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Error message when you try to authenticate an ODBC connection to your SQL Server 2005 or 2008 SQL Instance by using the

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>

            <p>Hi Sky Pei,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for your response. &nbsp;Apologies for taking so long to get back to you but for some reason I wasn't notified of your post. &nbsp; I will post in the SQL server data access forum. &nbsp; Is there a way that I can forward my original post to the SQL server
 forum? &nbsp; It was quite tedious pasting screenshots etc on the original post and it would be very helpful if I can just forward.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Victor<br />

<p>Are there any clues in the Event log about what is happening?&nbsp; Alternatively, you may get some clues from running ProcMon to expose whatever diagnostics are being created (or suppressed).</p>

            <p>Hi Natasha. Unfortunately, you are correct that the <em>"Save As/Save a Copy of this workbook in the same folder as the original"</em> option is currently available only in Excel. Of course, we do our best to make the web apps as consistent as possible,
 but this is one area where we aren't quite there yet. I'll make sure your feedback on this issue gets to the right people.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thank you for using the web apps and providing your feedback so we can make them better!</p>

            Has this functionality been added yet? I use the Word Online version in Office 365 for editing and I have a basic Word template document that is the starting point for most of my files. But I can't open it and then do a save as. I have to open it in Word
 2011 (using a Mac) and then edit there, then drag and drop it into my documents site in Office 365. Why can't I just open the template, do a Save As right in Office 365 and keep working on it from there? What is missing?

            Hi Rick. Thanks for posting. I can't give an exact date, but we are adding Save As (to OneDrive) for Word and PowerPoint in an upcoming release. Please keep an eye out for it in the next few weeks.

    <title>When I copy and paste a text value from Excel onto a Word or Notepad - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mi_1  say:</h3>
<h2>            When I copy and paste a text value from Excel onto a Word or Notepad file, the value appears to be in quoations and broken into two columns. What do I do to fix this&#63;</h2>
                    <p>For example, I have the following values in text format in Excel 2007:</p>
<p>000100</p>
<p>000101</p>
<p>[Some background info on the above values: They&nbsp;were formed from concantenation from previous spreadsheets, and then were pasted as text&nbsp;values in another spreadsheet that is in text format.]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I copy these values from Excel and paste them into Notepad or Word or any application, I get this:</p>
<p>"000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 100"</p>
<p>"000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 101"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried clearing the format on the cells and it didn't help. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems that there are hidden formats in the cell that I cannot get rid of. Does anyone know how to fix this? Or why it happens?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Is it happening only while copying from a particular file or all files?</p>
<p>Also provide us with the steps on how you had concatenated the data into Excel.</p>
<p>Are you able to copy from a different Excel file and paste it into other applications?</p>
<p>Are you able to copy from a Word and paste it into other applications?</p>
<p>Does this issue occur when you are performing the copy/paste function from Excel to the other application when any of the browsers are open?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a work around you may try inserting the copied value as text, using the Paste Special option in Excel or Word:</p>

                    <p>I mainly use Excel as a checkbook.&nbsp; Up until today, it was working great....&nbsp; But all of a sudden, the "Total" column" stopped working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried "Dragging" from the line above and clicking on "Fill Formatting Only", and that didnt help.&nbsp; The only thing I can do is hit save and then it updates.&nbsp; Can anyone help??</p>
<p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Date (A)</td>
<td>CK #/Trans&nbsp; (B)</td>
<td>Description (C)</td>
<td>Credit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (D)</td>
<td>Debit&nbsp; (E)</td>
<td>Total&nbsp;&nbsp; (F)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>My formula entries for the total column are &nbsp;=F(Line # of previous Line F total)+D(Line #)+E(Line #)</p>
<p>so if I had 100 bucks, and then spent 50, the total would automatically update to the 50 bucks I have left.&nbsp; Like I said, it was working PERFECTLY until today.&nbsp; Now, it doesnt auto update. Can anyone help?? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you Gino. &nbsp;However since the language in the link "use the System File Checker Tool" is so technical,
<strong>and I'm definitely not a techie</strong>, can I just follow the steps in "repair Office from the Control Panel" link? &nbsp;I'm even nervous about doing this, so if I do will it be sufficient to locate my lost clip art without doing the System File Checker
 Tool part?</p>
<p>I'm asking before I follow any of your previous instructions. &nbsp;Thanks!</p>

<p>Thank you again Gino. &nbsp;However I followed your last instructions to repair Office without using the System File Checker tool. &nbsp;It did not work. &nbsp;There is still none of the previously loaded windows clip art when I open a doc and insert clipart.</p>
<p>Since using the System File Checker tool seems way to technical for me to attempt, I have decided to just take the time and add my own desired clip arts from the Bing clip art tool.</p>
<p>This seems to work well and although more effort beginning, at least I am assured of having nice &nbsp;(and free) clip art available in my Photo Gallery to use with documents.</p>
<p>Thank you again for your help. &nbsp;Elizabeth</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm using the Exportwithformatting command in a macro to extract data and load it into a spreadsheet but I don't want the spreadsheet saved.&nbsp; Is it possible to turn this function off?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm using it to create a spreadsheet of extracted names so that they can then be fed into a Dymo label printer and print sticky labels.&nbsp; Eventually, non-technical people will be using the database and I didn't want them to have the bother of dealing with
 a redundant file.&nbsp; Maybe there's an alternative method I can use.&nbsp; I think I'll check to see if I can feed Dymo directly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the response.</p>

<p>Hi Joe, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may consider any Office 365 subscriptions with desktop clients included.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Office 365 Personal contain desktop Office suite for Word, Excel, PowerPoint as well as Outlook and it's for one person, means you can install it once across different devices.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Office 365 Home also contain desktop suite but is for up to 6 people.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Please check this following article for a detailed introduction and prices for these plans:
</span><a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/buy/compare-microsoft-office-products-for-mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://products.office.com/en-us/buy/compare-microsoft-office-products-for-mac</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>And if you only want to use Outlook for Mac without other Office apps, you can also consider to only buy Outlook, it's a one-time purchase:

    <title>Pivot Chart - Dynamic Axis Values - On Slicer Selection - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> porter444  say:</h3>
<h2>            Pivot Chart - Dynamic Axis Values - On Slicer Selection</h2>
                    <p>I have a work book that includes multiple pivot tables and pivot charts that display performance information for out different business units.&nbsp; The user selects the business unit they want to view via a slicer tied to a pivot table, and values are displayed
 in a pivot chart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem I am facing is that when I allow Excel to auto determine the&nbsp;axis&nbsp;bounds (Minimum and Maximum)&nbsp;the chart lines are very tightly grouped together and the user cannot easily see the variation in the line values.&nbsp; I can fix this by manually setting
 the bound values, but each business unit would need a different minimum and maximum value for each selection to display a meaningful chart.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you suggest a solution for this issue? (without having a separate chart for each business unit)&nbsp; My first thought was if I could set a field in the worksheet and they have the bound values set based on the field values (which I would change on the slicer
 selection)... that doesn't seem to be possible, or I just don't know how.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are two different business unit selections&nbsp;in the same chart:</p>
