<h2>            Change the color of a hyperlink in a cell&#63;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;I want the hyperlink to be readable, not some fancy-dancy blue or magenta.<br />
Simple black, bold for both before and after it is clicked so that normal people can read it.<br />
I don't even want it to be underlined.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will place a very small marker in the field with the name to show that it is a link.</p>
<p>It can be done in my web sites using HTML and I have some HTML-type coding in my

VBA but don't see how to do this.</p>

    <title>Preserving text format when copying and paste special-ing from Excel - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jonk2014&#33;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Preserving text format when copying and paste special-ing from Excel to Word in Office 2010 Professional Plus</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I am trying to copy a fairly complex spreadsheet (one that contains several simple mathematical functions coded into the document -- I mention this in case it might be having some effect on what I'm experiencing) from Excel to Word, but when I do so, the
 text within the cells is affected ... the spacing between some characters becomes wider, causing other characters to nearly overlap with one another and rendering the text whacky-looking on the whole. I am highlighting and copying the table within Excel, placing
 my cursor on the destination page in Word, clicking "Paste Special," and selecting "Paste as Microsoft Excel Worksheet Document."
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any idea how I can accomplish transferring this table from Excel to Word WITHOUT messing up the text within the cells?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            I think I would be inclined to paste a link as Windows metafile. This should give you a result closer to the source data and will still be linked back to the source material.<br />

            I have toyed around with removing the functions (I'm not entirely sure I've removed every one of them, to be honest), but it doesn't seem to have an effect. I have also tried pasting to a .doc file in lieu of .docx file, but to no avail. Is there a particular
 type of Excel file you'd recommend I try saving it as that might work for preserving the format when I copy and paste the table to Word?<br />

<p>You probably did not get a cab file in the download but rather 
a file that needs to be executed from your PC for an automatic install.&nbsp; I would take the file, place it on your desktop and try to install it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, if it is not an executable file from your desktop, look at it ... is it a zipped file?&nbsp; If it is, open it and what is inside will probably be the cab file you are looking for.&nbsp; If it is, copy that cab file to your device.&nbsp; Run that file
 and it will self install.&nbsp; Remember where you placed that file so after the install, if it has not been removed, you can safely delete it to save space.</p>

    <title>After Windows 8.1 upgrade, Internet Explorer stopped working and games - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michael birkett  say:</h3>
<h2>            After Windows 8.1 upgrade, Internet Explorer stopped working and games stopped working.</h2>
                    <b>Original Title: </b>Windows 8.1 broke my computer<br />
<br />
This is just getting ridiculous. &nbsp;I assumed that Windows 8.1 was just going to similar to a service pack, and therefore not a huge deal, but it the only thing it has succeeded in doing so far is breaking my computer. &nbsp;The first, and most evident, feature of
 the "update" was that when I tried to open Internet Explorer, I was bombarded by an endless stream of "Internet Explorer has stopped working" messages. &nbsp;And I literally mean endless; I had to end IE from the task manager, and the error messages were still
 coming up even after the program had been ended. &nbsp;I eventually changed a setting that stopped the endless stream of error messages, but IE still doesn't work. &nbsp;I tried everything I could think of to try to restore its functionality, from disabling all my add-ons,
 to clearing my history and cookies, and even running the IE troubleshooter that comes installed. &nbsp;Nothing worked, and it's a good thing that Chrome still does, otherwise I'd be out of luck.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I had assumed that this was the extent of the problems with 8.1, and that was tolerable, even though IE is my preferred browser. &nbsp;When I turned my computer back on today, however, none of my games work. &nbsp;They all crash upon launching, or have some kind
 of bizarre rendering issues that make them unplayable. &nbsp;Windows Update says I don't have anything to download, I have seen no resolution to any similar problems with 8.1 here on the support forums, and when I tried to IM with a tech, I was told I was contacting
 them outside their operating hours (despite their operating hours being 24/7).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This **** is immensely frustrating, and if I still fail to see a resolution to any of this within a day, I'm going to have to restore my system back to Widows 8.</div>
<div>Seriously, does no one Beta test these things anymore?</div>

            Actually, there are 3 ways to zoom in Chrome:
<div><br />
<div>
<ol>
<li>To zoom in: Press 'CTRL' + 'Plus' (the plus symbol on the num pad. The '=' works as well). To zoom out: Press 'CTRL' + '-' (the minus symbol, either the one on the numpad or the one next to the '=' symbol on top)</li><li>Press and hold 'CTRL' and scroll in or out with your mouse wheel to zoom in or out.</li><li>Click the Settings button on the top right (under the red X to close, looks like 3 lines) then click the plus or minus next to Zoom to zoom in or out.</li></ol>

            <p>If only I could make that happen. I'm hoping that you updated(I refuse to call it an upgrade as that is yet to be confirmed)&nbsp;from Windows 8, if so, then as long as you didn't have one of the same problems I had, there is a chance that using the Recovery
 option in Control Panel, you can roll back to prior to updating. I would've done so within an hour of updating to 8.1 myself, but the process cleared all of my restore points.</p>

<p>If you do not have a restore point prior to updating, then your only option that doesn't require a complete re-installation of your OS would be to restore your system from an image or back-up created prior to updating from 8 to 8.1. In my case, these were
 also destroyed by the update to 8.1 and so I was left with the option to format/re-install or nothing, and I chose to do nothing and use third party software to work around all of the features that the upgrade broke.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The last option is to stay with 8.1 and to tackle each issue individually. First I would go after your hardware by making sure that you have the latest BIOS for your MB and the latest drivers associated with it and any peripherals you have. Most manufacturers
 have drivers out now that are compatible with 8.1 that weren't available at the initial rollout back in October.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Once you've tackled that, the next step would be to attempt to repair your current installation of Windows. For instructions, you can go here:

            Thanks for those tips, of which I had been unaware. I should have been more specific: what Chrome can't do, unless they've changed it since my original post, is pinch zoom, which is pretty important on a Surface, with that small touch screen.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>By the way, on my second trip to the Microsoft Store they finally quit blaming the problem on false causes, dug in, and actually fixed the problem. There's a lot to like about the Surface (Pro); it's a very compact platform that can actually run full Windows
 programs. But I wouldn't recommend it to anyone not within driving distance of a Microsoft Store. I've already had quite a number of incidents that would have been insoluble had I not been able to take it in to their techs.</div>

    <title>Camera issue - pink flickering - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> picke---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Camera issue - pink flickering</h2>
                    
<p><span>Hey, I've had my Nokia Lumia 800 for about a week now. Everything is working fine except when I go in to camera mode when I am inside and try to snap a picture out of the window, I’m standing &nbsp;2-3 meters from the window. When I point the camera towards
 the window the view finder of the camera software starts to flicker with pink lines. These pink flickers are not visible on the image itself and the quality of the image is the same as all other pictures I have taken in different environments, but it is still
 a bit annoying... What makes me worry more is that in some cases, when it &nbsp;flickers really much with pink, the camera software freezes and you just get a black screen in the camera view finder and you can’t do anything in the camera and you have to power off
 the phone to be able to use the camera again. This only happens you really see the view finder flicker with pink like crazy.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I've played around a bit with the settings and what I've noticed is that is you change the metering mode to "frame average" it seldom does this flickering except in some cases, for example when it is really cloudy and bright outside and low light in
 the room.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Anyone seen this problem before or anything alike?&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>If you keep it pointed towards something that makes it flicker in pink for a verly long time the screen starts to move up. Though if you take a picture the picture still becomes accurate... got two samples attached&nbsp;that shows the issue.</p>

<p>Bottom line is that the camera app on the the Lumia 800 suck. The average user shouldn't have to fiddling around with the camera setting on the any phone. SOmething is obviously &nbsp;wrong with your phone; try to get it exchange.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think Nokia should address the camera issues public and give us a update date on a a fix. This is ridiculous and for a $600+ US frankly unacceptable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&nbsp;know&nbsp;someone will say that they [Nokia]&nbsp;said there is an update coming; show me where Nokia officially said any such thing.</p>

    <title>Nokia Suite and Nokia 701 Cable Driver Problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> inumani  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia Suite and Nokia 701 Cable Driver Problems</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I just bought a Nokia 701, and so far I love it, the only real problem I have is that I can't connect it with Nokia Suite through the provided cable, because the driver never get installed properly, everything OBEX fails to install.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the only real way I can fully connect my Nokia 701 with Nokia Suite is via Bluetooth, but the speeds are dramatically slower. So I'd like to know if there are others having this problem or if I'm the only one. And in case this problem is already known,
 will there be a solution for it soon?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also have a Nokia 5800 ExpressMusic and it has the same problem for ages. And it has never been solved, which I think it's pretty bad in a company the size of Nokia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just to clarify I'm using Windows 7 at 64 bits, and the latest version of Nokia Suite (3.3), and I'm trying to connect a Nokia 701 and a Nokia 5800, and both get driver incompatibilities that can't be resolved by the automatic Windows 7 search, and can't
 be resolved by searching for it manually with Windows Update, Windows Compatibility Site says that Nokia 5800 ExpressMusic should be 100% compatible, but, maybe because of the fact that Nokia 701 is relatively new, there is no information on the Windows Compatibility
 Site, about the device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help me with this problem, it's very important for me to be able to connect both my cellphones via cable to the Nokia Suite application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A preemptive thank you for all your help.</p>

<p>I haven't read much about Nokia 701, but it's a relatively new phone.</p>

<p>Hey Sevennikke7, Welcome to the Nokia Forums.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>To fix the problem, try the following solutions:<br />
</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span>disconnect the USB cable and connect it again.</span></span> </li><li><span><span>If you use a USB hub, try connecting the phone directly to the computer.&nbsp;<br />
</span></span></li><li><span><span>If you use a USB hub with an external power source, make sure that it has been switched on.<br />
</span></span></li><li><span><span>Check the USB cable for problems and replace if necessary.<br />
</span></span></li><li><span><span>If your phone asks you for the connection mode that you want to use, make sure that you select Nokia Suite(or PC Suite) on your phone.</span></span>
</li><li><span><span>Disconnect the cable, restart the computer, and try again.&nbsp;<br />
</span></span></li><li><span><span>Keep in mind that if you remove USB devices without using the Safely Remove Hardware tool in the Windows taskbar, connection problems may appear.</span></span>
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li><span><span>Go to Add/Remove Programs in Control Panel (called Programs and Features in Microsoft Windows 7).</span></span>
</li><li><span><span>Select Nokia Suite in the list of applications and click Change/Remove.<br />
</span></span></li><li><span><span>In the dialog that appears, choose Repair.Nokia Suite then check that all the needed files are intact and repairs any&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>errors that were found.&nbsp;</span></span>
</li><li><span><span>Control Panel &gt; Programs &gt; Programs &amp; features &gt; Nokia Connectivity cable driver, right click and Change/Repair</span></span>
</li><li><span>Try go Control Panel &gt; View Devices &gt; Remove your device profiles and reinstall them.</span>
</li></ul>
<p>As both devices cannot connect to your computer I believe it is a problem with drivers inside your PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps and you manage to resolve your issue. Please get back to me if your problem persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            I am at present using both Nokia 5800 &amp; 701. Previously I used to have the same problem of connectivity with Nokia suite for several months. Now it got solved after my purchasing official windows 7 professional os. If you like it you can try it. Now all
 of my problem of connectivity with the pc of mobile, digital camera &amp; other gadgets solved. Pirated versions of windows os will be blocking all the applications.

            Hi<br />
I had no problem with my Nokia 7230 allough this was not a smart phone it can connect both USB and bluetooth and Usb drivers are just the same ?<br />
<br />
So it is not a driver issue<br />
The 701 will only connect with Bluetooth even using the same lead it is a 701 issue !<br />
Does the 701 need a special lead as using the standard Nokia lead i had with my 7230 ??

I don't think admins the issue as it connect via Bluetooth OK<br />
<br />
Plus I can connect my Nokia 7230 with USB no problem<br />
<br />
I suspect the leead ma be the problem but I would have thought there would be only one Nokia Data Lead

    <title>Hotmail Stopped Synching to Windows 8 HTC Phone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kprince  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hotmail Stopped Synching to Windows 8 HTC Phone</h2>
                    <p>I purchased a Windows 8 HTC phone just over a week ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Email from my live.com account synched just fine, up until about 3 days ago.&nbsp; &nbsp;Then it just stopped.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I receive no error messages on my phone.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not see any error messages when I log into
 my live.com account.&nbsp; It was however around that time that a windows update was released, and applied, to the phone.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have </p>
<ul>
<li>turned off email synch on my phone, done a hard reboot, and then turned the synch back on.&nbsp; Did not work.</li><li>can't remove the live.com email on my phone as that is the primary account, so I tried adding a second account with the same live.com address.&nbsp; Did not work.</li><li>Tried turning off Backup Assistant Plus, no change.</li><li>Removed, rebooted, and re-added the Facebook account.&nbsp; No change.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have not done a factory reset on the phone, as I am concerned that 1) I could lose my calendar and contacts, and 2) it will take awhile to rebuild everything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Help!</p>

                    <p>I think I remember being told, when our company changed from Word 2003 to Word 2010/2013, that I would be able to copy text from a drawing, but I can't find any reference to that topic in Help.&nbsp; Is there a way to copy text from a drawing?&nbsp;

            <p>That rather depends on how the drawing was created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you (or someone else) used the Insert &gt; Shape tools to draw lines, boxes, arrows, etc.; right-clicked a shape and selected Add Text; and saved the document -- then you should be able to right-click the shape, click Edit Text, and select and copy the text.
 You'd have to do this for each individual piece of text in the drawing -- but at least it's just text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the drawing was made (or printed) on paper and scanned into the computer, you can't copy that text. The shapes that you see as letters are just pixels in the picture, like the lines and boxes. In that case, you need an optical character recognition (OCR)
 program that can "read" the document by recognizing the letters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have OneNote in your Office suite, you can paste the drawing into that program, right-click it, and click Copy Text from Picture. The text will be placed on the clipboard, and you can paste it into OneNote or into Word. Proofread it carefully, because
 OCR is prone to mistakes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't have OneNote, or if you want better performance, there are commercial OCR programs you can buy. The good ones tend to be expensive.</p>

<h2>            Scheduling a meeting beyond 180s...how can I change this for all calendars&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We've recently migrated over to Office 365. Is there a way to globally change how far in advance people can book meetings? We have like 200 different conference rooms / 3000 users across the company that this needs to be changed to. Everything I have seen
 shows how to modify this per room but it will take forever to apply that. We also do not want to have to manually adjust this setting every time we create a new room / user. Currently it is set to 180 days. Any ideas?</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>We can use PowerShell to edit all rooms in bulk. After this one-time change, all rooms’ attributes will be changed to what you want and don't need to be manually edited in future.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If you want to change <strong>all mailboxes </strong>no matter whether they are user mailboxes or room mailboxes, you can use the script:
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Get-mailbox | Set-CalendarProcessing -BookingWindowInDays *** as mentioned above.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If you want to change <strong>all room mailboxes</strong>, you can use the script:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Get-mailbox|where {$_.recipientTypeDetails -eq "roomMailbox"} | Set-CalendarProcessing -BookingWindowInDays ***.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Excel 2016 for Mac and Excel for Windows XP spreadsheet&#58; crash&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just subscribed to office 365 home and downloaded it onto a brand new iMac. I am trying to open a spreadsheet which was created using Excel for Windows XP. It works ok for a few minutes --all its content looks ok-- but the problem is that after a
 few minutes of work, it crashes ("excel had to close unexpectedly", sometimes it also freeze the mac and I have to force quite excel).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This document is crucial to me and is the main reason why I bought Office 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am told by Office support staff that excel 2016 for mac is compatible with previous excel versions, either for mac or windows. So I would like to know what is going on and how I can work safely on that spreadsheet using excel 2016 for mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using the latest version of osX (10.11.3) as well as the latest version of excel 2016 (365 subscription), which is 15.19.1 and it is set to automatic daily updates. The language is English-Primary and French and the region is Luxembourg (custom).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Luc</p>

<p>Copy the content of the Excel file in a new Excel workbook and check if the problem gets resolved.</p>

            <p>The size is 10.2MB; it was a number of straightforward formulae and no macros.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be very difficult to copy the content into another excel document as the spreadsheet contains about 90 worksheets; moreover, the document keeps crashing.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>This is my main windows xp-excel document (the other ones are very small documents which I don't use much), so I don't know yet whether it would crash on other windows xp- excel or new excel documents.</p>

    <title>Slow wake up on Lumia 950 XL - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vitch_00  say:</h3>
<h2>            Slow wake up on Lumia 950 XL</h2>
                    <p>Hi. Three weeks ago I bought a brand new Lumia 950 XL because of its interesting features. Little did&nbsp;I imagine that I was going&nbsp;to face "slow wake up and brightness" issue less than 1 month of using the phone. There are even moments when the phone rings
 with no brightness which prevents me from picking up the calls because the phone screen remains completely dark.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a topic that has already been raised a number of times in this forum. I just want to know whether there is any best solution to help fix this issue once and for all? It seems what have been shared so far as possible solutions&nbsp;are not giving full
 satisfaction.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any Microsoft or Windows Phone guru on this forum who can help with a clear answer? I am already thinking of leaving the Windows Phones World forever because of the persistent issue described above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

    <title>Nokia 5140 Xpress-on GPS Shell CC-70D Bugs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pverralls  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia 5140 Xpress-on GPS Shell CC-70D Bugs</h2>
                    I live on a Caribbean Island and purchased the phone and GPS on my last visit to the UK. For here the phone is excellent, survives the humidity, the salt air environment, the rain and the boat rides. The GPS is excellent for marking fishing spots, gaps
 in the reef, coral heads and for following tracks at night. My phones here usually last 10 weeks, the 5100 lasted over a year, until I fell into the sea with it. I replaced it with the 5140i and am equally pleased with it.<br />
But the GPS shell has some bugs. It often takes 14 minutes or so to find where it is, even though it has not moved since the day before, my Magellan GPS320 remembers or locates instantly. My Magellen will report on satellites even when under cover, the Nokia
 needs a clear sky. The Nokia often hangs when loading the GPS application, just before the "don't depend on this" screen. Has to be switched off. It often tells me "GPS shell is not connected please reconnect and retry", have to switch off. It is impossible
 to edit a waypoint without my westerly longtitude defaulting to E and impossible to change it. Have to delete the waypoint and re-enter. So editing actually destroys the waypoint, puts me 10,000 miles away!<br />
So frustrating for such a neat product. Any solutions?

            HELLO.<br />
<br />
I TOTALLY SHARE YOUR PROBLEM.<br />
<br />
I think that Nokia's GPS shell is really totally failed product. I never could believe that Nokia would deliver such a miserable product. Phone itself works fine, although the levelling eye must be glued by yourself, it loosens itself.... So I'm not expecting
 any 100% quality product, it would be enough to get it work.<br />
<br />
Anyway GPS is extremely slow. It might then finally get 2-3 points in memory but immediately when it loses it's contact to satellites the software crashes and I have to shutdown phone from ON/OFF and so are also the points in memory disappeared. Contact to
 satellites can be maintained only if the sky is really open (maybe it has been palnned to work only if user can see the satellite..)<br />
<br />
REALLY FRUSTRATING. NOKIA SHOULD SHAME TO DELIVER SUCH MISERABLE ADD-ON.

    <title>Instantaneous pace &#40;inconsistent&#41; while running - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marcus974  say:</h3>
<h2>            Instantaneous pace &#40;inconsistent&#41; while running</h2>
                    <p>I've found that in the Running Tile the Instantaneous Pace is very variable and therefore completely useless to monitor the pace.</p>
<p>For instance, while running quite&nbsp;constantly, the Instantaneous Pace is&nbsp;changing suddenly from 4:45/km to 5:50/km than again 5:10/km or even 6:10/km etc. all in few seconds. It is simply impossible such fast change in pace.</p>
<p>In this way it is impossible to have an idea about the pace. The GPS seems to work properly since on the distance or the average pace&nbsp;it is precise and constant. It is like that the sampling of the instantaneous pace is too 'fast', therefore maybe too sensibile.</p>
<p>Another GPS sport tracker that I own is much more reliable regarding the instantaneous pace without such erratic measures.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I just had the same experience today with a <strong>brand new</strong> Band 2 (received as a warranty replacement). I had freshly set it up with the latest firmware update. Therefore there was no issue with cleaning the sensors or updating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While jogging at a steady pace of 8:25 min/mile, I saw the Instantaneous Pace jump around all over the place. e.g. it showed 7:27 one moment, then 9:12 just 10 seconds later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone on this forum answer:<br />
<strong>Is there even&nbsp;one user who has found the Instantaneous Pace feature to work?</strong></p>

<p>Hello Spencer,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The data usage will only consume if you access the internet but for just simply saving/ syncing the file to OneDrive will not greatly impact your data usage (Depends on the file size) as it only save the changes you just made to the file. You can try by
 turning off all apps and background applications and make changes to your Excel file then save to OneDrive and check your data usage.

<h2>            How to keep track and manage documents that were shared with me&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I work for a large company and I&nbsp;get access to a lot&nbsp;of shared documents, including Word online, Excell online, OneDrive files and folders, SharePoint sites etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is the "Shared with me" screen in SharePoint (Or is it OneDrive? I don't understand the difference.), but there is no way to manage the documents, tag them or keep them in groups/folders/labels by the project they belong to. It is just a large list
 of everything that was ever shared with me, which is not useful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How am I supposed to keep track and manage which file belongs to which project?</p>
<p><br />

<p>Hi Daniel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot for posting in our forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You brought a bright point. It would be convenient if we are able to manage the files in Shared with me section. Since it is limited currently, you may consider suggesting the original user(who shared the files) save the files in a folder and share that
 folder with you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, we would like to invite you vote for this feature request in our UserVoice forum via the following link. If there are a lot of votes, the product group may pay more attention to it.</p>
<p><a href="https://onedrive.uservoice.com/forums/913531-onedrive-sharing-collaboration/suggestions/9156178-allow-shared-folders-to-be-stored-within-sub-folde" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Allow shared folders to be stored within sub folders</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Your understanding is highly appreciated.</p>
<p>

<h2>            How to block specific numbers on skype&#63;</h2>
                    Block does not work. I still get repeated calls from this number.<br />
No, I won't just block calls from all callers not in my contact list, as then new people could never reach me.<br />
I just want to block the offending caller. Reporting the abusive calling has had no effect either.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to clear / delete the file and get your 600 MB back you need to hard reset your phone</p>
<p>and I'm very sorry for the inconvenience.</p>
<p>You can do this by going into the Settings&gt;About&gt;Reset the Phone.</p>

<h2>            Change Flag Status in Outlook 2010</h2>
                    In Oulook 2010 the manual states that you can change the Flag status. However on my computer when I right click over the flag the only option I get is to<strong> Flag Message</strong> or
<strong>Clear Flag</strong>. I don't get any other options in any of the places where you can do to flag messages. I gather there should be several pink shaded options plus the option to
<strong>Mark as complete.</strong>
