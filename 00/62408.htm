<h2>            Pen won&#39;t open OneNote in Surface Pro 3 Windows 10 version</h2>
                    Windows 10 was preinstalled on my Surface Pro 3 and all updates have been applied,.&nbsp; I have Office 365 installed as well as OneNote app.&nbsp; The only problem that I am having with my pen is that it won't open OneNote. I tried the normally troubleshooting
 and read the forum for related postings... which were from 2014 and related to windows 8.1.&nbsp; Is it possible that I've overlooked a setting?

            <p>It seems to be a bug with Windows 10 affecting all units. We all have to wait patiently for Microsoft to issue a fix. (Or, come up with a solution hack&nbsp;ourselves.)</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Followup:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I seem to have stumbled across the "hack" procedure that gets it working.<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Open Bluetooth under "System -&gt; Devices"</li><li>Unpair the Surface Pen bluetooth device</li><li>Press "Win+X", open "Device Manager"</li><li>Navigate to "Human interface devices -&gt; <strong>Surface Pen</strong>" and "<strong>Surface Pen settings</strong>"</li><li>Right click both (or whatever remains) and click "Uninstall"</li><li><strong>Do </strong><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">not</span> tick remove drivers</strong><strong>.</strong> (This is to save headache later.)</li><li>If prompted to Reboot, click "No".<br />
<br />
<br />
</li><li>Go into "System -&gt; Devices -&gt; Bluetooth" again</li><li>Click and hold the Surface Pen button for 10s (until the green LED lights up solid)</li><li>Re-pair under Bluetooth</li><li>("Surface Pen" and "Surface Pen Settings" should reappear in Device Manager)</li><li>If prompted to Reboot, click "Yes".</li></ul>
<p>Your pen should now be working. Remember to re-set any curve sensitivity settings in the "Surface" Metro Windows store app.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Audio Service Can&#39;t Be Started - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cmiller85  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Audio Service Can&#39;t Be Started</h2>
                    <p>Suddenly my audio icon on the taskbar is marked with a red circle with an x in it and no audio plays. If I click on it, the troubleshooter starts and fails unable to fix the problem. Here is what I have tried so far:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Opened the Services program and tried manually starting Windows Audio - I receive an Error 126: The specified module could not be found</li><li>Restarted the Windows Audio Endpoint Builder and then tried to start Windows Audio again and received the same error</li><li>Went into Device Manager and tried to update the audio drivers for HD Audio. No difference</li><li>Booted in Safe Mode and the same issues persist.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>This is a custom built PC that has seen no issues with audio for the past 6 years. The only hardware changes have been a couple graphics card upgrades and the last was probably ~6 months ago. No driver updates have been installed recently that would account
 for the sudden change in status of my audio hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Relevant Hardware:</p>
<ul>
<li>ASRock X58 Extreme3 Motherboard</li><li>Intel i7-930</li><li>ASUS Radeon RX470</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions on how to solve this problem would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            Go to search and type audio troubleshooter.
<br />What is the error if any it is giving?
<br />
<br />This maybe an issue with a system file being corrupt.
<br />You can try a couple things.
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />In Command prompt type sfc /scannow and press enter.
<br />Restart the computer.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work then try this, 
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />
<br />In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. 
<br />Press Enter key after each command:
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />
<br />Important: When you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that are required to fix corruptions.
<br />To close the Administrator: Command prompt window, type Exit, and then press Enter. 
<br />Restart your computer.

<h3> vmamafrika  say:</h3>
<h2>            My product key &#34;is for upgrade only&#34; so now I can&#39;t activate Windows 8 after spending &#36;70</h2>
                    Two or so weeks ago I upgraded to Win8 from Win7. (PS my laptop isn't originally mine so I don't have the Win7 disc). Last Sunday Windows failed to update and crashed my system. After trying in vain to get help from Microsoft (and racking up quite the
 phone bill) I changed my hard disc and freshly reinstalled Windows 8. Finally I was back in business ... only that now my product key won't work. It's a valid key all right, but after many hours (and another huge addition to my phone bill) I am told that my
 disc is "for upgrade only" and cannot be used for a clean reinstall. What?! 1. What if someone doesn't have a disc with another OS, as is the case with me? 2. Why was I not told this when "upgrading"? 3. What if someone has hardware problems and is forced
 to reinstall their OS as was the case with me? Is the "backup disc" I was sent not supposed to work? What is the purpose of the "backup disc" then? 4. Do I have to spend more money even though I haven't yet got the service I was lookin

            you could try this fix from another thread:
<div><br />
<div>
<p>A brilliant, wonderful human being named BinaryInk posted the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The work around for this, while probably not officially supported for obvious reasons (they want more money), is to change a registry key. This was posted for Windows 7 update keys doing the same thing on a forum (though I had an update
 version AND did a clean install MULTIPLE times without having to do this) but worked without an issue on my laptop running Windows 8 regardless.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
1. Run the registry editor (regedit)&nbsp;<br />
2. Find the following key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Setup\OOBE&nbsp;<br />
3. Change the value for 'MediaBootInstall' from 1 to 0&nbsp;<br />
4. Open an elevated command prompt (run as admin)&nbsp;<br />
5. Run the following command: slmgr -rearm&nbsp;<br />
6. Reboot<br />
<br />
If you already entered your key, check the activation: for me it was already activated and I needed to do nothing more. If not, type in activate windows and type in the key; it should work. Also, do yourself a favor and export this key from regedit and save
 it somewhere if you ever are required to do another clean install. I know I did."</p>

            Hi tinatori,<br />
<br />
Your first step would be, to temporarily disable all security softwares.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note :</strong> After Installing the updates successfully, enable all security software.<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 2 :</strong> <br />
<br />
Reset Windows Update components and then try installing the update KB979202<br />
<br />
To reset Windows Update components visit the below link and click on Fix it button/follow the troubleshooting steps do it manually.<br />

                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just&nbsp;a heads-up. if you have purchased the Microsoft complete warranty i would definitely check the Microsoft website for your warranty status.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have received a replacement device for my surface book and just spent 40 minutes with technical support to get them to update the warranty with the "complete".&nbsp; They lady was very nice but it did take 40 minutes and it still isn't complete. You would think
 when they send you a replacement device that they would automatically move the complete warranty from the old device to the new device.</p>

            I agree, check it... Because I bought mine for my Surface Pro 3 back in April this year, and it never got added on. Took 2 weeks to get that straightened out.&nbsp;

            <p>So I bought a brand new Surface Book yesterday and went online to buy the Complete Care warranty as it seemed like the best option for covering the Surface from accidental damage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was told (after much confusion from the call centre staff and speaking to a manager) that I could not buy the warranty and that the only way I would be able to purchase it would be to go to the Microsoft store (the nearest store being a 5 hour drive and

<p>
</p><p>I offered to send pictures of the day old device and give them remote access to the system but they refused. So now I am left unable to buy the warranty and seemingly my only options are to return it and buy a new device from Microsoft or to travel at great

            I was also surprised to find this out. I bought mine from Best Buy. I had bought my Complete Care last year over the phone about 1 month after I bought my Surface Pro 3 from Best Buy. Now, I have to drive 70 miles to my nearest Microsoft Store to get Complete
 Care... Bogus.

<p>
</p><p>Exactly!&nbsp; Just as with Apple, I would never, under any circumstances, buy from anyone other than directly from Microsoft.&nbsp; And I much prefer buying from my&nbsp;Atlanta Microsoft Store even if it is a 100 mile trip for me.&nbsp;The treatment I get from my Atlanta
 Microsoft Store is second to none!&nbsp; And of course&nbsp;I always add the Microsoft Complete warranty at the time I buy. &nbsp;I always unbox and set up my new computer at a desk in the back of the Microsoft Store.&nbsp; If I have any questions I have tech support right there!&nbsp;
 And if I have any hardware problems whatsoever I don't have to go far to exchange it!</p>

            <p>I should add that when you buy the Microsoft Complete warranty you get a warranty package that makes your trip to the store a little more worthwhile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Microsoft Complete warranty package included:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; A paid year of Microsoft Office 365. (since I already had Office 365 my subscription was extended a year!)</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; A really nice Brenthaven carrying case for my Surface Book.&nbsp; Excellent quality case!</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; A Microsoft Surface logo T Shirt.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; A Microsoft Surface logo 8GB Thumb Drive.</p>

            That sounds like a pretty nice bonus pack actually. Unfortunate that Microsoft expects me to incur around $300 of expenses to travel to their only store in my province.

            But theoretically speaking, Microsoft needs to check our SB before giving the complete coverage... this should be a fair policy. The only problem is that they have to involve their "partners" to reduce the "Cost" of customers.&nbsp;

            <p>Don't worry about the warranty.</p>
<p>I did the same thing and was told I would have to return my SB and reorder to add the protection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After reading the fine print in the protection plan I see that there is a deductible and it is limited to 2 claims during the life of the plan. &nbsp;So I was happy I did not add it to my order.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I opted for Square Trade protection. &nbsp;It covers the device for 3 years and is not limited by the number of claims and the deductible is lower. &nbsp;If you buy the plan on Amazon, the cost for 3 years is only slightly higher than the 2 year plan from MSFT. &nbsp;I
 did not check but you should also be able to get a lower cost plan for a 2 year plan from Square Trade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, if you decide to return the SB (like I did) Square Trade will refund the entire purchase price within the first 30 days and pro-rated refund after that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW I don't work or have any affiliation with Square Trade or MSFT.</p>

<p>
</p><p>But does Square Trade do this?&nbsp; With Microsoft Complete you can destroy your computer, walk in to a Microsoft Store, and walk out with a new machine.&nbsp; The deductible is only $50.&nbsp; I accidently destroyed my SP3 this past January and did just that.</p>

            <p>I assume you may be located in the United States?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I looked at square trade in Canada it was $400 for 3 years with a $75 deductible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was quoted $249 for 2 years accidental and a 3rd with basic coverage from Microsoft with $50 deductibles over the phone this morning which I would say is the better deal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there other services in Canada that do this at more comparable rates to Microsoft that you know of? I just blew the bank on the Surface Book so I'm hoping to keep warranty costs as low as possible.</p>

                    Google indicates a common cause of this problem is AVG. AVG is not installed, Mcafee is. It's a Dell Inspiron N5110 laptop, 3 GB memory, i3 dual core processor, windows 7 (SP unknown). Original problem was that it wouldn't boot, system repair did not work
 and it got stuck in a rebooting cycle. Safe mode is unaccessible, last good file to load is classpnp.sys. Has anyone seen this?

http://www.carrona.org/hddiag.html</a> (read the details at the link) - Test [b][u]<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration-line: underline">ALL</span>[/b][/u] of the hard drives.<br />
<br />
If hard drive is OK, then try Startup Repair from the installation DVD:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/681-startup-repair.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/681-startup-repair.html</a>&nbsp; Run it at least 3 times<br />
<br />
- run CHKDSK /R /F from the Startup Repair disk<br />
- run SFC.EXE /SCANNOW from the Startup Repair disk (I'm unsure about this working - but it won't hurt)<br />
- replace the DLL with a known good copy (if you know what it is).<br />
<br />
Memory dump files may reveal the name of the missing DLL.&nbsp; Please do the following:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please zip up the contents of the C:\Windows\Minidump directory</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upload it to the Public area of a SkyDrive account ( <a href="https://skydrive.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://skydrive.live.com</a> )</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Post a link here so we can download it.</li></ul>

            Hi Mike,
<div>I did the offline system integrity check last night and my issue isn't yet solved. I'm still stuck in a rebooting cycle, and the system repair isn't working yet. It's a good first step though, so thanks for the links. I will work on debugging tonight and
 keep you posted.</div>

            Thanks for uploading the memory dump.&nbsp; It's dated from 13 July 2011 - have you checked the date/time on your PC (both in Windows and in the BIOS)?<br />
<br />
Looks like this one is a STOP 0x9F and blames your <span>Intel PROSet\Wireless Bluetooth<br />
I don't think that this is the one that we're looking for.<br />
<br />
Please check your C:\Windows directory for a file named MEMORY.dmp and check the date on it.&nbsp; If it's the proper date, zip it up and upload it to your SkyDrive account.&nbsp; BEWARE!!! This'll be a very large file and will take a while to upload!<br />
<br />
If it's too big to upload to SkyDrive, then upload it to a free file-hosting service and post a link to it here.<br />
<br />
Did you run the hard drive diagnostic?&nbsp; Did the hard drive pass?<br />

            Nope, it's the same as the other July memory dump.<br />
<br />
Let's try Driver Verifier to see if we can force it to spit out a driver name.&nbsp; Please follow these instructions:<br />
From this link:&nbsp; http://www.carrona.org/verifier.html<br />
[QUOTE]<br />
Using Driver Verifier is an iffy proposition. Most times it'll crash and it'll tell you what the driver is. But sometimes it'll crash and won't tell you the driver. Other times it'll crash before you can log in to Windows. If you can't get to Safe Mode, then
 you'll have to resort to offline editing of the registry to disable Driver Verifier.<br />
<br />
So, I'd suggest that you first backup your stuff and then make sure you've got access to another computer so you can contact us if problems arise. Then make a System Restore point (so you can restore the system using the Vista/Win7 Startup Repair feature).<br />
<br />
Then, here's the procedure:<br />
- Go to Start and type in "verifier" (without the quotes) and press Enter<br />
- Select "Create custom settings (for code developers)" and click "Next"<br />
- Select "Select individual settings from a full list" and click "Next"<br />
- Select everything [b]EXCEPT FOR[/b] "Special Pool", "Force Pending I/O Requests" and "Low Resource Simulation" and click "Next"<br />
- Select "Select driver names from a list" and click "Next"<br />
Then select all drivers [b]NOT[/b] provided by Microsoft and click "Next"<br />
- Select "Finish" on the next page.<br />
<br />
Reboot the system and [b][u]wait for it to crash to the Blue Screen[/u][/b]. Continue to use your system normally, and if you know what causes the crash, do that repeatedly. The objective here is to get the system to crash because Driver Verifier is stressing
 the drivers out.&nbsp; If it doesn't crash for you, then [u]let it run for at least 36 hours of continuous operation[/u] (an estimate on my part).<br />
<br />
Reboot into Windows (after the crash) and [b][u]turn off Driver Verifier[/u][/b] by going back in and selecting "Delete existing settings" on the first page, then locate and zip up the memory dump file and upload it with your next post.<br />
<br />
If you can't get into Windows because it crashes too soon, try it in Safe Mode.<br />
If you can't get into Safe Mode, try using System Restore from your installation DVD to set the system back to the previous restore point that you created.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, post back and we'll have to see about fixing the registry entry off-line:<br />
[code]Delete these registry keys to stop Driver Verifier from loading (works in XP, Vista, Win7):<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Memory Management\VerifyDrivers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Memory Management\VerifyDriverLevel[/code]<br />
<br />

            I had to perform a partial system restore back to 18-Nov-2011. The only programs listed as being affected were Firefox and McAfee Security Center. So far the computer seems to be working better (can get to login screen, which is an improvement). I will
 attempt updates and see if it is affected again. Thanks for your help. I will update you as I learn more.

<p><br />
</p>
<p>When the power supply is attached to Surface and plugged into a working electrical outlet, the LED on the magnetic tip should light up. This shows that Surface is connected to the power supply and ready to charge. The battery icon on
 the screen will show that Surface is charging.</p>
<p><br />

            <p>Hi There,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this the only device on your network having a problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason I ask, is I wonder if there is a DHCP problem on your router.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You also want to check on if the DHCP client service is running, or started. To get to services, to go
<em>start -&gt; Run -&gt; and type in <strong>services.msc</strong></em>, or go to the <em>
control panel -&gt; administrative Tools -&gt; Services</em>, or <em>right click my computer and choose computer management and go to services</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>locate the DHCP client service and look to see if it is set to startup automatically, and if it is running.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />

 service, as well set if it starts automatically.</p>

<p>
</p><p>If your DHCP Client service is running and started, you may want to look at trying to set your IP address statically. A good guide on how to do that is here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/19249/how-to-assign-a-static-ip-address-in-xp-vista-or-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/19249/how-to-assign-a-static-ip-address-in-xp-vista-or-windows-7/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You will need to know your network address range. Usually, if your router is at 192.168.1.1 your network address is 192.168.1.2 through 192.168.1.254 or, if your router is at 192.168.0.1 then your network address range is 192.168.0.2 through 192.168.0.254</p>
<p>
</p><p>good luck and let us know how it goes!</p>

<h2>            Keep freezing -Upgraded to Windows 10 from win 7</h2>
                    <p>MY Packard Bell laptop keeps freezing after upgrading to win 10</p>
<p>It is so frustrating , this happens twice a day and I can do nothing other than to force shut it through the power button.I tried to Ctrl+Alt+del &nbsp;but it does not work, escape button does not work, nothing works.</p>
<p>Im afraid that keep force shutting down my laptop will heart my hard drive. I have lost so much work just because i did not have time to save my work, sometimes i work in a project for an hour and then the laptop freezes and i had to start all over again
 and lose the work of an hour. Now I continue to save my work every 2 minutes just because i do not want to start all over again. This is so frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I like windows 10,but this might lead to go back to windows 7, I never had this problem with win7.</p>
<p>Today it froze with the sound , it sounded like graphic card problem, not sure, but this is only today freeze diagnose, the other times no sound at all. It looks like also if I use the laptop for few hours will bring this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you please assist and find me a fix that Im not aware of.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

<h2>            Live TV app Error&#58; Unsupported video type or invalid path</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need help. I'm into live streaming especially of sports and news. I have been using the Mobdro app in Bluestacks, but that has been taxing my RAM and slowing down my system. I'm on Windows 10 and I looked for alternatives to Mobdro on the Windows App store
 and the like-for-like app is Live TV and it seems rich in the channels it offers. The only drawback I'm facing, however, is when I try to stream anything &nbsp;I get nothing and the following
<strong>Error: Unsupported video type or invalid path.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help...need to enjoy streaming this festive season.</p>

            lol good luck on that.&nbsp; I also have the same issue and have called customer service twice only to be bounced around like a ping pong ball trying to find someone to assist and claim it as an issue.&nbsp; Both times ended being transferred to a dead phone, so
 gave it up.&nbsp; Today I tried the chat again was transferred this time they just said it wasn't known if it will be fixed, duh...&nbsp; If MS doesn't extend the offer I would feel it was just a method of retraction.&nbsp; I have not seen anyone but users saying there is
 an issue.

    <title>XBox 360 Slim &#38;quot&#59;Open Tray&#38;quot&#59; System Returned as - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            XBox 360 Slim &#38;quot&#59;Open Tray&#38;quot&#59; System Returned as Tampered</h2>
                    


<p>Let me say first that I have never, nor will I ever try and tamper with my XBox, I have<span>&nbsp;
</span>several gold memberships, and prefer not to be banned as I play online many hours per week. After about 11 months of no problems, I sent in my XBox Slim when it started displaying the "Open Tray" problem. Before I did, I took several photos of the console
 to show the condition of the system and tamper stickers, as I had an issue with another company in the past. It was sent back to me the same day it arrived with the "tampered" letter. I inspected the console, and found that the tamper sticker on the back had
 been gouged (and had 2 red arrow stickers pointing to it) and the bottom of the console had been gouged. This was NOT the condition it was sent out in. I called customer support and was told that there had recently been several Slims with the same "tampered"
 issue, and that 2 of the 4 the rep had been involved in resulted in warranty repairs. He also said that they would contact me in 48 hours, which they did, and told me that the repair center disagreed with my statement, even with photographic proof that the
 console had been sent in without tampering. The rep went on to say that because it had been flagged as tampered that I could not even PAY to get the console repaired by microsoft out-of-warranty. The first supervisor that I was able to speak with confirmed
 their "will not repair" position, even after again explaining that I had taken photos before packing up the system to send. He explained that they COULD push for a repair, but that it would make the repair department feel that they were questioning their honesty
 and repair policies. Later I attempted 3 more times to speak with another supervisor regarding the matter, the first of which was "unavailable" because they were all in a meeting, the second rang and rang for 5 minutes without ever answering, and the third
 hung up as soon as the call went through to his office. All of these calls were directed through India. I finally got through to a US rep, and was again told that my system was flagged as tampered, and that they would not repair it. He suggested I speak to
 one of the hardware supervisors in India yet again, or to try and contact the retailer I purchased the unit from nearly a year ago (I tried). Now I have this wonderful $300 paperweight unless I want to pay an outside party to repair it, which I obviously don't
 feel that I should have to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, good luck to anyone else who has this issue... You'll need it!</p>

<p>There is always the possibility of sabotage between you and the repair centre, But policy is policy. Do the Photos have time stamps on them? It would help your case. It is going to be hard to get this resolved tho. E-mail them in the pics after ringing them
 again and tell them what you want to at least be givin the oppertunity to contest the flag against your Xbox.

<p><span>If I am not mistaken, there was a way, with the previous dashboard, to find Down Loaded Content (DLC) for games that I have played. For example, I could view a list of all the games I have played
 and choose Command &amp; Conquer 3 (C&amp;C3). In the C&amp;C3 submenu there was an option to check for DLC. How do I do this with the new dashboard? I chose C&amp;C3 because it is not listed in Collections &gt; All Games/Full Games/Xbox 360 Games</span>.</p>

<p>Hello&nbsp;Pieter-AlexanderAken,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community forum!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand you concern. I would be more than glad to assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To send credit from one account to another, here's how:</p>
<p>If you have more than one Skype account, you can send yourself some of your own Skype Credit from any of your accounts as a gift. You'll just need to add yourself as a contact first.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Sign into the account you want to send credit to, and then <a href="https://support.skype.com/faq/FA3281" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>Confirm Selection</strong> button.</li></ol>
<p>The Skype Credit is sent directly to your other account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per your second concern, please be informed that if you'll delete the second account it will also delete the Microsoft account associated with your email address. But if there's no Microsoft account associated with it, you can proceed with the deletion
 process. Please make sure to change the primary email address of your Skype account first for account recovery purposes. To delete your account, please refer to this link:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12412/microsoft-account-how-to-close-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">click
 here</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this information helps but if you have questions and clarifications, please do not hesitate to reply back.</p>
<p>

            <p>As mentioned in at least one of the replies in that Q&amp;A link I posted, some users delete the cache folder every time they shut down the computer. I haven't done that myself as I do not wish to lose some automatic username and password form fill-in but TBH,
 I could not absolutely state that you would lose that in any event. I simply know from reading several responses that it is harmless to delete the cache folder as far as system integrity goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know as much about Windows 7 and Defender as many of the other volunteers offering advice here so I should leave that apple on the cart for the experts manning the Windows | Security and Windows Essentials forums.</p>
