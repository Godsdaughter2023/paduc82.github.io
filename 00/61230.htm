<h2>            Windows 10 won&#39;t update</h2>
                    <p>My PC is a month old, Windows 10 64-bit is installed, current version is 1607 Build 14393.0, it hasn't been able to update at all since being installed. I've tried countless methods, Google, Youtube, even Tech support live chat and remote access, they just
 kept disconnecting me, so gave up on that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It keeps trying to install:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1607 for x64-based Systems (KB3213986).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It downloads, asks to restart, starts installing, gets stuck at 20%, restarts and fails, then says 'Undoing any changes'. It's been trying to install this update since Windows was installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tired manually installing the update, but that fails too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is appreciated</p>
<p>
</p><p />

</p>
<div>
<p>If SFC could not fix something, then run the command again to see if it may be able to the next time. Sometimes it may take running the

</p><p>Restart the PC afterwards, and try the <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> command again.<br />
<br />
If still not, then try using <strong>OPTION ONE</strong> above to run the <strong>

</p><p>There is no option to remove a participant while the group call is on-going. As a workaround, you may try removing the participant from the chat group before you&nbsp; initiate the call.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you have further questions, please do not hesitate to reply to this post.

</p><p>I purchased a Skype number 3 days back for 12 month subscription in Skype website and they charged me $54. I have a confirmation and invoice email from Skype. But when I try to use Skype to call others it is saying like I do not have credits. I tried to
 call Skype representatives at 844-782-8096 ( I got this num from Google search) I spoke with 5 representative, they are taking my details and saying that there is no Skype number or order placed in my account. After 2 calls, I started saying that I am also
 recording this call from my side and after couple of minutes they disconnected my call without saying any word. I called 5 representatives in 3 days and the result is same. And most important thing is those guys did not sound as representatives, their language
 and way of talking is different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How does this Skype number works? Being a large customer base company why this guys doing this kind of **** here? Please let me know if you guys have any thoughts here. Does anyone have similar problem here?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nag</p>
<p />

<p>For starters,<strong> Skype has no phone technical support number</strong>.&nbsp; Performing a more thorough search should inform you that the number you are dialing is<strong> a scam numbe</strong><strong>r</strong> out to steal your information and money.&nbsp;
 They have no access to your Skype account or your computer unless you provide them with that information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had a Skype number for over a decade.&nbsp; If you just set up a Skype number it may take some time to activate initially (possibly 24 hours or so).&nbsp; If you are online in Skype and people call that phone number from their mobile or landline number, your
 Skype client should ring.&nbsp; A <strong>Skype number is an inbound-only subscription.</strong>&nbsp; A Skype number by itself does include any ability to dial phone numbers for free.&nbsp; That still requires credit or a subscription.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may want to determine whether inbound call&nbsp; issues are solely related to the client version on your phone or its sleep status.&nbsp; Having a static client that is on 24x7 may prove to be more reliable for inbound calls as variables are reduced.&nbsp; You may
 want to try a desktop or the web client just to see if calls are getting through on those Skype clients.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need to get a hold of Skype Customer Service, you can do so over live chat.&nbsp; To do so, contact
<a href="https://go.skype.com/help.support.selection" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Skype Customer Service</a>&nbsp;for assistance.&nbsp; To reach that support you simply need to choose the correct topic, sub-topic and click on "Next" to get a live chat option.&nbsp; The best topic and sub-topic for this issue would probably be:&nbsp;<strong>Payments &amp; Orders</strong>

    <title>Surface book 2 GTX 1050 gpu disappearing - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface book 2 GTX 1050 gpu disappearing</h2>
                    I am aware this is a widespread issue among the SB2 community. I have tried everything I can find including detaching and booting into UEFI then installing older drivers, installing older and insider versions of windows 10, and a complete wipe of the device.
 I still am having problems with this and it is interrupting me when i'm trying to make games in Unity. Can Microsoft fix problems with thousand dollar devices before making new ones! I hope some Windows 10 engineer is reading this to get this problem fixed.
 Any help is greatly appreciated.

            Can you try downgrading the installation back to a public, supported version of Windows 10? 
<br />
<br />Windows 10 build 18932 is a Insider preview build, try downgrading back to build 18362.
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<ol>
<li>Open<strong> Device Manager</strong> using <strong>Cortana</strong>.</li><li>Under<strong> Mice and other pointing devices</strong>, right-click on Touchpad and select
<strong>Properties</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Click on the <strong>Driver</strong> tab.</li><li>Click on <strong>Driver Details</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>

<p>
</p><p>You would need to download and install the compatible touchpad driver on your device. This is best determined by the manufacturer of your laptop.

<p><span>Hi Muccj,</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>As a first step check if the
 hard disk is getting detected or listed in the Basic Input/Output system (BIOS). Also make sure to change the boot order in the CMOS setup so that
<strong><span>Hard Disk&nbsp;</span></strong>is first on the list.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>For information about how to do this, see the documentation
 that was included with your computer, or contact your computer manufacturer.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal
 oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can resolved. Modifications of
 the settings are at your own risk.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>If the manufacturer has installed
 the&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=KB;en-us;q314058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Recovery Console</span></a> on your computer, perform disk check to fix this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>At the Recovery console command line, type:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>chkdsk /r</span></p>
<p><span>When you restart your system, your computer will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct them.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> While performing chkdsk on the hard
 drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.</span></p>
<p><span>For more information, see:</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 pc won&#39;t recognize keyboard nor mouse after blackout</h2>
                    Hello everyone. I was working on my pc the other day and suddenly a power shortage happened. After the power came back I turned on my pc only to find that neither the keyboard nor the mouse worked. I tried plugging them on different&nbsp; USB ports and it doesn't
 work either, in fact every time I plug any of them a notification shows saying that&nbsp; windows failed to recognize them. I have also tried restoring which didn't work either. I tried a different keyboard on my pc and it worked perfectly and I also tried the
 devices that the pc won't recognize on my laptop and they work just fine as well, so I don't really know what the problem is.&nbsp;

            Hi Leone.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />     
<br />
<br />Using the good mouse and keyboard while the other ones are still plugged in,  Update your Chipset and USB drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page for your full model number, HP Serial Number, or Dell Service tag from the sticker on PC.
<br />
<br />  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br />
<br />Go to the Keyboard and Mouse devices in Device Manager, right click each to Uninstall.  Restart PC to see if that fixes them. 
<br />
<br /> If not go back to the USB category in Device Manager, open each Enhanced, Hub and Host controller, from Driver tab select Roll back if available, or if not choose Uninstall.  
<br />
<br />If your keyboard and mouse are USB, first program the power button to effect the needed restart after Rolling back or uninstalling the driver.  Go to Settings &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; Sleep &gt; Additional Power Settings &gt; Choose what Power buttons do to choose Shutdown. 
<br />
<br />Run the System File Checker from <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow-to-repair-windows-system-files-2626161" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow...</a>.  If the SFC cannot repair broken files in 3 attempts, check the image file integrity using DISM from Step 10 of this checklist:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Run the Hardware Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br /> You can check which Updates were installed just before this happened, then uninstall them at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History - look first for installed drivers.  Then you can hide these Updates using the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also try to System Restore to a point before this happened, then check for Updates using the Hide Updates Tool to block the Updates offered:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Unable to run 3 monitors after windows 10 install - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikekelly6  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to run 3 monitors after windows 10 install</h2>
                    <p>I have been running Windows 8.1 on my laptop for about 9 months with two extra monitors plugged in. One via HDMI and one via display port. Never once had any issues before. Everything just worked when first plugged in. I installed Windows 10 Pro yesterday
 and now only two monitors at a time will work. My intel display drivers are up to date and I have the latest nVidia drivers for the GTX 980m. Everything was a clean install and I have no conflicts or errors in device manager. All the monitors work, just only
 two at a time depending on the order i plug them in. Right now it is running the two external monitors but if I unplug one of the video cables the laptop monitor turns back on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thank You,</p>
<p>Mike&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Mike.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />See this possible fix:  <a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/fix-windows-10-doesnt-detects-second-monitor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.kapilarya.com/fix-windows-10-doesnt...</a>
<br />
<br />Then try setting up the multi-monitor display following these guides: 
<br /><a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/how-to-setup-dual-monitors-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/how-to-...</a>

<br />
<br />Check for a newer Display driver on the PC or Display adapter Support Downloads webpage.  While there check if there are other newer drivers to Update, including BIOS, Chipset, Sound, Network, USB3, Bluetooth and all others.  Compare to the one present installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu..  You can take your time until they are all updated.  
<br />
<br />There is a known issue of incorrect Display driver being pushed by Windows Update which requires rolling back the driver.  Right click Start to open Device Manager, choose Display device, then Driver tab, then Roll back.  
<br />
<br />If there is no Roll Back or that doesn't help choose Update Driver on Display device Driver tab, then Browse Computer, then Let Me Pick to see a list of all previously installed Display drivers, work backwards trying each to find one that works.  
<br />
<br />If necessary you can also go to Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update to look for the driver under Installed Updates and Uninstall it form link there.   Then you can hide the driver so it isn't pushed again using the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />If none of those work try to System Restore to a point before the problem began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>.  Make sure System Restore is always enabled for C with plenty of disk space apportioned (5-10%) in its Configuration settings.

<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Windows 10 Home Activation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> syphious  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Home Activation</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I need help activating my Windows 10, Live chat was horrible and I have had better customer support from Sprint! Freaking Sprint! Come on now my god.... The tech lady had a major attitude, I couldn't understand half of what she was saying and she got
 more irritable when I tried to explain things. I have a ton of patience when it comes to tech support workers but this was just totally unacceptable..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have a product key, My activation is account bound, I cant find my activation key because my activation was strictly bound to my account for Beta testing Windows 10 early on. I have recently swapped my motherboard out only to find that activating
 windows with my account isn't working now. I dont have a product key and cant find the windows installation Id either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know if now I am forced to buy a new key to activate or if there is a way to activate using my account still, I hace removed all of my devices from my account on the Microsoft website in case it created a problem having more than one device
 connected so this Pc is or should be the only system linked. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated or if someone knows how to get ahold of a live text chat support agent that would be great..

            First, There was no free Windows 10 for beta testers aka Insider builds. In order to upgrade to Windows 10, you must have an existing Windows 7 or 8 license. 
<br />If you did had a license of 7/8
<br />Activation depends on what type of license you have of Windows 7/8/10. 
<br />
<br />If Windows 7/8/10 came preinstalled with the computer, that is called an OEM license. For an OEM license, the license dies as soon as Motherboard dies. So essentially it is non-transferable. If that is the case you need to get a new license. 
<br />
<br />However, this is not same for retail licenses i.e. you purchased the license through Microsoft store. That does carry transfer rights. If that is the case, please see the below steps: 
<br />(Not applicable to you) 
<br />What you need to do is to grab the key using any Software like Showkey Plus, uninstall that key from older PC and use it on another computer. 
<br />
<br />Download Showkey Plus: 
<br />www.thewindowsclub.com/showkeyplus-product-key-finder
<br />
<br />Uninstall the key
<br /><a href="https://winaero.com/blog/how-to-deactivate-windows-10-and-change-the-product-key/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://winaero.com/blog/how-to-deactivate-wind...</a> 
<br />
<br />Use the key by Showkey Plus on the newer computer. 
<br />(Not applicable to you ends)
<br />Alternatively, there are two more options available other than this: 
<br />
<br /> 
<br />Contact Microsoft using the phone numbers below:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4051701/global-customer-service-phone-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/405170...</a>
<br />
<br />Use the Activation troubleshooter on the new PC signed in with same MS account. 
<br />Go to Settings&gt;Update and security&gt;Activation and run the troubleshooter. 
<br />Select I recently changed hardware on this device.
<br />Please let us know if you need any assistance.

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If Windows came pre-installed on the PC then changing the motherboard voids the license.  Free Upgrade inherits that restriction.  This is the way it's always been with Windows.  You'll need to buy a new license:  <a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/Windows-10-Home/productID.319937100" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US...</a>
<br />
<br />If it is retail Windows you purchased separately then follow these steps for reactivating:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/windows-10-reactivating-after-hardware-change" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/...</a>
<br />
<br />There is no Product Key for free Upgrade and if you try inserting one other than the Generic version key it will mess up activation until the Generic key is restored:  <a href="http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-windows-10-rtm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-...</a>
<br />
<br />Run the Activation Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation. 
<br />
<br />You can also ask for help from MS Support to get it activated:   <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4051701/global-customer-service-phone-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/405170...</a>

            Sorry for the inconvenience you have experienced trying to reactivated.
<br />
<br />But there are some red flags here:
<br />
<br />" my activation was strictly bound to my account for Beta testing Windows 10 early on. I have recently swapped my motherboard out only to find that activating
<br />windows with my account isn't working now."
<br />
<br />Beta testing doesn't entitle you to a free upgrade to Windows 10. Having a valid, activated Windows 7 or Windows 8 license does. That was the policy Microsoft set in place a few weeks before the initial release. 
<br />
<br />You mentioned changing your motherboard. 
<br />
<br />It depends on how Windows 10 was originally configured on your computer.
<br />
<br />	If its a full retail store bought license online or offline, it is transferable to a new computer or motherboard.
<br />
<br />	If its the free upgrade from a retail store bought Windows 7 or Windows 8 license, it is transferable to a new computer or motherboard.
<br />
<br />	If its the free upgrade from a OEM preinstalled Windows 7 or Windows 8 license, it is NOT transferable to a new computer or motherboard.
<br />
<br />	Learn more about transferring your license: 
<br /><a href="http://www.groovypost.com/howto/transfer-windows-10-license-new-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.groovypost.com/howto/transfer-window...</a>
<br />
<br />I suspect your system originally came with a preinstalled OEM license for Windows 7 or Windows 8. Changing your motherboard likely has invalidated that free upgrade offer. 
<br />
<br />This means, you likely need to purchase a new full version Windows 10 Home license.
<br />
<br />If your system originally came with Windows 8, see if you can find the key - unlikely since you changed the motherboard.
<br />
<br />In Windows 10:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />
<br />Click Windows PowerShell (admin)
<br />
<br />Enter the following command:
<br />
<br />wmic path SoftwareLicensingService get OA3xOriginalProductKey
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />The product key will be revealed, copy the product key then enter it
<br />
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Activation &gt; Change the product key then enter the new product key then click Next to Activate
<br />
<br />If you are unable to activate Windows 10 after all the above and you are certain you have the correct edition installed, then please attempt chat support:
<br />
<br />Activate Your Windows 10 License via Microsoft Chat Support

<p>It might have been for testing Windows 8 then, Im not sure. But when I installed Windows 10 it had a key probably for Windows 8 that worked from testing one of the operating systems linked to my account, Ive never been able to see the key or anything, Im
 just curious if maybe its been used up now mainly is all but would be nice to have it activated without having to buy another key.. Thats all I really called MS for but that went nowhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks you guys, I get that you aren't Microsoft and have limited resources but shedding some light on the whole deal would help a ton</p>

            Did you happen to notice if the Digital License generated by the free Upgrade was ever linked to your Microsoft Account.  It will state this under Status at the top of Activation Settings page.  The idea is then that when you change hardware you sign back into the same account, if it doesn't activate after a few days online run the Activation troubleshooter there which will check in MS Activation Servers back into the history of what was used to activate your free Upgrade and either pass reactivation of the new hardware or fail it.  Normally a fail will only be for a motherboard change where the original OS key was either retail builder or factory OEM.  
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work for you then unfortunately the next step is to contact Support.  What I'd do is call Customer Service at one of these numbers because they are often more helpful:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4051701/global-customer-service-phone-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/405170...</a>.
<br />
<br />There was a lot more we could do in previous Windows but the Digital Activation has changed that.

<p>Pretty sure it was linked, I never got to see the key itself until I used a program to retrieve the code my system is trying to activate with now. And it is a new motherboard but the system never used an Oem/Factory board or windows install, It was always
 custom built.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried tech support earlier but that went nowhere real quick, Ill try tomorrow and hopefully get someone else.. Never have had issues with tech support other than getting bounced around everywhere before so its just a bit odd</p>

<h2>            HP LaserJet 3390 All-in-One Printer</h2>
                    I installed Windows7 64-bit edition. Now I seem to have lost TWAIN scan ability. Particularly it does not scan directly into Adobe Acrobat and I cannot scan to a pdf file as an option using the scan option under devices in Windows 7. HP does not seem to
 have a specific driver to resolve this issue and installing Vista software and running the printer in compatibility mode does not seem to work either.&nbsp; Does anyone have a solution?

            <p>Windows 10 has no such files. One of two things happened:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1- Your computer is hacked.</p>
<p>2- Your computer <em>was</em> hacked and your anti-malware software did not completely remove the infection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first step is to find out if you are presently hacked. You should scan your computer with 2 or 3 different malware scanners, since no scanner can detect everything. A good place to start is the
<a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">free version of Malwarebytes</a>.</p>

            <p>It may be that schoolchildluke.dll is a leftover from an earlier malware attack. In any case, it's always a good idea to use more than one malware scanner, since no one product can identify every type of malware. And the scanners are free so the only cost
 is your time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some other well-regarded scanners:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kaspersky: <a href="https://usa.kaspersky.com/free-virus-scan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Kaspersky Security Scan</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Symantec: <a href="https://security.symantec.com/nss/getnss.aspx?langid=ie&amp;venid=sym" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Norton Security Scan</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>A tip-off that a file could be part of malware is the nonsense name. What does Schoolchild Luke have to do with Windows?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If additional scanning shows that schoolchildluke.dll is not malicious, we can show you how to prevent the message you see at startup.</p>

<br />
<div>After running 4 types of anti virus like &nbsp;Malware, kasperskey, bytefence &amp; Norton I thought I had cleaned up.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>
So I removed bytefence, Norton as I thought it may be good or conflict to have so many.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>
But after doing it, &nbsp;I have started getting back the earlier pop up which is &nbsp;saying my pc is sending credit card details &nbsp;to hackers. It is asking me to call toll free number 3158-2482. within 5 minutes &nbsp;to get help to fix it.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>
When I called the person is asking me to give control of my &nbsp;pc. He also says there will be &nbsp;$99 charges which can be paid by &nbsp;debit card, credit cards. He says they are Microsoft support centre based in Philippines.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>
What is the best approach to this issue.&nbsp; Should I reinstall &nbsp;all the deleted antivirus?&nbsp; THANKS&nbsp;</div>

            <p>There are three separate issues here:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1-Multiple anti-malware applications</p>
<p>
</p><p>Broadly speaking, there are two categories of anti-malware applications. One type of anti-malware application scans your computer more or less continuously for the presence of malware. You should only have
<em>one</em> of these.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Defender is an example of an application that scans continuously. That's why Windows disables Defender when you install a third-party application that also does continuous scanning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other category performs a one-and-done scan, also known as an 'on demand' scan. Since it only scans your computer when you ask it do so, you can have more than one of these, although you should only run one scan at a time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2-Removing the message about Cool Hand Luke</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oops - I meant to say schoolchildLuke.dll. Sorry. Anti-malware applications - at least, the good ones - are not aggressive when they remove malware. They only try to remove the malicious parts of the malware. They often leave behind the harmless parts. If
 you're satisfied that your computer is no longer infected, you can remove the message yourself. Here's one way (there are other ways):</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open Task Manager [CTRL+SHIFT+ESC] and go to the Startup tab. There you'll see what else starts when Windows starts. Disable the item that gives you the message. You'll know it when you see it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3-Telephone scams</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are all over the internet. They're like junk mail and junk phone calls. The most amusing ones have a computer-generated voice reading the message to you, grammar mistakes and all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have to ignore these scams. Do <em>not</em> respond. At all. The safest thing to do is to
<em>not</em> click anywhere on the page. Instead, open Task Manager and 'end' your web browser. Your browser will close so you'll lose all your open tabs. That's a small price to pay to guard against malware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The scam you received is probably not related to Cool Hand Luke - oops, I said it again - just a coincidence.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know how important it is for you to use our service since you said that you're subscribed to a&nbsp;calling plan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly check that you have dialed the number correctly when calling. Remember to select the country from the drop-down, or enter a “+” and then the country code plus the number you want to call.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, please add a Caller ID to your account by following the steps on this link:
<strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA1248/what-is-caller-identification-and-how-do-i-set-it-up?q=caller+id" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Click here</a></strong>. The reason why we advise to set up Caller ID is because there are some network
 providers which are not allowing calls from "Unknown numbers". Your calls will be received as "Unknown number" if there is no Caller ID set on the account.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>I hope the information above helps in resolving your calling issue.</p>

            I have tried that, nothing&nbsp; works. the computer was working very well with a classic lay out; a mouth ago the image on my mail page, as well as everything else went from White with black letters to a black page background with white&nbsp; letters. The image
 when I log on has also gone.

<h2>            Super slow boot time and unrecognized HDD</h2>
                    <p><span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">So for about maybe 1 year maybe more my computer does this very random and very annoying thing where one of my HDD's does not
 show up in the bios and if I try to just boot in to windows it can take upwards of 5 minutes for it to finally bring me to login screen (I get stuck on the windows loading screen) I have my OS (Windows 10 Pro 10.0.17134) on a samsung ssd and 2 seagate 1TB
 HDD's. It is almost always the one specific HDD that stops being recognized however there has been one time where the other has stopped as well. I have tried the usual methods for fixing something like this, swapping SATA cables, SATA ports, I even re installed
 Windows and formated all drives to get it to stop doing it. I ran the hard drive health check thing from seagate on both drives both came up healthy. Generally it seems like pure chance as to whether or not the hard drive will come back and be recognized and
 I don't have to wait 5m for a boot on and SSD. I have yet to find any kind of pattern that could indicate what causes this although for some reason whenever my computer sustains some kind of "trauma" such as a power failure or one time I downloaded a software
 and clumsily gave myself a handful of virus / malware it seems to kaput out. Then finally for some reason it may come back, and I have to avoid shutting my computer down because I know when I reboot there is a likely chance i will lose my hard drive and it
 wont be recognized (and this is precisely what happened a couple days ago). I also just noticed I have a significant memory leak happening.&nbsp;</span><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1c5638b4-3bec-4c24-8154-dc7169e31c67?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1c5638b4-3bec-4c24-8154-dc7169e31c67?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>I have 8gb of ram installed, and somehow I am using 4gb of memory despite task manager displaying I am using nowhere near that amount. Could there be a link? I just reinstalled windows to try and fix the leak but it is still occuring. I truly have no clue
 what to do. Is it a windows problem, a bios problem, the fact that the drives will randomly come back and turn up healthy in tests leads me to believe it isn't the health of the drives. Even weirder is that if I unplug the Sata and power cables for the 2 HDD
 drives Windows still takes many minutes to load into despite being on an SSD I know works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p><span>Hello Kirshy,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand how difficult it feels when it takes a lot of time just to boot to the desktop. Let’s take one by one and try to resolve the issue. Kindly check with the below methods and see if it helps.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Slow boot issues</span>:</p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 1</strong>: To reduce the slow boot issue in Windows 10 we can disable fast startup option which will skip the wait time to boot up the system. To disable fast startup, follow the below steps:
</span></span></p>
<p><span>Search for <strong>Control Panel</strong> and click on it &gt; <strong>Hardware and Sound
</strong>&gt; <strong>Power Options</strong> &gt; select <strong>Choose what the power button does
</strong>which is present on the left side &gt;<strong> </strong>Click <strong>Change settings that are currently unavailable</strong> &gt; Uncheck the box
<strong>Turn on fast startup option</strong> and click on <strong>Save changes</strong>.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 2: </strong>Turn OFF <strong>Windows Subsystem for Linux (Beta)</strong>.
</span></span></p>
<p><span>This feature will not be turned ON by default, but check if it has been turned ON to turn it OFF. To do that, follow the steps: Press
<strong>Windows + R</strong> keys and type <strong>appwiz.cpl</strong> and click on
<strong>OK</strong> &gt; Select <strong>turn Windows features on or off</strong> option &gt; scroll down to the option
<strong>Windows Subsystem for Linux</strong> and check if it <strong>turned OFF</strong>.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 3</strong>: Also, you may go through the article on </span>
</span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4002019/windows-10-improve-pc-performance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Tips to improve PC performance in Windows 10</span></a><span>.

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Unrecognized HDD</span>:
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 1</strong>: Check for the status of the drive in the device manager by pressing
<strong>Windows + R</strong> key &gt; type <strong>devmgmt.msc</strong> and hit <strong>
Enter</strong> &gt; Expand <strong>Disk Drive</strong> &gt; If you are able to find the driver for the external drive &gt; then right click on the driver and select
<strong>Properties</strong> &gt; check the status of the disk.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 2</strong>: I suggest you to go through the answer provided by
<strong>Vanessa Sohtun</strong> dated <strong>January 21, 2016</strong> on </span>

<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 3</strong>: Run Chkdsk.</span></span></p>
<p><span>CHKDSK is a command we use in Command Prompt to scan, check and repair hard drives in the computers. To perform check disk, type
<strong>cmd</strong> in the search window and right click on command prompt to select
<strong>Run as administrator</strong> &gt; If <strong>User Account Control</strong> ask for permission, click
<strong>Yes</strong> to proceed &gt; In the command prompt, type <strong>chkdsk [driveletter] /f /r /x
</strong>(for e.g.: chkdsk C: /f /r /x) &gt; press Enter. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Check disk disclaimer</strong>: While performing chkdsk on the hard drive, if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive then chkdsk tries to repair that sector, if any data available on that might be lost.</span></span></p>

<p>Unfourtanatly the boot is still taking 5 - 10 minutes and the HDD still unrecognized. Generally the boot time is fast when the hard drive does get recognized so there must be a correlation. In device manager under disk drives I see my usual SSD, the seagate
 hard drive that usually shows up and then another unknown device. I tried uninstalling it and rebooting but it still comes back as unknown. If the hard drive is not detected in Bios how is it that it could appear as unknown in disk drives. Checkdisk on the
 drive that does not show up (E drive) just yields "cannot open volume for direct access" if that is indicitave of anything. As for the memory leak, could there be a correlation there?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate the help.&nbsp;</p>
