                    My personal emails keep going in to my junk box, and I am missing some important messages, as I forget to look all the time.

<p>Hello. It's odd that nobody has offered assistance in to a question that was asked a month ago. I wish I had some good news for you but unfortunately this issue has been a thorn in my side for way too many months.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will add the link to my question since a few suggestions were offered. None of the suggestions helped but there is a chance it will work for your situation.

<p>Hi SmokieT&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It really is becoming a right pain but more so because despite Microsoft knowing there is a major problem with this that has gone on for years nobody from their end seems to give a toss about our concerns. Really poor effort from a huge company. Will have
 to seriously consider ditching them as they obviously couldn't give a damn.</p>

    <title>Activation failure on 365 business premium - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnrule3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Activation failure on 365 business premium</h2>
                    <p>In early 2017 I acquired office 365, used it for the year -no issues all good!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the end of 2017 our company acquired Office 365 Business Premium, which I installed as my 2017 license expired on December 30, 2017. Since downloading and installing 365 Business Premium, my applications all continue to state that my apps are unlicensed.
 My date/time stamp is correct; I've downloaded the Activation Troubleshooter for Off 365 -which seems to indicate both my 2017 Office and my Biz Premium are both activated -which may be the problem; and I've re-installed the Off apps a second time -conditions
 remain the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts as to a way forward would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks Much!</p>
<p>John</p>

<p><span>Hi John,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From your description, I’d like you to check and try the following.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Upload a screenshot showing the Office applications installed on your computer. You can access the page via Control Panel&gt;Programs. If you have other type of Office applications installed, to get
 rid of some confusion, I suggest you use <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninstall-Office-from-a-PC-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
the easy fix tool</a> to uninstall all Office applications and then re-install the Office 365 Business Premium applications from your Office 365 Business Premium subscription.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Make sure that your subscription is active and log into the Office 365 portal&gt;Settings&gt;Office 365&gt;Subscriptions to check if you have corresponding licenses. Please also upload a screenshot of the
 page for our troubleshooting.</span></p>
<p><span>3. If your subscription and licenses are active, check and do what you haven’t tried in
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Unlicensed-Product-and-activation-errors-in-Office-0d23d3c0-c19c-4b2f-9845-5344fedc4380" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
the article</a> to see and let us know the outcome. You can change a network environment or do a test on another computer to check the result. Meanwhile, confirm whether all users in your company are experiencing the same issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Moreover, I’d like you to confirm and provide the following.</span></p>
<p><span>1. When did the issue happen? Did the issue happen before? Could you list the reproducing steps?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Upload some related screenshots of the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Upload a full screenshot of the Account page in an application such as Word. You can access the page via File&gt;Account.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Check if the issue happens in all applications.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p><span>Cliff</span></p>

<h2>            Microsoft office onenote quick launch</h2>
                    I am using ms office 2007 and I just found that Microsoft office onenote quick launch is running in background. Is it okay if I turn it off i.e. disable it from startup and in background too. So my question is if I do this it wont cause any problem in
 usage right ?

            <p>As a result of this little tool you should see a Onenote icon in the system tray of your task bar:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f7e82854-e070-47a4-b076-0489734d5ca4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f7e82854-e070-47a4-b076-0489734d5ca4" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can configure its function by right clicking. One possible feature (with one click) is creating a screenshot + inserting it in Onenote.</p>
<p>If you kill this little tool you'll kill this feature (and others).</p>
<p>But it will do no harm to your Onenote ;-)</p>

    <title>New, Reply and Forward buttons won&#39;t work in Outlook.com - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ants70  say:</h3>
<h2>            New, Reply and Forward buttons won&#39;t work in Outlook.com</h2>
                    <p>When I press the New, Reply or Forward buttons in Outlook.com, the command is processed but the page for composing the e-mail doesn't open. The white dots run across the top of the screen then they simply stop. This happens roughly every other time I want
 to write an e-mail. It occurs whether I use a button or the keyboard to issue the command. (A similar thing sometimes happens with the search function, too.)
<br />
<br />
The least inconvenient way I've found to get around this when it happens is to close the browser tab and reopen Outlook in a new tab. (Pressing the button again, no matter how many times, won't produce a different result.) Of course, once I've reopened Outlook,
 I'm still not out of the woods: there's still only a fifty-fifty chance it'll work. If it doesn't, I have to close that tab, too... and so on. Normally, I strike it lucky with three attempts.
<br />
<br />
Two things I've tried are deleting cookies and installing Microsoft Silverlight. Neither have a made a huge difference, or possibly any difference at all. Having to close and reopen tabs may not sound like much, but if you've just traipsed through pages of
 messages to get at the e-mail you want to reply to, it's a real pain. Sometimes, by the time I've opened the composition page, the impetus has gone.<br />
<br />
A shiny new interface is all very good, but if crucial buttons don't work then what's the point? I'd have hoped that Microsoft would've fixed it by now. They must surely be aware of the issue. Google searches reveal that this is a widely reported problem. Presumably,
 there's a solution.<br />
<br />
My browser is Firefox. Admittedly, my operating system is Windows XP (Service Pack 3), but I've experienced this problem on a later version of Windows, too.
<br />
<br />
Help would be much appreciated. <br />
<br />
Ant<br />

            According to Microsoft's Answer Desk, Outlook.com doesn’t support Internet Explorer 8, at least not with the new interface that’s being rolled out. I suppose I could try Google Chrome... though it may be better to wait and see if the issue's resolved with
 the new interface.

    <title>Closing MS Applications in background makes Default Beep sound - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ambitz 26  say:</h3>
<h2>            Closing MS Applications in background makes Default Beep sound</h2>
                    <p>I just switched to a Surface Pro 4 running corporate image of Windows 10 Enterprise w/Office 2016 (365). &nbsp;I have previously used many Lenovo laptops on the same corporate image. But none of them touch screens like the Surface. I use the Surface Pro 4 docking
 station with 2 monitors by mDP.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem: When clicking the "X" in the top right of any Microsoft application (Outlook,Word, PowerPoint, Excel, S4B) I receive a "Default Beep" sound and the program doesn't close. &nbsp;Instead, it just makes that program the active window. &nbsp;If I click the "X"
 again, it closes. Any other applications (MS-DOS prompt, Chrome, Windows Settings/control panel, etc) do work this way. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can replicate by opening word and excel and trying to close each that isn't the active program. &nbsp;The only way to close them is to select the program (not by clicking the X) and then clicking the X to close. Then it doesn't beep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone know what setting could be driving this "functionality"?</p>

<p>Hi Jelo - I use Office 365 current version. &nbsp;Windows 10 build 1703 latest updates. I've unplugged the monitor and have outlook/Skype open on my surface and still get the beep when i try to close one of the applications that isn't the active window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure what other troubleshooting can be done at this point. &nbsp;But it's annoying enough for me to go back to Lenovo systems instead of the Surface as I close MS applications constantly through the day (excel spreadsheets, skype main window, etc.) and every
 time it beeps and requires me to click again.</p>

 the issue by opening any outlook window, putting another application in front of it and clicking the X to close. The system beeps and the Outlook window comes to the front, I then have to click the X again to close. The beep is highly irritating and clicking
 twice is frustrating as I often have many Outlook windows to close.</p>

<p>Glad someone else is experiencing this annoyance... It's very bothersome when you dock the Surface and have multiple monitors as you are always trying to close Outlook and Skype windows that aren't active. &nbsp;I just take my headset off now so &nbsp;I don't have
 to hear the beep all day long... but I'm ready to quit using this laptop and back to Lenovo just for this reason.</p>

<h2>            Genuine emails getting redirected to junk&#47;spam</h2>
                    Hi. We recently moved our hosting to Outlook.com, but discovered after a week that a significant (30+) number of genuine emails were getting automatically moved to the junk (spam) &nbsp;folder. We can only access the spam folder via the web client, as when
 using a PC/Mac mail client (eg Outlook for Mac etc, - I am on Outlook for Mac 2011 14.3.7, but mail clients used vary) these emails don't get sent to our email clients (using POP) - which means that we have missed several important emails as we generally check
 email via the Outlook for Mac etc, not the web client.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there any way to lower the spam blocking settings? I'd rather get a certain amount of spam than miss out on real emails...</div>

<p>I understand that some legit emails lands to your Junk folder instead of your Inbox.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This happens because Outlook.com may treat the emails as Junk if the sender does not belong to your contacts list.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two things that we can do about this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check and adjust Junk filter settings by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ensuring that the sender's email address are added to your contacts list.</li><li>Check their emails that landed in the Junk folder and untag them as Junk. This brings their email address under your whitelist thus further avoiding the chance of having their emails land on your Junk folder in the future.</li><li>You may have to do this process for a few times before Outlook.com starts putting those emails to your Inbox.</li></ol>
<p>Choose IMAP protocol if your mail client supports it. This way, you can see emails even those that lands in your Junk folder through your mail client.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

I have had no problem at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Occassionally, you'll get&nbsp;a message saying that you are changing to a different office format when opening a file, but usually not.&nbsp; I always click the "yes" box when I get a message like that, but I think that is mainly when taking an office document from
 2003 to 2013.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>going between 2010 and 2013 seems perfect.</p>

<p>2007 to 2013, I don't think I've noticed anything.&nbsp; Anyone else?</p>

<p>If you plug it in to a big monitor, have a bunch of apps running, and are typing on an external keyboard, you likely will notice a little lag while typing which can be frustrating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Almost never notice lag when typing on the touch cover or on screen keyboard. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have to know its limits, then you will enjoy the device more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The touch cover typos get a little better with practice, but I often use the on screen keyboard for typing short messages.</p>

<p>If you want to use your tablet for&nbsp;business and especially if want to run any legacy windows programs not supplied with the Surface RT you will be happier with the Surface Pro.&nbsp;I had the Surface RT for&nbsp;a while.&nbsp; Found it too frustrating not being able to
 run old apps, but otherwise it worked very well.&nbsp; Bought a Win 8 tablet running Atom chip (HP Envy x2).&nbsp; It is underpowered, keyboard is subject to key bounce and lag (not a problem with the Surface), but the computer runs everything okay.&nbsp; HP tell me key
 bounce occurs because the atom cpu is too slow at handling interrupts.&nbsp; So I have to disable the trackpad to improve accuracy.&nbsp; Handwriting recognition and voice recognition work very well.&nbsp; Suggest if you are a power business user stick to Intel chip, but
 battery life will be compromised.&nbsp; The HP Envy goes for 5 to 6 hours between charges.&nbsp; Try to find a PC tablet that has at least 2 USB ports (thumb drive, external input device) and HDMI, and the option to disable the touchpad while typing as this improved
 typing accuracy.&nbsp; Above all, read the reviews carefully.&nbsp; </p>

    <title>shrink text on overflow not working - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            shrink text on overflow not working</h2>
                    Just switched from office 2003 to 2010. Strange thing that I have encountered: I am not able to utilize the shrink text on overflow setting. Probable cause is most likely me...<br />
<br />
After inserting a text box and typing a few words that extends outside of the box, I changed the autofit setting to Shrink text on overflow. The text does not shrink. I continue to add text and still nothing happens. I drag the corner of the box to change the
 size and still nothing happens. I go back to the shape properties to verify that the autofit setting is correct, which it is. ... and so on I continue to play around.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
Long story short, sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. Is it possible that even though I am an experienced user of the program, I really just don't know how to implement the setting properly?
<br />
<br />
Please explain how to properly implement the shrink text on overflow setting.<br />
<br />
Thank you<br />

            As Echo says it's the way you add em!<br />
<br />
When you select ADD TEXTBOX and just click on the slide&nbsp; "Wrap Text" is de-selected. This means that Shrink text will not work. If you want it to, simply select this option in Format shape &gt;&gt; Textbox.
<br />
<br />
When you select "Add TextBox" and draw the box with the mouse "Wrap Text" is auto selected.<br />

 on my PC, not true as soon as I loose internet, the connection is gone and I cannot access the files.</p>

<p>For the PC, before you start to sync the files, please check if the items in the library exceed the limitations below:</p>
<ol>
<li>You can sync up to 20,000 items in an OneDrive for Business library. This includes folders and files.
</li><li>You can sync up to 5,000 items in a SharePoint Online library. This includes folders and files.
</li><li>
In any SharePoint library, you can sync files of up to 2 gigabytes (GB). </li></ol>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the detailed information, please refer to
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2933738" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Restrictions and limitations when you sync SharePoint libraries to your computer through OneDrive for Business</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the items in the library exceed the limitation, you may view the files in the library. However, the library couldn't be synced. Please dispatch the files to different libraries as a workaround and

<h2>            Use of a canvas in Word.</h2>
                    <p style="margin-left: 13.5pt">I have extensively used the draw features of Word 2003 for over 10 years to create many complex mechanical, electrical and other drawings.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have never used a canvas, or even explored its use.<span>&nbsp; </span>I noticed from time to time in this forum that some have problems with using a canvas. My question is: what is the purpose (and advantage, if any) for using a canvas?</p>

<p>Honestly, I seldom use the drawing canvas. In fact I have the option turned off in Word's options. The only time I use it is when I need connector lines, in an organizational chart for instance. Connector lines do not seem to work outside of the canvas.</p>

            <p>Other than the connector lines that Luc mentioned, moving the canvas also moves all the contained shapes as if they had been grouped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The canvas in Word 2007 and better has bugs in the programming so that one of its tags (&lt;mc:fallback&gt;) is sometimes not closed correctly by Word. It's the second most common cause of document corruption (number 1 is editing a Word document while it's on
 a Flash/USB drive).</p>

<h2>            No longer seeing my contacts &#34;auto fill&#47;pop up&#34;</h2>
                    <p>About a month ago, my Outlook stopped seeing my Mac Contacts.&nbsp; So, if i enter a contact on my Mac, (like an email address) and then immediately attempt to send an email to someone, it doesn't see my Mac contacts anymore.&nbsp; It used to work just fine!</p>
<p>
</p><p>AND:&nbsp; the only reason i use Mac Contacts is because Outlook's contacts doesn't sync with my phone.&nbsp; What is happening?&nbsp; Is Outlook better on the PC platform?&nbsp; We have switched to MAC at work, so we need to find MAC solutions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you!</p>

<p>Hello Tower17,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your post in the forum. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that the issue is that the autocomplete is not working in the Outlook for Mac client. If you are using the Contacts application in the Mac, it is an expected behavior that it will auto fill when typing in the To field. Please create new contacts
 in the Outlook so that the autocomplete will work. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I misunderstand you or you still have any concerns, please contact the <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_outlook-mso_mac/new-contact-support-feature-in-outlook-2016-for/d4fc21c4-25e2-4e10-b943-1fba6542b517">

                    <p>(Back Story, I work on the Compliance/Email Deliverability team at an ESP)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently we have noticed some of our IP's being blocked, with that said this is for our shared pool of customers who follow best pratices and average over 20% open rates at minimum and other qualify factors. Below is the block reason with redacted information
 for obvious reasons. </p>
<p>
</p><p>550 5.7.606 Access denied, banned sending IP [REDACTED]. To request removal from this list please visit https://sender.office.com/ and follow the directions. For more information please go to http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=526655 (AS16012609) [REDACTED]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to find out who is the root cause of this issue? We closely monitor SDNS and haven't noticed any issues and the spam complaint for this pool is still around the same lower than .01%.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Now I do delist this IP, but it's relisted about an hour later, so I don't know if this is truly working or functioning as intended.

<p>Hello JustAnotherESP,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for posting here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>From your description, may I know if the users do not the Office 365 for Business accounts and when they send the messages to an Office 365 tenant, their IP are blocked by the EOP?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If
</span><span>not, which means these users are also the Office 365 for Business users.
</span><span>In </span><span>this situation, the admin can go to Exchange Admin Center &gt; action center to delist the blocks.
</span><span>For </span><span>detailed information please see:
</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms.exch.eac.actioncenter(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms.exch.eac.actioncenter(v=exchg.150).aspx</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If so, which means they are not the Office 365 for Business user. In this situation, please involve the admin of the recipients' side here for further help.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey Rudy, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for gettting back to me. The servers we send from are not Outlook 365, but the end-receiptent is. It doesn't seem like its being blocked on a IT/Admin level but on an Outlook 365 level with the IP being banned. Anyway I can PM you and talk further
 with more insight, dont want to put public information on here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I can access other features like calendars, OneDrive, etc. I tried to report the problem through the link "report it to Microsoft" but the status is still "Normally" for the Outlook.com Service Status page (after an hour)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I asked someone to login into another outlook account through this computer and the user can access the email page. I have tried access on other PC and tablet and different browser and get the same error. It won't sync with outlook 2016 either.</p>

</p><p>Thanks Jenicel, I don't have bit defender installed and only have the windows firewall which setting haven't changed. Just to restate this is a problem exists not only on PC but on Ipad, MS Surface, Android phone and on my laptop and work PC. I have tried
 it on different networks and always the same message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fault is with the outlook mail server as the email clients (outlook 2016), windows 10 mail client and android phone have all stopped being able to sync with outlook.com at the same time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyway to work around this fault?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is Outlook Web Access as well as all sync clients. It isn't a problem with an Office Application. See earlier post that it happens on all platforms and from various locations. The fault is with the outlook.com mail server and not with software
 on my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a problem for Microsoft's engineers and I guess might take some time to resolve.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>
<p><br />
Dave</p>

<h2>            Moving grouped objects crashes program.</h2>
                    If I try to move grouped objects in Powerpoint 2007I get the "Program has to close" error message and it closes the program. &nbsp;I have a rectangular shape, sent to back, with three other shapes in the group. &nbsp;I am using PP2007 on an XP OS. &nbsp;Anyone encountered
 this before? &nbsp;Regards, Davie.

            Is there any chance that one of the shapes involved is a chart? &nbsp;There were some nasty crashing issues involving charts/moving them around. &nbsp;This was fixed in a later service pack. &nbsp;
<div>On general principles, if you haven't updated to Service Pack 3 for Office 2007, I'd do that, then re-test to see if the same problem recurs.</div>

<p>Hi Ronald,</p>
<p>From your description, it seems that the recurring calendar events has been synced to your Outlook for Mac 2016. If the situation is misunderstood, please correct me and provide more details for your situation; if it is the case, try deleting the events
 in <a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook Web App (OWA)</a> light version. Note: While deleting the calendar events, keep your Macbook Agenda closed.</p>
<p>You can refer to the following steps to sign in to OWA light version:<br />
1.&nbsp;Login to your OWA (<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa/)." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">outlook.office365.com/.../).</a><br />
2.&nbsp;Click Settings (gear icon) in the upper right corner and select Options.<br />
3.&nbsp;On the new page, expand General in the left navigation and click Light version.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Alan</p>

<p>Hi Ronald,</p>
<p>It is not feasible to remove all items at once. However, based on my experience, there might be some tool (such as, MFC MAPI) can achieve that. For more information, please refer to

<br />
<br />Only Mobile number or Skype number can be used to set up caller ID. Landline can not be used.

            <p>So sometimes it is difficult to diagnose an issue without holding the device in my hands.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you install an app on SD, it still installs something (very little) in main memory. Possibly you have too much on your device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I would do is try to free up as much memory on your device as you can. Then try to install one app on the SD card and see if it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other option is to hard reset and set it up again by installing as many apps on the SD card as you can. Apps like Facebook I would install in main memory</p>

                    We were trying to insert a picture as part of our email signature. Once it was placed we discovered it could not be resized. Is there a workaround for this "feature" or do we have to play graphical 21 questions?

            It has been my experience to create and edit your email signature in Word or PowerPoint and then copy and paste it into Outlook. You can also review the article linked below for more information.

            You can't. DL's have always had this bug. You use _Remove_ to remove a member from a DL, not Delete. Delete deletes the entire DL, and they often don't get caught by the Deleted Items folder. It's a reason a lot of us stopped using DL's a long time ago.

<h2>            Weird static noise when phone rings</h2>
                    
<p>It's pretty damn weird. I don't think it's a speaker problem, because when I play it normally, I hear no breaks in the audio. But, when played as a ringtone (ONLY when the phone rings), there are strange static zzz noises as if the volume is too high or
 something--however, this can't be the case as it plays fine even on highest level. There are only a couple songs that do this that I know of. Anyone have any idea what the issue is??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh, and lowering volume doesn't seem to help on those songs at all. I still hear the breaks when it rings. I'm starting to wonder if it's those songs themselves, or on every ringtone. It was not like this on on the other ringtone previous to the one I've
 changed it to. It's just a select few, it seems. I have no idea what happened.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition: I use swappolube, and it's slightly overclocked to 850mhz. But that's all there is there is that I can think of.</p>

            sounds like a frequency is distorting your sound.<br />
<br />
i would try a different ringtone and see if it is the same.<br />
<br />
<br />
since you do not have that issue with other music or videos, the frequency that the ringtone is emitting could verywell be a soft spot on the device speakers.<br />
<br />
try that and report back.<br />
<br />
if this is a solution, please mark as so, and offer kudos.<br />
<br />

<p>So if a frequency is distorting it, why does it only happen when the phone rings and not when I play it through speakers normally? What difference does it make? Basically, what I'm saying is: The MP3 file that's being played is ONLY having an issue when
 someone CALLS me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It doesn't do that with some of the other songs I have on here. I just don't understand; it's logical that it would do this *regardless* of whether or not I'm getting a call.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And yeah, it doesn't do that with all music. Just some of the MP3s. And unfortunately they just happen to be my favourite to use, but I can't because it sounds awful. Thanks for the help so far though. Maybe there's a way around this... Has something to
 do with how it's played when it receives a phone call maybe?</p>

            have you tried to change the ringtone, and then have it ring, then try to change it back to the ringtone you want to see if maybe it was just an issue that way?<br />
<br />
it doesnt make much sense otherwise that you can play the same file full blast and it plays fine, then when it rings, distorts.<br />

            Yep, tried that, it doesn't do anything...<br />
<br />
It doesn't actually matter if it's full blast or not, there are ripples in the sound. I think something is really, wrong with the phone or the way it perceives the file or something.<br />
<br />
I first noticed this a few months ago, and just ignored it and figured... what the hell. Not really important. I tried at half volume, and weird breakage in the audio.<br />
<br />
Like you said, it doesn't make sense. And I don't understand why it's like that, either.<br />
<br />
*sigh* I guess all I can do is kudos you for the help, regardless of solving this.

            thanks.<br />
<br />
sorry there is no direct fix for this.<br />
<br />
most likely is a challenge in the algorythm taking the file and making it work when the phone rings.<br />
<br />
i know that while i do not get distortion, my phone sometimes rings warply. :/<br />
<br />
still a great unit. maybe try to get used to another ringtone.<br />
<br />
<br />
or, actually, why not try to convert it to another format that the phone can use?<br />
<br />
what format is the ringtone in?<br />

            is your phone upto date?<br />
this sounds like an old bug that's been ironed out..<br />
<br />
its possible that the interference is down to damaged/degreded speakers and the incoming signal is causing it, kinda like it does with older stereo systems

            @Cero<br />
It's a good phone, true. The file is MP3. These songs, are also korean. Maybe it has to do with how they're encoded.<br />
<br />
@Matthew<br />
I've had the phone for a few months (okay, not a few, about 8-9 to be exact. It's upgraded to PR 1.2.<br />
<br />
@Both<br />
The songs are korean, if that makes any difference. The encoding might be something that might affect it.<br />
Now, it can't be due to damaged or degraded speakers. Because as mentioned before, the speakers function fine and it only happens when an incoming phone call causes the file to play. I have not had any problems with other songs except for, like 3 out of 40
 so far that I've got here. It also doesn't matter if I lower the volume of the ringtone down to minimal levels. There's still a soft "ZZZ" rip in the audio, which is directly proportional to the volume of that ringtone. I've got other korean songs, but they
 don't do this--not even at highest volume.<br />
<br />
So it doesn't make much sense, to say they're damaged or degraded.

            what is the bit rate of the mp3 you are using?<br />
<br />
if it is above 128kbs, it may be an issue.<br />
<br />
let me know. that should be an easy conversion if it is too high at like 192kbs.

<p>*Are you mistaken or still you are in PR 1.2 ? I think better to update it to PR 1.3. Use Nokia Software Updater.</p>

<p>***Bitrate is a good point. It affects. Dont know how to explain it.</p>
<p>Anyway do you have any "MP3" converters? Convert your MP3 to 128kbps using that. Internet downloaded MP3s sometimes dont co-operate&nbsp;normally with mobile devices. So you have to convert it.</p>

            <p>Hi mjmp,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&nbsp; would suggest to visit the website below&nbsp;regarding shorcut keys in Outlook.</p>

Thanks! </span></p>

            <p>Hi Raymond,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Been there, seen that. It says Ctrl+Shitf+V - which is in fact obsolete. If you press the '?' key in the Outlook.com interface you get help on all the shortcuts. Including 'V' to move a message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Press 'V' when a message is selected - a list of folders appears. Great!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next: How do I choose a folder on that list&nbsp; - to move my message into? Which keys on my keyboard do I press to select a folder from that list? Because none of those which I've tried have worked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
        </p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've simulated your issue and you need to click the <strong>Tab</strong> key to choose&nbsp;your&nbsp;preferred&nbsp;folder on that list after pressing "V".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have any issues, please let us know and we're here to help you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
        </p>

            <p>Thank you!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For whatever inexplicable reason it obviously did&nbsp;not occur to me to try the Tab key. I feel silly now for even asking this question...
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Either way you've made another Outlook user a happy person!</p>
