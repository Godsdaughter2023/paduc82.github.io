    <title>&#34;Failure configuring Windows updates&#34; issue - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            &#34;Failure configuring Windows updates&#34; issue</h2>
                    <p>I recently returned my Asus S56C laptop to factory settings. I am using the&nbsp;Windows 8 it came with. I ran the Windows Update. It had about 117 updates right after restoring my laptop to factory settings. I restarted my laptop to complete installing the updates.
 Now it is stuck on a blue screen that reads:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Failure configuring Windows updates</p>
<p>Reverting changes</p>
<p>Do not turn off your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It stayed on that screen overnight (about 8 hours).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried turning off and on my computer using the power button. It would return to the blue screen.</p>
<p>I also tried unplugging the power cord and battery. That put me back to the Asus loading screen. But, it returned back to the blue screen after the Asus loading screen. I also tried entering safe mode from the startup screen, but that did not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the blue screen, only the mouse is responsive. I cannot access any of the menus or programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to fix/restore my laptop? I do not mind losing any files in it. Also, before restarting my computer for the updates, I had an updated version of AVG free software as my anti-virus.</p>

            <p><strong>IMPORTANT! =&gt; Support for Windows 8 ended on Tuesday, 12 January 2016.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Your Windows 8&nbsp;computer should NOT be connected to the internet or any local networks for extended periods (i.e., more than a minute or two) in its current state. All business &amp; personal data (including online banking &amp; credit-card passwords) should
 be considered at-risk, if not already compromised.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Assuming Win8 64-bit...</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please answer <em>each of the following </em>[admittedly tedious]<em> diagnostic questions</em> in a correspondingly-numbered list in your very next reply, preferably
<em>without</em> quoting this post: </p>
<p>
</p><p>1a. When (approx. date) did you purchase the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1b. When (exact date) did you do the Reset ("return to factory settings")?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1c. What problems were you having that you thought the Reset might resolve?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. After you did the Reset, how long was the computer connected to the internet before you got AVG Free installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. In Windows Explorer [<strong>WinKey+E</strong>], navigate to &amp; right-click on:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong>C:\Program Files\</strong><em><strong>AVG</strong> &lt;=this folder</em></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Select PROPERTIES: What's the CREATED date displayed on the resulting GENERAL tab?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [pick one] come preinstalled on the computer
<em>when you bought it?</em> (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Is&nbsp;KB3124275, KB3124001, KB3121918, KB3109560, KB3110329, KB3121461, and/or KB3121212&nbsp;listed in
<strong>Installed Updates </strong><em>(not <strong>Update History</strong></em>)<em>?</em> [1]</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. What Update Version &amp; KB number are displayed in the <em>second line of text</em> in IE10's Help | About [<strong>Alt+H+A</strong>] tab; e.g.,
<strong>Update Version: 10.0.54 (KB1231231)</strong> ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. Is <strong>Adobe Flash Player v20.0.0.272 </strong>[sic] installed? TEST HERE USING&nbsp;INTERNET EXPLORER OR EDGE
<em>ONLY!</em> =&gt; <a href="http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. Is Firefox version 45.x (or higher) and/or Google Chrome version 49.0.2623.108 (or higher) or any other alternate browser installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>9. Are you in the habit of using "Registry cleaners" (e.g., Registry Mechanic; System Mechanic; RegCure; RegClean Pro; Advanced SystemCare; Registry Booster; McAfee QuickClean;
<em><strong>AVG PC TuneUp</strong></em>; Norton Registry Cleaner; PCTools Optimiser; SpeedUpMyPC; PC Doctor; TuneUp Utilities; WinMaximizer; WinSweeper; Comodo System Cleaner; Advanced System Optimizer; CCleaner's
<em>Registry Cleaner&nbsp;</em>component)?</p>

            <p>Thank you for the help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1a. I purchased the computer on Nov. 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1b. I reset the laptop on March 24, 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1c. I was having problems with the Windows 10&nbsp;start menu after I upgraded Windows.&nbsp;I did other things to try to fix this: made new user account, reinstalled drivers, ran Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. After I the Reset,&nbsp; the computer connected to the internet before&nbsp;installing AVG Free for about 15-20 minutes. I set up the wireless network during the reset prompt screens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I cannot access Windows Explorer. The computer is stuck on the blue screen. My mouse pointer moves and that is it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp;<em>McAfee free-trial</em> [pick one] came preinstalled on the computer <em>
when&nbsp;I bought it?</em> I do not remember updating it or doing anything with it when I bought my laptop. I usually installed AVG when I got the chance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. I cannot access the Installed Updates and I cannot remember the updates. The laptop is stuck on the blue screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6.&nbsp;I cannot access&nbsp;IE10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. I do not know the version of&nbsp;Adobe Flash Player that I installed. I remember installing it since I play games on www.kongregate.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. I installed Firefox from [<em>https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/?icn=tabz</em>] and used that after resetting my computer. I installed AVG using Firefox to download it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>9.&nbsp;I do not use&nbsp;"Registry cleaners".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this information is OK. If there is any more information or clarifications I can provide, them I can try to find it. Again, thank you for the help.</p>

</p><p>2. Was the upgraded offered &amp; installed via Windows Update or did you use the Media Creation Tool to upgrade manually?</p>

</p><p>3. Had you ever&nbsp;run the <strong>McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool</strong> before you upgraded to

<p>

            <p>1. The very first time&nbsp;I upgraded to Win 10 was when it came out, summer of 2015. I remember because I had a pop-up telling me my laptop is updating it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp;I cannot remember whether it was the&nbsp;Windows Update or&nbsp; the Media Creation Tool. I remember the popup in the corner saying that the download was complete and I needed to click the popup to start the installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I never ran the McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Correct. I usually download Firefox and then install AVG. I never used the McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool before.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Close all open applications (i.e., anything with an icon on the taskbar).</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Right-click on the file you saved in Step #1 above and select <strong>Run as Administrator</strong> to run the McAfee utility. Don't TOUCH your keyboard until the run completes, then reboot again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Re-assert Internet Explorer as the default <strong>Browser</strong> in the CUSTOM (<strong>&lt;=important!</strong>) section of
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/set-program-access-computer-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

                    <p><strong><u>Original title:0x00000024 (0x0000000000190444, 0xFFFFFA80061c9530, 0xFFFFFFFF0000102, 0x0000000000000000)&nbsp;
</u></strong></p>
<p>My girlfriends computer crashed last night and when we try to restart it it gets just past the windows loading bar and then freezes with a black screen. I tried running startup repair and loading in Safe Mode to no avail. I have since used a vista disk to
 boot from and that resulted in the same freeze in that same location as booting from the hard drive. I managed to get an error report which gave me the following codes:<br />
<br />
0x00000024 (0x0000000000190444, 0xFFFFFA80061c9530, 0xFFFFFFFF0000102, 0x0000000000000000)<br />
<br />
I am reletively computer literate, have always been able to save my computers except when something hardware went wrong, but this is something that seems beyond me from my tinkering. I have been unsuccessful in finding out what exactly each of these codes meant,
 though I know they tell me what is wrong. Any help anyone could give would be appreciated as her entire college career is on the computer, including all the information she needs to complete her senior seminar this semester and graduate.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>A "Stop: 0x00000024" error message occurs when Windows Vista encounters an unrecoverable error when it tries to access an NTFS partition or a volume on the hard disk. Typically, you receive a "Stop: 0x00000024" error message during Windows Vista Setup when
 one or more of the following conditions are true: <br />
The file system or partition structure is corrupted. <br />
A driver compatibility issue exists. For example, the file system driver for an antivirus program or for other utility can cause this issue.<br />
To troubleshoot a "Stop: 0x00000024" error message when you try to upgrade to Windows Vista, use one or more of the following methods, as appropriate for your situation.</p>
<p>Caution We recommend that you perform a full backup before you implement any of the following methods.
<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: <br />
Run the CHKDSK program <br />
</strong>To run the CHKDSK (Chkdsk.exe) program, follow these steps: <br />
Use the Windows Vista DVD to start the computer in Windows Recovery (WinRE). For more information about how to start Windows Recovery, visit the following Microsoft Web site:
<br />
<a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/f768809f-ed90-415f-a83f-89b42108b3551033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/f768809f-ed90-415f-a83f-89b42108b3551033.mspx</a>
<br />
In WinRE, open a command prompt. To do this, follow these steps: <br />
a)&nbsp;On the Install Windows screen, select the appropriate Language to install, Time and currency format, and Keyboard or input method options, and then click Next.
<br />
b)&nbsp;Click Repair your computer. <br />
c)&nbsp;Click the Vista installation that you want to repair, and then click Next.</p>
<p><strong>Note </strong>Click Load Drivers only if you have to load a driver to access a hard disk.
<br />
d)&nbsp;Click Command Prompt.<br />
e)&nbsp;At the command prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER: <br />
chkdsk drive: /r<br />
Note In this command, drive is the hard disk where you want to install Windows Vista.
<br />
Disclaimer:<br />
While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost<br />
If Chkdsk.exe does not find and does not repair any errors on the hard disk where you want to install Windows, run Chkdsk.exe on any other NTFS hard disks on the computer. To verify the partitions that are configured on the computer, follow these steps:
<br />
At the command prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER: <br />
Diskpart<br />
At the DISKPART prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER: <br />
List vol<br />
Note the hard disk information that is returned. <br />
At the DISKPART prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER: <br />
exit <br />
At the command prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER: <br />
exit <br />
</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Check for driver issues<br />
Warning This workaround may make a computer or a network more vulnerable to attack by malicious users or by malicious software such as viruses. We do not recommend this workaround but are providing this information so that you can implement this workaround
 at your own discretion. Use this workaround at your own risk.</p>
<p>If you are upgrading to Windows Vista, follow these steps: <br />
a)&nbsp;Install updated disk controller drivers. <br />
b)&nbsp;Uninstall any antivirus, any antispyware, or any backup programs that monitor the file system for changes.
<br />
c)&nbsp;Try to upgrade to Windows Vista again.</p>

<h2>            my left shift, tab, and caps lock keys no longer work after an update on 3&#47;25&#47;2018</h2>
                    <p>the update is called security update for microsoft windows kb4088776</p>
<p>just to be clear the right shift works just fine but i'm not used to using the right shift so i'm not going to capitalize.</p>
<p>
</p><p>my laptop was previously a windows 7 two years ago. however, i have been updated to windows 10 and have been able to fix any issues that came with upgrading to windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the keys tab, caps lock, and left shift were all in working order just the day before on the 24th.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i did try to uninstall this update but the file explorer in control panel locks up when i try, and i do not feel like restoring my system. i have tried a few things like updating my keyboard driver, uninstalling and reinstalling my keyboard driver with no
 avail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>when testing with the on-screen keyboard and pressing caps lock, the caps key light on my keyboard would turn on, but when i had manually pressed the caps lock key it did not register. when using the on-screen keyboard i noticed it was difficult to unshift
 and the caps lock seems to stay on after i would disengage it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>none of this has happened before. </p>
<p>just to note i have tested with the on-screen keyboard before and after updating and reinstalling my keyboard driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i hope a patch or 'fix' comes out soon enough or if someone can give me a solution i could try.</p>

            Sounds like something was spilled on the keyboard.<br />
It may need to be cleaned with Electronic cleaner or may be just shaken or blown out.

</blockquote>
<p>to my knowledge nothing has ever been spilled on the keyboard, and the problem keys mentioned were all working before today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i may pop the keys off later and see if anything has gotten caught underneath.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Edit: I have just popped off the keys and there wasn't much but a bit of dust. I cleaned it up and the keys seem to be working now, but my caps lock dosn't turn off unless I press any shift key.</p>
<p>(I do not need to hold shift to turn off the caps lock, but caps won't turn off by pressing the caps key.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the suggestion. </p>
<p>I wouldn't have suspected a little dust since most of my issues seemed to have started today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>edit; now shift caps and tab are not working again i don't know what happened they were working fine for a few hours. maybe there is some strange hotkey or something that i am pressing.</p>

            Hi Daksh, <br />
Thank you for replying.
<div>Sorry to know that methods suggested earlier did not help.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Did you try connecting the mouse to another computer and check if it works?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Here are a few more methods which you can follow to resolve the issue:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
Try booting the computer in safe mode and check if the same issue occurs.<br />
Refer to the link:<br />
Start your computer in safe mode<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
Try performing clean boot and check. <br />
Refer to the link:<br />
How to perform a clean boot to troubleshoot a problem in Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 8<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a><br />
Note: Refer "How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot"<br />
under more information to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope this resolves the issue.<br />

            mine is the same detects as a usb mouse but will not allow me to use profile editor, which kinda defeats the purpose of having a programmable mouse, this is really a let down as it worked fine in windows 8.1.

<p>This update includes quality improvements. No new operating system features are being introduced in this update. Key changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Addresses an issue in Microsoft HoloLens with tracking and device calibration that has affected some users. You may notice improvement 10-15 minutes after installing this update, but we recommend resetting the holograms for best results.&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;Addresses an issue that may cause users to receive “Error 1309” while installing or uninstalling certain types of MSI and MSP files.</li><li>Addresses an issue that&nbsp;may degrade graphics and mouse performance with desktop gaming when playing certain games, such as Destiny 2, after installing KB4482887.</li><li>Security updates to Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Scripting Engine, Windows Shell, Windows App Platform and Frameworks, Windows Kernel-Mode Drivers, Windows Server, Windows Linux, Windows Hyper-V, Windows Datacenter Networking, Windows Storage
 and Filesystems, Windows Wireless Networking, the Microsoft JET Database Engine, Windows Kernel, Windows, and Windows Fundamentals.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If you installed earlier updates, only the new fixes contained in this package will be downloaded and installed on your device.</p>

</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Symptom 1</strong><br />
After installing this update, Internet Explorer 11 may have authentication issues. This occurs when two or more people use the same user account for multiple, concurrent login sessions on the same Windows Server machine, including Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
 and Terminal Server logons. Symptoms reported by customers include, but may not be limited to:<br />
*Cache size and location show zero or empty.<br />
*Keyboard shortcuts may not work properly.<br />
*Webpages may intermittently fail to load or render correctly.<br />
*Issues with credential prompts.<br />
*Issues when downloading files.<br />
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Workaround 1</strong></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">*Create unique user accounts so that two people don’t share the same user account when logging on to a Windows Server machine. Additionally, disable multiple RDP sessions for a single user account for a specific Windows Server.*<br />
*Microsoft is working on a resolution and will provide an update in an upcoming release.</p>
<p><span>Symptom 2</span></p>
<p>After installing this update on machines that have multiple audio devices, applications that provide advanced options for internal or external audio output devices may stop working unexpectedly. This issue occurs for users that select an audio output device
 different from the “Default Audio Device”. Examples of applications that may stop working include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows Media Player</li><li>Realtek HD Audio Manager</li><li>Sound Blaster Control Panel</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Workaround 2</strong></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">As a temporary solution, select the “Default Audio Device” in the options provided by the application; please refer to the application’s user manual for details.For example, to set the
<strong>Default Audio Device</strong> in Windows Media Player:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open <strong>Windows Media Player</strong> &gt; <strong>Tools</strong> &gt; <strong>
Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Devices</strong>.</li><li>Select the device and choose <strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>On the next dialog, from the drop-down menu under <strong>Select the Audio Device</strong>, choose
<strong>Default Audio Device</strong> from the list.</li></ol>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">You can then send audio from the application to the audio device you want&nbsp;in the per-application audio settings found under
<strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>System</strong> &gt; <strong>Sound</strong> &gt; <strong>
App Volume and device preferences</strong>.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span>Microsoft is working on a resolution and estimates a solution will be available in late March 2019.</span></span></span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Symptom 3</strong></span></p>
<p>After installing this update, MSXML6 causes applications to stop responding if an exception was thrown during node operations, such as
<strong>appendChild()</strong>, <strong>insertBefore()</strong>, and <strong>moveNode()</strong>.<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span>Group Policy editor may also be affected when editing a Group Policy Object (GPO) that contains a Group Policy Preference
 for Internet Settings.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span><span><span>Workaround 3</span></span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>Microsoft is working on a resolution and will provide an update in an upcoming release.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Before installing this update</strong></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Microsoft strongly recommends you install the latest servicing stack update (SSU) for your operating system before installing the latest cumulative update (LCU). SSUs improve the reliability of the update process to mitigate potential

<h2>            Wireless Mouse 4000 won&#39;t turn on most of the time</h2>
                    I've a 2 month old MS Wireless mouse 4000.&nbsp; I've been having battery issues with this.&nbsp; Initially I had to replace the battery once a week.&nbsp; Batteries are bnew Sanyo Eneloop 1900mah, 1.2v HR.<br />
<br />
Anyway, in the past 2 weeks the mouse would completely turn off after a few hours of replacing the batteries.&nbsp; Today I got suspicious because all newly charged batts didn't work.&nbsp;&nbsp; I pulled out my 3500mouse and not surprisingly, all batteries worked.<br />
<br />
Now I'm not sure if the prob's the mouse or the batteries.&nbsp; I noticed that recommended batts are rated 1.5v LR, but then howcome I've no issues with the 3500 mouse.&nbsp; The 4000 is now running on an energizer batt with recommended rating, going to monitor how
 long this one lasts.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since it’s battery issue with Microsoft Mouse, you can find better solutions at Microsoft Hardware support.

<p>Hello Thanasi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, no user on the forums has tools to assess enforcement cases/actions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be best for your friend to reach out to the <strong><a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/en-US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox Enforcement Website</a></strong> so that the account may be reviewed or further investigated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please have them do this and attempt to check available options there.</p>

            <p>sir you need to contact your wife and son immediately&nbsp; windows 10 GWX is one of the most deadly cybercrime attacks&nbsp;ever to infect a computer, you evidently have better virus and malware software than you family it is steadily getting all of your wife and
 sons information, I mean everything bank accounts purchase made on credit card&nbsp; and every documented history you have ever created, they need to to convert back to where they were before upgrading and it will still be on there pc or os you have probably noticed
 since applying that most every site you visit has changed , in someway&nbsp;the color or maybe the look of it is not what your use to, its because it has been encrypted and manipulated, there for not certified but a fake if it hasn't already it will do this to
 every page you use especialy your virus protection software&nbsp; and take it and Microsoft anything having you to seek help or&nbsp;support , and it can take control of you system, It makes sure that you cant acknowledge it, but your software I cons and programs will
 still show up, if you don't belive me&nbsp; go your c/drive&nbsp; then&nbsp;type in the search window GWX let it fully search&nbsp;, you can see it has moved already throughout your pc, and it is waiting for the final update to come in on your windows updates to hack the rest
 of your system im on my third pc purchase and if I reach you I will be lucky , don't open up any emails unless you know for sure whou it is they will eventualy get your contacts I will tell you tomorrow how to start getting this diseas off of your pc, and
 any kind of remote serice you call will probably be a scam&nbsp; even if they claim to be with one of your service will go into your system and destroy more and tell an outeages price to fix it good luck to you snd your family</p>

            <p>dear Gerry, I clearly get the point, but its free with a catch, I hope you read my last reply, sir there;s nothing in this world free without some kind of hidden clauses, and this free item is loaded with&nbsp; them if you get it you wont be able to convert back
 without changing your complete identity.&nbsp; im just someone like you friend, I just have suffered the hard way. the first response you got from TaurArian, it says right under his reply no warrenties or guarantee's , have you took a look at some of the mvp's
 giving answers on this site,&nbsp;I wonder how they have received so many awards when some of them just joined this site , check some of them for your self, good luck and god bless</p>
<p>

I would not try to create it myself, it will just open the door for more to remotely attack your pc, and if you had the&nbsp; GWX icon show up on your task bar , they
 may have gotten you identity info and don't need to download the rest of the spyware</p>

            Hi, MichaelBassett3
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor. I would love to help you today.
<br />
<br />When you reset your network, Windows will forget your Ethernet network, along with all your Wi-Fi networks and passwords. It will also forget additional connections, such as VPN connections or virtual switches, that you’ve created. Resetting will disable and then reinstall all your network adapters and set other networking components back to their original settings. You’ll even have to run through the questions you saw when you first installed Windows where you select whether you want your PC to be discoverable on the network.
<br />Once you’ve exhausted your other troubleshooting efforts, resetting the network is easy. Open Windows Settings by pressing Start and clicking the Settings button (or just by pressing Windows+I on your keyboard). On the Windows Settings screen, click “Network &amp; Internet.”
<br />On the “Network &amp; Internet” page, select the “Status” tab on the left and then, on the right, scroll down and click the “Network reset” link.
<br />The “Network reset” screen warns you about what will happen when your network is reset and also lets you know that a restart will be necessary. Click the “Reset now” button to reset the network and restart your PC.
<br />
<br />Let me know if the information has been useful to solve your Problem.

<h2>            Windows 8 giving &#34;System Thread Exception Not Handled&#34; BSOD on Clean Install</h2>
                    <p>I have my Old Laptop (Windows 7 Upgraded to Windows 10) and I would like to Dual Boot It with Windows 8.1. When the Installation finished I went to install Windows Updates (First 50). Everything went well until the Restart when Windows decided to install
 the remaining 150 Updates. In the middle it gave me the BSOD (System Thread Exception Not Handled). This Blue Screen has to do with the graphics driver. I then reinstalled Windows 8.1 and the same thing happened. The Graphics Driver was installed via Windows
 Update.</p>

            As I said in the first thread I have Windows 10 and want it Dual Booted with windows 8.1. I tried this twice. In the first install I installed every driver from the Toshiba UK Website and got the mentioned BSOD. So I Deleted Windows 8.1 and tried to reinstall
 it. This time all the drivers where installed from Windows Update and the same thing happened. Attached is a picture of my laptop's specs.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0dc1c148-2f3e-4bed-a993-4387d4bbc3ab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0dc1c148-2f3e-4bed-a993-4387d4bbc3ab" /></a>

<p>Just for clarity, are you experiencing the same issue when you're using Windows 10? If you're also experiencing a blue screen error when you're using Windows 10, it's probable that the cause of the issue is a faulty graphics driver. If you're not experiencing
 the same issue in Windows 10, it is probable that the issue is due to driver compatibility issues. In both cases, we recommend that you contact your computer's original equipment manufacturer, and ask them for assistance so that we can further isolate the
 issue. It is also advisable since you've already tried all of the available basic troubleshooting steps for your concern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly get back to us with the results of your conversation with your computer original equipment manufacturer's support team.</p>

<h2>            Problem downloading email on Windows Live Mail</h2>
                    On Windows Live Mail I've been trying to download an email for ages. Keep getting a box saying: Your POP3 server has not responded for sixty seconds. Woud you like to wait another sixty seconds for the sever to respond? I keep clicking WAIT, but then just
 keep getting the message again. Is it the email e.g. massive attachment? If so, can I delete it or move to the next one in any way?

<h2>            data lost &#40;unreadable&#41; from usb flash drive</h2>
                    
<p>My son placed a 16gb flash in the usb port of the 360 and formatted per the prompts, transferred almost all of his data and now the flash drive isn't recognized by the xbox. &nbsp;Unfortunately...he already deleted the data from the console $#@!. &nbsp;The flash is
 almost completely full. &nbsp;I saw a hint regarding setting the properties to the non default option, doesn't help. &nbsp;Tried rebooting with the flash in the port, doesn't help.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

 for the console to read it. Before you do anything else with it, have you tried plugging it into another console to see if his data shows up on that? If not that would be one thing to try.

<p>I assume it is compatible as it was formatted by the console and allowed the transfer of all his data??? &nbsp;The drive wasn't removed from the console while his sister played a game, the console was turned off, later when turned on, the console read that the
 drive needed formatting. &nbsp;This was a brand new, empty drive going in, and currently shows as almost full. &nbsp;We have since verified that there are files on the drive by placing the drive in a pc (no warning anywhere not to place flash-drive into a pc) but the
 files are "gibberish." In fact I think I read a post that you can select a certain amount of space to be dedicated to the xbox so as to use the remainder for pc files. &nbsp;It seems unlikely that placing the drive in a pc would render the drive useless???</p>

<p>The same thing happened to me last night. Fortunately, my most important saves were alive, but on other transfers, I lost large amounts of DLC and some old save games. The USB stick was also brand now, formatted correctly and readable in the XBOX. When I
 moved it to the other XBOX, NOTHING. Put it back in the original XBOX, it prompts me to format it for use in an XBOX. Something is wrong here somewhere....</p>

<p>Are you putting the USB stick into the console before powering it on? Some brands, such as PNY, seem to go as you describe when that happens, so it is best to always plug the USB stick in after the console has started up.</p>

<p><span>By default, the system reserves 512 MB for system use. &nbsp;Upon formatting the drive, you will have two options, "Configure Now" and "Customize". &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>"Configure now" will automatically reserve 512 MB of space for system use plus the remainder of space left on the drive (up to 16GB) for Xbox 360 storage. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>With the "Customize" option, you can choose exactly how much space you want to use for Xbox 360 storage (up to 16GB). &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would recommend formatting the flash drive with the Windows FAT32 file system. &nbsp;Macintosh or Linux formats will not work. &nbsp;Then just stick the drive back into your console, format per instructions, but this time
 choose "Customize" if your son plans on transferring data such as music/pictures. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>

<p>I had the exact same problem. I have been using an HP flash drive and it was great, until recently. Ive bought 2 other drives and formatted them all properly, and it will work for a day or 2, but when i plug it in to one of my other consoles, its all gone.</p>
<p>A real solution would be great, since you guys made the old hard drives incompatable with the new systems. Thanks for the RROD too for every console I've owned.</p>

<p>Is the xbox capable of your flash drive type?</p>
<p>If not then this could be an issue.</p>
<p>If this has worked in the past then you may of ejected the flash drive to soon whilst data is still been submitted to and/or from the flash drive.</p>
<p>You can clear all data from your flash drive via your computer.</p>
<p>On your computer load up the flash drive, there should be no files there,</p>
<p>If this is the case on 'My Computer'/'Computer' (Depending on the version) right-click your flash drive and click 'Format' from here it will clear the flash drive and will be usable again for computer usage.</p>
<p>Hope this help,</p>

<p>voteDC is right. I had this exact problem and tried his solution and it was a quick and easy way to save the day.</p>
<p>Unplug it and plug it back in. Apparently it doesn't like turning on with the USB already in.</p>

                    <strong>After the latest windows 10 update all the icons and fonts and pages became hug, ovelapping the screen. All the fixes found online didn't work. I right clicked on the screen and went to view and adjusted it but it didn't do much. It seems windows
 needs a new update to&nbsp;fix this problem. Please hurry. Every page I open is huge and I have to reduce it&nbsp; just to be able to see it.&nbsp; The desktop icons are still big and I cannot reduce them to what they were before. Even the quality of the print is not as
 crisp&nbsp;and sharp as before. The aps on the bottom taskbar are still huge and a little blurry, not sharp.The latest update messed everything up and I cannot get it back to how they were before. I have experienced many issues with windows 10 but this is probably
 the worst one for me. I really liked windows 7, I never had these many issues with it!!! Didn't this happen to many users, are there many complaints???</strong>

<p>Hi those instructions above were posted by Microsoft. I seen in another post that you replied to that maybe your issue is gone? These driver updates Microsoft is doing for older devices is a disgrace. If you have not solved your issue I would suggest downloading
 the drivers for your device from the Microsoft update catalog and installing that driver.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
Go to the Microsoft Update Catalog website page at&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)"><a href="http://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com</a>&nbsp;</span></li><li>
 a search for your driver for older drivers that are not supported anymore. Or download from your PC / laptop manufacturer</span></li><li>
If you are using a laptop or an all-in-one PC you will want the Mobility driver, otherwise you probably want the one that doesn't include Mobility.</li><li>
&nbsp;If you have a newer driver you were using and windows does not find it then download it from your computer manufacturer.</li></ol>
<li>
If you are running 32-bit Windows, download the smaller of the two files shown for your device, otherwise download the larger.</li><li>
Create a new folder in your downloads folder called "Video driver"</li><li>
Double click on the CAB file you downloaded to open it and then drag its contents into the "Video driver" folder.
<strong>
Or run the exe file that you downloaded from your computer manufacturer.</strong></li><li>
Go to Device Manager and Display Adapters, select the Microsoft Basic Display Adapter, right click and select Update Driver</li><li>
Click on "Browse my computer for driver software"</li><li>
Browse to the "Video driver" folder you previously created and press OK and Next</li><li>
Hopefully this will install the 2015 version of the drive and you'll be back up and running
<strong>
or your computer manufacturers driver</strong>
<p>
<strong>If
 you find and download your driver . Back it up to a usb or cd/dvd</strong></p>

<strong>Microsoft
 has a troubleshooter to hide updates</strong></p>

    <title>Windows 10 feedback - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xnon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 feedback</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to find a "site" where I can log and/or read about Windows 10 comments and suggestions as well as "bits" that aren't working as well as or the way that customers have expected the "New" windows to work.</p>
<p>I am led to "older" sites that were about all the development and trials but not now that that the customers are actually using the product.</p>
<p>I am interested in what people are saying, requesting, finding good and bad and probably throw in my comments.</p>
<p>Within the first few hours after the install I had a "box" pop up and ask for comments, it showed lots, but then I have not been able to get back to that.</p>
<p>Any help please?</p>

<p>Hi Dennis,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The issue may be caused by an improper Windows Update installation. For example, a Windows Update installation interrupted by a crash may result in a corrupted system file. A third-party
 program conflict can also be the reason for this error.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let us narrow down the possibilities why your PC encountered this issue. You can follow the troubleshooting steps below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Temporarily disable your antivirus program before running the Windows Update.
</span></li><li><span>Visit the article on </span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">how to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></strong></a><span>.
 This helps eliminate software conflict that occurs when you install a program or an update. You may also determine what conflict is causing the issue by performing this method.</span></li><li><span>Fix Windows Update errors. Since you are using Windows 10, you can do this by running the Windows Update Troubleshooter. To download the Windows Update Troubleshooter, click on this
</span><a href="https://aka.ms/wudiag" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">link</span></strong></a><span>.</span></li><li><span>Restart your computer for the changes to take effect and try updating Windows again.
</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>Note: After doing the steps above, you can enable your antivirus program again.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Keep us posted if you encounter any challenges along the process.</span></p>
