<h2>            would like a confirmation for shutdown</h2>
                    
<p>When I hit the power button action (shutdown) there was no confirmation - it just shut down. I'm not so coordinated that I could be aiming for the teeny&nbsp;tiny pull-down next to it (lock, log off, ...)&nbsp;and miss.&nbsp; In XP, it was a two-step process.&nbsp; Considering
 all the actions in win7 that require more steps than in XP, this one requires fewer and potentially can cause more havoc.&nbsp; I realize I can change what this button does but what would be far useful is a&nbsp; shutdown&nbsp;confirmation step.&nbsp; Having the pull-down further
 away from that button would also be nice.&nbsp; Again, it seems to me (with my 1-month experience in win7) that everything is much more spread out - action are widely separated, eg on the start panel&nbsp;(or is that partly a function of my 24" monitor?) except for
 this.&nbsp; My question, to be clear, is there any way to add a 2nd step in this shutdown action?&nbsp; I'm ok with lock, etc because they don't have the potential for damage that shutdown does. Even were I to move the shutdown inside the pull-down, I still face the
 potential problem.</p>
<p>thanks, Joan</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>There are a few ways to add steps to the shutdown process, if you wish.</p>
<p>Use the keyboard instead of the mouse.</p>
<p>a. Press the Windows Logo Key to bring up the Start Menu. Press the Right Arrow key once to select the Shutdown Button. If your sure you want to continue, press the Enter Key to shutdown.</p>
<p>b. Press the Windows Logo Key to bring up the Start Menu. Press the Right Arrow key&nbsp;Twice and the Up Arrow Key once to bring up the menu. Use the Arrow keys to select any of the 5 options and press the Enter Key.</p>
<p>c. Press Ctrl+Alt+Del once. You will see several options on the screen, including the shutdown menu in the lower/right corner.</p>
<p>d. If you just want to Lock or Switch User, press the Windows Logo Key+L. This will take you directly to the Logon Screen.</p>
<p>Also, Windows 7 includes a built-in safe shutdown&nbsp;component. When you shutdown the computer, if there are any programs still running that could potentially cause corruption, you will see a screen advising you of the problem. You will have the options of
 clicking the Force Shutdown Button, or the Cancel Button.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Can anyone please explain&nbsp; what logon process initialization failure consult event viewer error means</p>

<p>By profile, I mean your user account (or any user account).&nbsp; Each account has a profile stored in C:\Users.&nbsp; If the profile can't initialize, then the system can't log you in properly under your selected username - or perhaps can't log anyone into the system
 except perhaps by providing a limited access temporary profile.</p>
<p>It means that this particular part of Windows didn't load - for whatever reason.&nbsp; The reason is documented in the Event Log if you want to learn more.&nbsp; You can do this using the procedures I provided above about using Event Viewer.&nbsp; If you don't understand
 it, copy it and post it here and I'll see if I can discover the problem from what you send.</p>
<p>I have no idea if the error is serious or not because I don't know what caused it because you haven't done the above procedures some of which would help in identifying the cause.&nbsp; I would at least run the SFC and the CHKDSK scans to see if there is any corruption
 and those programs when rum as directed can sometimes repair that corruption.&nbsp; They aren't bad things to do from time-to-time just to check to make sure everything is running as well as possible.</p>
<p>I would add Malwarebytes <a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</a> to your programs (the free version) and scan with it every few weeks to catch anything McAfee might miss.</p>
<p><span><span><span>I hope this helps.</span></span></span></p>

<p>It means that the logon process is not functioning properly - I assume you're unable to logon to your system or have been given a temporary profile instead of your normal profile (or have had other logon-related problems).&nbsp; If it doesn't seem like you do,
 you possibly haven't done anything to reveal the problems yet - but this is an issue that needs to be resolved (before it gets any worse).&nbsp; Here's a Bing result page with many articles about this error message if you want to check them out:
<a href="http://www.bing.com/search?q=what+does+logon+process+initialization+failure+mean&amp;form=QBRE&amp;qs=n&amp;sk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.bing.com/search?q=what+does+logon+process+initialization+failure+mean&amp;form=QBRE&amp;qs=n&amp;sk</a>=</p>
<p>Have you made ANY changes to your system recently - additons or removals of hardware or software of any kind (including updates)?&nbsp; When did this first start?&nbsp; Exactly when does the message occur?&nbsp; What effect does the error have on how you can work with
 the system?&nbsp; What version of Vista are you using (e.g., 32-bit Vista Business SP2)?&nbsp; Has your AV program (what is its name and version) detected any viruses recently (even if they were supposedly cleaned by the software) and if so, do you know the name of
 the virus?</p>
<p>If you can't login normally, try logging into safe mode with networkding (by repeatedly clicking the F8 key until the menu apppears) and see if you can get in.&nbsp; If not, boot to the Installatio Disk or Recovery Disk and go to the Command prompt option and
 cd to C:\Windows\System32.</p>
<p>P<span>lease post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning&nbsp;logon initialization failure &nbsp;(Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Event
 Viewer – or typing eventvwr from the command prompt).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:
</span><span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 If you need to, boot to the Recovery Disk or Installation Disk to get to the Command Prompt option (see below for how to change BIOS if needed to boot to the disk or if you don't have a disk and need to make one that will work to do this.&nbsp; Check the System
 section first as that's where it's most likely to appear.&nbsp; These details will undoubtedly help us identify the cause of the error and then we should be able to come up with a targeted solution to the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>Now, lets try to troubleshoot and find the cause and solution to this problem:</span></p>
<p><span><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore
 to a point in time <strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work (it works a bit different than the above instructions but if you follow the prompts on the disks and know the above information you should be able
 to restore with no problems).<br />
<br />
If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
<span><a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></a></span><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span><span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></a></span><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s)
 using </span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></a></span><span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will probably want to schedule itself to start at the next startup.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Answer yes and then reboot so it will run. It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>If
 that doesn't work and you can boot normally (or if SFC finds any&nbsp;corruption &nbsp;it cannot repair), we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. If the other procedures don't work, THIS one is almost certain to work.&nbsp; You may have a lot of updates to re-install
 (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:
</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></span></a></span><span>.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>I
 hope this helps.&nbsp; If you continue to get the error message or continue to have any problems, please post back and we'll try to come up with some other options.&nbsp; In that case, please include the results from the above scans and tests and procedures - especially
 the contents ot the Event Log error message.&nbsp; That way we'll have a better idea of what's the best thing to try nexxt (if necessary).</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Good
 luck!</span></span></span></p>

<h2>            Need help&#33; Windows 10 Build&#58;1709 - Windows Store and Windows Update errors - Code&#58; 0x80073CF9</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone. I recently updated to the new Windows 10 Fall Creators Update. I now have an issue with both the Windows App Store and the Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My system:</p>
<p>Custom built PC</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Gigabyte GA-78MLT-USB3 mobo</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Kingston HyperX Fury 1866Mhz 1x8GB</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; AMD FX-4100 3.6Ghz (3.8Ghz boost) OC'ed to 4.1Ghz</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; MSI N760 4GB GPU</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 3 HHDs (One for OS, one for apps, one for media and various storage.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>_______ISSUES________</p>
<p>
</p><p>App Store:</p>
<p>I first noticed this one when I tried to update Minecraft: W10 Edition. I kept getting errors. I then tried to update another app, which was a system app, to make sure it wasn't all the apps and not just MCW10. The system app updated fine so I Uninstalled
 MC and then proceeded to reinstall it. I've tried to reinstall MC several times now and only come up with Error&nbsp;Code: 0x80073CF9. I then tried to update another app, a user app this time, and it got the same error. Apparently only system apps update now and
 user apps are left in the dust.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Update:</p>
<p>It took me a while to notice this one. When I try to install an update it downloads then goes to install the update. Upon the update hitting "Preparing to install - 100%" it resets itself and start back to "Preparing to install - 0%" which quickly jumps
 to "Preparing to install - 26%" then takes it's time counting back up to 100%. If I go into the "View Installed update history" section I see the update and it shows Error Code - 0x80240034.</p>
<p>
</p><p>______________________</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried ALOT of "Problem Fixes" already, ones including PowerShell, Command Prompt, DISM.exe, SFC, changing Region settings, and many others I can't remember right now. This is starting to annoy me. Is there any way I can fix this issue without resetting
 Windows? I would like to be able to keep all my apps as it would take me a long time to recover them. I can do registry edits and about anything else you through at me. I am pretty techy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for any answers.</p>

</p><p>Hi Tanner,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You're indeed a very technical person, as per the troubleshooting steps that you've mentioned were almost all the needed steps for the concern that you're having.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, we would like to know if you've another user account on the PC. If yes, then are you able to install or update the apps from that account? If not, there is a high possibility that the errors that you're receiving when updating is due to
<em>corrupted profile </em>which can be resolved by creating a <em>new account</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, considering the methods stated and the issue still persist, we might need to already perform an in-place upgrade repair. You don't need to worry as this process won't affect your personal data and configurations. We highly suggest following the
 steps provided by Andre Da Costa on this <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-perform-a-repair-upgrade-using-the-windows/35160fbe-9352-4e70-9887-f40096ec3085">link</a></strong>.</p>

<p>I have a laptop and a desktop. The laptop installed 1709 without any trouble. The desktop exhibited exactly the annoying behaviour you reported: the "Preparing to install updates" bar climbed to 100% and then jumped back to 0%. I read various advice online
 and did the following:</p>
<p>1. I ran the trouble-shooter&nbsp; which is available in the menu on the left of the Microsoft Update window. That seemed to help becasue the next time I tried to install 1709, it went much more quickly but still failed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. I have a relatively small solid-state C-drive. I used diskcleaner to free up space on it. Again this did not seem to be the whole answer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Finally, I paused my Kaspersky Total Security for the next attempt.</p>
<p>After pausing the Kaspersky Total Security the "preparing to install updates" went quite slowly and so I was not too hopeful. But this time it "took" and told me a reboot was needed when it reached 100%. Then everything was fine although the computer was
 restarted several times during the installation. Immediately itt finished I restarted the Kaspesrky.</p>
<p>Of course, I cannot be sure which, if any, of the moves I reported above made the difference.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for the suggestion. I did try another account and experienced the same issues. After doing that I downloaded the newest Windows 10 ISO file (1709) and went to reinstall Windows. I backed up my main files to another drive and fresh installed. I
 went ahead and made a few changes to the system while i was doing it, which wasn't too much of an issue. I then experience yet another error when downloading the app again, which I believe to be in the process of solving. I forget the error code at this time.
 I've done updated everything and i believe the issue to be from a messed up file which i had left on my programs drive after i reinstalled Windows on my OS drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't expect a major update to be spotless but i would appreciate if y'all would take a check on the Windows Update issues. I don't seem to be the only one and this has been the major cause of issue throughout the other versions of Windows. I appreciate
 your work. Windows 10 has come quite a far way but still has some distance to go.</p>

<p>
</p><p>It is indeed possible that the issue maybe related to system or program files that you've left on the programs drive. There is also a high probability that your hard drive has bad sectors that is corrupting the OS installation. Since you've already back
 up your files, we highly recommend performing a clean install and formatting the hard drive.</p>
<p>
If anything comes up, don't hesitate to get back to us anytime.

<p>I beg to differ with you concerning a hard drive with bad sectors. It should be OK for Microsoft to take ownership of issues with upgrades, and not blame the problem on bad hard drive sectors. With all the people reporting exactly the same issues (I am experiencing
 them also), is it possible that all of a sudden we have bad sectors? I doubt it.</p>
<p>Please let us know when Microsoft will release an update that will correct the problems with Build 1709. As a former member of the Insider Program, I know Microsoft can do much better than this.</p>

Mayra Aqu</strong>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of the moment, we do not have any information on how the issue will be fixed by a particular update however, we do have monthly Cumulative updates and major updates every March and September.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll keep an eye out for your response.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I did manage to get my OS working again. Although I forget how I managed that, I believe that i accomplished it by taking ownership of the bad files and deleting them, then installing all available OS updates at the time, and then installing all the system
 apps updates in the Store before reinstalling all of my additional apps. I may have also allowed a few system apps and services through the firewall just to confirm that wasn't an issue. The only security service I use is the one built into W10, so that i
 don't get any issues with multiple security services running at the same time. This is apparently the issue methuselahXI had.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I installed MCW10, however, every time I would go to start it the app would almost immediately crash. I had this issue for the longest time before I finally figured it out. I had not yet installed the Media Package for my OS, which is required to run
 MCW10 for some reason. The package hadn't come out yet when I had upgraded so I had to wait a while.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a rather pick OS. Gets annoying at times, but at other times it gives me something to do besides video gaming, XD. I do also like to repair hardware and software, so this gives me a bit more experience. However, to have such issues with what supposed
 to be a main OS that is also really overpriced is unacceptable. Some apps, both games and necessary apps, require the most recent update to run. If we cannot download that update then that can set quite a few people behind. Then if we cannot download and install
 the system update to correct the issue that leaves the user in a terrible state. About to only solution then is to reinstall Windows, possibly loosing alot of your work, then spend hours and even days reinstalling everything and getting the OS back up, and
 hope it doesn't happen again. There is a reason many still like W7. We never did experience many hard to solve issues, and the issues we did run into at the time were fixable by easily repairing yourself, a downloadable repair, or by contacting a tech. Plus
 it ran smoother. W10 is a good base but needs much improvement.</p>

<p><span>Another way I have seen on some models is to tap F8, and go to a list of Startup options, and start a Factory Standards Recovery from in there, by selecting the Repair
 computer option.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span><span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Also ask them if it is possible to make Recovery Disk/s from the Recovery Partition in case of Hard Drive failure or System Crash.</span></p>
<p><span>They will tell you how to do that.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Each Computer Manufacturer has their own way of making Recovery Disk/s.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
Or borrow a proper Microsoft Vista DVD (not Dell, HP, Acer, etc Recovery Disk/s).<br />
A proper Vista DVD contains all Vista versions.<br />
The Product Key determines which Vista&nbsp;version gets installed.<br />
<br />
There are 2 Vista disks: one for 32bit Operating System, and one for 64bit Operating System.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If a clean install is required with a proper Vista DVD (not HP, Dell Recovery Disks):</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At startup/power on you should see at the bottom of the screen either F2 or DELETE, to go into Bios/Setup, or F12 for the Boot Menu</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Go into your Bios/Setup, or Boot Menu, at startup, and change the Boot Order to make the DVD/CD drive 1st in the Boot Order, then reboot with the disk in the Drive.</span></p>

            <p>If you are using Windows Mail in Vista, then go to Tools | Options | Security and check the box to warn if other applications are sending mail as you.&nbsp; I suspect, however, that your email address is being spoofed by a different infected machine and it is
 sending out emails disguised as coming from you.&nbsp; There is not a whole lot you can do about that.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Make sure you machine is not infected by doing a virus scan (e.g. www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/ ) and check for malware (<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.malwarebytes.org</a>). But it may not be you or your machine&nbsp;that is reponsible for
 sending out spam that appears to come from you.</p>

    <title>youtube videos will not play in any browser - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jetwrench  say:</h3>
<h2>            youtube videos will not play in any browser</h2>
                    Win7 Pro 64bit, IE10.0.9200.16721.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cannot play youtube videos in&nbsp;ANY browser. I believe it started after running&nbsp;a registry cleaner back in July.
<p>Spent two months trying to fix and still not working. Cleared caches, stopped all programs including firewalls and antivirus to no avail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Transferred&nbsp;files and settings to another drive (D:), like moving to new computer and did fresh Win7 install on C:. Migrated files and settings, set everything back up, still did not work. Removed flash player, ran flash uninstall tool to make sure nothing
 showing, reinstalled after, still did not work. Uninstalled IE, reinstalled, still did not work. Have the latest version of Java and Shockwave plugins -&nbsp;I've uninstalled and reinstalled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figured maybe something migrated from files and settings so backed up important files to D:, reformatted C:, did fresh install of Win7. Still did not work after new installation. Thinking this is very weird to have happen AGAIN. Could maybe new installation
 of Win7 to C: be picking up info off of D: when installing or possibly reading old prefetch or registry from info saved from&nbsp;the transfer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried IE10, Chrome and&nbsp;Firefox to no success. When clicking on link in email or going to youtube&nbsp; website, player screen comes up with picture as if all is normal. After clicking, black snowy screen appears with the message "An error has occurred, please
 try again later." And below that, there is a link that says 'Learn more'. I've been through all of those steps and stages both times around and have yet to find a resolution. I can watch some flash videos if they're embedded on a website like MSN or some news
 videos but email links or going to the youtube site and clicking on videos will not work. Sometimes ads will come up and they'll play fine until the video should start, then the message appears.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm beginning to think I'll have to do another reformat and total fresh install of Win7, Office and all programs without the D: drive being hooked up... Very frustrated - one of the toughest problems to fix in over 20 years of jacking around with computers...
 I've been all over the Microsoft Forums and web looking to find something that might work but keep coming up empty. Any help from&nbsp;any of you supergurus out there would be appreciated - thanks!</p>

<h2>            Is there a maximum HD file size with movie maker</h2>
                    When I save a movie in HD there seems to be a max size. The rendered movie is 5 GB and it cannot be played with any software. Everything tells me the file is not recognised. If I render just a small length of the same file it plays just fine. Is there
 actually a max file size?

<h2>            OS update on XBox One a total failure</h2>
                    
<p>First of all finding my games is MUCH harder which is super frustrating, being that 95% of what I use the xbox for is gaming. Then they give us a community page that just features my friends achievements. I could care less about which achievement they just
 earned, I'd much rather know who is currently online, and what game they are playing. You see socialization and interaction happens easier if I see a friend online playing a game I'd enjoy playing with them as well. That's how I understand interaction with
 community, if Microsoft truly wants to promote social gaming they just took a GIANT step backwards with this update. Also I enjoyed the gamerscore last 30 days feature they used to have in the community section. That feature created competition amongst friends
 where their overall gamerscore didn't matter, just what they've unlocked in the last 30 days, so people who've had an xbox for years and people with only a few months of playing can compete on an even playing field. With the new update that is now gone. As
 far as I'm concerned this update was a complete failure since I can't find my games and the only social aspect of gaming that I enjoyed has been eliminated. I hope that both of these issues are resolved very soon.</p>

<p>the new dash should never have been released until they had fixed all the bugs within it. there is still bugs in it that were reported by the beta testers months ago but were never fixed and now they have thrown it at everyone without fixing all the bugs.</p>

<p>the last update is just crap, too much lag while 'multitasking', nothing is improved only more complexe ways to find things.</p>
<p>dont care much for the 360 stuff, because i play mainly multiplayer and bought the xbox one to play against people without modded consoles.

            <p>Hi Antony,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to clarify, you are referring to charging a different laptop from a laptop without connecting to a power source, is that right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, please be informed that there is no option to charge a laptop from a different laptop. However, you can use you favourite search engine and check if there are any external devices which meets your requirement.

<h2>            Someone else using my account&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I'm not sure how this is possible but I got on Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare after lunch today and I had two supply drops and the one shot goggles which I know I didn't earn. I checked my last couple matches stats and the last two said K/D:&nbsp;0.3. I'm not
 a very good player but I'm not that terrible. I assumed someone else must have been on my account, but upon researching this I learned that you get prompts if you've been logged into a different console. I have a friend who uses my account but only for Call
 of Duty: Black Ops 2&nbsp;multiplayer on the 360 and possibly MTV or something with dirt bikes and he doesn't have the password. So that means it must have been on my console except that it would have to have happened between last night and this afternoon. My console
 is in my room where I sleep and I haven't left the house since before last night. Perhaps someone snuck into my room and turned the volume off to play a match. That would explain the horrible K/D, but the goggles? Shotgun? IDK what the hell just happened.</p>

<p>First off, you are breaking the rules when you allow anybody to use your account, and taking a chance that they might do something wrong while they use it. I would suggest that you do not allow your friend to use your account any longer, and if you feel
 that your account may have been logged in somewhere else I suggest you change your login details. You can take this as far as opening an unauthorized access investigation, all you have to do is call support at 1-800-4my-xbox for the US and Canada. Your account
 will be frozen during the investigation.</p>

<p>Thanks for the insight apparently Xbox uses security as an excuse to make everyone pay for gold and help track their individual purchasing patterns. That does make sense I guess. In light of this and the fact that it turns out my friend was on Advanced Warfare
 messing my K/D up I have barred access to my account. Also WARNING: The 360 does not acknowledge the fact that you are or were logged in on the One and the other way around. Something Microsoft should look into. Thanks again.</p>

<p><span>Hi 77raine,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you receive this error message when trying to download a program from your web browser or while installing the downloaded program on your machine?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>What
 program were you trying to download/install?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to perform an online virus scan.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: Perform an online virus scan from Safe mode with networking?</span></strong></p>
<p><span>To boot the computer into Safe mode with networking, follow the steps mentioned below.</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Use
 F8 while restarting the computer.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Under
 Windows Boot options menu, select “Safe mode with networking” and press Enter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Once
 you login to Safe mode, open your web browser and visit the link “<a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Get a free PC safety virus scan</a>”</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:<span>Perform a check disk operation from Windows Recovery Options</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can help solve some computer problems and improve the performance of your computer by making sure that your hard disk has no errors. If system
 restore doesn’t help, then use the command prompt tool from the Windows Recovery options and then perform check disk.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>To run chkdsk from Windows Recovery Options</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the command prompt, type chkdsk followed by one or a combination of switches listed in step b and c.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Note: You need to perform check disk operation on C: drive. So, the command to switch to C: drive would be chkdsk c: and followed by switches as
 given in the steps further.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/f = The /f switch is the most common of the chkdsk switches. It tells chkdsk to try and fix any errors it finds.</span></p>
<p><span>EX Type: chkdsk C:/f</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>NOTE: Answer Y when chkdsk asks you if you want to check the drive next time Vista boots (restarts).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/r = The /r switch tells chkdsk to attempt to recover any bad sectors of the hard drive if any are found. A bad sector is a spot on the hard
 drive that cannot hold saved data anymore.</span></p>
<p><span>EX Type: chkdsk c:/r</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>NOTE:</strong> Answer Y when chkdsk asks you if you want to check the drive next time Windows Vista boots. If check disk finds any bad
 sector, the data on the sector would be lost.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful and let me know if you need any further assistance.</span></p>

    <title>Wifi signal is lower than before - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mushtaqa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wifi signal is lower than before</h2>
                    I have a strange problem with my HP laptop running Windows 10, anniversary update installed. This problem started only after the anniversary update performed.<br />
<br />
01. Whenever I connect my Laptop to a Wifi network it shows full signal strength in the task pane but, when I click the Wifi icon there to see all the available networks, it shows the real signal strength is far less than the full signal strength which is seen
 in the task pane.<br />
<br />
02. After updating latest the drivers for the network adapter in the Device Manager, the rate of signal that my PC receives is significantly lower than it was before, thus making it difficult to use the Wifi away from the router where I used to operate before.<br />
<br />
I use PROLiNK H5004NK router and Ralink RT3290 802.11bgn Wi-Fi Adapter with the latest driver being version 5.0.57.0.<br />
<br />
Your help and feedback are highly appreciated.<br />

            <p>Hi Mushtaq,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If your Wi-Fi signal mysteriously drops off in certain rooms, it may be due to your home’s construction. Especially thick walls can muffle Wi-Fi signals.
</span><span>Another source of Wi-Fi signal problems is interference. Wireless devices feature the ability to transmit and receive on several separate channels, but in many cases, they shift from the factory set to a single default channel. This can mean that
 several wireless sources in a small area, such as an apartment building, are all competing for signal in the same frequency band.
</span><span>You may also find intermittent signal problems caused by interference from other, non-Wi-Fi devices. Wi-Fi operates in the 2.4-gigahertz band, as do cordless phones and some remote alarm products. When active, these devices can reduce your Wi-Fi
 signal strength due to interference.</span></p>
<p>

            <p>Hello Sujatha,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying. Your answer is wonderful. But, I can see that it was intended to address only the 2nd of the 2 issues I had mentioned in my post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please look at this image below, and try to understand the first problem which is, the full strength is seen in the task pane but at least 20% lower in the Task manager and the available connections list. I want all of them to show the exact same signal
 reading as the other. I am asking this because it was alright when I was using the previous version of Windows 10 but suddenly happened to become like this after the update. Is there a solution for this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the 2nd problem, for which you'd tried to solve, I suspect my Ralink RT3290 network adapter to be the culprit since I have been seeing many complaints related to this product lately. I will check the network adapter by replacing with a new one
 and let you know the status.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, please try to get me a solution for the issue I have explained above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks and regards,</p>

            <p>Hi Shilohbob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Speedtest gives me almost 90% of the maximum achievable speed when WiFi signal strength reads 80%. That's a good sign. But, although my router is placed within 5-metres radius in the same room as my PC is, without any disrupting materials, the signal is
 weak (around 80 - 90%), which is so annoying. Perhaps, it is the maximum possible absorption by my apparently damaged RT3290 adapter.</p>
<p>Now, let's leave this topic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want a solution for my other problem which I described in the above post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe you can provide a solution for that, too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks and regards,</p>

<p>Dear Ana Cuéllar,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason for weak reception of WiFi signal was my faulty network adapter. I use an external adapter nowadays and it works just fine.<br />
<br />
If you are asking about the other problem, the difference of signal strength shown in the task pane and available networks list, I am afraid that it has no solution. It is still the same even after installing all the updates Microsoft has released.</p>

    <title>How to prevent &#40;accidental&#41; deletion of a file in Win 8 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to prevent &#40;accidental&#41; deletion of a file in Win 8 &#40;security settings&#41; &#63;</h2>
                    I have a Laptop with Win 8.<br />
Recently I deleted a folder in my thumb drive accidentally as that folder was "active" in the explorer, while I thought I was deleting something else on the desktop.<br />
I am hoping I do not make the same mistake twice, so in addition to taking a backup of such folders on the thumb drive, I would also like to change its security settings, so that a casual "Shift+Delete" will give me an access denied warning - so that I can
 realize I am deleting the wrong thing.<br />
I tried adding a Deny Delete permission to Everyone in the advanced security setting, but it does not seem to work. I tried this while enabling inheritance and also after disabling it - but it did not make a difference.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions would be appreciated.<br />
Thanks
