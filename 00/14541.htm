<h2>            Image to resize automatically in a cell </h2>
                    
<p>I have two cells in my spreadsheet with an embedded image. In both cases I have defined in the properties for the cell 'Move and size with cells' for the Object Positioning property.</p>
<p>One image happily expands to fill the cell when I resize the width of the cell while the other stays the same size when I change the column width. Changing the row width the opposite happens.</p>
<p>I would like the image to resize uniformly with changes in either the cell width or height.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>you must align your image at the borders of the cell <strong>exactly</strong> :</p>
<ul>
<li>Select the image. </li><li>Press and hold the Alt-key while dragging upper left handle to the upper left corner of the cell. The cell border behave like magnetic. The corner of the image jumps to the corner of the cell.</li><li>Repeat the same with the lower right handle. </li><li>Take a look inside the image properties: Picture Tools/Format, Group Size &gt; click the dialoglauncher in the lower right corner &gt; tab Properties &gt; activate the option: Move and size with cells.</li></ul>
<p>You can activate or deactivate the checkbox<strong> Lock aspect ratio</strong> on the tab<strong> Size</strong> .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

 a total of over an hour on the phone, one of your team members said I was not entitled to phone support suggesting instead I email *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. (She had also suggested leaving feedback through
</span><a href="http://onenote.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">onenote.com</a><span> which to me is not the same thing as technical support.) after confirming with her the email was for technical troubleshooting I got off the phone and emailed. Well I

            <p>Hello, many thanks for your response. </p>
<p>&nbsp;I'm afraid saying you are sorry for the inconvenience and saying you think it will not happen again is not actually addressing my complaint at all. I will just take it that Microsoft does not &nbsp; Look into customer complaints and we can leave that one there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the link. My problem is not with opening the app either through navigation or via the pen top button so let me elaborate on the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>With th the onenote app open and using the stylus to make notes, the stylus is not working/onenote is not responding to the stylus. I have reinstalled onenote, switched off and on, close and reopened, cleared the cache. None of these fix the issue and it
 has reached the point where onenote/stylus is next to useless.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Helen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm the Product Manager for pen &amp; ink in OneNote and would love to help you solve this issue. Let's first make sure your pen is working, so we can then understand if it is a OneNote app issue. Does your pen work for other apps on your Surface?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, you may need to change the AAA battery in the pen. For more on that check out this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztoQVjX21WI</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it does work in other apps, let us know what version of Windows you're using and I'll bring this back to my ink engineering team to investigate further. :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much and thank you for using OneNote ink!</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Ian</p>

<p>
</p><p>Ian, can you please arrange for one of your team to work with me on this?Although perhaps you would agree with me that The use of the message board is not the medium for this conversation? Certainly a nice idea but it clearly isn't cutting it in this case!</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>Secondly At this point you will not be surprised to hear that I am incredibly frustrated with th level of service received and I would appreciate you putting me in direct contact with the complaints department. (And yes I have previously been fobbed off

<p>
</p><p>Per your previous post on January 5th (see above), you were going to test the pen in other apps the next time you had the issue in OneNote. This will allow me to verify whether or not this is an issue specific to OneNote or elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know as soon as you're able to do this so we can continue to help you :)</p>

<h2>            Some minor vertical gridlines missing in Excel 2007 charts</h2>
                    
<p>On my new computer with Excel 2007 I noticed problems with charting as compared to Excel 2003. Some or all of the minor vertical gridlines that were set to show actually don't show in Excel 2007 while they were visible in Excel 2003.</p>
<p>Tried to remove all gridline settings and re-install them and even rebuilt the whole Excel graph 2007 and the problem persists. The problem is irregular, in the sense that some charts do show both major and minor gridlines, some have a few minor gridlines
 missing, some have none at all.</p>

<blockquote>I can confirm that XL2007 does fail to display all your vertical minor gridlines. I tried this with a desktop and a laptop with very different&nbsp; screen resolutions. I even tried changing the resolution on the desktop. XL2007 was marred by poor charting
 - chart expert Jon Peltier reported many issues. Fortunately, MS has solved these in XL2010 in which your chart looks great. I do not think there is a simple resolution other than $s to upgrade. best wishes

Thank you for sending me at last the reply that confirms what I suspected from the beginning. I just wonder why Microsoft sells "improvements" of its software (in this case Excel 2007 with respect to Excel 2003) incapable of doing things that were possible
 with the previous version, and then does not care to fix the errors. Who is Jon Peltier and where can one find his findings on charting issues in Excel 2007?<br />

<h2>            Access 2010 - LookUp Tables w&#47;multi-fields</h2>
                    <p>I have created a Products Table that contains several fields (i.e. Commodity, Variety, Size, ValueAdded).&nbsp; In my Order Details Table, I created a Product Field that "LooksUp" the data in the Products Table.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I enter the details for a new order, the Product Field provides a drop-down list of each Product from the Products Table and it shows all the various Fields (Commodity, Variety, Size, ValueAdded).&nbsp; When I select the appropriate product from the list,
 however, the Order Details Table only shows the first item - COMMODITY.&nbsp; This is not sufficient information as each Commodity has various VARIETIES, SIZES, and VALUEADDED information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I get all Fields from the Product Table show up on the Order Details Table?</p>

            Hi Judith. You may have created a look up field at the table level, which is discouraged practice. What you really need is create the Combobox on the form and add unbound Textboxes to display the other columns of the Combobox.

            There are three ways you could handle this:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; Use correlated combo boxes so that you can drill down through the attributes, e.g. you select a commodity in one combo box, then a variety in a second combo box whose list is restricted to those varieties pertinent to the selected commodity, then a size
 in a third combo box and so on until you select the item in the final combo box.&nbsp; The basic methodology for this is that each combo box's RowSource is an SQL statement which references the previous combo box up the line as parameter.&nbsp; In each combo box's AfterUpdate
 event procedure those down the line are assigned to Null and requeried.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; Use a bound multi-column combo box to select the item, and unbound text boxes which reference the Column property of the combo box to show the other columns when an item is selected.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp; Concatenate the values of the various attributes into a single string expression in the visible column of the combo box.<br />
<br />
You'll find examples of the first two approaches in ComboDemo.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
Note that if you are using an earlier version of Access you might find that the colour of some form objects such as buttons shows incorrectly and you will need to&nbsp; amend the form design accordingly. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link copy its text (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
You'll find an example of the third method in the NotInList demo in the same OneDrive folder.&nbsp; In this little demo the opening form concatenates the various address columns with the contact's personal name to allow for two or more contacts of the same name
 to be distinguished.&nbsp; The concatenation is done by means of the ConcatValues function from the basConcat module in the database.<br />

<p>This is NOT how relational databases work. The ONLY value from the Products table that should be in the Order Details table is the ProductID (the primary key in the Products table) as a Foreign Key. One of the principles of relational databases is that data
 should exist in one place only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want&nbsp;to DISPLAY the additional values from the Product table on your form when you select a product, there are a variety of ways that are detailed in my blog on Displaying Data from Related tables. For reporting purposes, you would base the report
 on a query that joins the two tables on the ProductID.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also please heed DBGuy's advice on doing lookups on the form level not on the table level.</p>

</p><blockquote>Hi Judith. You may have created a look up field at the table level, which is discouraged practice. What you really need is create the Combobox on the form and add unbound Textboxes to display the other columns of the Combobox.
</blockquote>
<p>Thank you DBguy, however, I have not yet created any forms.&nbsp; So, if I understand you correctly, you are telling me that I should create the Products Table with the various descriptive Fields as I have done.&nbsp; And then, instead of creating a Field in the Orders
 Table that is called PRODUCT, I should create a Form; which will have a Combobox Control with unbound Textboxes?&nbsp; I am a little confused, because I thought I would need a Bound Textbox, so it would be connected to the Products Table?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you could make the instructions clearer, I would appreciate it!</p>

            <p>No, that's not what&nbsp;DBGuy is saying. </p>
<p>
</p><p>First you should have an Orders table and an OrderDetails table. Unless your customers only order ONE product per order, you need both tables. The OrderDetails table should have a foreign key for ProductID. That field should not be a lookup field. Instead,
 when you do create your forms (you should not be entering data directly into tables, that is what forms are for) You bind the ProductID field in the table to a combobox control on the form. So you are doing your lookups on the forms, not the table.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Forms only display data they don't store data. If you check out my blog that I mentioned earlier I think this will become clearer to you.

            <p>Hi Scott. Thanks for the assist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Judith, following on what Scott said, your table structure might look like the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>tblProducts</p>
<p>ProductID</p>
<p>ProductName</p>
<p>etc...</p>
<p>
</p><p>tblOrders</p>
<p>OrderID</p>
<p>CustomerID</p>
<p>OrderDate</p>
<p>etc...</p>
<p>
</p><p>tblOrderDetails</p>
<p>OrderDetailID</p>
<p>OrderID</p>
<p>ProductID</p>
<p>Qty</p>
<p>Price</p>
<p>etc...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The ProductID field in tblOrderDetails is a foreign key to tblProducts. In the tblOrderDetails, you leave the Lookup tab of ProductID as Textbox and store the ID numbers from tblProducts. However, in your subform for entering order details, you can use a
 Combobox bound to ProductID in tblOrderDetails with a dropdown based on tblProducts. To show the other attributes of the selected product in the subform, you can use several unbound textboxes pointing to the "columns" of the Combobox, which Ken said he has
 a demo you can check out to see how it's done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that makes sense...</p>

            <p>Thank you, Ken!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe what you are describing in #1 is what I have already done to create the Products Table?&nbsp; In other words, I have the various Fields that I mentioned in my question and several of these Fields contain either a LookUp Column from which I had typed
 in several options, a LookUp Column that is linked to another Table, or a multi-field Lookup Column.&nbsp; I am trying now to make Access show all of these columns together when I link the Products Table to the Order Table.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your suggestion #2 sounds as though it might work, however, I do not know how to "set up the unbound text boxes that would reference the Column property of the Combo box".&nbsp; I would greatly appreciate it if you could go into detail as to how to accomplish
 this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did look at your ComboDemo.zip file, however, I could not tell how you created the Forms and how they then were connected to the various Tables?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As with suggestion #2, suggestion #3 sounds like a possible solution, but I am not sure how to "concatenate the values of the various attributes into a single string expression".&nbsp; If you could elaborate, that would be appreciated as well!</p>

            <p>Scott -</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have a basic understanding of Access.&nbsp; I actually taught it for a brief time several years ago!&nbsp; I find, however, that teaching it from a book with corresponding files that have the various Objects already created or step by step instructions in how
 to create them by oneself is not very helpful when one tries to create their own unique Database from scratch!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your explanation of the idea of having information in only one place and then any other Table referencing it just showing an ID # helped me to understand the whole concept behind how Access operates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will now have to study Form creation and, hopefully, be able to accomplish what it is I am trying to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to your blog as suggested.&nbsp; That was the first time I ever went to someone's Blog!&nbsp; I saved it to my Favorite Places!&nbsp; So, I can check it out as I go along.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any recommendations for getting proper training?&nbsp; Not some basic class as those I taught.&nbsp; Any ideas would be appreciated!</p>

            <p>Use the Form Wizard to build your forms initially, then customize them to suit.&nbsp; You use a main form bound to the Orders table and a subform bound to the OrderDetails table.

<h2>            E52 does not receive SMS after SW update</h2>
                    Hello, I have very strange problem with my phone. When somebody sends SMS to me I will not see it until the phone is restarted. Sender gets delivery report, but I do not have any signal about new message and it is not visible in the inbox. After phone
 reboot I will see all messages sent to me. Sending SMS works fine. The problem started acter I've updated phone software to 071.004 (071.004.C00.01) Tried to reset to factory settings - does not help. Does anybody have any idea how this may be solved?

simply substract&nbsp; 2 hours&nbsp; i.e. "2:"</p>

<p>You can add the date and time together to form a date/time. Using your supplied sample data I created this with your date and time highlighted in yellow,</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fydewhg.blu.livefilestore.com%2fy1prqeYtNjGmAdbwmG71FmPyKLhhPIRMuoLcBa61ITW5IMnIDpMPLk6RrAi03GfsHB_lhUaMjXovD_2Kmb8XRH7Yh6xa09-44gs%2fSubtractDateTime1.JPG%3fpsid%3d1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;... so if your dates were in column A and your times were in column B, then subtracting two hours would be something like,</p>
<p>=(A1+B1)-TIME(2,0,0)</p>
<p>... and subtracting an entire&nbsp;day would be,</p>
<p>=(A1+B1)-DATE(0,1,1)<em> or</em>&nbsp;=(A1+B1)-1</p>
<p>You will have to change the A1, B1 for your own purposes, but that should get you on track.</p>

    <title>VBA sample to copy cell formatting to shape - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> keratl  say:</h3>
<h2>            VBA sample to copy cell formatting to shape</h2>
                    <p>By any chance, does anyone have code to copy <strong>cell formatting </strong>
to a rectangle <strong>shape</strong>? When I start thinking about all the more complicated formats (gradient, font characteristics, etc.) that means time digging around the object model to make sure I've got everything- so if someone else has already done
 the work, I'd greatly appreciate it if you are willing to share.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use case: interactive calendar, where I used to have only one primary activity per cell. Now we have 3+ activities going on at a time, so I'm moving from individual cell format/content, to rectangle shapes over the calendar using the cell coding rules that
 are already defined and are shown at the bottom of the calendar in specific [legend] cells.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is no problem to get the text into the shape and resize it for the date range- I'm just trying to save myself from having to format the shapes manually, or manually re-apply formatting if someone wants to change the base formatting for a particular type
 of activity later. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

            <p>The broadest answer is yes- ultimately that is what I need to do- </p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't tell from the video if fill color is the only transferred property. I need to make sure I get everything else that is applicable to a rectangle shape - border color/weight/line style, font/size/font color, &nbsp;fill effects (gradient colors and direction)
 and applying those to the appropriate shape properties. I shouldn't have any font effects to deal with, I can ignore linewrap (hardcode to no wrap), and I'll have to hardcode shape text box margins and other properties separately, since those aren't set in
 the legend cells</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ultimately, I can walk the object model for each of these properties for both cells and shapes, it just isn't an area of the object model I spend a lot of time in (I'm a data guy, not a "make it pretty" guy&nbsp;&lt;g&gt;) so I was just hoping someone else had&nbsp;to do
 this in the past and might have pre-existing code.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I had initially considered this- I may have discarded the idea too quickly- my legend has text inside, and that text may not be exactly what shows up in the rectangles. However, I will explore copying to a helper cell, deleting the text, and pasting as image-
 then I'd just need to create a textbox (and only have the font properties to adjust) and resize and group to the new image.</p>

    <title>Importing Data &#38; Calculated Fields - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Importing Data &#38; Calculated Fields</h2>
                    <p>Hi Guys,</p>
<p>I am an Access “newbie” so would appreciate some guidance on the best way to address my requirements.</p>
<p>Each morning we generate an Excel report from an on-line system. It contains basic user details such as name, country, e-mail and date. We get a full dataset each morning, not just changes. Currently,
 that dataset is then extended using Excel formulas to calculate some additional details;</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Week – calculated based on date field.</span></li><li><span>Month – calculated based on date field.</span></li><li><span>Year – calculated based on date field.</span></li><li><span>Domain – extracted from the users e-mail address.</span></li><li><span>Partner Membership – if their domain is listed in a separate XLS, then mark the partner field as “Yes” if not, mark as “No”. It is basically an IF and vLookup formula. Happy to move the “source” list of domains to a SharePoint
 2010 list.</span></li><li><span>Type – A series of IF commands. For example, if [Domain] is “abc.com” set value to “Employee”, ElseIF [Partner Membership] = “Yes” set value to “Partner”, ElseIF set value to “Customer”.</span></li><li><span>Region – vLookup to separate XLS. Looks at the country and then returns the corresponding region. For example, if the country was United Kingdom, the region would be EMEA. Happy to move this XLS to a SharePoint list as well.</span>
</li></ul>
<p>I was thinking that the best approach would be to create a table to dump the daily data into and then use calculated fields to generate the additional details – am I heading in the right direction
 or should I be running a macro to generate the details?</p>
<p>I would also love some guidance on the “formulas” I should be using to generate my additional fields.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>First you need to create a database design that can support the requirements. As a good database design it should model real entities. You're saying you're getting "daily basic user details" but your examples are not about users. Maybe membership???</p>
<p>Leave all calculated fields out of your tables. Don't use calculated tables for now.</p>
<p>"Helper" tables will be similar to the Domains list you currently have. I would store it in Access rather than SharePoint, but that's OK too if there are reasons for that.</p>
<p>Calculated fields will be generated in an Access query. For example:<br />
select Month(myDate), Year(myDate) from myTable<br />
This query is then used for (I assume) some reports you are generating on a daily basis.</p>
<p>I feel there is more analysis that needs to get done here, but the above should get you started.<br />

            Hi,
<div><br />
<div>The database is actually for people that have earned a qualification. I get an XLS report each day from the &nbsp; company that administers the program.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The main reason why I would prefer to have the "helper" tables on SharePoint is so that they can be referenced and updated by other people. However, if I need to maintain separate tables in Access, that would be ok.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Could you please provide some guidance on how to reference these "helper" tables in an Access query?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also, if I build a master query that incorporates the new calculated field, I assume that I can then build a sub query that allows me to further filter the data? For example, I would then create a query that only showed people in EMEA.</div>

            I have all the fields setup except for the "Partner Membership" and "Type".
<div><br />
<div>For "Partner Membership" I am currently using IF, INSA and VLOOKUP forums in Excel.</div>

<div>For "Type", it is just a series of IF commands.</div>

            I have now figured out the "Type" field by using a series of IIF statements.

<div>I could really do with some help on the "Partner Membership" field. I need to check to see if the users "Domain" appears in another table and then return a "Yes" or "No".</div>

            <p>Off the cuff you can create a select query like this:</p>
<p>Put the main table and the Domains table on the query grid. Drag-n-drop between the two domain fields from the main table to the Domains table. Right click the resulting line and choose something like "select all from main table and whatever matches in domain
 table."&nbsp; This sets up what's called an "outer join".</p>
<p>Now put tblDomains.Domain on the grid (among other fields). Run the query. Where it is null, it does not exist in the Domains table.</p>

            <div>I don't think I can use the solution you have suggested as there is no "Domain" field in the main table, only a e-mail address.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
So this is what I have done…
<div><br />
<div>Setup 2 queries.</div>
<div><br />
<div>In the first query, I have an expression "Domain: Right([E-mail],Len([E-mail])-InStr([E-mail],"@"))". This allows me to extract domain from the users e-mail address.</div>
<div><br />
<div>In the second query, I have adding in the first query (which now has a field called "Domain") along with my table that lists all the member details including their domain. I have set this up as an "outer join". I added a second field from my member table
 called "Member Name".</div>
<div><br />
<div>I then created a query to set the user type.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Type: IIf([Domain]="mydomain.com","Employee",IIf(IsNull([Member Name]),"Other","Member"))</div>
<div><br />
<div>It all seems to work… Ideally I would like to be able to do everything in one query but I could not figure out how this was possible as I first needed to extract my domain name.</div>

            Junk mail belongs in the Junk Email folder, so the fact that these unwanted messages are being delivered to that folder is proof that the junk filter is working correctly. No amount of fiddling with rules or the blocked sender list will affect that. You
 can't prevent delivery of junk, only control where it gets filed. Junk mail belongs in the Junk Email folder. Ignore it.

            Depends on how many spam lists your address is on. When going through the Junk EMail folder, you don't have to examine each message to determine the false positives. They should be obvious from the sender or subject. A quick skim through the message list
 is all it takes, a task that takes no longer that five minutes once each day.

<p>so "ignore" them, or "skim" through the junk mail on a daily basis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Easier to do if there were an on off button to completely block all junk mails.&nbsp; &nbsp;Anything i receive is on a safe sender list. why should anyone be swamped with porn, pills, casino spam? perhaps some of you are more tolerant but I've reached my limit on

            However much, philosophically, someone might agree with you, I like to deal with things as they are and this is how Outlook.com works. Fortunately, there are multiple free mail services and if one doesn't like or can't deal with the way one works, another
 is always available.

            You can open the email that you want to block. Then on the upper tab click on the "Sweep" you can choose to delete all emails from the inbox and future messages from this sender.

<p>
</p><p>Any data present in a specific cell (ex F35), then current cell (ex C35) returns to calculate =IF formula if true; returns blank (highlighted) cell if false.</p>

<p>
</p><p>=IF(F35="", =if(E35&lt;=E28,"X",""),"")</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I review the function arguments, it displays:</p>
<p>Logical_test: f35 = "" = FALSE</p>
<p>Value_if_true: =if(E35&lt;=E28,"X", "") = INVALID</p>
<p>Value_if_false: "" = ""</p>
<p>
</p><p>The statement that is noted as "invalid" is already being used in other cells and functions properly, so I'm not sure what the problem is.&nbsp; It is used to mark a cell with an "X" if the formula returns a particular date range.</p>
<p>

            Hi BKIMG, your error is you have 2 Equals symbols in your formula . . .
<br />
<br />An IF formula has the following form:
<br />
<br />=IF(condition, do if true, do if false)
<br />
<br />So your formula should look something like this:
<br />
<br />=IF(ISBLANK(F35,"",IF(E35&lt;=E28,"X","")
<br />
<br />or more this will do the same thing:
<br />
<br />=IF(E35&lt;=E28,"X","")       
        </p>

<br />Conditional Formatting was introduced with Excel 97 and is a terrific feature, but there is a limit of 3 conditional sets per cell (like 3 wishes).  Conditional Formatting, while in effect for a cell, will override the text colors that can be produced for numeric values by normal cell formatting.

<h2>            Issue with OneNote for iPad Pro - Entire Page goes blank after handwriting notes</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I seem to have a wierd issue with OneNote for iPad Pro, and I have looked all over the internet but have found no answer yet. Whenever I hand-write something in OneNote and I press the erase button or move the page, the entire page goes blank, even the title.
 Afterwards, if I open and close the sidebars, they start to glitch after a while. One of the solutions to this was to turn off auto-sync attachments, but this does not work with really big notebooks with lots of pictures and handwritten notes and this glitch
 still applies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems to be happening with all of my notebooks in OneNote and this has started a few weeks ago, so maybe it has to do with the app itself. I have also tried to use my iPad as a second display with my Mac and it works fine, but I much prefer not to do
 this for the long term. I do not want to use apps like Outline because I have seen them and they do not have the speed that OneNote does, which is really important to me. I have an iPad Pro 1st Generation with Apple Pencil and Apple Smart Keyboard if that
 helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts?</p>

<p>Hello AndreePin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your suggestion. I took your advice and I checked my OneNote version, but it seems to be at Version 16.8, which was released 2 weeks ago. I have reinstalled the app just to make sure but another thing to mention is that I have also tried to
 reinstall the app and the glitch keeps coming back after some time. It might just have to do with the memory allocation on the software side of iOS 11, but I cannot assume anything just yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently on iOS 11.2.1 and the problem started around the time iOS 11.2 was released, if that helps.<br />
</p>
<p>Again, thank you so much. I will keep the community posted based on the reinstallation of the app.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Issue with Word 16 opening all my Word docs in Read Only mode</h2>
                    Since the latest update of Word (version 16.0.9029.2253 32 bit), all of my Word documents open in Read Only mode.&nbsp; I have made sure that my Preview pane in disabled. I made sure that I unchecked the Read Only box in properties for the folder that has the
 documents.&nbsp; I have gone into the Trust Center of Word and made sure all the boxes in the Protected view are not checked.&nbsp; I have tried everything that I have read online, and none of it seems to work.&nbsp; I have tried to open the file directly and also through
 Word, but the results are the same.&nbsp; I am getting frustrated because this issue did not happen until the latest update, and if I am going to pay $69.99/per year I want a product that works. &nbsp;&nbsp;

That does not work either.&nbsp; I can unclick the Read-only box in Properties, but it will still open in Read-only.&nbsp; Here is an example:</p>

<p>Hi Brian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may find that when you are opening files, they open as read-only. In some cases, this is for added security, such as when you are opening files from the internet, and other times, it can be due to a setting that can be changed. To resolve your concern,
 we suggest that you repair your Office application. Kindly refer to this <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            What is WSTPager.ax&#63; And is it harmful&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 8 Home version, and I found a suspicious file named&nbsp;WSTPager.ax in C:/Windows/System32 folder. &nbsp;I did a web search and found out that it is a malware file used for fraud and taking over a computer. &nbsp;I deleted the file from my computer. &nbsp;I
 did a task manager search to see if it was running visibly, but I didn't see anything. &nbsp;After I rebooted, I noticed my entire computer's folders' links are not responding; as if all of my folders' links are web links and the javascript is not working for me
 to click on links. &nbsp;Also, my Windows Defender is now disabled, and I am unable to click SAVE to enable it in the Defender Settings menu. &nbsp;Just so you know, before I deleted that&nbsp;WSTPager.ax file, My Windows Defender was "up to date" and working fine. &nbsp;The
 quick scan I did when I initially turned on my computer turned up no harmful files. &nbsp;Why isn't Windows Defender detecting this harmful file&nbsp;WSTPager.ax? &nbsp;It is obvious my entire computer is compromised hackers. &nbsp;Just so you know, I found that file because
 I tried using WSreset to fix an issue with my Windows Store not loading so I could do the Windows 8.1 free update. &nbsp;I got an error message saying I didn't have proper access to use the WSReset. &nbsp;I looked in the security tab and my self &nbsp;along with Users have
 proper modify access. </p>

            <p>There is legitimate Windows file with exact the same name (WSTPager.ax) which is safe. If you believe a file is infected, you shouldn't just delete but instead you should use trusted malware removal tools like safety scanner or Windows Defender to remove
 it and in this case, if you are not sure whether the files I safe or not, you should submit it to Microsoft Malware Protection for analysis:</p>

<div>I am trying to do a table plan for a poker tournament.

<h2>            We have a library of knowledge, that just like an Artificial Intelligence Improves based on our interactions.</h2>
                    <p>Its amazing how much you can learn in 20 secs or sooner, if you actually took the effort to search the key words of the exact topic you were pondering on. &nbsp;In our cases we all are very creative, business oriented, were poets, artists. Social media communicators,
 just trying to make a voice speak out inbetween all the chatter, hoping that your idea, your dreams, and your wishful thinking just got a glimpse of enjoyment, the same feeling you get, as you commit to the act. &nbsp;Its very amazing to me, how Interacting with
 a group of people who take the time and effort to evaluate conversations, and create a similar or better idea that totally syncs with you( me) etc. Interacting with Microsoft has me very interested , on top of being mysteriously manipulated by my own demise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to being involved with a program like this, you find yourself learning about yourself and about the updates, it has you searching for solutions, and coming up with reviews that could in the long run be acknowledged and next thing you knkow
 it your creating more. I am very excited for whats next .&nbsp;</p>
<p>Improvement. Performance, Optimzation, speed. and being able to unleash a potential in a piece of technology &nbsp;you had no clue wa ale to do that, it inspires you to gather that idea and make it yours, so that way you can tink on it and make it yours. &nbsp;I have
 a lot to learn still when ti comes to specifications. I really only know the basics. That still doesnt stop me from fixing it myself, until i get help to get a better understanding.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Question about setting event reminder in Outlook app for Android - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cmih1964  say:</h3>
<h2>            Question about setting event reminder in Outlook app for Android</h2>
                    Well, I'm not sure where to post this question. &nbsp;None of the category options seem to apply to the Office Android app. &nbsp;I recently switched from a Windows phone to an Android phone. I installed the Outlook app and it synced with my Outlook (Hotmail) account.
 &nbsp;My Windows phone allowed me to set event reminders of up to one week. &nbsp;For events in my Outlook Calendar which already existed at the time I installed the Outlook app and for which I had already set a one week reminder, the one week reminder still remains
 in effect and it shows up in the Outlook app as one week. However, for any new events I add using Outlook app I can set a reminder of at most
<strong><em>one </em></strong><strong><em>hour</em></strong>. &nbsp;Is there any way of setting a reminder of more than one hour in this Android app? I can sign in to my Hotmail account and update set event reminders of up to two weeks, but I'd rather not have to
 do that. &nbsp;Is this just a limitation of the Outlook Android app? &nbsp;Thanks.

            So, I'm assuming that the option to add event reminders greater than one hour (and to get support for such questions) is reserved for 365 subscribers. Fair enough. As is said, "You get what you pay for." (You hope you get at least that.)<br />

<p>Failing that, open the run window, &lt;Win R&gt;, and run word suppressing addons by typing: Winword.exe /a</p>
<p>Take a look and see if that fixes it. If it does, one of your addins is acting up. You will have to decide which you can live without, the addin or the page count.</p>
<p>You can control addins individually: Office button / Word Options button / Add-ins option</p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I will be glad to help you with the issue you have with Outlook. I understand the frustration when things don't work the way it should.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please answer the following&nbsp;for us to assist you better:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. What is the browser you are working on?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Do you have the same issue on all the browsers?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3.&nbsp;Did you make any changes&nbsp;to the account prior to the issue?&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I suggest you to reset your browser and check if you are using Internet Explorer. Please follow the below link to know how to rest the browser.</span></span></p>
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/reset-ie-settings#ie=ie-11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 170, 1)"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/reset-ie-settings#ie=ie-11</span></span></a><span>
</span>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Note:
</span><span>The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might reset security settings or privacy settings that you added to the list of Trusted Sites. The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might also reset parental control settings.
 We recommend that you note these sites before you use the Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature. Resetting Internet Explorer isn't reversible, and all previous settings are lost after reset.</span></span></p>
