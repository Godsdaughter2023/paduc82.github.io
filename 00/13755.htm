<p>Hi walter paul:</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is your Windows operating system and what version of MS Excel are you using?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your previous posts indicate you have a Win 10 computer but you've posted your question in the Windows Vista board.&nbsp; We can ask the forum moderators to move your question to a different board for better exposure if necessary.</p>

    <title>Google Chrome Critical Error Red Screen - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Google Chrome Critical Error Red Screen</h2>
                    <p>I had the google chrome critical error red screen while browsing the weather station in the google chrome browser today. I've included a screen shot. I had to use task master to log off as clicking the red x to close was inoperative. It appears the hacker
 was trying to hold me ransom! This is the first time in a very long period I’ve experienced any problem with google chrome. I deleted the browser history, etc. and ran CC CLEANER. It has not appeared since. It never showed up in MSE, no warning or quarantine.
 Is the google chrome critical error red screen something to be concerned about as far my computer system is concerned?</p>
<p>Another concern is this Trojan:JS/Flafisi.C and Trojan:JS/Flafisi.D <span>&nbsp;</span>that
<span>&nbsp;</span>show up 2x to 4x daily while I’m surfing the internet. I have been using ie11 and surfing yahoo internet for 3 to 4 years and have only seen MSE detect and quarantine other threats only 4 or 5 times in the past. MSE is now detecting and quarantine

 Trojan:JS/Flafisi.C and/or Trojan:JS/Flafisi.D&nbsp;malware much more often. I have informed the Microsoft community about the Trojan:JS/Flafisi.C and/or Trojan:JS/Flafisi.D&nbsp; a few days ago.
</p>
<p>I use both ie11 and google chrome browsers for different applications and surfing the internet. Does anybody know why there has been a substantial increase in malware, threats, viruses, etc. in the past few months?</p>
<p>Thank-You</p>

<p><span>This is a template that’s being used for different browsers, and I’m still seeing it, along with the fake Adobe Flash Player update (Trojan:JS/Flafisi.D) on the MSN news portal in Edge:</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>We’re almost certain now that this is the handiwork of a very widespread malvertising campaign, but why no one seems to have picked up on it yet is a mystery to me. These recurring detections are easy to explain if we assume that the attack vector
 is a compromised advertising domain – because the compromised domain gets another chance to deliver one of these malware-site redirects every time it gets reconnected to the host site, and we can thus explain these repeated attacks without postulating the
 presence of any persistent malware:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>And in fact, many of us have actually been able to manage this issue by just installing an ad-blocker extension like uBlock Origin&nbsp;</span><span>–</span><span> which selectively prevents any suspect advertising domains from connecting to the host site.
 Although uBlock Origin also includes some granular script-blocking features, I’ve been able to manage the issue here with just the domain-blocking features that are enabled “out of the box”. Ad-blocker extensions for Edge are available directly from the Edge

<p>For anyone that is interested, I was not so really all that concerned by this page appearing, I was more amused at how bad it looked and more interested to find out how it got there.&nbsp; Everything I found pointed to an amateur (like really amateur) operation.&nbsp;
 However, I was interested how the code managed to compromise the windows UI (so you couldn't close the window) and also decided to investigate whether it was locally generated (from an existing nasty on the system) or if it would have been 'sent' from an outside
 server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to avoid having everyone zone out, I will skip the details of how I investigated and just go to what I found.&nbsp; Feel free to ask me about any part if you wish.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. This page was SENT to the browser, in my specific case I was able to trace the event to a .onmouseclick -&gt; http post get req sent -&gt; SERVER fires back the evil RED window as a popup class.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Since some server somewhere was obviously hosting this garbage I decided to track them down and let them know.&nbsp; Seemed like it would most be a compromised, otherwise respectable system, or a dedicated server somewhere that must be behind several proxy
 or other such barriers.&nbsp; However, what I did find seemed like it was so amateur that I had to check more than once out of disbelief. &nbsp; The RED WARNING page is pretty much a mishmash of 'borrowed' code and I could find had no potential for serious security
 threats.&nbsp; Simply launch the task manager and terminate the process. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally I called their name registrar to get the account banned (obvous violation of any TOS) but after 30 minutes on the phone and getting absolutely no where - "maybe you should contact microsoft" they say!</p>
<p>I gave up but here's all the info:</p>

<p><span>We appreciate your efforts here DMacG. These Tech Support Scam pages have traditionally locked up browsers by looping a JavaScript modal alert (dialog loop), which prevents the focus from being returned to the browser – although many of the newer scam
 pages loop through multiple elements. We’re calling what you’re describing a “malware-site redirect”, meaning that the MSN news portal page (for example) is being redirected to a malware domain by a redirect that gets piped in through a compromised “advertising”
 channel (thus the term “malvertising”). I can see this most clearly by monitoring/blocking MSN’s domain connections with uBlock Origin.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>But now we’re getting reports that uBlock Origin isn’t filtering out some of these fake Adobe Flash Player update pages (</span><span>Trojan:JS/Flafisi.D</span><span>), and I’m wondering if you can determine whether these redirects are in fact standard
 JavaScript redirects that could potentially be filtered with uBlock Origin’s script or frame filters. I’m out of my element here, and would appreciate any insight on the nature of these redirects, and any suggestions on how we should customize uBlock Origin
 in the event that the default domain/request blocking settings fail to block these malvertising “threats”.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I do understand that the threat from these Tech Support Scam pages is mostly just that unsuspecting users might be scammed. But what we’re seeing most often, at least on the MSN news portal, is the fake Adobe Flash Player update malvertising template
 – and the most recent analysis of the FlashPlayer.hta program indicates that it’s a complex double-downloader that could easily be adapted to any kind of payload, including ransomware:
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><a href="https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/kovter-group-malvertising-campaign-exposes-millions-potential-malware-and-fraud" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/kovter-group-malvertising-campaign-exposes-millions-potential-malware-and-fraud</span></a>
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So I’m personally convinced that any of the affected high-profile portals need to be cleaned up ASAP. There are just too many unsuspecting users out there, many of them on PCs with older OSs, weak AV apps, and no ad-blockers. A local moderator did
 try to escalate this issue directly to Microsoft, but to no avail. So unless some internet security analytics team suddenly picks up on this current campaign, the only way that we’ll ever be able to sound the alarm is by reporting the high-profile host sites
 themselves as “unsafe”, which is exactly what I’m doing at this point. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I’m afraid that the SmartScreen reporting system was designed strictly for reporting a single malicious domain – which is pointless with these malvertising attacks, because the malware page itself is continually being reassigned to a newly-registered
 domain. And since the SmartScreen filter doesn’t seem to be smart enough to associate the host domain with the malicious domain, it looks like reporting the host domain as “unsafe” will be the only possible way to flag this issue for site owners. This is actually
 pretty easy to do with most of these redirects (including the Tech Support Scam pages, from what I’ve seen). In Edge, click on
<strong>Settings &gt; Send Feedback &gt; Report Unsafe Site</strong> to report the malware domain&nbsp;– and then just click the browser
<strong>page-back arrow</strong> to return to the host page – and report as "unsafe":

<p>I haven't had much time to do any real good research yet but since you were kind enough to give me such an informative reply I thought I would share what I did find so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided to do a little review of windows event logs (always such fun!) to see what, if any, events had been triggered.&nbsp; I'm sure you already know that most browser activity is relatively segregated from the main OS for obvious reasons - so imagine my surprise
 to find out that there was a flurry of recorded events under 'Applications &amp; Services -&gt;Microsoft -&gt; Windows -&gt; Windows Defender -&gt; Operational'</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the 'fraud page' was loaded by Chrome it created a small cache file as would be expected, but that cache file was immediately recognized by a component of Windows Defender which automatically uploaded it to microsoft AND didn't bother to notify me or
 even create a record in Defender itself.&nbsp; Further even logs show that exactly 14 seconds after microsoft received my file it activated the Dynamic Signature Service to retrieve additional signatures, which it adds to the system "standard" library.&nbsp; A total
 of 18 new signature updates were created and compiled, timestamped only 2 seconds before they were sent to me, all marked with a version number of 0.0.0.0.&nbsp; Then it was all over. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, it would seem that microsoft is indeed at least interested in this issue.&nbsp; Unfortunately I don't have access to anything more than this metadata because I would have to set up some targeted low level monitoring tools before the event took place.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The real challenge for me right now is finding a way to intentionally cause another event.&nbsp; Do you have any information on that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, my comments regarding the "fraud page" being a total amateur piece of garbage was really meant to say that there appeared to be a mismatch between that and the sophistication of the 'attack'.&nbsp; You are quite right that, while you or I may be hard targets,
 there are many other users that are at real risk.&nbsp; I see a serious cause for concern here: as you pointed out the end user assumption that a high level domain such as msn.com is 'safe', add to that a more sophisticated
<span>(ie. perceived as legitimate) redirect&nbsp; - NOT GOOD.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>I would really like a chance to analyse the code involved to get a better idea of the mechanics involved before I were to speculate on an effective method for dealing with this issue.&nbsp; I just don't know enough to say anything useful.</span></p>

<p>As I've mentioned to Greg already, nothing that either of you have found is surprising, since Microsoft obviously knew about these attacks or their ability to head off the more directly malicious versions wouldn't exist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The questions that DMacG has brought up relating to the ability&nbsp;to repeat the attack are precisely what interested me most, since I've not only not been bothered by these due to my use of ad blocking, but had still been unable to experience any&nbsp;even once
 I'd removed both this and several other security settings I'd thought might interfere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That has made me even more interested in any indications&nbsp;as to&nbsp;why I might not encounter these and also why the apparent inability for Yahoo, Microsoft and other major websites to stop them completely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first question I'd already at least partially answered to my satisfaction, though I've found even more detailed information relating to the targeting of such campaigns that's far more revealing.&nbsp; For example, though this following article is focused
 on attacks via Facebook, it's very interesting to see how the types of data Facebook has can be used to target&nbsp;such ads and also to protect them&nbsp;from those like us who might be attempting to investigate&nbsp;the campaigns.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-03-27/ad-scammers-need-suckers-and-facebook-helps-find-them" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-03-27/ad-scammers-need-suckers-and-facebook-helps-find-them</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The most in depth technical&nbsp;discussion I've seen of both this and the reasons for the change from exploit kits to forced redirection are covered in the following article, which also discusses the 28 fake ad agencies they discovered being used to deliver
 malvertising campaigns in 2017.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://blog.confiant.com/uncovering-2017s-largest-malvertising-operation-b84cd38d6b85" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Uncovering 2017’s Largest Malvertising Operation</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So my own suspicion continues to be that Microsoft and Yahoo are fully aware of these campaigns and are simply using them to collect and collate the data required to identify and eventually involve law enforcement in the countries required in order to truly
 shut the perpetrators down for good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a side note DMacG,&nbsp;your thought&nbsp;that the "fraud page" was a total amateur piece of garbage, by which I assume you mean its badly worded and formatted appearance, is typically intentional.&nbsp; That's done to serve as an additional&nbsp;filter to keep more intelligent
 individuals from ever responding via phone.&nbsp; The reason is to avoid wasting the time of the often not highly capable telemarketing people initially answering the phone and operating via script.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rob</p>
<p>
</p><p>&lt; EDIT &gt; As an aside, another suspicion I have relating to the targeting of these campaigns is that the articles being read may trend toward what might be considered&nbsp;conservative items.&nbsp; This may just be a side effect of other more specific targeting, but
 I'd be curious if that's something either of you might confirm?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also DMacG, the most dependable method to experience these popups is browsing the types of websites where you might expect to be attacked, such as the seedier&nbsp;portions of the net.&nbsp; However, these are probably more related to other specific campaigns that
 were known to target these less reputable zones in the past and so wouldn't necessarily&nbsp;provide the same attack profile.</p>

<p><span><span>Of course some of us no longer need to venture out into the hinterlands to study these malware-site redirects – because they’re being delivered to our doorstep every day right along with the morning news. So the first thing to try would be just
 opening an MSN news page and then waking away for 15 minutes. That’s usually enough for me.
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Important Warning!</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">
</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Visiting the MSN news portal will be at your own risk, and these risks include, but are not limited to, being exposed to malware, Tech Support Scams, and crypto mining attacks.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I don’t have the time for stories or speculations, but I was happy to learn from the Confiant article that other people have also been focusing on these forced redirects, and I was frankly amazed to learn that Chrome had already implemented anti-redirect
 protection. So I’m guessing that a significant migration is already underway; and goodness knows how long it will take the Edge Team to figure this one out, and how long they’ll be playing catch-up. In the meantime though, maybe we can take a closer look at
 the nature of this forced redirect beast and see what configuration changes for </span>
<span>uBlock Origin </span><span>might be helpful in cases where the preconfigured domain/request blocking isn’t enough to prevent them.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2017/11/expanding-user-protections-on-web.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">https://blog.chromium.org/2017/11/expanding-user-protections-on-web.html</span></a>
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Looking a little deeper into the Confiant research confirmed my suspicions that these forced redirects are indeed essentially just simple JavaScript redirects, where<span>&nbsp;
</span>window.top.location</span><span style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)"> </span><span>= "http://whatever.com" can be set from a cross-domain advertising iframe:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><a href="https://blog.confiant.com/how-bad-ads-hijack-your-browser-with-one-simple-trick-712ad3590a13" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">https://blog.confiant.com/how-bad-ads-hijack-your-browser-with-one-simple-trick-712ad3590a13</span></a>
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So this made me wonder if uBlock Origin’s frame blocking option might be something to try in cases where the preconfigured domain/request blocking isn’t effective in preventing the malware-site redirects. And reading this uBlock Origin support document
 convinced me that I was probably on the right track:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dynamic-filtering:-Benefits-of-blocking-3rd-party-iframe-tags" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dynamic-filtering:-Benefits-of-blocking-3rd-party-iframe-tags</span></a>
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>This document specifically refers to the Proofpoint analysis that I had already adopted as the “standard model” for these forced redirects to the fake Adobe Flash Player update page in my original thread on this malvertising issue:
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><a href="https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/kovter-group-malvertising-campaign-exposes-millions-potential-malware-and-fraud" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/kovter-group-malvertising-campaign-exposes-millions-potential-malware-and-fraud</span></a>
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_defender-protect_scanning-windows_10/im-seeing-trojanjsflafisid-detections-and-tech/8fbe8eaf-1af0-4e76-9ab0-57828f631a5f"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_defender-protect_scanning-windows_10/im-seeing-trojanjsflafisid-detections-and-tech/8fbe8eaf-1af0-4e76-9ab0-57828f631a5f</span></a>
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So I’m going to provisionally recommend the frame blocking option for add-on protection in cases where uBlock Origin doesn’t consistently block malicious redirects – but of course I'll still be anxious for any further information or suggestions that
 you can provide, DMacG.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>But the evening news is much better, since Microsoft has just answered my original thread – and hopefully returned it to its intended purpose of reporting these malvertising incidents. So my question – which was really just “doesn’t anybody care” has
 now been answered with a resounding “YES”. And I feel like a party here – which of course for me is just pineapple upside-down cake and premium coffee. When I look at the domain connections now, everything is suddenly “green”, so it does look like they’ve
 cleaned things up. HOWEVER, my MSN news test page that was running in the background just now crashed the Edge browser, so I’m afraid you’re right about “more work to be done”. The page for that one was:</span></p>

                    After installing the latest updates to Windows 10, I am no longer able to check for updates. I just get the endless string of dots that never go anywhere. I tried running the FixIt tool, which said it found and fixed an error of some registry keys being
 corrupted. I rebooted and retried, but it had no effect. I then went an did the elevated command prompt instructions but that didn't solve the problem either. I need a fix as I don't really want to reset or restore my system.

<h2>            OneNote not working without being signed in</h2>
                    <p>I use my Surface Pro 3 at work to make notes during meetings.&nbsp; I use the OneNote App.&nbsp; My office does not have wifi so I do not have an Internet connection for my tablet.&nbsp; This has never been a problem before, but about 2 weeks ago I was not able to open
 the OneNote app because I could not log in without an Internet connect.&nbsp; When I went home I logged in and everything was fine.&nbsp; I went back to work and my OneNote worked just fine without being connected to the Internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today it happened again but with a slight twist. I was able to open a new section&nbsp;in my OneNote App and even made some notes.&nbsp; I opened up a new page after taking a short break.&nbsp; I was able to do a little writing and took a break.&nbsp; When I went to continue
 with my notes it would not work and it required me to sign in.&nbsp; My page went a dark grey and there was a box in the middle of the screen saying that I needed to be logged-in ( I wish I wrote down exactly what it said).&nbsp; I got home&nbsp;just a little while ago and
 it is now working just fine because I was able to log in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know why this is happening and more importantly how to stop it.&nbsp; Simply put why, on some occasions will OneNote require me to log in via the internet (and I guess access my OneDrive) in order for it to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I love my Surface Pro 3 and OneNote and depend on them almost daily</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

            Can someone from Microsoft provide an answer to this post? I am having the exact same issue as Dennis. I really depend on my notes in OneNote at work. I have a Surface Pro 4 and like Dennis, it used to work well until recently.

            Hello,<br />
<br />
Good to have you here. Are you using the pre-installed OneNote app that comes with Windows 10? Or, the one with licensed version of Microsoft Office (2013/2016/365)?<br />
<br />
To help you out, you can check Deepika Gowda's suggestion on this <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/apps_windows_10-winapps/unable-to-access-onenote-offline-on-windows-10/bf2ad24b-3f53-4936-8510-3868513dc05f">

            Are you using Lion? Office 2004 will not work in Lion. <br />
<br />
IF you just dumped the office2008 folder in Trash and emptied. You could not have done more wrong.<br />
with 2008 and 2004 they have an uninstall Program.&nbsp; You still have to go int application support and and remove items if left.<br />
<br />
Report back with more details.<br />

<p>Hi David</p>
<p>
</p><p>Made a quick internet search on that error. Found 2 interesting threads (Power BI &amp; Power Query follow the same route re. DB connections):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://community.powerbi.com/t5/Integrations-with-Files-and/odbc-error-quot-Restricted-data-type-attribute-violation-quot/td-p/53943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">odbc error "Restricted data type attribute violation"</a></li><li><a href="https://community.powerbi.com/t5/Issues/DataSource-Error-ODBC-ERROR-07006-Oracle-ODBC-Restricted-data/idi-p/112708/page/2#comments" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">DataSource.Error: ODBC: ERROR [07006] [Oracle][ODBC]Restricted data type attribute
 violation</a></li></ul>
<p>No idea if a robust solution now exists for this obviously known issue but the above threads talk about a workaround that some people successfully implemented...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps</p>

<h2>            Outlook Android App - iCal Feed Setup</h2>
                    I am unable to view an iCal feed in the calendar on the Outlook app that is visible in Outlook.com. Is this possible? I presently have a primary calendar on Outlook.com that syncs as my primary calendar in Outlook 2010. I have set both up to sync with
 each other and that works. So far, so good. But I have an iCal feed that appears in Outlook 2010 (as a separate calendar that can be overlaid) and in the Outlook.com system. (I had to set these up separately.) The overlay of the iCal feed at Outlook.com doesn't
 work great, but does work sometimes. In any case, I can't find a way to get the iCal feed calendar to appear in the calendar on the app. Anyway to do this. I'd like all of the iCal feed information to appear in the calendar on the app.

            <p>Thanks for this advice. I went a bit further and was ultimately able to solve the problem. I uninstalled the Outlook app, but also went into the phone settings and purged the cache for the app. Reinstalled the app. Reconnected with Outlook.com. Still no
 luck. I went into Settings, then clicked on the email for the account, and noticed at the bottom it said, "if you are having sync issue with this account, you can try refreshing its data." Hit the Refresh Account button and all my default calendar entries
 showed up almost immediately. However, not the second iCal account info. I found that in the app in the Calendar section if I clicked on the upper right menu and on default calendar, it showed my default and the other iCal calendar, but the iCal entries still
 weren't showing. However, when I clicked the upper left menu it showed the iCal calendar as being off. Turned it to on and it works now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the guidance. With that and some tinkering it now works.</p>

<h2>            LG KS20 can not synchronize with my computer</h2>
                    My&nbsp;LG KS20, WM6.0 can not synchronize with my computer.<br />
<br />
I know what's the problem but I can not resolve it.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Start --&gt; Setting --&gt; Connect ---&gt; USB to PC&nbsp;&nbsp; (I hope my description is correct, my PPC display Chinese)<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I should choose the option of "USB ActiveSync" without choosing the box of "enable advanced network&nbsp;function " (?, I just translate it into English according to Chinese tag). Otherwise my PPC can&nbsp;not be synchronized<br />
&nbsp;<br />
But every time after I delete the choosing of advanced network function, I can not save it and will encounter a error message saying "the setting is not actived, un-plug USB wire and try again".&nbsp; But whatever the USB wire is plug in nor not same message will
 be shown.<br />
<br />
I performed "hard reset" with install whole WM 6.1 in my PPC,&nbsp;then I can disable&nbsp;the advanced network function option, but days later same situation occur again.<br />
<br />
Anybody know how does it happen and how to resolve it?

            So are you saying that if you UNCHECK the Advanced Network Functionality, it will not save?<br />
<br />
Before the device is connected, uncheck that option, click OK then soft reset your device.&nbsp; Check it to see it it is still unchecked.

<p>Thanks, Jack</p>
<p>&nbsp;You're right, I can not save it after uncheck the Advanced Network Functionality.<br />
</p>
<p>If I uncheck that option, click OK, then I would get a error message which can not be closed, I&nbsp;soft reset my&nbsp;device directly, after my device booting&nbsp;the option is unchecked, but&nbsp;device still can not synchronize with my computer.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
and, &nbsp;I tried as this way: soft reset my device ---&gt; get into setting and try to uncheck (without pluging in USB&nbsp;wire)----&gt; click OK. But still show me the error message saying it does not work, need me unplug USB and try again.<br />
<br />
Any other way to resolve it?<br />

            Interesting ... not sure why that is happening.<br />
<br />
So, when you hard reset before and had advanced network functionality unchecked, were you able to connect and sync for a while?

            hi m8, had the same problem. I didn't have problems with windows xp, but it was impossible to link the phone in win vista. The device was allways recognized as standard and not like LG KS20 and windows mobile center never sinchronized.<br />
<br />
My solution was uninstall all windows mobile center things, turn off firewall and make all the proccess again with the firewall down (install again windows mobile center and link the phone), then i could make the connection, the device was recognized and the
 windows mobile center started the sinchronization.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />
Don't know if this is exactly your problem, but try it.<br />
<br />
Good luck.

    <title>Fonts appear bold in IE when they&#39;re not supposed to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robertfaber  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fonts appear bold in IE when they&#39;re not supposed to</h2>
                    <p>I've recently bought a new computer, which like the old one runs Windows 7. I'm now encountering a problem I didn't have on the old computer and have never had before, everytime I visit a web page in Internet Explorer 9&nbsp;that uses Arial as a font (which includes
 Bing, Wikipedia, and ironically this very page as well) the text that isn't supposed to be bold does appear bold. Italic text works fine, and doesn't become bold italic. Whether this occurs with other fonts I do not know, Arial is the only one thus far that
 I've seen the problem occur with, even though I realise it's sometimes difficult to visually distinguish between fonts that look very much alike, so it might occur in Arial-like fonts too.</p>
<p>Normally one would expect this to be a problem in Windows, but the Arial font looks completely right in the Windows\Fonts folder, and any other program has no problem correctly rendering the font. Internet Explorer is the only program in which the problem
 occurs. I don't know if it also occured in IE8, as the first thing I did with my new computer&nbsp;was update to IE9. I've done all the things one does in this kind of situation, I've rebooted the computer and reset IE9, neither of which worked.</p>
<p>I'd be very much pleased if somebody could help me with this, as while it is not a major problem, it is quite a bit of a nuisance, and clearly not the way it should be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Insufficient Skype Credit - cannot call Skype - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ullalaaksonen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Insufficient Skype Credit - cannot call Skype</h2>
                    I tried to call my husband with Skype. I had no Skype credit. I put there 10 Euro. Still the system does not contact to his Skype but says "Insufficient Skype Credit". This is a lie, I do have. I could contact his phone with Skype, but not to Skype.<br />
<br />
He can call me with Skype.<br />
we can send text messages with Skype.<br />
<br />
What to do?<br />
<br />
BTW, the method to get any help is not acceptable. It is very difficult to find a question answer forum. Also the menus for selecting the questions is not made by professional people. This question is not there available, However i can see that many people
 have the same question or near the same.<br />
<br />
The same problem persists, if I use mobile or PC. I have installed all newest versions of Skype and Windows updates.

</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Did you receive a confirmation email from Skype regarding your purchase? Can you please double check the Skype Name of the account that has the
 Skype Credit? Most likely the Skype Credit is on a different Skype account. </span>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>"<span> Can you please double check the Skype Name of the account that has the Skype Credit? Most likely the Skype Credit is on a different Skype account.
</span>"<br />
<br />
I am using for this purpose only one Skype account.<br />
<br />
I tested it in the following sequence:<br />
<br />
1. Verified the balance on the said account<br />
<br />
It showed €9.77. (earlier there was 10.00, but I lost .23 to Microsoft/ Skype when I tested a call to a landline.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0b9d6f18-11bf-4af5-a414-07a36e7d01e3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0b9d6f18-11bf-4af5-a414-07a36e7d01e3" /></a></p>
<p>Then I called definitely the Skype, not the landline. I took the pic with a camera:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2c7e3988-c690-443a-8cd8-1fd26ada959f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2c7e3988-c690-443a-8cd8-1fd26ada959f" /></a><br />
<br />
And the result is wrong, "no sufficient Skype credit."<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/acc3f2e4-ffde-482d-86d2-76ff153124ec" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/acc3f2e4-ffde-482d-86d2-76ff153124ec" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I used all the time the same Skype account. So Skype is wrong.<br />

<h2>            Docmd.transferspreadsheet command in VBA drops records</h2>
                    This is driving me insane. &nbsp;Using a VBA process, I import a spreadsheet to a table, add a column to the end, and populate that column for each record. I also have a predefined query that takes certain fields from that table and sorts them as I need it
 (no grouping). &nbsp;I then have, at the end of the VBA process, a docmd.transferspreadsheet command that exports the query results to a worksheet in an Excel 2010 workbook. &nbsp;What's absolutely maddening is that the transfer seems to be dropping records. &nbsp;For instance,
 if I execute the predefined query on this week's data, I get 74 records. &nbsp;When I look at the export results, however, I only have 65. &nbsp;There does not appear to be any rhyme or reason to which records the export is dropping. &nbsp;Any ideas?

<h2>            Highlighter during PowerPoint presentation not functioning correctly</h2>
                    When I use the highlighter pointer in presentation mode, my highlights get overlayed by a black box. When I save the inking and go back to edit mode it appears as just the highlight colour. This happens when running the presentation on my PC or laptop
 screen! I tried repairing my Office 365 installation but it did not fix the issue! How can I fix this issue?

<h2>            Retrieving deleted mail from junk folder</h2>
                    This is a long shot but is it possible to retrieve emails that were deleted out of the junk folder a while ago - up to a year? Just dawned on my now that an email I was expecting may accidentally have ended up in junk. Many thanks

            <p>Hi steviemoffat,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you would like to recover the deleted messages on your Junk folder. Please be informed that the emails on your Junk folder&nbsp;are cleaned out periodically same with the Deleted folder. You can use the auto restore option of your mailbox in
 recovering the emails. Refer to the article below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/outlook/recover-deleted-messages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><font color="#0000ff">Restore deleted email messages in Outlook.com</font></span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are unable to recover the emails that you're looking for, it means that the emails are purged from the system and can no longer be recovered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps and clarifies your issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

<h2>            Merge fields not working in Office 365</h2>
                    I'm an instructor at a college and I often teach the same course either in following terms or following years. Because of this I use an Excel file containing the quarter, due dates etc... to merge with a Word document and produce the new syllabus without
 the necessity to re-type it all. Some of the variable data is contained in the header of the Word document. Always before this has merged perfectly. However, with Office 365 this appears no longer to work. Is there a fix or something for this?

<h2>            BBC iPlayer Radio App on 950XL</h2>
                    <p>Good afternoon all,&nbsp;I have a Lumia 950XL and it is refusing to launch the BBC iPlayer Radio app. I've uninstalled and reinstalled and the problem persists. I launch it, I see the initial BBC screen, then the dots, then very very briefly the page of stations
 before it&nbsp;crashes back to the screen I launched it from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas anyone please?</p>
<p>

            <p>I'm in the US Neil and cannot see a BBC iPlayer Radio app&nbsp; in the store. Possibly because I am not in the UK and it is not offered. I was able to use IE and play the iPlayer from their website. It worked fine on my 950XL.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I did see an iRadio Player by ANDREI PIKHTIN. Is this what you are using?</p>
<p>I installed and it seemed to work fine. I was not able to listen to sports live. There was some restriction which I assume was my location. Overall it worked well for the 10-15 minutes I tried it on different stations.
</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>There was a glitch listening to a few that seemed to try to load continuously but backing out and reloading seemed to do the trick and the station that was not working began to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you in the UK?</p>

            <p>Many thanks for this Jack a workaround at least as I hadn't seen that app before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am in the UK and yes you're probably right that you wouldn't be able to see this official BBC App there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The BBC apps are advert and in game purchase free of course as is the BBC itself which is the attraction of those.</p>

            <p>Great news Neil ... I am sure you will like it. Another one I do use a lot is TuneIn Radio.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use it on my Surface Pro 4 and my Windows 950XL ...&nbsp;It is awesome! Check it out, I think you will like it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: It does have ads but when I listen on my device the screen is not on or I'm working on another app so it is not an annoyance.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If my posts helped you out I would be appreciative if you marked them as an answer.</p>

            <p>All solved, the BBC are doing away with&nbsp; their APPs (certainly the windows versions) as you can now play the stations and TV shows from&nbsp;your Browser so there is no need for the APPs.</p>

<p>I have a laptop running macOS Mojave and a desktop running windows 10. Both computers have Microsoft 365 installed. Both Outlook instances have 4-5 email accounts connected. Outlook on my mac has an "All Accounts" tab in the sidebar with an "Inbox" folder
 below it containing all the mail from all my email accounts. My windows computer doesn't, and I can't find how to get an equivalent setup on this computer. How can I do so?</p>

<br />Outlook for windows does not (yet) have a unified inbox option. You can use Instant search to create one though - and use a macro to automate it.

<h2>            Microsoft Excel Mobile</h2>
                    I was sent an ASUS Vivo stick PC, at work, to connect to our conference room TV monitor. &nbsp;It came loaded with Office Mobile. &nbsp;My question revolves around the included features in this version of MS Office. &nbsp;Specifically, it appears that the mobile version
 appears not to include a status bar, usually found at the bottom of an Office app's window. &nbsp;Is this correct? &nbsp;If so, is there any way to add the status bar or, otherwise to expand the View menu so I can better customize the viewing area - need to be able
 to view the entire spreadsheet on screen - this is for an active wallboard for use in a call center.

<p>Hi Daniel,<br />
<br />
When using an Excel Mobile app, it doesn't have some of the features that are available on the Excel Desktop version. However, you could raise this to our Excel Team as a feedback using our
<strong><a href="https://excel.uservoice.com/forums/304939-excel-for-android" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Excel Suggestion Box</a></strong> so that they could find a way to add this feature to the Excel Mobile app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance.</p>
