            Yes, this is the updated version I am using. My computer is brand new. The file type loaded into WMM was wmv. I have tried saving the file using recommended settings, high def, for computer use, and for email and none of these seem to work. I even let
 it sit over night trying to save and it never moved off the 1% mark. &nbsp;I have clicked on the save file icon on the tool bar, and also going through the file save area. I have tried changing the file extension to see if that would work. Nothing is working.&nbsp;

<p><span>Hi
<span>jewells67,<br />
<br />
</span></span><span>This might be due to one of the following reasons:<br />
<br />
-</span><span>System resources<br />
-</span><span>Unsupported media files<br />
-</span><span>Outdated VGA card driver<br />
-</span><span>Missing or incorrect Video/Audio codecs
<br />
<br />
</span><span>Please refer to the steps below for further assistance.<br />
<br />
1. </span><b><span>System resources -
</span></b><span>The more you add to Windows Live Movie Maker the more memory the application uses especially if you have a large video.
<br />
<br />
</span><span>To check how much Windows Live Movie Maker is using from your system, please go to your Task Manager, click on Processes tab and from there you can see if it's using more memory.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</span><span>If your virtual memory is low, there are two things that you can do. Increase the minimum size of your paging file and Split the video in two parts.<br />
<br />
A. </span><b><span>Increase the minimum size of your paging file.
</span></b><span>Below are the steps on how to do so:<br />
<br />
a. </span><span>Open System by clicking the
<b>Start </b>button, clicking <b>Control Pane</b>l, clicking <b>System and Maintenance</b>, and then clicking
<b>System</b>.<br />
b. </span><span>In the left pane, click
<b>Advanced system settings</b>.&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
</span><span>c. On the <b>
Advanced</b> tab, under <b>Performance</b>, click <b>Settings</b>.<br />
d. </span><span>Click the
<b>Advanced</b> tab, and then, under <b>Virtual</b> memory, click <b>Change</b>.<br />
e. </span><span>Clear the
<b>Automatically manage paging file size for all drives</b> check box.<br />
f. </span><span>Under <b>
Drive [Volume Label],</b> click the drive that contains the paging file you want to change.<br />
g. </span><span>Click <b>
Custom size</b>, type a new size in megabytes in the<b> Initial size (MB)</b> or <b>
Maximum size</b> <b>(MB</b>) box, click <b>Set</b>, and then click <b>OK</b>.<br />
<br />
</span><span>Increases in size usually don't require a restart, but if you decrease the size, you'll need to restart your computer for the changes to take effect. We recommend that you don't disable or
 delete the paging file.<br />
<br />
B. </span><b><span>SPLIT THE VIDEO -
</span></b><span>If you have a large video the best thing to do is to split the Video into smaller parts. This will help Windows Live Movie Maker deal with resources.
<br />
<br />
a. </span><span>Click the
<b>video</b>, and then drag the playback indicator to the point where you want to split the video.
<br />
</span><span>b. Under <b>Video Tools</b>, on the Edit tab, in the Editing group, <strong>
click Split.<br />
<br />
</strong>2. <strong>Unsupported media files </strong></span><span>– Windows Live Movie Maker isn't compatible with a lot of formats it. Check if file types are supported by Windows Live Movie Maker<strong>
</strong><a href="http://explore.live.com/windows-live-movie-maker-file-types-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://explore.live.com/windows-live-movie-maker-file-types-faq</strong></a></span></p>
<p><span>3.<strong> Missing or incorrect Video/Audio codecs</strong> - Audio and Video require codecs to play the file and it’s important to have the right codecs installed or updated in your PC.
<br />
<br />
</span><b><span>Media info</span></b><span>
<span>will be able to identify any issues with missing or faulty codecs and
</span>whether it’s already installed in your computer or not. You can get it at&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<strong><span><a href="http://mediainfo.sourceforge.net/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span><span><strong>http://mediainfo.sourceforge.net/en</strong></span></span></strong></a>
<br />
<br />
</span>Note</strong></span><span>: If you can’t find the codec you need to convert the video to AVI and then import it in to Windows Live Movie Maker.<br />
<br />
4. </span><b><span>Outdated VGA card driver -
</span></b><span>Movie Maker makes extensive use of the video card GPU (graphics processing unit). Computers with video cards that are not intended for high-end graphics usage or older cards may encounter
 issues in rendering video and effects in Movie Maker.&nbsp; The display driver affects the reliability, performance, and quality.
<br />
<br />
</span><span>There are 2 ways how to determine the version and VGA card driver date to determine if it should be updated.<br />
<br />
</span><b><span>Control Panel<br />
<br />
</span></b><span>Click on Start button and type Device Manager in Search programs and files box.<br />
<br />
1. </span><span>Click Device Manager on top of the results list.<br />
</span><span>2. Look for Display Adapter and click the triangle/chevron next to it.<br />
3.</span><span>&nbsp;It should show the name of you display adapter/video card. Right click on it and left click on properties.<br />
4. </span><span>Click the Driver tab and you will see the driver details including the driver version.<br />
<br />
</span><span><strong>Note:</strong> You may also run the update from here. On the Driver tab, click the Update Driver button and on the new window click Search automatically for updated driver software.<br />
<br />
<strong>MS Diag/DirectX Diagnostic Tool.<br />
<br />
</strong>1. </span><span>Click on Start button and type dxdiag in the Search programs and files box and press Enter key on the keyboard.<br />
2. </span><span>Click on the Display tab and you will see the driver details including the driver version.<br />
<br />
</span><span>Thanks!<br />

            Hi Nelson,<br />
<br />
thinking about this and the user problem, and being a bit unfamiliar with the latest WMM (which is why i'm here...) but being familiar with other video editors in general, and having messed with this stuff for more than 10 years now (doing multiple VCD encodes
 at once on a 256mb, 800mhz machine with no GPU acceleration at all... they were slow, but they still went, and the system was still usable at the same time)<br />
<br />
1. Does it actually use the GPU for encoding? The encoding speeds I've seen with it so far really don't suggest that. Ergo if he's OK editing and previewing the file, but encoding fails, it seems less likely to be the video drivers unless something fairly esoteric
 is happening.<br />
<br />
2. The length of it - fair enough if there's a million little clips or a lengthy voiceover etc, that can put extra load on the system and be easy to chop down further... but if it's just trimming/re-encoding a single video file, how is this going to help? It's
 not failing halfway, it's stalling almost immedately. Besides, if he wants to get a single, slightly shorter file at the end of it, he'll then have to put both split halves in a new project to concatenate them, and we're back to square one.<br />
<br />
<span>3. Pagefile... ok, this could have some effect, but for most purposes, if he's borderline enough for memory to stop the program working at all, then there will have been other effects noticeable, e.g. the machine being almost unusable
 for browsing any except the simplest web sites, one at a time... That, or movie maker is dealing with an entire divx-style 300-image keyframe-to-keyframe lump at once, with uncompressed video as well, which would need about 2.5Gb of working space (for each
 10 second chunk) at 30fps 1080HD. I don't know of any other video encoder that does that, however. It'd be practically impossible to encode hi-def on my laptop for a start, as it'd rapidly run out of RAM and then have to page at least a gig of stuff out to
 the disc (that's a minute of waiting) and then back in (another minute ... for each 10 second chunk), but this is demonstrably not the way it works on the very rare occasions I do hi def encoding on said laptop. The CPU is far more the limiting factor...<br />
<br />
4. Unsupported media file - if WMM is supposedly properly coded, why wouldn't this be picked up at the file-import stage, rather than the encode stage, after the user may have already spent a couple hours editing?<br />
<br />
Besides, Jewells has already said that modes other than full HD have been tried - including email, which is quite undemanding - and the machine has been left to run overnight with no progress. Unless it actually does use GPU encoding (poorly?), even for the
 low rez modes, it must be some other fault or bug?<br />
<br />
I figure there may be other problems in play, like a lack of disk space, disk errors, super slow CPU (...malware?) etc.<br />
<br />

            The laptop I started this project on is a quad core, brand new laptop. The device is not the issue. There is plenty of memory and paging space available for this project. I have trimmed this down first to 2 different flies in order to make it work, (which
 it didn't) and now I have divided it up into 3rds. STILL it stops (gets stuck) at 1%. &nbsp;I have now moved the project to my work desktop computer and imagine that... the same issues arise. I have done several other videos using this program and have never run
 into this issue before so I know that my computer/video card/hardware is not the problem here. &nbsp;Normally I would just throw my hands up and forget it on this, but this video is essential for my work and I need to get this done!&nbsp;

            I just browsed this thread and think your issue could be the file type. WMV files can be made using different compression codecs and the screen capture one results in a WMV file that isn't a standard video one, and Movie Maker needs video WMV files.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
A tool such as Expression Encoder 4 can convert a screen capture WMV file to a video WMV file.... it's a free download from Microsoft.
<br />

<h2>            resetting child&#39;s linked account</h2>
                    I setup accounts for my 3 children to use for their homework on my PC which they have been using but they only remember their pin numbers and not the default password I setup for them when I created their accounts. When I try to reset their passwords,
 the system sends my email account a code to reset but that just takes me to a page which asks me loads of questions about the child including emails they sent etc which they don't use this account for and so it ends up sending me a note saying I haven't supplied
 enough information for automatic verification. I've given all the information I know, I've proven I'm the linked account because the password reset pin has been sent to my email and yet the system still wont let me reset the child's password. Please help -
 these accounts are useless with PIN if parents cannot easily reset their child's account. If logged in as parent you should just have a reset password on any of the linked child's account, but this is not an option and the normal

<h2>            convert read only music files</h2>
                    I am unable to transfer music files from hard drive to Win media player. They were transferred from old computer by flash drive. They&nbsp; are saved to hard drive and will go to the Media Playlist, but cannot be saved to Library. The problem seems to be related
 to the files' " read only" status which I am unable to convert (by unchecking read only box). One site says the registry needs to be modified, but I am not certain this applies to my situation.<br />
<br />
thanks &nbsp;

            <p>You shouldn't be using Windows XP -- and certainly not Windows XP sp2 -- to connect to the Internet.&nbsp; It isn't safe, despite some individuals' observations that they haven't been infected yet.</p>
<p>

<li>you don't see your own network in the "Choose a wireless network" screen (you get to this screen by right-clicking the icon for your wireless network adapter in the Network Connections window and selecting "View Available Wireless Networks)<br />
OR<br />

            Recently there was an unamountable boot volume, so I did a fresh install of windows xp svc pack 2.

            <p>Based on that screenshot, neither your wireless network adapter nor your Ethernet network adapter is installed, even though in your earlier response you said that Device Manager showed that "the wireless card is working properly."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to Device Manager and expand the "Network adapters" section by clicking on the + symbol to its left.&nbsp; List the names of each device you see in the Network adapters section.&nbsp; Which, if any, of those devices shows a warning icon?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "1394 Net Adapter" is <strong>NOT </strong>your wireless card.&nbsp; It is a FireWire adapter and unless you're an Apple enthusiast, about the only thing you're likely to have that is able to use this connection is an old iPod.</p>

            Judging by what you said I dont think my wireless card is installed, I went into the device manager and the only thing under Network Adapters was 1294 Net Adapter.

            <p>There's a lot more than your wireless network adapter that isn't working properly.&nbsp; You need to install the drivers for your computer's hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With your other computer, go here --&gt; <a href="http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/19/product-support/product/vostro-1500/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/19/product-support/product/vostro-1500/drivers</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Preferably, enter the Service Tag from your Vostro 1500 (<a href="http://www.dell.com/support/contents/category/Product-Support/Self-support-Knowledgebase/locate-service-tag" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Where is my Service Tag or Express Service Code?).</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This should limit the downloads to only those appropriate for your particular unit.&nbsp; Otherwise, you'll have to select the appropriate drivers to download and install from the collection on the page linked above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Download the necessary drivers and copy them to a USB flash drive or burn them to a CD.&nbsp; Then transport the USB flash drive or CD to your Vostro 1500 for installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Read this:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.dell.com/support/article/SLN148687" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Installing Drivers in the Correct Order</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternately, you could download and install the Chipset driver and the Ethernet driver, then connect your Vostro laptop to your router with an Ethernet cable, come back to the site above and select the "System Analysis" button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest that you <strong>NOT </strong>install the optional update to the computer's BIOS at least until everything else has stabilized and then only if you are experiencing one of the specific issues that the BIOS update is supposed to address.&nbsp; If you
 do decide to install the BIOS update, <strong>ONLY </strong>do so when the laptop is connected to the mains power -- do not update the BIOS on battery power alone.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Use your desktop to go to the Dell site and download the drivers.&nbsp; Enter the Dell Service Tag that's on your laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can't, of course, use the "System Analysis" button at this point because you're connecting with a different computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On your desktop, copy the downloaded drivers to a USB flash drive or burn them to a CD.&nbsp; Then bring the USB flash drive or the CD to your laptop and copy the files onto the laptop.&nbsp; Then install the drivers.</p>

<p>if it says your signed in but cant see anything on the home page accept need to sign in cam be caused by a few reasons first clear your cache this usually works for me. secondly you could be having a high bandwith use on the beta which can prevent you from
 accessing it. I would suggest going to the beta forums or contacting the beta team and reporting the bug.</p>

<br />
<br />It is part of Windows. If you think it is involved in some problem them use these troubleshooting methods which most often will clear up the issues.
<br />
<br />I would do Performance check for the entire system.
<br />
<br />If using an SSD or hybrid hard drive be sure it has the latest firmware.
<br />
<br />Try the Clean Boot method to see if a startup program is involved - if so it is a  process of elimination :
<br />
<br />Right Click the start button - Command Prompt (Admin)   OR   Windows PowerShell (Admin) - at the prompt type in 
<br />
<br />MSCONFIG 
<br />
<br />and hit enter

<br />=====
<br />
<br />Do all of these :
<br />
<br />If you had a 3rd party antivirus on the OS you upgraded OR if you have one now uninstall it and then run its maker's removal tool. Use Windows Defender which in Windows 8/8.1/10 is a full antivirus. Despite all the hype out there
<br />Windows Defender and the Windows Firewall are true superstars.

<br />
<br />The below is additional help with some of the methods in the "Tips to improve...." link.
<br />
<br />Windows Key + X - Command Prompt (Admin)  OR  Windows PowerShell (Admin)
<br />
<br />(Run these one line at a time.)
<br />
<br />SFC /scannow
<br />
<br />Note if that shows uncorrected errors - do the below regardless.
<br />
<br />When that completes run these :
<br />
<br />DISM /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth
<br />
<br />DISM /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth
<br />
<br />Note if that shows any uncorrected errors - do the below regardless.
<br />
<br />Then restart the computer.
<br />
<br />------
<br />
<br />
<br />Be sure you are running the latest available BIOS, chipset drivers, and all the major device drivers.
<br />
<br />
<br />Check with System Maker (Motherboard Maker for custom systems) for updates to the BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major on-board and separate device drivers. Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their name.
<br />
<br />
<br />DriverView - Free - utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.
<br /><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current. Right Click Start Button - Right Click Start Button - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -  REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.
<br />
<br />
<br />Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.
<br />
<br />Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples) (as rollback) and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset, and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)
<br />
<br />Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.
<br />
<br />Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.
<br />
<br />Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at Device Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.
<br />
<br />Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.

            No, its not a virus, it means either some of the store apps need to be re-registered or a component such as Microsoft Edge or Cortana needs to be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />Option 1: 
<br />
<br />Reinstall all Windows Store apps:
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: powershell
<br />Right click PowerShell
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type the following command then hit Enter, exit PowerShell then restart, then try updating through the Store again.
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml”}
<br />
<br />Option 2: Perform a repair upgrade:

<br />
<br />Not a virus! It's app plugin. You can fix it by this. 
<br />
<br />Open administrative Windows PowerShell and type following and press Enter key: 
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"} 
<br />
<br />Let the command complete.

<h2>            Suddenly not allowed to use Cortana&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello there! I have been using Cortana for like a year now (currently 14) and had no issues signing into my Microsoft Account for the same. About a few weeks ago, I updated my PC to Windows Insider Preview Build 17074.1002 and suddenly Cortana asked me "Fix
 my account". I went ahead and did so and tried signing into my Microsoft Account. However, it threw me an error saying "Minors aren't allowed to use their accounts here". I installed the Cortana Beta app on my Android device from the Google Play Store and
 it too said I was a minor and can't use my account here. I also receive the following error code: 0x80190005</p>
<p>Here's a screenshot of the error:</p>

<h2>            Slow HDD copy speed. </h2>
                    
<p>I'm getting very slow copy speeds, no matter if its installing a game from a DVD (retail), or copying files over the network. I never get over 12 MB/s. I opened resourse monitor for disk&nbsp;and it looks to me like files are first copied to the C: (SSD) and
 then to my target drive (HDD raid0). I have tried turning off disk cashe and the swap file. I'm still getting very slow copies. I understand why the SSD is the bottle neck, but how do I make it stop going through the SSD.</p>
<p>System specs:</p>
<p>intel dx58so with 975 chip</p>
<p>kingston 64 GB value SSD (OS drive)</p>
<p>4x 1TB samsung HDD in raid0</p>
<p>samsung bluray reader dvd-rw</p>
<p>6 GB kingston hyperX 1600</p>

<p><span><span>• Which Antivirus program are you using on your computer?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>• Is downloading from internet also slow?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>First you may refer the following link to check the PC performance and check the copy speed:</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>This also sounds like a hardware issue; you may try to run Hardware diagnostics tool to identify if the issue is hardware related.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may refer the following to run the Diagnostic tool:</span></span></p>

    <title>why does my xbox keep getting kicked off of router and sometimes have - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> the darkstar  say:</h3>
<h2>            why does my xbox keep getting kicked off of router and sometimes have limited connectivity</h2>
                    i have an Xbox 360 that works on other routers just fine so i know for a fact it is not my wireless card. when i share the internet threw a computer to the same router there is no problems. the computer is using a wireless card. so i don't understand why
 the computer sharing internet with an xbox there is no connecting problems with the router but the Xbox it self using a wireless card (and the Xbox is even closer to the router than the computer) has horrible problems like disconnecting for no reason. and
 sometimes connecting and all i can do is communicate with friedns but nothing else. and this is a brand new router because the other was replaced because it was dropping packets. now this new router is an RT-AC66R. it is actually pretty cool i can walk like
 three blocks away and still have wifi on my phone. and my xbox is about ten feet away from it and the computer is about fifteen feet away. and now my new problem is that i can no longer run an Ethernet cable to the computer to share internet. because the computer
 sees the xbox but the xbox does not see the pc. or rather the xbox fails the pc test. and also i can no longer share my internet with another pc. i switched the wireless card from one pc to the other and the pc with the wireless card connects no problem. and
 the other one is said to have an incorrect ip address. and if you switch it back the problem is the same now the one with the wireless card works but cant share internet with the other. and before there was no problem sharing internet. but i also could not
 see the other pc one way or the other. i fixed that problem and now the pc's can not only see each other they can copy cut and delete media and files on the other pc. but that is when i could no longer share the internet and also with the xbox. and now the
 xbox cant see ether pc. and i figured that was the problem so i turned off sharing and then it still didnt work. i even did system restore and that did nothing. i been reading forums for two days now and no help no one has the same problem as me. one pc is
 running windows 7 professional and the other is running vista home basic. so please someone anyone help me out im going nuts. i am about to get a switch so i dont have to keep switching the ethernet cord so i can only have two things online at a time. i also
 in the future am going to get a long enough cord to plug the switch directly into&nbsp; the router. but dont have the money to do that right now. i live in a motel and already got in trouble by my landlord for resetting the old router to default so i could make
 it better for my system. then i told him it was dropping packets. so he replaced it. and put up a cage so as to stop me from resetting this one. but all i would have to do is use my finger to tip it up and i would have access to the reset button. i am paying
 for this internet service and am really frustrated because i keep telling him something is wrong but he thinks its fine because he bought a new router. but if my xbox is still having the same problem do you think it could be the Ethernet cord going from router
 to modem. but the new router doesn't drop packets at all and it works beautifully when it wants to. some times it just stops putting out a signal and it will stay like that for hours. even unplugging it for 30 seconds and plugging it back in does nothing.
 or do you think it is because he has only a limited number of ip address available and has them set to save them for say ten days instead of one. because by resetting my wireless card and the other peoples computers also reset the wireless card when they have
 connection problems or it ask for a new ip address. does that then use up all the allotted spaces for connecting? i dont know that is just a theory from reading forums if that is dead wrong someone please let me know. also i have put another question about
 the samething before but dontknow if i explained myself well in ether question because i am so tired that i am having trouble typeing it is driving me insane i just want to reset the router to default so i can acces it webpage. so if you can help me that would
 be awsome her is the other post.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
i have a network admin who dont want people to enjoy there internet that we pay for please help
<div>i am having trouble getting my computer to share its internet connection with another computer and with an xbox. i had them working and now the xxbox. i had them working and now the xbox cant even see the computer and the other computer which is running
 vista and keeps saying the ip address is wrong. i live in a hotel and allready got introuble for resetting the router to default password so i can fix the settings. but now he baught a new router and put a cage around it so it cant be reset and the computer
 that is sharing the wireless internet is running 7. and the xbox can sometimes connect to the router but keeps getting booted off or sometimes it says that some xbox live content is unavailable. i know its not the xbox wireless card because it works on other
 routers just fine. and i was sharing a connection with the vista computer just fine before now it will not work at all. can anyone please help me???????

<h2>            Magnifier lens size keeps getting smaller</h2>
                    I use the Windows 7 magnifier consistently and repeatedly.&nbsp; My problem is that the lens size keeps getting smaller with successive uses, eventually winding up at minimum size.&nbsp; Then I have to increase the lens size using the slide bars on Magnifier -&nbsp;Options,
 and the process begins all over.&nbsp; Does anyone know how to "lock in" or retain a previous selection for this feature?

<p>
</p><p>I would like to know some information about the issue so that we could assist you further.</p>

<p>
</p><p>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 8.1, Windows
 8, Windows 7, or Windows Vista. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.</span></p>

</p><p>Note: Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 2 if the above steps does not resolve the issue try to create new user account.</p>

            Thanks for your suggestion.&nbsp; I am able to customize my Magnifier as you described.&nbsp; My problem is that the software doesn't appear to remember my custom settings.&nbsp; Specifically, the lens size keeps getting smaller and smaller with successive uses, and
 I periodically have to customize it again.&nbsp; I would like it to remember my original settings each time I use the application.

<h2>            Windows 10 not operable</h2>
                    <p>I had Windows 7 Ultimate and upgraded to Windows 10 about a week ago. &nbsp;Since then, I have been getting some very poor performance on my system, culminating today in a forced restart. &nbsp;When it came back in, all that was on the screen for 2 hours was the spinning
 dots cirling around on a grey background. &nbsp;Pressing Ctrl+Alt+Del at least got me into the welcome screen. &nbsp;After logging in, the taskbar is inoperable, the start menu not usable and the system all around unstable, meaning I cannot launch things such as the
 personalize wizard or other such settings windows. &nbsp;Windows Key + R does nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found an article which had me disable development mode on all apps, and it partially restored my system, but the start menu is blank and none of the settings screens will stay up on the screen for longer than maybe a second. &nbsp;My system is totally unusable
 in this state. &nbsp;What can I do to fix this?</p>

<h2>            keeping win 8.1 after upgrading to win 10</h2>
                    So I would like to know if it is possible that once after I have upgraded my OS from win 8.1 to win 10, can i re-install the win 8.1 (that I had originally purchased) onto another HDD, while being able to keep the new win 10 on a second HDD and vise versa....
 Or is it once i have upgraded to win 10 does that make my win 8.1 OS null/void... not sure if this question has already been answered or I'm just not understanding something somewhere, but I would really like to be able to have both OS's.... and if we can,
 what would be the best way on going about how to do this...????

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can test the Windows 10 Tech Preview in a dual boot, but the final release next month of the free Windows 10&nbsp;upgrade&nbsp;has to be done as an upgrade to your existing Windows installation, not as a standalone dual boot&nbsp;installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your existing Windows 8.1 License becomes part of the Windows 10 upgrade process, resulting in the end product, namely Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers.</p>

</p><p><strong>When I upgrade a preinstalled (OEM) or retail&nbsp;version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 license to Windows 10, does that license remain OEM or become a retail license?</strong></p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM or retail version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 to the free Windows 10 upgrade this summer, the license is consumed into it. Because the free upgrade is derived from the base qualifying license, Windows 10 will carry that licensing
 too.</p>

<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What happens if I change my motherboard?</strong></p>
<p>As it pertains to&nbsp;the <strong>OEM licenses </strong>this will invalidate the Windows 10 upgrade license because it will no longer have a previous base qualifying license which is required for the free upgrade. You will then have to purchase a full retail
 Windows 10 license. <strong>If the base qualifying license (Windows 7 or Windows 8.1)&nbsp;was a full retail version, then yes, you can transfer it.

<h2>            Cannot uninstall a printer from my computer</h2>
                    I need to uninstall a printer that I had on my computer years ago. When I click on the uninstall button, it says that the printer is in use and to try again when the printer is finished printing. Only I have not had the printer for years now. In my printing
 options, this deceased printer comes up as the main printer and there are some things I cannot print because they try to print from that printer. I have no clue what to do now. Any suggestions?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I would suggest you to try uninstalling the printer in clean boot state. Make sure you are uninstalling the printer which is no more connected to the computer.</p>
<p>Starting your computer by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs so that you can determine whether a background program is interfering with your game or program. This kind of startup is known as a "Clean boot."</p>
<p>Refer:<br />
<strong>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7<br />
</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>
</p>
<p>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:<br />
1.&nbsp;Click Start, and then click Run. <br />
2.&nbsp;Type msconfig, and then click OK.</p>
<p>The System Configuration Utility dialog box is displayed. </p>
<p>3.&nbsp;Click the General tab, click Normal Startup - load all device drivers and services, and then click OK.
<br />
4.&nbsp;When you are prompted, click Restart to restart the computer.</p>

    <title>dpi error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zazubotts  say:</h3>
<h2>            dpi error</h2>
                    I tried to change the dpi but made it too large.&nbsp; I cannot scroll to the bottom of the page because it's so big and I can't change it back.&nbsp; How can I fix the problem?

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Use System Restore back to a point before you did that.<br />
<br />
Start - Control Panel - Backup and Restore Center - upper left Repair Windows<br />
<br />
How to Do a System Restore in Vista<br />

<br />
You could also try booting into Safe Mode and set the DPI. Repeatedly tap F8 as you boot.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
