<h2>            Powerpoint 2010 in Win10 after 1709 update won&#39;t display in slideshow mode</h2>
                    <p>I have 'disabled' graphics acceleration as per the fixes that are shown on the web, but since the Windows 10 update (Creator on October 17, 2017) and service packs on November 7, I cannot run a PPT presentation.&nbsp; When I try to run from beginning or hit the
 slide show icon in the bottom right hand ribbon, it comes up with a black screen and I have to ESC out and just show the slides with thumbnails because i can't get to fullscreen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I present three or four times a week and this is a terrible inconvenience!!&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Using: PPT 2010 on HP Spectre x360 with Win10 - fully updated with all Win and MS updates</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            Hello Angela,<br />
<br />
<br />
Slideshows may not display due to corruptions within the PowerPoint app. Most Office app issues can be fixed by running the automated Office troubleshooting tools. In repairing PowerPoint, you may refer to the instructions provided on the link below:<br />

<p>These keys have different values on different PDA's / phones so I can't give you a definite answer. However, if you're able to install&nbsp; apps on your phone, you might want to give a try to the apps / tips (e.g., direct Registry inspection) explained in my
 dedicated articles at <a href="http://www.smartphonemag.com/cms/blogs/3/more_programmers_hackers_stuff_along_wit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know if you don't really understand these articles or don't find any apps supporting your phone; then, I'll try to look around more thoroughly.</p>

            Don't think you have resented enough information. Is it possible to help those that, are familiar with the subject, to post your files including you Pivot table attempts to a cloud based service such as: OneDrive, Google Drive, DropBox or Sugar Sync. And
 then provide a Link. If you can put a copy of originals create such with Dummy information &nbsp;or privacy concerns.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Bruce,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will be glad to assist you on how to make the hyperlinks that were&nbsp;sent to your account work again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">There is a possibility that&nbsp;the pop-up blocker feature prevents pop-up windows from opening when&nbsp;you click hyperlinks in email messages. I would suggest that
 you<strong> </strong>enable pop-up windows to open, <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
please perform the following steps: </span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">1. Click the

software from a third-party that blocks pop-up windows, you may receive a warning message about a pop-up window, or nothing happens when you click hyperlinks in email messages. You might need to contact the manufacturer or check the documents of the third-party

<h2>            Help with Excel Template</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have downloaded the employee attendance template from the Microsoft website here (<a href="https://templates.office.com/en-us/Employee-attendance-tracker-TM02780235" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://templates.office.com/en-us/Employee-attendance-tracker-TM02780235</a>).&nbsp;This workbooks
 works very well for us however I need to make&nbsp;a few tweaks. This brings me to reach out for help. I have created the fields I need, I just need help with creating the formulas that will link the sheets.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need help in these areas:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have edited the "List of Employee's" tab to include all the days the employees are allotted in the year. Example, employee A gets 15 vacation days and 5 sick days, etc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I need the total days taken off in January for example to filter to this sheet and spit out a # for the January column, etc.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/22cadaf7-e96f-4690-a2f7-19cef1a5139b?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/22cadaf7-e96f-4690-a2f7-19cef1a5139b?upload=true" height="125" width="1061" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I also need a formula for the Calendar View tab. I have amended this&nbsp;tab to include the allotted days for each employee.
<strong>On the allotted days, I need the cells for sick and vacation to link to the List of Employee's tab which it will draw the information for each employee</strong>.
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/91285199-23c5-4df8-900f-0c24a68e8a7e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/91285199-23c5-4df8-900f-0c24a68e8a7e?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Hopefully this was clear... and thanks for helping me out!</p>

    <title>Suggestion&#58; Multiple copy and paste options - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ank_ash  say:</h3>
<h2>            Suggestion&#58; Multiple copy and paste options</h2>
                    
<p>There needs to be a feature that will allow the user to copy and paste multiple items at the same time.</p>
<p>For example, User can select "Copy" or "CTRL+C" option followed by "1", "2", "3".. and so on till multiple times while working on a document and this information will get stored in the Clipboard. User can paste this by using "Paste" or "CTRL+V" option followed
 by&nbsp; "1", "2", "3" in the sequence in which it was copied.</p>
<p>This is how it would work:</p>
<p>CTRL+C+1 for copying and CTRL+V+1 for pasting this information</p>
<p>CTRL+C+2 for copying and CTRL+V+2 for pasting this information.</p>
<p>Can we expect to see this feature in future releases?</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Office shortcuts unexplainably removed or changed and can no longer open any microsoft office products</h2>
                    I opened Microsoft office - outlook this morning it opened and was fine.&nbsp; Then it said there was an update and the pc needed to be restarted for the update to take effect.&nbsp; I did this.&nbsp; However when it restarted I now get the following error message when
 trying to open any of my Microsoft products (appropriate product name inserted where OUTLOOK.EXE is)&nbsp;"The item "OUTLOOK.EXE" that this item refers to has been changed or moved, so this shortcut will no longer work properly.&nbsp; Do you want to delete this shortcut?"&nbsp;
 I cannot open any Microsoft Office product.&nbsp; It is as though it has been removed, however when I look under C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office15 I can see there are files there.&nbsp; I am running Windows 8.1.&nbsp; I have no idea how to fix this, but at
 this point I cannot even use Word or Excel.&nbsp;

                    <p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hi, </p>
<p>i have a strange problem. I'm using Nokia Lumia 620 running dev preview 8.1. Recently I got some serious problem my internet data,it is decreasing day by day. I'm not an extreme internet user, but all I do is chatting mainly WhatsApp (with its image ,video,audio
 auto downloading disabled) and also my background data settings is in "when I'm near limit" . My Internet data pack is draining by some settings.I donno which one, but when i checked with data sense usage....it says my data is mostly used by an app called"system".
 What the **** is that ?? </p>
<p>have double checked</p>
<p>
</p><p>#phone update settings</p>
<p>#syncing settings </p>
<p>#background app usage</p>
<p># backup settings </p>
<p>#Automatic app updates </p>
<p>
</p><p>But non of these things are turned "on" , but I couldn't figure it out why it draining so much data. All I can do is to set background data restrictions to "Always" in data sense to avoid this issues, but with restriction settings "on" WhatsApp will not
 open. Plz ...any help,will shed light on this issue. Thank </p>

<h3> pineman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel position on screen when opened</h2>
                    <p>I have a 27" screen and when I run Excel the first time it always opens fairly small on the top left hand side of the screen. I want it bigger and central on the screen but cannot find a way to do it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I open Word on a Mac for the first time and make it the size I want in the centre of the screen before closing it then it will always open in the centre. If I do this with Excel on a PC it will do this BUT if I do it with Excel on a Mac it always opens
 on the top left and too small.</p>

    <title>Hi Microsoft, I collected some constructive feedback from other sites - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hi Microsoft, I collected some constructive feedback from other sites to help aid you in not ruining Skype.</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: left">I don't think I've found a SINGLE positive thing said about Skype 8 in the hundreds of comments I've read, but here's some samples. (PS, this forum itself is pretty confusing itself just to post a thread &amp; how about a *preview* option
 so I don't have to fix everything after I've posted it, geniuses?!)&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
</p><p style="text-align: left">-----------<br />
</p>
<p>The same is clearly true with Skype. Microsoft is still a petulant child. They claim to want your feedback, but they do not. What they want is for you to stroke their ego. Would you expect any less really? It is the same old story: big company buys smaller
 company, big company gets rid of people who made smaller company, people stop using smaller company's product, big company wonders why. I stopped using Skype a very long time ago because it just wasn't that good anymore. All Microsoft has to do to make it
 good is listen and I mean really listen -- something they have shown an inability to do since SatNad took over.<br />
<br />
Skype appear to have been listening to serious user concerns on their user forums for years... and then moving in precisely the opposite direction. Personally, I will not "upgrade" to version 8 until it reaches feature parity with v7, and has a compact mode
 with screen-real-estate parity with v6.21, which was the last version without the wasteful speech bubbles.<br />
<br />
<br />
So would this bloatware/feature reduction shrink the size"<br />
Since it needs now a whole javascript runtime and framework to work, I won't bet on it....<br />
<br />
Ah, the good times when applications were native ones just calling the OS APIs....<br />
<br />
Corporate-speak is such asswipary. Anyway, hands up whose going back? I used Skype for years, but MS couldn't stop hitting the kill-switch, which made it hard to stay in touch with people who need help maintaining a PC or who don't see any benefit in upgrading
 to 64-Bit / Win10. But hey, wish core scenarios meant a Ribbon re-think and a halt to Win10 Slurpage too!<br />
<br />
Microsoft is in full "me too!!!" mode (and it's not about the #metoo movement). It's desperate about copying whatever had a breadcrumb of success somewhere else.<br />
<br />
I'm surprised they didn't add to Skype a taxi operation, or a food delivery system yet. Or to plug some AR/VR system within - when most people just need a simple way to communicate via voice or messages.<br />
<br />
Dear MS<br />
Please just return Skype to what it was on the day before you bought it.<br />
<br />
Thank you<br />
<br />
Former Skype User.<br />
<br />
It sounds like a lot of job justification was going with Skype along the lines of what they did to Windows. Things don't need a lot of bells and whistles and shiny. They just need to work and not get in the way which is something I think MS forgot.<br />
<br />
If it ain't broke, management will fix it - there will be meetings and the PHB will demand new features, that existing features be enhanced, renamed, moved and rewritten in Java, Ruby or VB. Management have to justify their existence by making decisions. And
 if these means the death of a product? Doubles all round at the annual bonus meeting.<br />
<br />
I need to see multiple conversations at once<br />
Is that really so hard?<br />
<br />
That is why I am running Skype 7, and why I continue to use Skype at all.<br />
<br />
I think MS realise many active users will drop Skype if they pull the plug on Skype 7, that's why they changed their minds and why they're now getting rid of idiotic features on Skype 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The bloody bastards removed the ability to disable auto updates from version 7.41.0.101 (the one available from skype.com).<br />
<br />
The fact that a spokesdrone says that at all is nice to hear. Too bad it's just PR and nothing will change as far as Microsoft's mentality is concerned. It has been a long time since MS ever thought of _maintaining_ simplicity.<br />
<br />
“maintaining simplicity while enhancing functionality is critical to usability,”<br />
<br />
Being in his position, I would be unable to keep a straight face while saying that; Opening Sgripe on my Win7 takes 6 pages just to sign in, the functions that bloat it seem to work when they feel like it and quit when they are bored.<br />
<br />
It's clear this guy is responsible for Outlook too as it shows a similar lack of basic functionality and over- complication along with similar recurring faults that should have been seen and fixed well before the release of each incarnation.<br />
<br />
Another upper manager that can't manage.<br />
<br />
It might be a blessing if someone could arrange as lahar from Mt Rainier to visit Redmond.<br />
<br />
Try just *asking* the users<br />
Although big tech and its enthusiasts keep wittering on about "innovation", there is actually very little of that going on. It is not "innovating" to find yet another field where an app can be levered in as a parasitic intermediary between a service and a customers
 (taxis, food, room lets, what's next?). It is not "innovating" to add yet another CPU core to the dozen or so already shoehroned onto a die. It is not "innovating" to make incremental performance improvements to a phone or a laptop or a tablet. And it certainly
 was not "innovating" to take a relatively simple application that just does what it says on the tin and slap on endless pointless and unwanted frills, furbelows and witless nods to social media.<br />
<br />
Microsoft could have asked Skype users what they wanted from the application and what improvements were needed ... but I'm afraid if you gave MS devs, marketurds and UI folks the design for a hammer—which has been basically the same for 10,000 years—they'd
 "innovate" and "improve" it to the point where (a) it was difficult to use it to drive nails in, and (b) the blinking lights and paisley-themed interface used too much battery power.*¹<br />
<br />
I was so disgusted by the v8 Skype "up"grade that I reinstalled 7.44 on my phone and have killed autoupdates to stop it rising from the grave again.<br />
<br />
I suspect the problem is (as ever) that Skype is supposedly free, meaning that corporate greedmongers are obsessively looking for ways to monetise it. As with social media and search, a great many problems, ranging from usability to data privacy, would be solved
 if you simply had to pay for the software. Give MS a $10 credit and get 500 hours of calls or something. The pressure to tinker with the app would largely evaporate, and even better, would be driven only by what rivals could successfully offer, and that would
 mean only what customers actually prove to desire.<br />
<br />
(Paying for Skype and ensuring it couldn't become part of a data-collection 'monetise the user' paradigm would improve the product and encourage rivals to emerge for true competition, and this is also true of other currently "free" services. The solution to
 many search and social media problems is right there, too ...)<br />
<br />
I honestly don't care about your "designer" stuff. The second it isn't to my taste, I start ditching the program. And because you can't account for everyone's taste, don't. Provide options. Let people choose. Focus on the core product - how do I send audio/video
 over the net nice and fast. Everything else is none of your business and pointless trying to control how "my" desktop appears.<br />
<br />
"Skype and Outlook design director Peter Skillman" - There is a design director for Outlook? No kidding!<br />
<br />
Skype has been trashed. It's official.<br />
<br />
Pre-Microsoft, I set up my Dad with a little hardware box that combined skype/landline and it was cheap as chips. He could use his landline phone and and hit *9 I think ? and it would route his call through skype. It was great. That's gone.<br />
<br />
He has a lot of his contacts in speed dial. that's gone.<br />
<br />
Adding people to a video call is now difficult as it fails to do anything sometimes, and just adds them to the group but you can't redial them.<br />
<br />
The UX is horrid and leaves you wondering how the hell to do simple things.<br />
<br />
I regularly skype with my Dad and Brother and all we do mostly on calls (after finally setting up) is just moan about how bad Skype is.<br />
<br />
However, at least i can send one of 5 or 6 emoticons to the callers, now that's SOOOOOO useful.<br />
<br />
Skype will be dead soon. All they will have left is Skype for Business.<br />
<br />
Does Microsoft have ADHD or something?<br />
I honestly can't keep track of their product line these days. It seems that not a month goes by where they've not rebranded, or deprecated, or otherwise changed something that we literally just finished migrating TO after the last pointless change. I'm so utterly
 sick of spending more time migrating from platform to platform than I actually get to spend using the damn things.<br />
<br />
Just what businesses want, to have to keep migrating to new products when MS get bored and decide that they will release something new to replace the thing that was new only a couple of years ago.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know...<br />
..why MS bought Skype in the first place?<br />
<br />
From here, it looks like they bought a customer base and threw away the product.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anybody using ZOOM for video/audio conference and team work. It rocks. We’ve just moved from Skype to it (not the dreaded Skype for Business BTW) and the signal quality, user interface and ease of use has truly impressed an old cynic: I go back to VNC and WebEx<br />
<br />
<br />
Can the last skype user turn the light out when they leave please.<br />
<br />

I use Skype every week to talk to an elderly and technophobic relative, on the far side of the planet.<br />
<br />
What version is he using? Heck if I know, and I'm damn sure he wouldn't even understand the question. But if it suddenly stops working, I wouldn't give much for his chances of learning to use anything else. It's taken him several years to learn how to receive
 calls on Skype, and even now he's far from confident with it.<br />
<br />
Dear Microsoft: is it really asking too much for you t* just STOP F***** AROUND WITH THINGS THAT ALREADY WORK?<br />
<br />
Nah, it's a tradition for Microsoft: "if it works, break it" - Aero, Office, configuration panel.... the list is a long one.<br />
<br />
The truth is, Microsoft like to change user interfaces in order to piss off users. It's the only logical explanation.<br />
<br />
This seems to be their main hobby.<br />
<br />
If it works, break it.<br />
<br />
If it's useful, hide it.<br />
<br />
If they like it, change it.<br />
<br />
"Microsoft like to change user interfaces in order to piss off users"<br />
<br />
Seems like it, huh? I don't think it's outright deliberate. Just negligently clueless and selfishly arrogant.<br />
<br />
Well, Micro-shaft CLAIMS that they're continuing 'to work on your most requested features". Yet the article points out that the most requested features are, basically, to RESTORE the capabilities of "skype classic".<br />
<br />
But you _KNOW_ Micro-shaft will *NEVAR* do that. Why should they? They're MICRO-SHAFT! If they don't like it, then it was never even mentioned (*cough* *cough*), at least not 'enough' to be 'most requested' [I think their dictionary definition of 'most requested'
 might need some serious re-editing] and so they fly off into "la la la I'm not listening" mode with their hands firmly planted against their ears as if NOT perceiving it means it doesn't happen...<br />
<br />
Micro-shaft started doing this when 'Ape' (windows 8) released. Why is anyone surprised? Ok nobody is, and this is why many of us *SNARK* about it. I miss their customer-centric attitude (ok not entirely but still...) when 7 was released. Now it's "world domination"-centric.
 Right?<br />
<br />
I wasn't even aware that the deadline had been extended. I ran down my Skype credit and stop using it before the original deadline.<br />
<br />
When I want free mobile to mobile calls I use WhatsApp. Oh well, out of the frying pan into the fire.<br />
<br />
Does the register get paid directly by Peter Skillman!?! If you go to the skype forum HOSTED BY MS you'll see that virtually NO ONE LIKES THE NEW SKYPE. Please, I IMPLORE YOU read the forums and even his own twitter account before regurgitating what Peter tells
 you to say. The new skype 8 is an abomination and all the features no one users are posted over an over and over again to return - including the ability to just make skype call without it dropping sound or dropping completely. Skype 8 is a turd from top to
 bottom and I'm not just one person - thousands of people are complaining about the new skype on many forums including MS' own web page - how did you miss this. You've posted a number of articles and my guess is you've never used skype or you'd know what rubbish
 the product is.<br />
<br />
The general consensus is to roll back to 7, skip 8 and fire Skillman.<br />
<br />

            <p>Rumor is that the next build is to be released before the end of this month (February). &nbsp;I also feel the urgent need to try the next build because 9926 is such a bitter disappointment that I am hoping the trend reverses and the next build has actual improvements
 instead of getting worse.</p>

<h2>            Can you sync a new phone with an old phone data</h2>
                    I have a HTC Pro and replaced it when the touch screen failed with another HTC Pro and can not get my contacts to sync on the new phone. It knows it is a different phone and will not let me use the same sync name? And I can not see any of the old contacts
 from the old phone is there a way I can open the old profile and explore the data?

            Where is this data now?&nbsp; If it is stored in Outlook on your computer, all you need to do is set up a new partnership between your new HTC Pro and your computer and sync the data to your phone.&nbsp; A computer can sync to numerous windows mobile devices (I
 currently sync 8 different windows mobile devices, with 8 different names to my computer)

            Mine has "Internet Browser" chosen, which I believe points it to whatever the default browser has been set to. Chrome shortcuts work fine for me and Chrome is my default browser most of the time. If I switch default to IE or Edge they also work.

</p><p>I am a Firefox user but had to swing to Edge for a while until I got the Firefox icons working again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I make 2 simple changes -</p>
<p>
</p><p>1&nbsp;&nbsp; I change the default browser to Firefox</p>
<p>2&nbsp;&nbsp; I go to Settings and then under "default apps by file type" I boogie down to URL and I change the default to Firefox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Firefox shortcuts work fine.&nbsp; I do find that at 1 time, under Properties, I could direct to a specific page # but I no longer can.&nbsp; I may have referenced Page 150 in the past and now want to go to Page 160, the latest.&nbsp; I now just get to go to Page 150.&nbsp;
 Not a big deal, on most sites, I just want to get to the site.</p>

            I tried right-clicking Desktop and creating a shortcut to http://10.0.0.1/ which is my router. I can toggle the default browser from IE to Edge to Chrome and each time I change it, the shortcut icon changes to match the new default browser and that is
 what opens if I use the Desktop shortcut.

<h3> vienna10  say:</h3>
<h2>            Insiders on Sony Vaio SVS1512Z9EB</h2>
                    <p>Originally an Insiders notebook, but took the chance and exited during the fall upgrade. Curiosity got the better of me and decided to rejoin Insiders on that machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appeared to go well, but no new build was offered. To make things worse, the language went back to the default German, although it still showed English.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, took the next step and&nbsp;upgraded from the build 17025 ISO. This went smoothly, but again, no English language.&nbsp;Took a few&nbsp;repair steps known to me, but no new build being offered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thought it better to go back to the previous build, which took me to&nbsp;build 16299.125 (non Insiders).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried again to join Insiders again, but on clicking the button,&nbsp;all relevant&nbsp;text showed in German, instead of English.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What could be wrong?</p>

<p>Had another go at rejoining Insiders a couple of days ago. This time all went well, with build 17063 downloading a short time later. Whatever the problem was in regards to the language, it must have been fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The install took an awful long time, but the language in finish was English. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So wo can mark this as fixed and finished.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your help</p>

            I had used Skype for very many years, never had a problem like this. I had been gone from the States the last 3 months. When came back, my phone updated Skype automatically to the new version. Have lost some phone numbers, contacts and the balance on my
 credit. I had log off thinking it would reset my account and now it does not take my Skype name, phone number or email on my laptop and cell phone (iPhone.) I have been trying all kind of communication with Skype and nothing... Please help me. Thank you.

<h3> g.nicolls  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2010 Error Code&#58; 0x8007007B</h2>
                    I installed Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2010 off of the University of Windsor software depot for students and faculty;
<b>product ID: 02260-018-0000106-48838</b>. I received the <b>error code:&nbsp;0x8007007B</b> for the first time in 2012 after I successfully downloaded, installed, registered and activated the program in 2011. I could not figure out how to solve it at that moment,
 so I repeated the whole process again. I am now having that same <b>error code:&nbsp;0x8007007B</b> with this installation. I have reached my limit on downloads for this software and have long since cleaned out my e-mail inbox with the product key. Whenever I click
 on Change Product Key, a error box materializes and states:<i> <b>"The setup controller has encountered a problem during install. Please review the log files for further information on the error."</b></i> The only option given is to click "OK." It does not
 give a link to the log files or allow you to access the activation information. I have located the log files. There is only one error, and I do not have a clue to what it means:&nbsp;Error: No ARP entry found for this product '{90140000-0011-0000-1000-0000000FF1CE}'
 Type: 33::InvalidData.&nbsp;
<div><br />

<div>I have left this until the end; 3 days left until expiry.&nbsp;</div>

<div>Any help would be greatly appreciated!</div>

            You will need to see if you can find a third-party addin for the calendar. &nbsp;The only calendars available in Display Options are Gregorian, Thai Buddist, and Hijri.

    <title>Lumia 635 Update No Service Problem - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Lumia 635 Update No Service Problem</h2>
                    I downloaded the Windows 8.1 Update on my Nokia Lumia 635 this morning. Since then, I have not been able to get any service, it shows either "No Service" or "Emergency Only". Wifi and everything else works fine. I have tried restarting it and taking the
 battery out, but with no success. I have also tried manually searching for networks, but it doesn't find my network, EE. Is there anything I can do to fix this without resetting the whole phone?

            I gather you are asking about highlighting spaces around the text? Perhaps you could use text shading instead of highlighting? That allows you to include spaces.

Highlighting also allows spaces to be highlighted.

<p>I just tried it in Word 2016 and 2010 on my office computer and was unable to get shading to stick to a space! I cannot figure out the difference.</p>

            Thanks. Yep, I'm aware of that, but it doesn't produce human readable output (yet - I'm aware the developer has plans for this, but it is already a long time coming), the date/time is not local and images are not displayed in-line, i.e. in the thread.
 I also find that this app doesn't reliably match phone numbers to contacts (hence their names are not always displayed - just the number), and it sometimes&nbsp;mixes up threads for contacts. For contacts with multiple phone numbers it also doesn't reliably combine
 these into one thread, i.e. as they appear on the phone.
