<h2>            When I link my inboxes in Windows 10 Mail, I get duplicate emails</h2>
                    <p>I have contacted Microsoft support five times now. I'm not contacting them a sixth time. They have remotely done everything, from removing accounts, to deleting accounts, to upgrading Windows 10, but the problem persists. One agent said my files and account
 were corrupt and had to make a new account and migrated my files. A couple of the agents were very nice and pleasing to work with, but the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had my brand new computer (Lenovo Yoga) for 9 months now with zero issues. As soon as I activated Microsoft Office a few days ago, then the double emails started. I narrowed it down to when I link my two inboxes (Yahoo &amp; Gmail accounts), then I get
 double emails in my inbox. You may ask, why I just don't link the inboxes? Because I didn't have to before, and it is very nice to see all my emails in one spot, just like before Microsoft Office activation. (Microsoft Office was already installed on my computer.
 I just entered an activation code.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not use Outlook. I do not want to use Outlook. I use Windows 10 Mail. I'm not very computer literate, so I like to keep things as simple as possible. I just want my email inbox to be like before Microsoft Office activation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I searched here and used a few recommendations to no avail. That's when I contacted Microsoft support and they haven't been able to fix this issue either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated. Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mr. Frustrated</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. Not sure which topic to put this under, since there is nothing for Windows 10 Mail problems.</p>

<h2>            Bring my Xbox One to Europe&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I currently live in the US, but will be moving to Europe (Sweden), this summer. Can I bring the Xbox and use my Xbox Live account and access my content (games and movies from Xbox Video) in Sweden? I assume I'll need an adapter for the power supply, but
 will there be other issues (TV standards, access to Xbox account etc.)?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Jonas</p>

<p>Hey mate,</p>
<p>Won't be a problem at all, you'll still be able to access all your games and the like without any problems. Even if/when you change your locale to Europe, you'll still be able to access your games downloaded when in the US :)</p>

<p>You should never use any type of power adapter/voltage converter with your console.</p>
<p>You would need to buy the correct power brick once in Sweden.</p>
<p>Some digital items are region locked so that may be an issue but any physical copies are region free.</p>
<p>Blu-ray/dvd is also region locked.</p>

<p>I've been having the same problem nearly all of today. I was on Black Ops this morning and i played a few games with no problems then suddenly my connection just dropped. Usually to 1 bar orange/red or 2 bar yellow. I had a look in the options menu where
 you can see your bandwidth etc and my bandwidth had dropped to 27Kbps. What's that all about?! Sometimes it was even saying 0Kbps. I'm so confused!</p>

<p>I experienced the same problems after the MW2/Black Ops (BO) update couple weeks ago. I have tried other games and the lag is only on BO (e.g. Halo was fine). Activision's website said the server status was at Defcon 5, all servers are running. I contacted
 the help desk at Activision BO and they responded with the standard help desk answer of "make sure the game ports are open on the router and that Firewall is turned off". This is a crap answer as I have never had the problems before until the BO update. Running
 speedtest.net shows nothing wrong with my Road Runner internet access and I did go through all the steps of making sure my network connection was good using the XBox network Live test. So I'm pretty sure you are right = the BO lag is caused by Activision's
 recent update. BTW: All the lag problems magically disappered last night...</p>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for posting in Microsoft community. I will certainly assist you with the issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Is your computer up to date?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I suggest you to download the and reinstall Microsoft-IME in Japanese format and check if it helps.</div>
<div><strong>Installing MS-IME</strong></div>

<div>2. Open "<strong>Time &amp; Language".</strong></div>
<div>3. Select <strong>"Region &amp; Language"</strong><br />
Click <strong>"Add a language". </strong></div>
<div>4. Select<strong> "Japanese".</strong></div>
<div>5. <strong>"Japanese"</strong> is added<br />
(This means "MS-IME" is installed)</div>
<div>6. Confirm the<strong> Language Bar. </strong></div>
<div>7. Click <strong>"ENG"</strong><br />
Select <strong>"Japanese Microsoft IME".</strong></div>
<div>8. Japanese Typing Mode [A].</div>

            <p>Thank you for your suggested answer. I did manage to (re)download the Global IME for Japanese directly from the Microsoft website, and it is now fully functional again. The taskbutton to change from English to Japanese, or reverse process, is a little different
 than previously, but is easy to learn and helpfully explained.</p>

            <p>it is best to run checkdisk from the recovery console: chkdsk c: /r</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>if you cannot burn the cd from the instructions below, then you can run it from CMD</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>go to start, run, type in cmd, select ok</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>at cmd prompt type in chkdsk c: /r press enter</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>type Y for yes when asked to run at next restart, press enter</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>type exit press enter</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>restart machine, let checkdisk finish and if any errors are found run again</p>

<p><b><u>Here's how to<span>&nbsp;
</span>make a bootable xp recovery console cd</u></b></p>
<p>Courtesy of JoseIbarra
</p>
<p>You need to start by booting into the XP Recovery Console using a CD you can make (no XP media required) and run a chkdsk with error correction enough times
 until it runs clean and if that doesn't work, you can create a new boot.ini file (it is usually one of those two things).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's how:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use the XP Recovery Console to verify the file system on your HDD and correct any problems&nbsp;and then try to boot your system - this may be all you need to
 do. &nbsp;Or, you are welcome to&nbsp;just start trying things that might work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Boot into the Windows Recovery Console using a bootable XP installation CD.</p>
<p>If you have no bootable XP media (or are not sure what you have) create a bootable XP Recovery&nbsp;Console CD and be sure what you have (no XP media required).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is not the same as any recovery disks that might have come with a store bought system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can make a bootable Recovery Console CD by downloading an ISO file and burning it to a CD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bootable ISO image file you need to download is called:</p>
<p>rc.iso&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Download the ISO file from here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thecomputerparamedic.com/?p=8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thecomputerparamedic.com/?p=8</a><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>(courtesy of Daavee)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use a new CD and this free and easy program to burn your ISO file and create your bootable CD:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When installing ImgBurn, DO NOT install the Ask toolbar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some instructions for ImgBurn:</p>
<p><a href="http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would be a good idea to test your bootable CD on a computer that is working.</p>
<p>You may need to adjust the computer BIOS settings to use the CD ROM drive&nbsp;as the first boot device instead of the hard disk. &nbsp;These adjustments are&nbsp;made
 before Windows tries to load. &nbsp;If you miss it, you will have to reboot&nbsp;the system again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you boot on the CD, follow the prompts:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Press any key to boot from CD...</p>
<p>The Windows Setup... will proceed.</p>
<p>Press 'R' to enter the Recovery Console.</p>
<p>Select the installation you want to access (usually &nbsp;1: C:\WINDOWS)</p>
<p>You may be asked to enter the Administrator password (usually empty).</p>
<p>You should be in the C:\WINDOWS folder. &nbsp;This is the same as the&nbsp;</p>
<p>C:\WINDOWS folder you see in explorer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Recovery Console allows basic file commands like: copy, rename, replace, delete,&nbsp;cd, chkdsk, fixboot, fixmbr, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a list of Recovery Console commands, enter help at the prompt or read about the XP Recovery Console here:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/recovery_console_cmds.mspx?mfr=true</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A good idea before starting things is to first verify the integrity of your file system using the chkdsk command.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the command prompt window run the chkdsk command on the drive where Windows is installed to try to repair any&nbsp;problems on the afflicted drive.</p>
<p>Running chkdsk is fine even if it doesn't find any problems. &nbsp;It will not hurt anything to run it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assuming your boot drive is C, run the following command:</p>
<p>chkdsk C: /r</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let chkdsk finish and correct any problems it might find. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It may take a long time for chkdsk to complete or it may appear to&nbsp;be 'stuck'. &nbsp;Be patient.&nbsp;If the HDD light is still flashing, chkdsk is doing something.
 &nbsp;Keep an eye on the percentage amount&nbsp;to be sure it is still making progress. &nbsp;It may even appear to go backwards sometimes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should run chkdsk /r again until it finds no errors to correct.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remove the CD and type 'exit' to leave the RC and restart the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You do not have to adjust the BIOS again to boot on the HDD since the CD will not be present.</p>

<h2>            How to turn off Norton product tamper protection during unsuccessful system restores</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently installed Norton antivirus software, which recommended that I install some Microsoft updates, which I did, but upon restart, I began to hang up on the windows logo start screen (please excuse my lack of proper terminology; I am just an average
 computer user).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an HP Pavilion dv7 running windows xp home edition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon reading several other threads regarding this startup problem, I have taken many, many steps, which I will post later if needed, but during trying the various system restore points, I received the error message:&nbsp;<span>Unspecified error during System
 Restore 0x80070002 and 0x800700b7 (depending on which restore point.)&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>According to another thread, "some security programs prevent changes to their files and have to be configured to allow system restore to work. If using Norton, you must turn off Norton Product tamper protection.</span></p>
<p><span>I cannot boot in safe mode, I receive the error: windows failed to start. A recent software or hardware change might be the cause.</span></p>
<p><span>Primary hard-drive test both quick and long passed, also the memory test passed, so I do not think it is the hard drive or memory.</span></p>
<p><span>Does anyone have further advice on how to disable Norton so I can at least boot up and save my files? (I do have backups, just as backed up as I'd like-I may lose quite a few important documents and memorabilia).</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks in advance,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Chryss</span></p>

</p><p>Can you tell me the Norton product you have, so I can provide you the steps to turn off Norton Product Tamper?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using Norton 360, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Start Norton 360.</p>
<p>2. Click Settings.</p>
<p>3. In the Settings window, under Quick Controls, uncheck Norton Product Tamper protection.</p>
<p>4. Click Apply and then click OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using Norton AntiVirus or Norton Internet Security, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Start the Norton product.</p>
<p>2. Click Settings.</p>
<p>3. In the Settings window, click the General tab.</p>
<p>4. On the left pane, click Product Security.</p>
<p>5. Next to Norton Product Tamper protection, click the status indicator to turn it off.</p>
<p>6. Click Apply &gt; Ok.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then perform a System Restore and see if it works!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hi Vineeth,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate the reply, however, I cannot boot the system, and thus cannot open Norton products to turn it off. I was hoping that someone would walk me through a command prompt shut-down of the Product Tamper protection (Norton Antivirus). However, I ended
 up taking the laptop to a data recovery center for a diagnosis after-all. Just waiting for the verdict.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for the response.</p>

<p><span>Hi Dennypic747,
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your question in the Microsoft Community Forums.
</span></p>
<p><span>I appreciate your efforts to work on this issue.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please answer these questions to get clarity on this issue:
</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>What is the exact name of the app that you are using?
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Is that a Microsoft Store app or a Desktop app?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>How did you download the music files and where have you saved those files?</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please follow these steps to copy the music files from the computer to the USB flash drive:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1</span></strong><span>: Insert the USB drive into the USB port
 on your computer. Try to use a port directly on your computer. Windows will usually notify you that a USB drive was inserted, and an AutoPlay window may appear. You can close the AutoPlay window for now.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2</span></strong><span>: Open File Explorer by pressing Windows
 key + E together. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 3</span></strong><span>: Click This PC and Find your USB drive.
 Your USB drive will be displayed in the "Devices and drives" section of the window.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 4</span></strong><span>: Note the drive letter for the USB drive.
 Knowing the drive letter will make it easier to send files to the drive later.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 5</span></strong><span>: Find the music files that you want to
 copy to the USB drive. Your music files may be located in a variety of locations on your computer:
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 6</span></strong><span>: Select all of the files and folders that
 you want to copy. You can also press Ctrl+A to select everything in the current folder.
</span></p>
<p><span>You may find it easier to move all of your music files into one spot on your computer, organized into folders. You can then copy all of the folders
 and files at once.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 7</span></strong><span>: Wait for the files to copy. Your selected
 files will begin copying to your USB drive.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 8</span></strong><span>: Once the copy is done, click the "Safely
 Remove Hardware" button in your System Tray. This will unmount the drive from your system, allowing you to safely remove it without corrupting any data.</span></p>
<p><span>Pull the USB drive out of the computer. Your music is now safely stored on your USB drive.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let us know the result of the steps performed so that we can help you further.
</span></p>
<p><span>Awaiting your reply.

</p><p>Thank you for responding, it was a clear answer that is helping solve my desire to move music files to a thumb drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The music I want to move, was downloaded from Google music play.&nbsp; I now believe that their music is on my MS Surface book 2., but the files are not view&nbsp; able by the subscriber, me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I presume it is necessary to use music from a streaming source, that is music that has been paid for, and is in a file format that can be copied or moved.&nbsp; If you can confirm this for me I would appreciate it a great deal!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the help.</p>

</p><p><span>Thanks for the reply and appreciate your efforts to work on this issue.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As the question is about the Google Play Music, This is the best effort support provided.</span></p>
<p><span>You can refer to this article to know about downloading music.</span></p>

<p><span>Note: Signing out of your account will remove downloaded music from your device.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may also know by now that Google Play Music encrypts the music you download, which is why the albums and playlists can’t be seen by other apps.</span></p>

    <title>Some CDs playing distorted &#47; crackling - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dolbyjones  say:</h3>
<h2>            Some CDs playing distorted &#47; crackling</h2>
                    Hi, I am having a problem listening to some of my CDs. I thought this was a problem with Itunes at first as when I rip some Cds they are coming out distorted and crackling. However, I have now discovered that even if I play the Cds through media player
 the same is happenning. It is only occurring with some of my Cds and it doesn't appear to matter whether they are old or new.
<br />
My computer has definately played them OK in the past as I have tried this with some Cds that I ripped with no problem previously, however now they are sounding disorted.
<br />
I have checked all the troubleshooters with no improvement.<br />
I have been on Windows update to make sure all the up to date drivers are installed.<br />
It does not appear to be a problem with the individual Cds as I have played them in other computers and Cd players with no problem.<br />
Any ideas?<br />
Thanks.

            After some further investigation I think the problem rests with the CD writer -&nbsp; a TSST SH S223B. I am trying to find the cable for my old one to see if this rectifies the problem.

<h2>            Windows 10 - Start menu - critical error</h2>
                    Does anyone know how to fix this? I cannot access any applications&nbsp; on the start menu. Clearly thousands of people have this problem all over the world yet I can't seem to find anyway of fixing it?

            <p>Thanks Billion,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was so frustrated that I rang Microsoft help desk. </p>
<p>
</p><p>First I had one guy try to help but couldn't in the end. He referred me to a level 2 tech who logged into my computer, worked on it for 40 minutes but couldn't fix the problem. He got the error message to go away but the start menu still doesn't come up.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, he said it was beyond him and he referred me up the chain to a higher level tech who is due to ring me and log onto my computer tomorrow to see what he can do.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So while I cannot access any application in the start menu and indeed can't use the start menu at all, I think I will wait until tomorrow to see if the next guy can get anywhere (don't want to mess it up mid diagnosis).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate your feedback and assistance. </p>

Hi, I have given up trying to find a way to fix this problem as all the methods suggested online got me nowhere.&nbsp; I have restored the factory settings on my tablet and so gone back to Windows 8.1 and it works fine as it did before Windows 10.&nbsp; It was over a
 month between downloading Windows 10 so i couldn't simply reinstall 8.1 hence the factory setting restore through Control Panel.&nbsp; Reloading all my email accounts, files etc. was worth it to get shot of Windows 10 and that silly critical error message.&nbsp; I won't
 use Windows 10 until Microsoft give assurances that this problem has finally been rectified.&nbsp; Good luck from someone who totally understands your Windows 10 problem.<br />

            The dropbox uninstall/reinstall is a temporary fix for me.&nbsp; Every few weeks the critical error reappears and have to repeat the procedure.&nbsp; It is unbelievable that there is no permanent fix to this issue.

            Same here it will just start to work again after a few days of leaving the laptop off and the problems I hear from my friends. They play games on there steam account and those that downloaded windows 10 can't get any of them to start . This is so typically
 of Microsoft put out the garage and let the consumer surfer while it is sorted out or even fix by them. Kept windows 7 on my gaming PC so I can still use my orgins account and steam account .&nbsp;

            <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft spent nearly four hours logged onto my computer trying to fix this problem and couldn't (3 different technical people). In the end they set up a new user account. This worked for about 6 weeks before the problem resurfaced again. I have had the
 same problem on two of three computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Microsoft instructions shown above didn't work on either computer. Uninstalling Dropbox worked on one but not the other computer. Just can't fix it on the remaining computer rendering it almost useless.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just recommend not upgrading to Windows 10 if you haven't already and just feel sorry for the rest of us with this problem......
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

    <title>Change built in administrator account name with windows 7 premium - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> doctor ah  say:</h3>
<h2>            Change built in administrator account name with windows 7 premium</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I've read the forums and i've seen a lot of similar posts to this one and for this I am sorry.</p>
<p>Basically I purchased a computer from Acer which has windows 7 premium 64 bit running; what must have happened is they must have installed windows 7 and it must have asked for a user name and for some reason they put on "User#".</p>
<p>I want this to be changed to something like Amaad; regarding the forums I have seen that a standard account is reccomended I would like this to be named as "Family". I would like any method which changes the built in administrator account to Amaad, even
 if it means deleting the built in administrator account.</p>
<p>Please to minimise your time spent on this post, please reccomend any alternative methods and state their advantages and differences from the original built in administrator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated, and I apologise for the inconveinence,</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>When you change an account name then several references such as the name of the profile folder remains unchanged. This is a frequent source of irritation. Much better to start your own account.</p>
<p>The only difference between the Administrator account and your own account is that the Administrator account cannot be deleted.</p>

            Simple: Create an account called Amaad and/or Family. Note also that you cannot delete the inbuilt Administrator account as this is equivalent to painting yourself into a corner.

<h2>            Desktop Background - pictures show too large to set as background</h2>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have had my computer for more than 3 years and have not had any trouble until recently.&nbsp; I wanted to change the picture for my desktop background and it is too big; actually any picture I choose turns out to be too big for my desktop.&nbsp; I have not had this
 problem before.&nbsp; I have resized the picture and now it does not show&nbsp;the full picture on the desktop.&nbsp; It displays the resized picutre but&nbsp;it looks like it is a 4 x 6 pic on the screen, the background is black.&nbsp; Any suggestions on how I can correct this?</p>

<h2>            Multiple email accounts in Windows 7 Windows Live Mail</h2>
                    
<p>I am trying to migrate my emails from my old XP PC to a new Windows 7 PC.</p>
<p>I use Outlook Express on the old PC and use several email accounts on it.</p>
<p>When I import the mail to WLM on the new PC, I can't find how to retain a common inbox for all of the accounts.&nbsp; WLM seems to insist on creating a set of Inbox/Drafts/Sent Items/Deleted Items folders for each account.&nbsp; How do I merge these into common folders
 for all accounts so it works the same way as Outlook Express does?</p>

    <title>Screen size constantly changing during scroll - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> avagee  say:</h3>
<h2>            Screen size constantly changing during scroll</h2>
                    Just got a new Surface RT and I've found that my screen size CONSTANTLY changes as I scroll. I'm pretty sure that I'm not doing anything out of the ordinary, just a typical touch scroll down a website or whatnot. I've found that the screen can change upwards
 of three to four times during a single scroll- enlarging one minute and shrinking the next. As you can imagine, this can grow quite disorienting after a while. I was just wondering if there was something that I can do to prevent this from occurring?

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Adding layers are currently available to 3D objects in the Paint 3D application. Non-3D objects within the application doesn't have this feature yet.

<ol>
<li>Select a 3D object in your scene.</li><li>Use the Z-axis left-hand button to drag the object back and forth, and move items front to back.</li></ol>
<p>

<p><span>2. Navigate to&nbsp;<strong>Feedback</strong>&nbsp;in the left menu, then press&nbsp;<strong>+ Add new feedback.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>3. Select the&nbsp;<strong>Problem</strong>, and share any details you think are relevant, and choose an appropriate category and subcategory.</span></p>
<p><span>4.&nbsp;<em>Important:</em>&nbsp;If possible, reproduce the problem(s) after clicking&nbsp;<strong>Begin monitoring</strong>&nbsp;(or&nbsp;<strong>Start capture</strong>) near the end of the form;&nbsp;<strong>Stop monitoring</strong>&nbsp;when you’re done.</span></p>
<p><span>5. Once you’ve completed the form and monitoring, click&nbsp;<strong>Submit.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>6. Click&nbsp;<strong>Continue using Feedback Hub</strong></span>.</p>
<p><span>7. Click&nbsp;<strong>My feedback</strong>&nbsp;at the top, then find the item you submitted (it may take a while to appear)</span></p>
<p><span>8. Open the item you submitted, then click&nbsp;<strong>Share.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>9. Click&nbsp;<strong>Copy link</strong>, then paste the link here in your response (it will look like&nbsp;<a href="https://aka.ms/%3cunique" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://aka.ms/&lt;unique</span></a>&nbsp;link&gt;).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Note: New features are usually released via Windows Update. We suggest to check for device updates from time to time.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let us know should you need further assistance.</span></p>
