    <title>Surface 3 - How to Clean Install Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface 3 - How to Clean Install Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>After following the upgrade process to&nbsp;install Windows 10 on my Surface 3, Windows 10 installed smoothly and was operating well, however after two weeks many Windows updates failed installing with error code
<strong>0X80246008</strong>. I tried using the built-in repair options in Windows 10 to clean install, however half-way through the installation process my Surface 3&nbsp;fell into a BSOD loop. To resolve I resorted to clean installing Windows 10 again from a USB
 drive. </p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentHeader1">Preparation</p>
<p>Before you upgrade, you must complete the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install Windows 10 via an upgrade process, whether&nbsp;through Windows Update on Windows 8.1 or with the bootable USB drive;
<a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/activate-windows-10-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>this ensures later activations</strong></a>&nbsp;if you don't have a product key and want Windows 10 for free</li><li>Create&nbsp;a <strong><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">bootable USB drive with the Windows edition you need</a></strong>, most likely Windows 10 Home 64-bit</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=38826" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download the Surface 3 drivers</a></strong> and copy to&nbsp;a USB drive (only download
<strong>Surface3_US1_Win10_150724_2.msi</strong><span>)</span></li><li>Ensure all personal files are copied elsewhere, maybe to another USB or a cloud storage service; this installation method wipes all data from the Surface 3</li><li>Print these instructions to <strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/storage-files-and-folders/boot-surface-from-usb-recovery-device?os=windows-8.1-update-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Boot a Microsoft Surface from USB drive</a></strong></li></ul>
<p class="contentHeader1">Clean Install Windows 10 on Surface 3</p>
<p>After you've prepared for your installation,&nbsp;do the following tasks to install Windows 10:</p>
<ol>
<li>Follow the instructions you printed to boot the Surface 3 via USB</li><li>Complete the installation steps in Windows setup window to install Windows.&nbsp;<strong>NOTE:&nbsp;you will be asked for a product key!</strong> Once asked, always click "Skip this step" or "Do it later" or whatever combination of English words on the screen that
 mean the same thing</li><li>Create a local user account first; you can attach a Microsoft account to it later</li><li>Copy the <strong>Surface3_US1_Win10_150724_2.msi </strong><span>file from the USB drive onto the Surface 3 and run the installation to install the Surface 3 drivers and firmware</span></li><li><span>Reboot as necessary until all drivers are installed</span></li><li><span>Activate Windows by going to </span><strong><span>Settings</span> &gt; <span>
Update &amp; security</span> &gt; <span>Activation</span></strong>, and then click Activate.
<strong>NOTE: my first attempt was unsuccessful; the activation tool said my product key was blocked!</strong> It didn't make any sense since I didn't need a product key and I panicked, however, after about five minutes something else finished installing and
 required a restart. After restarting, Windows 10 activated successfully.</li></ol>
<p class="contentHeader1">Post-Installation</p>
<p>After you've installed Windows 10 on your Surface 3, do these general steps to finish setting your computer; they're all optional:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install all Windows updates, patches, and drivers via Windows Update</li><li>Sign into a Microsoft account and download OneDrive files</li><li>Pair all Bluetooth devices like a Surface Pen or the Arc Touch Mouse</li></ol>

            <p>Looks like there is a typo - the directions say to download Surface firmware&nbsp;<strong>Surface3_150623.msi.&nbsp;</strong>However, on the next screen it states this is for Windows 8. Not completely sure which is the correct file but guessing for a US Surface 3
 it would be: Surface3_US1_Win10_150724_2.msi</p>

            For repaving my Surface 3, the&nbsp;<strong>Surface3_US1_Win10_150724_2.msi</strong> installer did&nbsp;<strong>*not*</strong> work.<br />
<br />
However,&nbsp;<strong>Surface3_Win8x_150623_2.msi</strong>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>*did*</strong></span> work and allowed me to complete the clean install of Windows 10 on my Surface 3.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Followed this guide but my Surface 3 couldn't able to boot from USB drive, &nbsp;had tried with 02 different USB drive.</p>
<p>However, it did boot from USB if I go to Settings - Update &amp; Security - Recovery - Advanced Startup - Boot from a disk (ex: USB or DVD) or device (UEFI only), and this is the only way to clean install W10 on my Surface 3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is my Surface 3 UEFI firmware have problem?</p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I didnt want to install using win8 drivers so didnt try it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">One other tip I will share is that the touchscreen (and I think keyboard?) wont work until you plug an old fashioned mouse into the USB port, and then you dont need the mouse plugged
 in anymore. &nbsp;Was stumped on that one until I tried it on a whim.</span></p>

            Oh, one other suggestion to the original poster - you have two different files referenced. In one place you say download&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Surface3_150623.msi, which I dont think exists anymore, and
 then in another you say&nbsp;</span><strong>Surface3_US1_Win10_150724_2.msi,</strong> which didnt work for me.

<p>Yep, didn't work for me neither. I ended up getting stuck in Windows 10&nbsp;purgatory without being able to install any firmware to operate the device. I had thought perhaps I deleted one too many partitions during the upgrade process and therefore the device
 would not&nbsp;recognize itself. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So I eventually called&nbsp;Microsoft support, which were very helpful and professional.&nbsp;With their help&nbsp;downloaded a Surface 8.1 image to a USB flash drive&nbsp;and used that to get back to 8.1. Then after downloading all the updates&nbsp;upgraded&nbsp;back to Windows 10 using
 Microsoft's media creation tool following the advice of the Surface support staff upgrading within windows 8.1 instead of booting into a flash drive. Its been working great the last week.

            <div>Thanks, it's corrected. Also it seems like they keep changing the MSI file names; that's pretty frustrating. When I installed the drivers though it installed everything automatically for me. If it missed something, Windows Update took care of the rest
 once I had the WiFi driver installed.</div>

            <p>Thanks for correcting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears theres no .msi option for win10 at the moment, only a .zip file.&nbsp; I believe in this case you gotta go down the "unknown device" list in device manager and "update driver" for each individual item in the tree.&nbsp; Painful, but works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would be much nicer to have an MSI that does it automagically for you :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because it simplistically lists everything as unknown device, no way to accurately guess which one is the wifi device :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for original article -\</p>

    <title>Why is my screen color different&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why is my screen color different&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My name is Nico I've been using a Windows PC for about two years or so and I haven't messed with many settings at all with my computer, so it's fairly default. I was playing a video game and everything was going as normal, but I had to get my roomed cleaned
 by someone, and they probably used wipes and such to clean the desk where the computer was, and they've been doing this for a long time and I've seen no issues. However, when I returned as they were done I noticed my screen saturation/sharpness/brightness
 was adjusted and things were strangely darker and harder to read. Most importantly the display was not as smooth as it was before, everything seems sharper. I tried to color calibrate but it found no issues and I used the Settings bar doing as much as I could
 do adjust the color, but I can't seem to find the right solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could anyone assist me in bring my Windows Screen back to normal?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Nico</p>

 is what the color looks like. I could tell something was wrong as the edges of the logos seemed much sharper, some logos seemed redder than they should be, such as Minecraft.

    <title>My IOS app is completely unusable. Had to delete - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pakshirajan  say:</h3>
<h2>            My IOS app is completely unusable. Had to delete</h2>
                    <p>I have been using Skype to call my parents in India for the last 12 years. And it used to work like a charm. I even taught my mom from India to use it. I attached my credit card to her account as well. So she can call me on my U.S. cell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the recent upgrade, I do not even recognize the app. None of the buttons are recognizable. Navigation is twisted. I used to be able to select a iPhone contact and call their number (and my credit card would be charged). And that feature is taken away.
 I had to go to contact on the phone... copy long international numbers and paste it in Skype in order to call them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today all my contacts even disappeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am totally lost. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you trying to discourage people from using the app on IPhone? Are we expected to use desktop version going forward? What is going on?</p>

<h2>            Fallout 4 Creation Club greyed out. Tried everything. Bethesda is no help&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Bethesda help site is garbage. I've gotten the same answer from them several different times and it's always from a different support agent. Here's what I've done with no resolve:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;- unlinked the account through Bethesda.net and relinked... no resolved</p>
<p>&nbsp;- hard restart on the system after ensuring "ask before buying" is checked "no".... no resolve</p>
<p>&nbsp;- deleted and reinstalled the game (twice)‚Ä¶ no resolve</p>
<p>&nbsp;- closed out of game, went offline, signed in on another account, went to creation club, signed in to my account, went back online... no resolve</p>
<p>&nbsp;- signed out of Bethesda.net on xbox and signed back in... no resolve</p>
<p>&nbsp;- called xbox and was informed to contact Bethesda... no resolve</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been going on since mid May. How do I get this fixed???</p>

            I don't think so. I've had this account for 10 years... I'm not sure if I have it set us as a family account. If it is this would be the main email. Why what's up?

<p>Totally agree. Although, I have brought it to their attention through 6 different trouble tickets, posting in the forums, and reaching out to their customer service numerous times since May 17th with no resolve. I‚Äôm not on here to bash Bethesda, but I have

<p>when you signed in with a different account, were you able to access the Creation Club with the different account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>if you were, any creation club items purchased on that account would be useable on your account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know this isn't a good solution, but it would enable you to get the timed free items while you wait for a better fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>having a creation club item loaded in might give the menu the metaphorical jump start to get it working for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>hope this helps</p>

<h2>            lost folder and files when trying to attach to email message in web-outlook</h2>
                    My chosen folder is sitting in library/documents, but when i try to attach a file from this folder in my web-outlook email, the entire folder is missing - from one moment to the next! all the other outlook emails allow me to locate, open&nbsp;and attach this
 same file. For the web-outlook attachment from this one folder, i have to save the file on a memory stick, then attach. Any ideas where it disappeared or how to get it back???

            It's probably a permissions issue.&nbsp; Websites aren't allowed to access your personal files.&nbsp; You can probably get around this by adding web outlook to your trusted sites list, which you can do from Internet Explorer options.&nbsp; Trusted sites get more access
 to your computer.

                    <p>this error code happens a lot past few <strong>WEEKS</strong>... the xbox home button does not work anymore. when pressing this the screen gets a bit darker as if the menu pops out, but it¬¥s not poppong out. i still have almost full controll about my game
 or whatever i may do in that moment... after about one minute i get the following message: A Problem accured. Try again in a few moments. when you still recieve this message, go to xbox.com/errorhelp and search for code: 0xc0000189</p>
<p>
</p><p>when searching for this error the website tells me this error is invalid, not existant....</p>
<p>
</p><p>the only help out of this problem is to reset my xbox by holding the xbox button on the console. i thought this might be solved by a console update, but it stiull accures after the update yesterday...</p>
<p>
</p><p>i am streaming, and when this happens the stream automaticly ends and i have to reset my console. this is unacceptable...</p>
<p>
</p><p>and YES, thx to MS i am very expirienced in solving the "little issues". i alredy did all the steps i have to do to MAYBE solve the problem. Including: Factory Reset, Hard Reset, Power Cycle, Update and any other imaginable BS that might eventually help...</p>

            Hi there.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It sounds like you are going to have to factory reset the console. Don't worry, you can still keep all your games and apps while doing this though.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
To do this, press the Xbox button on your console to open the guide and go to settings. Then select Systems&gt;Console Info&gt;Reset Console. When it prompts you, pick "Reset and Keep My Games and Apps". This will reset it to factory settings and will be like setting
 it up from out of the box. However, all your games and apps will still be on the system meaning you don't have to download them again.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully that works for you

<p>Hi there Prototype, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out here in Xbox Forums. I understand there is an issue with the error code 0x80830003.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The recommended step is to reset your console to factory defaults by&nbsp;<strong>Resetting and removing everything</strong>. This option resets the console to factory settings. All user data, including accounts, saved games, settings, home Xbox associations,
 and all games and apps will be deleted. You should only use this option as a last resort in some troubleshooting cases.</p>

            So here is an update to my (our) issue... after factory resetting my console, the error was gone for like a week. it just happened again. My stream stopped automaticly, my home menu only dimmed the screen, i still had full controll over my game... same
 as before... So far all possibile steps of maybe solve the problem are done... BTW this almost only happens when playing a game from the developer Hi-Rez... maybe you (MS) may reach out for them???

            so far i figured out, it seems to only happen when i play a game by Hi-Rez Studios, Realm Royale and Paladins... So MS you maybe finally have a talk with them and figure ouut, what is causing this and also answer... cuz i am not the only one and we all
 might be a little happier with an update from your side...

<h2>            Windows Live Mail Desktop 2012 Gmail IMAP download&#47;sync issues</h2>
                    I upgraded to a new computer with Windows 7. &nbsp;Before starting the built in mail client (2011), I upgraded to Windows Live Mail Desktop 2012. Hotmail account seems to have synced fine, and Gmail using IMAP was a snap to set up compared to the older versions
 of Windows Live Mail, but it is having issues. &nbsp;When I try to sync accounts (and click the sync all mail icon a second time), it states it is downloading x of 18,123 messages. Sometimes I get 0 messages, other times I get 9, sometimes as much as 97. &nbsp; Then
 it pauses and seems to do nothing (progress bar blinks as if it is working). &nbsp;No error, no nothing. &nbsp;I have to "Stop" the download and restart it for my next few messages. This will take all month to get all messages. What's up? &nbsp;When it's paused like this,
 I can't send or receive other messages. Thanks. -John

            I completely uninstalled and reinstalled Live Desktop Mail 2012. &nbsp;This helped a lot, but did not completely solve the situation. &nbsp;I still occasionally get a message that it is updating setting, and nothing happens until I hit cancel, and sometimes message
 don't download until I stop and restart, but it is much better this time round. -John&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Kem and GenevieveLizee and JohnGIII,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest that you try the following steps below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>1. </span></span><span>Remove the account from Windows Live Mail.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><font>&nbsp;&nbsp; ¬∑</font><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Right click on the account as displayed on the folder pane.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><font>&nbsp;&nbsp; ¬∑</font><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click <strong><span>Remove</span></strong> account. (Refer to the link that Marco_Mi provided)</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><font>&nbsp;&nbsp; ¬∑ </font><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Confirm the action by clicking
<span><strong><span>Yes</span></strong></span>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2. <span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Add the account again. (Refer to the link that Marco_Mi provided)</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3. <span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Right click on the account as displayed on the folder pane.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>4. <span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click on
<b>Download all folders.</b></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>5. <span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Wait for Live Mail to download all your folders and email headers.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>6. <span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Check if all your folders have been downloaded. If it does proceed to the next step, if not go back to step 1.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>7. <span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Press on
<b>F5</b> on your keyboard or click on <b>Send and Receive</b> button to synch all your emails to Windows Live Mail.</span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Wait until Windows live Mail has finished synching your emails. This might take a long time depending on the size of your accounts inbox.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please return back if the issue has been fixed. If not, we will further assist in you resolving the issue.</p>

<h2>            Sent Xbox in on repair on Mar 2nd and have not received it back yet</h2>
                    
<p>I am so sick and tired of Microsoft and their lack of communication. Bottom line I sent my Xbox One in for repair on the March 2nd. I had the launch consoles, the ones that had the bad disc drive. Label got printed out to ship back to me on the 13th. Here
 it is the 20th and the tracking does not have not one piece of activity on it. Called MS and they are no help at all. So it takes 3+ weeks to get an Xbox back in from repair? This is worst than it was with the 360. I bought my PS4 at launch and had to send
 that out for repair last year and it was not even a yr old.</p>
<p>This is getting ridiculous. Has anyone else had this problem with this and their turtle slow service?</p>

            <p>Hey there&nbsp;Mathematik!<br /><br />Sorry to hear that you have not received your console back yet! I can definitely understand how frustrating that could be. In order to receive an update your consoles shipping status, I recommend reaching out to phone or chat support on the next business day or if you already have received a tracking number, you can check the status by reaching out to shipping company directly. You can reach phone or chat support from our&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contact Us</a>&nbsp;page. Once again I am truly sorry to hear about the issue and any inconveniences this may have caused.</p>

<p>I had the same about 4 months after I bought my console at launch but it was the Kenict that went bad . It took them a long time after the repair was done to get it shipped back. I think it was like over a month.</p>

<p>I have the same issue pretty much the same timing , i sent mine the &nbsp;sixth i think, they got it at the cent re the 8th, which was a Thursday i believe, and my box was fixed &nbsp;by Monday or Tuesday and it's just been sitting there for days, sayin dumb stuff
 like processing order and making shipping label, i know for a fact it doesn't take two days to make a shipping label, and no i have the same problem as you, xbox website tells me it's been shipped to me, but the fedex tracking has no activity and only says
 that FedEx as received the shipping information late thursday, and says the anticated shipping date was the 19 which means i should have it today at the very least. I feel the same way i wish i could tell Microsoft to f the selfs, they made me pay for the
 repair as I have the same first batch of xboxes that had the bad disk drives and thats whats wrong with it, and then the person that i talked to said he could only get me a three month free code of live and that didn't even work</p>

<p>I recommend anyone with a faulty console to return it back to the retailer. You have a 12 months warranty with the console.</p>
<p>People using the exchange program will get a refurbished console which may or may not have issues. People have reported their new consoles having faults.</p>
<p>Microsoft have not addressed the fan issues yet, although they've acknowledged them publically in the media.</p>

<p>I had the same issue when I sent mine back. It's a case of the right hand not knowing what the left hand is doing. If they printed your label then you xbox is sitting on a shelf waiting to be shipped back to you. They like to make it look like FedEx is slow
 to update but in actuality your xbox has not left their facility yet. Mine sat for a week from the time the label was printed to the time FedEx picked it up. I think they wait until they have a certain amount of units to be shipped before they call for the
 pick up.</p>
<p>Mine was picked up from their facility on a Thurs. and I had it back that weekend. So once it gets picked up it will ship fast. Hang in there.</p>
<p>The long part comes when you have to re install all your games. Took me a day and a half.</p>

<p>@Big 233 First off I will defend Microsoft that once they ship the package they have no control over how long it takes FedEx to update,ship or otherwise handle the package. They use a flat rate shipping so you are at the will of the distributor and most
 of the time a company like FedEx has shipping hubs that package must check in at before they can be sent back out or moved.
</p>
<p>For instance I ordered something last week on Wednesday 18th...If I could drive to pick it up it would only take me 13 hours year the package is due to arrive on Monday the 23rd by 5pm. When I followed the tracking the package went 3 states away before making
 it's way back into my current state. This is not Microsoft's fault...This was UPS and how they ship a package as well as non delivering days (IE Sunday)</p>

<p>Just got off the phone with them AGAIN and yeah it is very frustrating. Just never, ever seen this before in my life. The label was printed on the 14th and here it is 9 days later and still no info on it. Now they saying I have to wait until the 27th before
 they can escalate it and then another 3 days to process and ship so I am looking at the end of next week at the earliest now. I have 2 Gamefly games here I have not opened and bought Hardline and can not even do anything with them.</p>
<p>Funny thing is I bought a PS4 at launch also and I never, ever played it unless it was The Show. I can literally count on 2 hands how many times I fired that thing up. Well last June it had the eject button failure that was going around, in which even when
 it was off It would make the noise like you trying to eject a game and it is not one in there. Would do it in the middle of the night a lot, thought the *** thing was haunted. Short story I sent it out for repair (a system I never ever played) and they &nbsp;shipped
 me one with a screw loose in the console, called them, shipped that one back out and got another back in about 3 weeks. So in the same time now I had 2 PS4's delivered to me and I have not seen the One yet.</p>
<p>They tried to offer ma a 3 month code but I told them they could have that crap, I have a nice career so my sub's never run out on either account. Just have never ever seen anything like this before. I paid $500 at launch for a crap console and their customer
 service treat you like dog poo. Let it be their console I am sure they would complain also. I told him I am not complaining about the time frame, but more so the tracking activity</p>

<p>My money is on a server issue that will clear up on its own, but you can try a couple of things to eliminate it being on your end.</p>
<p><strong>1:</strong> &nbsp;<strong><em>Turn off e-mail scanning in your anti-virus program</em></strong>.&nbsp; It is a redundant layer of protection that eats up CPUs, slows down sending and receiving, and causes a multitude of problems such as time-outs, account
 setting changes and has even been responsible for loss of messages. Your up-to-date A/V program will continue to protect you sufficiently. For more, see:<br />
<a href="http://www.oehelp.com/OETips.aspx#3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.oehelp.com/OETips.aspx#3</a>&nbsp;</p>

</strong><a href="http://thundercloud.net/infoave/tutorials/email-scanning/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://thundercloud.net/infoave/tutorials/email-scanning/index.htm</a></p>
<p><strong><em>Note that for many AV programs, it may be necessary to uninstall the program and reinstall in Custom Mode and uncheck e-mail scanning when the option is offered.&nbsp;<br />
</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>2: </strong>&nbsp;<strong><em>Create a new Sent Items and Outbox</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Move most of your messages out of the Inbox and then create new Outbox and Sent Items folders after you move any messages you wish to save to a local folder you create.</p>
<p>Tools | Options | Maintenance | Store Folder will reveal the location of your Outlook Express files. Write the location down and navigate to it in Windows Explorer or, copy and paste it into Start | Run.</p>
<p>In WinXP, Win2K &amp; Win2K3, the OE user files (DBX and WAB) are by default marked as hidden. To view these files in Windows Explorer, you must enable Show Hidden Files and Folders under Start | Control Panel | Folder Options Icon | View, or in Windows Explorer

<p>With OE closed, find the DBX files for the Outbox &amp; Sent Items and delete them.&nbsp; New ones will be created automatically when you open OE.</p>
<p>After you are done, follow up by compacting your folders manually while working *offline* and do it often.</p>

<h2>            Stuck in Automatic repair loop but with no administrator account.</h2>
                    Hi. I am stuck in an automatic repair loop. I've tried to do solutions that I already saw (refresh computer, command prompt thing) but I can't because I don't have an administrator account. I don't know where my CD or USB is or even if I used one in the
 first place. Help?!? Thanks.

            Similar problem here. Also my system isn't recognizing my optical drive nor any of my USB ports to be able to use a repair disc or anything like that. When I access the boot menu the only option it gives me is boot manager. Not hard drive, not CD/DVD,
 not USB, just boot manager. It is saying I have no administrator account when there are supposed to be two admin accounts, and it won't let me try to boot into my other hard drive to try Linux, 7, Or XP (I have a multi-boot on the smaller hard drive so I can
 try to fix problems like this) so all I can do is mindlessly wander through automatic repair failing and get told that I can't change anything without an administrator account. Please help, I need this computer for college so I can complete my (ironically
 enough) Computer Service Technician courses. I have tried changing the boot priority to make the CD and USB be checked first but it still only lets me choose boot manager and kicks me into that loop again. I have also tried a complete tear down and rebuild
 with the minimum hardware and the problem persists. It was working fine yesterday. Only thing that changed was I just cleaned the dust off with a can of air meant for cleaning electronics.

            Normally, any downloads sent through Skype go to your downloads folder in File Explorer in Windows 10.

<br />Click on the File Explorer icon on the Taskbar

<h2>            Volume decreases on Groove music when the app is minimized during Skype call in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Lowering of Volume of Music during Skype Calls</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently using windows 10, did not have this problem before. I'm using the Groove app on windows 10 to play my music right now, and when I'm in a skype call, it only lowers the volume when I minimize the Groove window. I've tried the remedy of going to
 sounds --&gt; communications and selecting "Do nothing" but for some reason, it still lowers the volume substantially whenever I minimize Groove. Interestingly enough, if I select lower by 50%, there's less of a change in volume than if I select "Do nothing".
 Is this some bug in a new update or something? Or is there some other option I can tinker with?</p>

            <p><span>Hello Cantabile,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. We regret the inconvenience caused and will appreciate the time and effort spent in resolving the issue on your own.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Before assisting further, I would like to ask you few questions:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Are you facing the above issue since the recent update?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>If yes, which was the recent update installed on your PC?</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may be facing the above issue due to some corrupted app files &amp; folders or due to some missing app files in the PC.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1: </span></strong><span>Since Groove music is a Windows application, I suggest you to run the
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Windows apps troubleshooter</span></span></strong></a><span>&nbsp;and check if the issue
 is resolved.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In many cases, the Windows Store will automatically notify you if there‚Äôs a problem with an app and try to fix the problem. If you continue experiencing problems with an app, this tool can automatically identify and fix some problems with apps and
 the Store.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2: </span></strong><span>If the issue persists, I suggest you to run
</span><strong><span>SFC scan</span></strong><span> and <strong>DISM scan</strong> on your PC by following the steps below and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">SFC scan </span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. If a
<strong>Windows Resource Protection (WRP)</strong> file is missing or is corrupted, Windows may not behave as expected. For example, some Windows functions may not work, or Windows may crash.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Windows corruption errors may prevent Windows updates and service packs from installing. For example, an update might not install if a system file is damaged. The
<strong>DISM</strong> <strong>scan </strong>or System Update Readiness tool may help you to fix some Windows corruption errors.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 1: </span></strong><span>Open an <strong>Administrator command prompt
</strong>window by</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Press<strong> Windows logo + X</strong> keys on the keyboard and select
<strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong> option.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Click on <strong>Yes</strong> and <strong>continue</strong>. Provide administrator password if prompted.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Check if it says <strong>Administrator: Command Prompt</strong> at the top of the command prompt window.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2: </span></strong><span>Type the following commands in the
<strong>CMD Prompt</strong>:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><strong>dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>sfc /scannow</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 3: </span></strong><span>Close the command window and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Write to us with the answers to the above questions and the status of the issue on the same post for further assistance. Your reply is most important for us to ensure we assist you accordingly.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

<h2>            Gamertag FNC&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I had just noticed while playing a game that my gamertag had changed from "B a b y" to "SillyJoey517767". I&nbsp;then checked my activity feed and had seen that it was changed 30 minutes ago, which I had not done. I have spent over $300 on this account, and am a loyal customer, but I have now just set up my PS4 again because of this disappointment by xbox/microsoft. I only had a couple dollars left in my balance, I also do not have a payment method added. Nothing in my recent account&nbsp;activity is&nbsp;suggesting that a name change has occurred either. I&nbsp;contacted&nbsp;live chat support, which after acknowledging their mistake, sent me here since they are not the enforcement team and cannot undue this bug or glitch. Now some random has my&nbsp;gamertag Baby because of this. I would like my name reverted to Baby, without having to pay for the name change&nbsp;you have forced.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was removed because Microsoft is trying to eliminate Control Panel type settings little by little...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately they failed to include a replacement...</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a number of 3rd party utilities that will return most (or more) of the settings...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally I used the free WinAeroTweaker...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Eventually, after reloading an earlier build, I exported the registry settings that included the settings from the missing tool... I then just double click on it and Merge it with mu current build...</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The easiest fix for you at this point would be to just do a online search for WinAeroTweaker...</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you try to install it you will be given the option to "Install" or run as "Portable"...</p>
<p>

    <title>Windows 10 cause black and gray screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nicklinn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 cause black and gray screen</h2>
                    After downloading windows 10 on my dads Windows 7 Dell it was taking an unusual amount of time to install. When the login screen finally came up we thought it was over but then the screen went black and occasionally has little notifications that come up.
 The notifications are always from something called WerFault.exe and will say things like "The instruction at (bunch of random numbers and letters) referenced memory at 0x00000000000000010. The memory could not be written. Click OK the terminate the program".
 Messages like this will repeatedly pop up and have been for about two days now. After a while the black screen went gray but the messages still kept coming. Forced reboots do nothing and when I reboot it doesn't ask for a login. I literally can't do anything
 to this computer.

            <p>Those "random numbers" would probably be clues about what is crashing which in turn would be clues about how to devise a workaround.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it may be a useful guess to think that it will be an incompatible video driver or BIOS that needs updating.&nbsp; Check
 with Dell to see what they would recommend.&nbsp; E.g. consider what they would say about updating that machine to W8, if not W10.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise "Windows 7 Dell" isn't really a specific enough product description to allow anyone to try to help you.&nbsp; Although what might be appropriate I suppose would be changing the boot to make sure that you get Low Res Video support and see if that changes
 your symptom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck</p>

            It's a Dell Inspiron 620 with Windows 7 home premium. I cannot boot the system in any way except normally because it won't give me the boot option screen after force shutting down the system. After about 10 reboots I finally got the login screen to come
 back up but upon logging in I got a creek that told me the computer needed to restart because it encountered a problem. The problem was a Critical_Script_Error if I remember correctly.

 was asked to activate windows again. So I typed in my key and it said the following.</p>

<p>The Software Licensing Service determined that this specified product key can only be used for upgrading, not for clean installations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This key has worked before when formatting my previous drive and then installing Windows 8 from my disc. Why doesn't it work now and how can I fix this?</p>

<p>You upgraded to Windows 8, but didn't have a previous version of Windows installed (error 0xC004F061)</p>
</b>
<p>If you see error 0xC004F061 when you try to activate Windows 8, it means that you're using a product key for an upgrade version of Windows 8 and a previous version of Windows wasn't on your PC when Windows 8 was installed. To install an upgrade version of
 Windows 8, you must already have Windows 7, Windows Vista, or Windows XP installed on your PC.
</p>
<p>If you formatted the drive before the upgrade version of Windows 8 was installed, you won't be able to use your upgrade product key to activate Windows 8. To activate Windows 8, you'll need to install your previous version of Windows, and then reinstall
 Windows 8. For help with the activation process, <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=260480" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<u>contact support</u></a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Windows 8 must be installed from within a previous version of Windows, if you format the drive, there will be no chance to do a compliance check against a previous version of Windows to qualify to use the upgrade.</strong></p>

<p>I just need some help right now. I was trying to recover my gamertag and it said&nbsp;"Xbox Live Signup is Currently Unavailable" and i didn'y know what it meant. After that I ran a Xbox Live Connection Test and everything was fine but I still could not recover/sign
 into my account. If anyone knows what to do that would be very helpful. Thanks.</p>
