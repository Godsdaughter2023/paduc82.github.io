<h2>            Xbox live gold free games suggestions. </h2>
                    
<p>Okay considering the list of free games that Microsoft is giving us. I just want to put some useful input. Most of us have Assassin's Creed 2, Fable 3, Deadrising 2. For those of us who have the games in my opinion should have credit to a game that is the
 same price. And please be diverse in your game selection. It has been very disappointing the games you give us. Sony has been doing this longer, yet they give their customers more and better choices. Ive been with xbox&nbsp; 360 for the past 6 years. I just would
 like to mention a few games that I believe should be considered for all of us. Oblivion, Soul Calibur 4, Star wars The force unleashed 1 or 2, Lost Odyssey. There are a countless amount of games. And please do not give us a game that has multiplayer and the
 servers aren't indecent shape. Thats why I am happy Halo 3 was not included in the free games. There is hardly anyone on the game and the servers are bad. Mix it up some more please a good RPG, or fighting game would be nice.</p>

<p>Most of the games on your list come down to your own personal preference, Oblivion wasn't that great &amp; neither was Star Wars the Force Unleashed. I remember seeing a friend playing Lost Odyssey and it looked terrible. The only game on your list I could agree
 with is Soul Calibur 4. I'd personally like to see one of the Fallout games make it on there and a good racing game like Forza 4, Dirt 3 or Grid. I'm not slating your list by the way, but you did say for "All of us". Kind of like you're speaking on everyone
 else's behalf. </p>

<p>That would be cool if Microsoft gave us L4D2 with their GWG promotion because I really loved that game and it should be old enough to be one of our free games. I really don't care what games they do give us as long as the games are fun to play and have multiplayer.
 In my opinion, a free game is a free game....so I will be downloading any game Microsoft gives us. They may be old games, but there are people out there that can't buy games, even if they're cheap. Besides, Microsoft doesn't have to nice to all of us by giving
 us these games. Does anyone know what games we are actually getting September? I heard that we are getting GTA4. Is this true?</p>

<p>GWG finishes 12/31/13, so here are my predictions...</p>
<p>A Forza game - A Battlefield game - Kinect Sports - Halo 3 - A Call Of Duty game - A Fifa game - A Batman game - A Sports game (NHL, NFL, NBA).</p>
<p>I obviously mean the older games when I mentions the games above. It's not like they will give us the recent version of the games listed above.</p>
<p>They seem to be giving out older version of games that have new sequels or what have you. This is speculation, but it seems to be the trend from MS.</p>
<p>Only time will tell... 8 games left.</p>
<p>As much as I may not agree with all the titles they are giving out, Free is Free, and in this economy, I won't complain much.</p>

<p>I think in December, they should give us a random game as they have been doing, but near christmas time (Between 20 -26 for me) They should let the gold members chose 3 games of their personal choice between them dates so everyone is happy and gets what
 they want for the Xbox, i personally don't like the games they have put up and wish the whole time i could chose my own 2 games each month.</p>

<p>Actually, Xbox is going to keep the Games With Gold promo going even beyond 12/31/2013. &nbsp;But, if we're making suggestions for games, I'd kinda be interested in seeing Earth Defense Force for an arcade title, and maybe Mass Effect as a Games On Demand title.
 &nbsp;Of course, if they wanted to toss some Minecraft at us, I would be fine with that, too.</p>

<p>It would be great if Microsoft made these games free in September, The Escapists, Dungeon Defenders, Sim 2, and Destiny. If they only picked one of the four up on my list make it The Escapist.
</p>
<p>P.S. The main games I want are The Escapists, and Dungeon Defenders being backwards compatible from 360.</p>

    <title>Marriage - just not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> poker lich  say:</h3>
<h2>            Marriage - just not working</h2>
                    
<p>Ok, at this point I really have had enough of Bethesda and their glitchy games. Looking online, getting married in Skyrim seems to have a multitude of problems, and now it's just cost me about a day's worth of playing.</p>
<p>It starts with me talking to Marathal, getting the marriage option, but then nothing happening when he askes me if I understand how marriage works. I pick one of the answers, and it just leaves the dialogue. Being a semi-intelligent sort, I figured out to
 just talk to my follower anyway (in this case Jenassa), and get her to agree, we set up the ceremony, etc.&nbsp; However, after waiting for a day and walking back into the temple, I walk up to the altar where Jenassa and Marathal are waiting,&nbsp;and when I get there,
 nothing happens. We just all stand there, I can't move except to look around, no one talks. I tried reloading the autosave from entering the temple, and that got him to raise his arms and move his lips, but no words, nothing. I try waiting, nothing. Of course,
 waitning overrides my autosaves, so I the only way out was to use my last manual save, which I don't do all that often and cost me about a day's worth of playing.</p>
<p>It's a shame, because I'd have to say 2 of my top 3 game series were Elder Scrolls and Fallout, but now I've just had my fill of Bethesda and their rushed-to-market games loaded with glitches. I don't know why they constantly seem to have to rush their games
 through production, and why they can't just meet their deadlines so they can release a reasonably glitch-free game, but at this point I truly believe Skyrim will be the last Bethesda game I ever buy.</p>

<p>Did you reload a previous save? that usually works or try clearing the game cache itself I think the buttons you press are LB, RB and x and hold them till the bethesda logo shows up. If that does not work. then try clearing the regular system cache if not
 then i really don't know what to do.</p>

<p>Your game is obviously glitched for some reason. But, how can you blame Bethesda for a glitchy game when the marriage option works just fine for so many of us? &nbsp;I also see people complaining about freezes, long screen loading times, dead NPCs needed for
 a quest, etc. &nbsp;I did 3 playthroughs, got 1000/1000 gamerscore, and had none of those problems. &nbsp;It's a mystery to me why some have problems and some don't. If the game coding were at fault, wouldn't we ALL have the same problems? &nbsp;

<p>Just for the record, by definition a glitch is something that can't be explained or expected, so it can't always be reproduced exactly every time. So the answer to your question is NO, you wouldn't necessarily ALL have the same problem if the game was glitched.
 Sometime it glitches, sometimes it doesn't.</p>

    <title>Random Blue Screen Bugcheck 124 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bits8mybytes  say:</h3>
<h2>            Random Blue Screen Bugcheck 124 </h2>
                    
<p>original title:&nbsp;Random BSoD's, random reboot, hardware issue, driver issue, system crash, tried almost everything! Please Help__</p>
<p>My computer has been randomly crashing for the past couple of months since I bought Windows 7 Professional edition. I was previously running windows XP with no problems except for a faulty hard drive about a year ago. This issue was fixed and I had no BSOD
 problems until I switched to windows 7. I dual boot Ubuntu 10.04 LTS on this computer. In Ubuntu I can leave my computer running for days, and even up to a full week with zero problems.<br />
My Windows 7 problem is that my computer randomly crashes. It will sometimes give a blue screen, and sometimes it will just reboot and not write a dump file; even though I have unclicked automatically restart in the control panel and clicked write a dump file
 when there is a crash. This doesn't make sense to me, but this is what happens. I noticed that the computer is more likely to randomly restart when there are multiple USB drives connected. I have had this problem for a while now and it occurs completely randomly.
 It happened 6 times while writing this post!!! I know my hardware works fine because in XP, and in Linux there are zero problems. I think Windows 7 has a ton of bugs and I am experiencing a lot of them.<br />
What have I done so far to help fix the solution? I have updated the BIOS, run a file system check, run a complete disk check, ran a memory test, updated all the drivers for all the devices I use with my computer, and updated Windows 7 and all software I use
 with the computer on a regular basis. I have ran virus checks, and have read as many forum posts as possible. Some of these posts have lead me to make small BIOS changes, and other changes like turning off all the sleep mode functions. It seems like a lot
 of people are having similar problems to me. I have downloaded and used the "who crashed my PC" and the blue screen viewer. The best answer from these is it is a hardware issue, hal.dll being a culprit. This doesn't mean anything to me because I know for a
 fact that my hardware is fine; I have ran all the tests, and my computer functions perfectly fine in other OS's. I have even reformatted my hard drive and did a clean re-install of Windows 7. And I still found my computer to randomly crash. OK I could go on
 and on but I will try and describe my machine now:<br />
OS: Windows 7 Professional OEM<br />
Mother Board: Abit KN9SLI<br />
Sound Card: Integrated to motherboard realtek chip; ALC883<br />
Network: nForce Nvidia chipset integrated with MoBo<br />
Video Card: ATI Radeon HD 4870 Series 1Gb memory GDDR5<br />
RAM: PC3200 (I believe it is 3200, it is def. a compatable version for the MoBo) 4*2 Gig sticks = total 8 Gig (All the RAM is the exact same model/brand)<br />
CPU: AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual Core 6400+<br />
Mouse: Razor Death Adder<br />
Harddrive /w Windows 7 OS: Western Digital Cavier 500 GB<br />
Extra File storage drive: Western Digital Cavier 1TB<br />
Printer: HP Photosmart 2575<br />
PSU: Thermaltake 750W<br />
AntiVirus: BitDefender<br />
As stated earlier I really think the hardware is fine because all the tests I ran were passed, and the computer works in Ubuntu 9.10, Ubuntu 10.04, and Windows XP Pro. But then again I could be wrong. And there is no heating issues either I check that too.
 My case has run open with a window open and a cold breeze and still managed to randomly crash.<br />
I am starting to think it could be a faulty driver or my hard drive could be broken, but anyways here is an example critical error I get if the computer BSoD's:<br />
- &lt;Event xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/win/2004/08/events/event"&gt;<br />

Thank you very much for reading this, and would appreciate any help. I also don't have time to test every single driver and windows service to find the issue because sometimes I will not get a BSoD for 24 hours, which makes the troubleshooting in safe mode/clean
 boot an unrealistic approach. I've seen this as a toubleshooting solution on multiple forum posts and in my case it could take a month to successfully troubleshoot my computer. If all else fails I may have to go back to using XP and wait until SP1 and or SP2
 comes out for Windows 7...</p>

<p>Hello I would like to comment that the problem may be fixed (fingers crossed). It has been 24+ hours since my machine has been running, and I have run a CPU stress test, left firefox open, left adobe illustrator open, and played computer games. I have done
 all the things that would normally cause the machine to crash besides leaving any USB thumb drives in. That will be the next test, but I am happy with the performance so far. I would like to give people some hints and help that have similar problems to me.</p>
<p>First off make sure you download all the Windows 7 updates, and update your BIOS, update all your devices, and make sure all your drivers are the must current. I noticed that sometimes the drivers provided by the board manufacturer are not the most recent
 so make sure you visit the website of your specific devices such as Nvidia if you have an Nvidia chipset, or realtek if you use a realtek sound chip (mine was the ALC883).</p>
<p>If you have an older comp, pre-vista there are some legacy setting in your BIOS that may be turned on. I found that once I turned these settings off my computer did not crash (as of yet fingers still crossed :-) ). Anyways the setting I think that helped
 was<strong> disabling BIOS cacheable</strong> . I read an article that explains this is a legacy feature for when OS's communicated with the BIOS to control the hardware (in some cases), and it can cause system instability and crashes in newer OS's such as
 Vista and 7. I also<strong> disabled the AMD Cool and Quiet</strong> feature in the BIOS. I found my problem occurred when my machine had little to no load on the CPU and after it had been running for 10 minutes plus. I'm guessing this feature does not play
 well with Windows 7 for some reason. I also made sure to disable all the put computer to sleep, or put hard drive to sleep features in the power settings.</p>
<p>For those of you who have similar problems you may actually have a hardware problem. I don't think it was my hardware due to the fact that my computer was able to run without any problems in other OS's (Ubuntu 9.10, Ubuntu 10.04, and Windows XP Pro SP 1,2,&amp;3).
 I found a great tool to narrow down your problems is the Windows debugger. Download the windows SDK and follow this helpful article for reading your .dmp files when you have a crash (Make sure you run the WinDbg as administrator so you can read your dump files):<a href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/2005/041105-windows-crash.html?page=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.networkworld.com/news/2005/041105-windows-crash.html?page=2</a></p>
<p>I found that after reading my minidump files found in C:\Windows\Minidump that the problem was in fact related to a caching issue of my processor. Normally the fix would be buy a new chip, but I luckily was able to run CPU tests to determine that my CPU
 was in fact healthy. But the caching error may be from a conflict of the BIOS sharing the same memory space as Windows 7 which would cause a crash. After disabling those BIOS features my computer has been able to run for an extended period of time without
 a reboot!</p>
<p>Another issue could be related to my computer over heating, I have also left my case open and found that a wire was actually jamming an exhaust fan next to the CPU. I cleared the wire and let my computer run with its case open. So for those of you having
 a reboot with no Blue Screen just a hard reboot it is probably related to a heating issue. This only applies if you have made sure to check the show a Blue Screen feature in the control panel. Right click your "my computer" or "computer" from the start menu
 and click properties. Click advanced system settings and then click start up and recovery settings. Make sure automatically restart is unchecked and make sure write and event to the system log is checked.</p>
<p>Anyways I hope these solutions can help anyone who has upgraded their older machines and found their system crashing randomly. Thanks to all who replied I have been having this problem since February and I hope this time it has been solved.</p>

            Hi Ismael
<br />
<br />When is this popup appearing, is that when Windows 10 Starts up or is that during your session repeatedly?
<br />
<br />Can you please provide a screenshot of what you are seeing, so we can provide a solution for you . . 
<br />
<br />How to do that:
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type snip and hit Enter - this will open the Snipping Tool
<br />
<br />Set Mode to Full Screen, then click New to take a screenshot
<br />
<br />Save that file to your Desktop and close the Snipping Tool
<br />
<br />Then in your next post, click the second last button on the toolbar above your post to select that image and upload it to your post . . .       
        </p>

            Hi IsmaelVaLVERDE,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />This generally gets triggered from scheduled tasks. Type scheduler in Cortana search &gt; Click Task Scheduler and see which task is invoking this. Delete that task if not needed.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

<br />Could you also check whats starting up with the system?
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Task Manager
<br />Click Startup
<br />
<br />See if there any suspicious programs listed there that you can display.

            Hi Ismael.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />2) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi,</p>
</span><span>
<p>
</p><p>Apologize for the difficulties that you're experiencing regarding this issue and also for the delay in getting back to
</p>
<p>you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to check if the issue occurs in <strong>Safe Mode with Networking</strong>.</p>
<strong>
<p>
</p><p>Step 1: <strong>Safe Mode with Networking</strong></p>
</strong>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Safe mode with Networking</strong> starts Windows in safe mode and includes the network drivers, services needed to access the Internet or other computers on your network.</p>
<p>Refer below link to Enable Safe Mode with Networking.</p>
</span>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><span>Start your PC in safe mode in
 Windows 10 </span></span></span></span></strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Please restart the computer to start in normal mode.</span></p>
<span><strong>
<p>
</p><p>Step 2: Perform Clean Boot</p>
</strong>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue does not persists in Safe Mode, then perform a <strong>Clean Boot
</strong>to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as Clean Boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.
</p>
</span>
<p>
</p><p><span>To do this, refer below article on how to perform a Clean Boot in Windows.<br />
</span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></span></strong></a></p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> The troubleshooting steps in the above link are meant for windows 8, however, you can use the same for windows 10 as well.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> After clean boot troubleshooting steps, refer to the section "<strong>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot</strong>" in the provided link to return your computer to Normal startup mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please post back with the status of the issue and we will be glad to assist you further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Cannot download daily challenges&#47;new packs for Jigsaw in Windows 10</h2>
                    Title pretty much says it all. I can play jigsaw, but the daily challenges just say they are downloading with no progress, same with new packs. If I go to the calendar of the daily challenges, none of the days load. They all just have the spinning loader
 icon.&nbsp; I have only gotten one daily challenge puzzle to load for the entire month of August. My husband is on the same internet connection as I am and he has been able to download all of the puzzles fine.&nbsp; I have verified that Windows Firewall is not blocking
 the traffic. I also don't have this issue with Solitaire or Mahjong- the dailies load fine for those.

<br />
Check with Nvidia Support and their forums as even the driver site has information on the Control Panel<br />
for that driver.<br />

<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Check hardware</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Make sure your printer is turned on and connected to your PC. Many printing problems are caused by hardware that isn't set up quite right. Here are ideas to solve common problems with printer hardware.</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p style="margin-left: 60px"><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1.&nbsp; Check the power.&nbsp;
</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Make sure that the printer's electrical cord is plugged into an electrical outlet and that the power switch is turned on. If you're printing to a shared printer or a printer on a network, make sure that all necessary
 computers and routers are turned on too. If your printer or other equipment is plugged in to a surge protector or a backup power supply, make sure that hardware is plugged in and turned on as well.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px"><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2.&nbsp; Check the cables (wired printers).&nbsp;
</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Make sure that the printer cable is properly connected from the printer to your PC.<br />

<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Make sure the printer’s wireless option is turned on and available. Many printers have a button that displays a blue wireless icon when wireless is available. To learn where this button is located on your printer and to find instructions
 about how to turn it on, see the manual that came with the printer.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Run the printer’s wireless connectivity test. Many printers have a menu option to test the printer’s wireless connectivity. Read the instructions that came with the printer or check the printer manufacturer’s
 website for instructions about how to do this.<br />

<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Update drivers</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Most printers require driver software to work properly. If you recently upgraded from one version of Windows to another, it's possible that the current printer driver is for the previous version of Windows and may not work with Windows 10. If you've
 had recent power outages, viruses, or other computer problems, it's possible that the drivers have become damaged. Downloading and installing the latest driver for your printer can resolve these types of problems.
<br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
Here are three ways to find and install a driver:</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p style="margin-left: 60px"><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1. Use Windows Update</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">‍.
</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Windows Update might have an updated version of your printer driver. To update your drivers using Windows Update follow the steps in the article

<span>&nbsp;<br />
<span>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px"><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2. Install software from the printer manufacturer‍</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">.
</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If your printer came with a disc, that disc might contain software that installs a driver for the printer.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px"><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">3. Download and install the driver yourself</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">‍.
</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">You can search for a driver on the manufacturer's website. Try this if Windows Update can't find a driver for your printer, and the printer didn't come with software that installs a driver. To download and install a driver
 yourself:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If Windows can't find a driver for your printer, and the printer didn't come with driver software, you can look for a driver on the manufacturer's website. Driver updates are often available in the support section of such websites.
 Locate and download the latest driver for your printer.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Follow the driver installation instructions on the website. Most drivers are self-installing—after you download them, you usually double-tap or double-click the file to begin the installation, and then the
 driver installs itself on your PC.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Some printers have drivers that aren't self-installing. If you download a driver that isn't self-installing, follow these steps.

            So far, every time I allow a Windows Build to install the nearby HP 7525 printer the Build later sends a driver update which fails over and over again. In order to prevent a build up of failures in the update system I have to uninstall the printer to stop
 the updates. This has been going on for a long time. Would really prefer to have a generic driver that works and stop the updates or get this thing right. HP is not helpful here as it wants to install software to nag me about buying their ink. I know where
 to buy the ink.&nbsp; Would prefer they spend some time on fixing their programming and drivers. HP software takes up much more storage than necessary as well. Simple driver please.... .

            <p>I also have had trouble trying to print e-mail messages &amp; attachments in Outlook (Windows 10).&nbsp; By luck, I discovered how to fix this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open up Settings.</p>
<p>Choose Devices.</p>
<p>Open up Printers.</p>
<p>When you see "Let Windows Manage My Default Printer", make sure the option selected is "ON".&nbsp; Somehow mine was set on "OFF" -- not sure how, maybe an update from Outlook (they like to change things around just for the sake of change, and because they can).</p>

            I am having problems printing Word and Excel documents from my desktop. &nbsp;For example, when I print a Word document--even if I've printed it many times in the past--will not show the words I've typed. &nbsp;It does display anything that was hard formatted on
 the document--such as a church logo. &nbsp;I have connected my printer to my laptop and the documents print perfectly--so I don't believe the problem is with the printer. &nbsp; The print jobs worked fine on Saturday, but not since then. &nbsp;I can print PDF files without
 any problem. &nbsp;Would anyone know what has happened?

<p>Greetings,<br />
I have an HP printer that depends on Win10 software to print from my (really great one year old DELL) PC that came with WIN 10.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>Correction:&nbsp; HP unit states paper jam is clear and the unit functions perfectly except when trying to print from my WIN 10 unit regardless of the source of the document for print.&nbsp; The WIN 10 software is the only part of this picture that still thinks there's
 a paper jam. This is a WIN 10 bug that needs fixing.</p>

<p>I had that issue after a WIN10 software update.&nbsp; I had to roll back the update to get it to work again.&nbsp; Also check your browser updates b/c sometimes the browser and WIN updates are released in close proximity and have conflicts requiring one or the other

    <title>Topgun II Lightgun Driver Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> realgonekid  say:</h3>
<h2>            Topgun II Lightgun Driver Problem </h2>
                    I have a Topgun II Light Gun which worked previously on XP. I have downloaded latest drivers from web site. These drivers are not installable, But I cannot get Windows 7 to look where they are as I could in XP. "Browse for File Folder Location" (Or something
 like that).<br />
If I could do that I'm sure Compatibility issues could be further addressed. This Is the only Light Gun that works properly with large Flat LCD and Plasma TV/Monitor Displays, And it s also very expensive. It seems very odd that this issue is such a problem
 on Windows 7, As would be the case for all un-installable drivers. If I knew where to put the drivers so that Windows 7 would find them that would be great, I have tried putting the Folder I extracted in C:/Windows/System 32 And C:/Windows/System 32/Drivers.
 Neither Worked. I understand that the loose files may be needed to be in one of these directories to work, but I didn't want to add a load of lose files into a critical system folder.<br />
Any Help would be appreciated.<br />
Thanks in advance...<br />

<div>Hi,</div>
<div><br />
I suggest that you download Topgun II Light Gun drivers for vista 32 bit Operating System and install it in vista compatibility mode.<br />
To do this:<br />
1. Locate the installer.exe or setup.exe file in your file system and right-click on the file.<br />
2. From the contextual menu, choose Properties &gt; Compatibility.<br />
3. Choose the version of Windows you want to emulate and select the “Run this program in compatibility mode” checkbox.
<br />
4. Run the installer</div>
<div><br />
If you need further information on the above provided steps then you can follow the link provided below.

<h2>            HP LaserJet 3100 All-in-One Printer</h2>
                    I think there are probably a substantial number of us out here with a printer we like and no driver that is compatible with Windows 7 to make it useful.&nbsp; I have a computer running XP just to maintain this printer.&nbsp; I don't understand why one of the 3000
 series or 3200 series printer drivers couldn't be adapted to use for the 3100. I admit I don't know anything about writing code, but when these printers were sold, they were not the bottom of the line, and it seems unreasonable to just drop support of the
 product when it is the operating system changing that makes the printer obsolete.&nbsp; I notice that the printer is still supported when you want to buy a toner cartridge.&nbsp; If anyone finds a fix for this, please post.

Hi</p>
<p>Your frustration is understandable.</p>
<p>A newer operating system must include all of the latest technology in software and hardware development. Unfortunately, a by-product of this is that some legacy software and hardware device drivers&nbsp;will no longer work in the newer OS.</p>
<p>Third party software and hardware are the proprietary property of the manufacturers that develop those products. Microsoft or any other company cannot develop drivers or provide software updates for these products. Even the drivers that you download from&nbsp;Windows
 Update must be licensed and tested before Microsoft is allowed to distribute them.</p>
<p>Windows Update Driver Publishing: <br />
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/gg487521#ETD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/gg487521#ETD</a><br />
</p>
<p>Microsoft does maintain a complete division to assist hardware developers with building the drivers for those products.</p>
<p>WHDC: Develop Hardware for Windows: <br />
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/default.aspx</a><br />
</p>
<p>Windows 7 has the largest number of Compatibility options of any previous version of Windows&nbsp;to help with making legacy drivers work with the new OS.</p>
<p>HOW TO: Install a Hardware Device Driver using Compatibility Mode: <br />
<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itprohardware/thread/80cae5ee-dc98-4a2f-8284-a1ab826059b7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itprohardware/thread/80cae5ee-dc98-4a2f-8284-a1ab826059b7</a><br />

<p>Hi Nigt,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>What is the exact error message you are getting?</p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Have you made any changes to your computer recently?</p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Are you facing this issue with any other applications?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to follow the methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 1: Perform a clean boot and check if it helps.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</a></p>
<p>Make sure that you enable Nero services in this troubleshooting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NOTE: Make sure that you perform “step 7” in the above link to boot your computer normally after your troubleshoot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 2: <span>&nbsp;</span>Run System File Check (SFC) scans and checks if it helps.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</a></p>
<p>Note: System File Checker gives an administrator the ability to scan all protected files to verify their versions. If System File Checker discovers that a protected file has been overwritten, it retrieves the correct version of the file from the cache folder
 (%Systemroot%\System32\Dllcache) or the Windows installation source files, and then replaces the incorrect file. System File Checker also checks and repopulates the cache folder. You must be logged on as an administrator or as a member of the Administrators
 group to run System File Checker. If the cache folder becomes damaged or unusable, you can use the
<b>sfc /scannow</b>, the <b>sfc /scanonce</b>, or the <b>sfc /scanboot</b> commands to repair its contents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 3: Perform a disk clean up and check if it helps.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Delete-files-using-Disk-Cleanup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Delete-files-using-Disk-Cleanup</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 4: You can also try to perform a Check Disk and check if it helps.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Check-a-drive-for-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Check-a-drive-for-errors</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue still persists, try to contact Nero again and check if it helps.</p>

<h2>            can&#39;t close current tab in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Close tab(s) to back up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Previous versions of Windows allowed me to "close all tabs" or "close current tab".&nbsp; Windows 10 only allows all or nothing.&nbsp; Why is this?&nbsp; It is certainly not an improvement.</p>

            <p>I have also found the missing 'Close Current Tab'&nbsp;annoying. I cannot find it anywhere on my screen. This is definitely not an improvement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Someone elsewhere has suggested that pressing Ctrl &amp; w will close the current tab. It seems to work for me.</p>

    <title>Unable to find a folder from the saved location but is visible in - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to find a folder from the saved location but is visible in search bar</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Lost a folder....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok so a few days ago I opened a little movie file that I had on my computer on another drive than my main windows drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I tried to find it again and it's gone. To be a little more specific, the folder in which the movie file was situated is completely gone from my windows explorer. The particular folder was located in a map with other subfolders, none of them is gone,
 only this particular one. I have not done anything with the files or folders on this drive since opening the movie for the last time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can find the folder when I use the search tool, however I cannot open it. I also cannot find the movie file in this way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had some PC crashes in the past few days, I wonder if these might have anything to do with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot find the folder in my bin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to recover this folder and in particular this movie file?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to ask for any additional info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance, Xentro</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can find the folder&nbsp;through the search bar, then&nbsp;I suspect you accidently moved the folder to other location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you&nbsp;try the following steps and see if it helps.</p>
<p>1. Press <strong>Windows key </strong>and type your folder name. (Do not click Enter after typing)</p>
<p>2. Once your folder appear in the suggestions, <strong>right-click</strong> on it and select
<strong>Open file location</strong>.</p>
<p>3. You will be directed to the file location, copy your folder from that location and paste it to your desired location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To Paste - press <strong>Ctrl + V</strong></p>
<p>To Copy- press <strong>Ctrl + C</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.&nbsp; Please respond if you have further related queries.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Jesinta Rozario&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes, you can purchase gold via the website. It is tied to your account so as long as you're signed into the same account on the website when you purchase the gold it will be available on the console.</p>
<p>Gold is no longer required in order to use apps. You do need a Netflix subscription though.</p>
