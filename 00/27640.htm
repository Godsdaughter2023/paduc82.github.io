    <title>PPT 2007 Automatic Slide Advance Not Working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> winkinvan  say:</h3>
<h2>            PPT 2007 Automatic Slide Advance Not Working</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I'm using PPT 2007 with Win 7 (32 bit, Home Premium). I'm an intermediate to advanced user and have created numerous presentations.</p>
<p>Recently, I have been unable to get PPT to advance slides within a given time frame (e.g. 5 seconds). Most recent example I selected all 23 slides, clicked on<strong>Animations</strong> , unchecked the
<strong>On Mouse Click</strong> box and checked the<strong>Automatically After</strong> box. I inserted 00:05 in the dialogue area. I then clicked<strong>Slide Show &gt;&gt; Record Narration
</strong>and after checking to ensure that the microphone levels were accurate, I clicked<strong>OK
</strong>and began talking. The slide never moved on. It stayed on the first slide. After about 15 seconds, I hit the space bar and it moved on, but that's not what I want, I want it to move on to the next slide automatically.</p>
<p>Any suggestions as to what I can do to soplve this problem would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<hr />

            Record narration doesn't work like that (Well I don't think so). You need&nbsp; to record your narration pressing space to move on when finished. The timings will be auto applied to your slides when you finish.

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>Thanks for your prompt response.</p>
<p>I forgot to mention that I had done this once before - i.e. set automatic slide advance and then recorded with those settings. It is a presentation form called pecha kucha that is gaining popularity. Youtube has many examples if you're interested. So I think
 PPT does allow for this type of process. I just can't get it to work again.</p>
<p>Any other thoughts that people have would be appreciated.</p>

<p>OK John. If that's so, how do people set up kiosk presentations where PPT slides continue to click through with a voice over?</p>
<p>Thanks for continuing to follow up with me. This is a mission critical piece for me to figure out.</p>

            In the way I said. You record the narration clicking space to move on and PPT records the timing and uses it to play back the show. That's a different thing to setting the timing first and expecting slides to change while you record the narration. Like
 I said though I'm very happy if someone knows a secret setting!

<p>The data is in the app on the Windows phone. App data can only be accessed by the phone.

<p>If you contact the app developer they will say the same.</p>

<p><span>Thank you for choosing Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Since you have Windows 8.1 the steps would be little different.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In order to troubleshoot compatibility for Excel you may try the steps below:</span></p>
<p><span>You need to go to programfiles folder:</span></p>
<p><span>· Hold <strong>Windows key</strong> + <strong>R</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>· In Run window type or copy and paste the following command<strong> %programfiles%</strong></span></p>
<p><span>· Go to Microsoft Office, <strong>Office 15</strong> and look for <strong>
Excel.exe</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>· Right click on Excel.exe and <strong>click on Troubleshoot Compatibility</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>· Then click on <strong>recommended settings</strong> and test the program.</span></p>
<p><span>· If it works fine, then you may click on next and save the settings.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know the result.</span></p>

            <p>If Microsoft can't find an answer, here is a partial workaround for all those with this error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open Word (Excel ...) from your Start menu. Then choose file you wish to edit. There will be an error with recovery files, but you can close it and work.</p>
<p>I still can't open the file with double click on it.</p>
<p>MS be a shame.</p>

<h2>            calendar user interface and adhd &#40;attention deficit hyperactivity disorder&#41;</h2>
                    <div>
<p>In my organization (recently we have invested in O365) there is an employee with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It is nearly impossible for him to work in Office 2013. 2010 is a little better. For him we have installed Outlook 2010, but there are still a few issues, that actually consume hours of his daily worktime.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><em><strong>Are there any ways to solve this?</strong></em><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This applies to Outlook 2010 and/or 2013, desktop.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
</p>
<p><strong>1 </strong>Main issue with Office 2013 is that the insterface is low on contrast. Is there any way to change this (without changing the Windows appearance - he does not need high contrast because of poor eyesight but to be abe to focus mentally and
 find things on the screen)?<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
</p>
<p><strong>2 Calendar colouring</strong><br />
</p>
<p><strong>A)</strong> Calendars change colour when turned visible/unvisible/visible. That is, person A is green one day, but red the next day. Very confusing. The employee starts every Outlook session with re-colouring calendars in the "right" way.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>B)&nbsp;</strong> If other people use colouring for different categories in their shared calendars, the colours also show up in his calendar. The calendar of person A may in this way be green, pink and red, which is confusing since there may also be a
 person B wh has a pink calendar.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>C)</strong> Only 9 colours in 2013 - but 15 in 2010. Why???? Really makes his sorting difficult.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
</p>
<p><strong>3 Calendar sorting</strong><br />
</p>
<p>When starting Outlook, different calendars are visible "on top" of the other calendars. The employee wishes to always have the own main calendar "on top" when starting.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
</p>
<p><strong>4 Calendar "tabs"</strong><br />
</p>
<p>When in overlapping view, the employee really dislikes the standard Outlook tabs, and wishes for a cleaner gui, such as Google calendar. This may seem like a minor issue, but for the employee it's not.<br />
</p>
<p>Outlook vs Google (tabs top vs "clean" top)<br />

<h2>            music starts playing after end coversation</h2>
                    
<p>Hi. I have stopped media player, walked into a meeting, and put the phone on silent. My phone rings! It's ok, because the phone is on silent, however, after it stops ringing, music starts playing and it's really loud. It plays through the phone speakers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anyone had an issue with this? I would love to resolve this issue asap because It's happened a number of times, especially when I don't want it to.</p>

<h2>            PC Suite, Bluetooth and Windows 7 - Cannot authenicate phone&#63;</h2>
                    I had real problems getting PC Suite to connect via bluetooth to my 6300 phone.&nbsp; I'm using a CSR type dongle which installed via plug and play using the Microsoft drivers.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I installed PC suite and followed the instruction to "connect a phone".&nbsp;&nbsp; The phone was discovered and pairing attempted using the default 123 passkey.&nbsp; I entered the passkey into the phone.&nbsp; PC suite sat there for about 5 minutes, then came back with "Cannot
 authenicate phone".&nbsp; This was tiresomely repeatable!<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
After much messing about I finally got the PC suite to authenticate the phone and its all working finel.&nbsp; Here is what I did in case this helps anyone with the same problem:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li>Install PC Suite.</li><li>From the Windows Start Menu In "Devices and Printers" the bluetooth device should be visible - Mine shows "CSR Bluetooth Radio"</li><li>Check the Bluetooth settings of the device "Allow Bluetooth devices to connect to this computer" should checked</li><li>Still in" Devices and Printers", click on "Add Device", if the Bluetooth is working correctly, this should scan bluetooth and discover the phone (make sure the phone is set to visible or discoverable).<br />
(An alternative method is to open Control Panel, under the "Hardware and Sound, there should be "Add Bluetooth device" option under "Devices and Printers". )</li><li>Select the phone and follow the instructions and pair the PC with phone.&nbsp; This will involve entering the passkey generated by Windows<br />
If successful the phone should now appear in the Devices list.&nbsp; I now see "Nokia 6300" as a device.</li><li><strong>The next steps are the ones I was missing</strong>: right click on the phone device and select Properties and then the "Services" tab<br />
Windows should access the phone device for the services offered by the bluetooth phone.</li><li>Check mark the following services:<br />
Dial-up Networking [DUN]<br />
Serial Port (SPP) 'COM1'<br />
Serial Port (SPP) 'Nokia PC Suite'<br />
and click ok</li><li>Start up PC Suite and go through the "connect phone" procedure again and it should now connect successfully.</li></ol>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hope this works for you<br />
<br />
Chris

<h2>            Outlook 2013&#58; no horizontal scrolling in navigation area &#38; wrong concept to mark mail folders wirh unread mails</h2>
                    <p>This thread includes two related topics/questions about Outlook 2013. I use Windows 7 btw.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Background: To maintain a good&nbsp;view over my work, and to have quick access to all mails related to a certain project, I sort all my mails into specific mail folders.</p>
<p>So I have a fairly huge amount of folders and subfolders - at the moment approx. 150.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In some of the folders are mails marked as "unread". Some of them really contain to-dos, some of them contain important information I want to get back to form time to time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Outlook 2003, all folders with unread mails were marked by displaying the folder's name with bold face. This was really helpful, as it highlighted pending work at first sight. With Outlook 2013, this feature seems to be gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's left is: displaying the number of unread messages behind the folder's name.</p>
<p>This is not helpful at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because to see that number,</p>
<p>- we either have to enlarge the navigation area (folder area) until all folder names can be seen in full length - result for me would be that the navigation area would use half of the screen, so that is not an option,</p>
<p>- or we should be possible to scroll to the right - which apparently is also not possible anymore in Outlook 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my questions (or bug reports) are:</p>
<p>1) How can I activate a horizontal scrollbar in Outlook's mail navigation area?</p>
<p>2) How can I activate the feature that marks folders that contain unread mails in bold face?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone can help me there. (Please don't post workarounds like "Keep you folder's names short", I have my reasons. :-))</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>(P.S.: Bizarrely enough, a horizontal scrollbar shows up whenever I want to rename a mail folder. Nevertheless, this scrollbar doesn't work at all, but disappears whenever i click on it - maybe some relic from&nbsp;older Outlook versions. Surely not "works as
 designed")</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thank you for posting the question in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes as you have stated the unread folder in Office 2013 do not display in bold.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to easily access the unread folder you may add the unread folder to the
<span>favorite’s </span>folder which would be displayed in the navigation pane.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In order to add the folder to the favorites list, you may right click on the unread folder and then click show in favorites.</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you for the reply to the second of my two questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sadly, the answer did not help me at all.</p>
<p>The only real information I&nbsp;can find&nbsp;in the reply is that I have another reason for despair with Office 2013. There seems to be no way to mark the folders containing unread messages in a highly visible and accessible way like in previous Outlook versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So as a WORKAROUND to deal with Microsoft's decision to remove this really useful feature in Outlook 2013, "Microsoft" advises me to invest MUCH more of my own time just to administrate my folders!?</p>
<p>The suggestion to use the "favorites list" only means that I have to manually(!!) add folders to this list as soon as I put an unread mail there, and to manually delete the folder from the list as soon as I read the last unread mail in this folder.</p>
<p>Sorry, but this is simply not maintainable.</p>
<p>Removing the "highlighting" feature (display in bold) noticably reduces my work efficiency as it is, because it hampers quick orientation. The suggested workaround would reduce my speed even more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, to rephrase the question in a constructive way: What do I have to do to persuade Microsoft to reactivate the helpful "highlighting" feature?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I would also be thankful to hear a Statement about my first question, the missing horizontal scroll bar in the navigation pane.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(P.S.: I'm actually sorry if my post should&nbsp;sound impatient or impolite. No harm intended! Office 2013 is plainly frustrating in so many details, it strongly challenges my friendliness.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>(P.P.S.: Out of curiosity, I tried to follow the suggestion anyway: I right-clicked one of my mail folders. But there was no context menu entry to add this folder to my favorites. As it turned out after a bit of experimentation, this context entry is only
 available if I chose a certain display setting for the navigation pane, by clicking on the "Mail" icon in the navigation bar. Well, this "view" is absolutely useless for me, because it doesn't contain notes, contacts and other folders that I use in high frequency
 every day and hour. And in addition, the design slows down my orientation. I always work with the Display setting "Folders", not "Mail". Favorites don't appear in this display setting.)</p>

            The total lack of an answer to your excellent question regarding the horizontal scroll bar that you asked in April (now 5 months ago as of my writing this) is just one more of many reasons why I've canceled my Office 365 Subscription and will soon move
 back to Office 2007.<br />

            <p>try this: shrink the width of the email and see if the horizontal scroll bar appears. &nbsp;I have all my emails coming in HTML. &nbsp;It appears when I do this. &nbsp;Not sure with other formats.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another way is to forward the email, select the message body and click format at the top, then on paragraph. Increase the right indent to at least 1"....if you still cannot read it, increase it some more.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it is not an answer, since it has nothing to do with my question(s). Please look closely: I didn't ask about the horizontal scroll bar in mail windows&nbsp;or message agents, but in the navigation area of Outlook.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Word for Mac Version 15.16</h2>
                    I have had my Mac for about three years now. When I purchased my Mac, I purchased a four year Microsoft University subscription to get me through college. The first two and a half years I didn't have a problem. However, last semester, word started to not
 respond when I would highlight, adjust bullets, change font colors, etc. This requires me to force quit the program and lose everything that I had completed. I reported this issue multiple times, but it continued to happen. I returned to school today, and
 now I cannot use anything in the bar that has the home, insert, design, etc. tabs. For example, I can click on the bulleting option, and choose to italicize, bold, or underline. However, anything from any of those tabs that requires a drop down does not work.
 I checked for updates and was hoping that would solve the problem, however, my microsoft is up to date. I don't know what to do. I use Microsoft Word for everything I do in school, and now I can't count on it to work. I considered

            Hi Aron
<br />
<br />This is being widely reported in the last few days, it seems to be caused by a bug in a recent update. hopefully Microsoft are now aware of this bug and will resolve this at the next opportunity
<br />
<br />It is, of course, not possible for an image file to take your data, this is an erroneous popup. In the meantime, you can right click any image file on the web and choose 'Save as Image, then use the Insert - Picture function to put the image into your document . . .

<h2>            Page reloads every 10 minutes</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm having trouble with IE8 refreshing/reloading the page I'm viewing every 10 minutes. This is very annoying if I try to play streams because every time the page is refreshed, it loses the stream and it stops. I can't find the settings to adjust the auto-refresh
 feature - please help...?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>M.</p>

<h2>            Another E63 question &#40;APN&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hey!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have sent my girlfriend a Nokia E63 (Australian model) to China.</p>
<p>It's unlocked so she can use it with her SIM.</p>
<p>But she is having many problems trying to get the APN settings.</p>
<p>The phone supports 3G but her old phone which is a Lenovo S700 she used GPRS on it (whether thats because it only supports GPRS or maybe her phone company (China Mobile) only allow GPRS for her current plan)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think i would need some APN settings for her to get the internet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have googled it and it seems that almost every google result is tleling me different settings which we have tried all of them but have had no luck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>she ahs spoken to China Mobile who have sent her some config file via SMS but still it did not work as they didnt have the config for the Nokia E63 so they sent her info for the E60 or something. which didnt work!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Was wondering if there's an area of the nokia site which tells you every APN setting?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did look but had no joy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks guys.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mart.</p>

<p>Network settings are available from the networks themselves.The E63 uses&nbsp;S60 3rd Edition, Feature Pack 1so they need to settings for another phone using trhe same S60 version. Popular FP1 phones are the N95 or N82. &nbsp; Failing that, you can get the settings
 from the network and set them up manually.</p>

If she fails to find anyone with an N95 or N82.<br />
How would she go about getting the settings from the network and setting them up manually?<br />

            I actually just thought of something....<br />
I can use her phone via her internet if i use the 'Connect to internet' setting on Nokia PC Suite.<br />
I select the carrier from the huge list of worldwide carriers and choose china mobile and bingo it works via the computer.<br />
BUT thats all well and good using it through the computer but i need to use the 3G net through the phone and not by the computer.<br />
Can i somehow look at the access point settings that Nokia PC Suite uses to connect her to china mobiles internet via the web?<br />
Is there an option within ~PC Suite to edit or look at what the China Mobile settings are?<br />
<br />
Thanks.

<p>You can contact the carrier directly for the settings or it may be available from their website.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is worth contacting them again and asking them to sms the setting for either an N95 or N82 directly to the phone. Also ask for the setting as a backup plan.</p>

    <title>Rough ride with 10041 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jack nothing  say:</h3>
<h2>            Rough ride with 10041</h2>
                    <p>Well, I've had to give up on Windows 10 and revert back to Windows 7 for the time being. I'm not going to say it was smart of me to use Windows 10 as anything other than a VM or alternate OS, but I also didn't expect I would be stuck on only my laptop for
 the past two months. Anyways, starting out, 9926 had me stuck with the no start menu issue, which I used the regedit fix to circumvent. When 10041 was pushed to the slow ring, I made sure to revert the fix. Updating to 10041 through 9926 was a success, but
 it still left me with no start menu. It got a lot worse though, as NO apps worked, and this includes the Settings app, which rendered me unable to do an update, rollback, or refresh. I couldn't use the search on the taskbar and, while I could bring up the
 other search function by right clicking the Windows icon, I couldn't start anything through the function. For some reason, Windows 10 stopped giving me a rollback option after booting up, so that was a no-go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My first attempt to fix this was by using a USB with 10041 to try to boot from USB and do a refresh. It wouldn't allow me to do that. Then I tried to run the setup through the USB instead. This was probably where my poor decision-making ruined me. running
 through the setup, I had the typical 6+ hour long hang other people have been noting. However, when it finished the first part, the "Setting up" that's 30% of the total installation, my computer simply stayed shut down instead of automatically restarting.
 Turning it back on, I got a blue screen with the message "SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED" error. It would then just restart loop. Uh Oh. Again, it never let me boot from the USB, every time I tried, it would just boot Windows 10 normally. As such, I was
 unable to refresh or use the system repair. The only option was to reinstall Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, after reinstalling Windows 7, and going through all the updates in case I needed to rollback, I decided to give 10041 another shot through the Windows update. It took 10 hours to get past the first setting up part. After that, the computer simply shut
 down instead of restarting. Sound familiar? Yep, exact same blue screen message, exact same restart loop. I had to reinstall Windows 7 again, and am currently reinstalling updates. It's a real shame, Windows 10 runs so much smoother. I was hoping I could deal
 with most of the bugs (I was even willing to tough out no start menu, but being wholly unable to update kind of ruins the point of flighting the OS), but this is a build I have to skip.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was really looking forward to the new feedback app, but oh well. This is how it needs to go when building a new OS. It's great there was finally a new build after two months, bad luck on my end that I can't participate. I REALLY don't feel like installing
 a separate partition/VM of Windows 10 when I have to use this laptop as my daily driver, but I thought it might be important to note I had this particular installing issue with USB installation as well as installing through Windows Update. I know there's a
 general thread about installation issues stickied, but I think the fact that my USB wouldn't work was worth an individual mention (as well as upgrading from Windows 7 straight to 10041). I also haven't noticed many people ending up with the same error I got,
 so it's possible that it's a hardware issue on my end (I will gladly provide whatever information on my specs that may be necessary if it sounds like this is the issue). Just thought it might be important to give what little feedback I can now that I have
 to bow out (for the time being) of the Tech Preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways, it's good to finally see new builds coming through. I know they're not supposed to be too stable yet, but I was hoping to get some feedback in. The performance of Windows 10 seems pretty darn solid to me (it's usually fully booted in the time it
 takes me to use the bathroom, and I'm not even on an SSD) compared to 7. I'm excited for the next build that comes to the slow ring, and I'm looking forward to coming back as soon as a build comes through that I can actually install.</p>

<h2>            Excel 2016 blank file when double click - Already tried almost every solution</h2>
                    <p>Hello<br />
<br />
So i have Excel 2016 and after i moved 1 file to another paste i got this problem. All files that i open by doubleclicking are blank. The only way to open any file is go to excel -&gt; open -&gt; and select the file.<br />
<br />
I have tried to unninstall and install; used the repair thing; checked the DDE thing; disabled graphics hardware accel; uncheck and checked all addons; tried the excel /unregserver and excel /regserver and tried to delete personal.xlsb under XLSTART but the
 folder was empty<br />
<br />
I did every solution that i found online but none solved. I had this problem some months ago and i think i solved changing some regedit thing but im not sure.<br />
<br />
What can i do?<br />
<br />
Windows 10 x64 1703</p>
<p>Office 365 Pro Plus (fully updated)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Double clicking on word and powerpoint files works&nbsp;</p>

<p>Based on the information you have provided, looks like there are residual files left from your previous installation of Office. We recommend that you download and run the Easy Fix tool on this

<p>
</p><p>I am running a new high-spec computer with Windows 10 installed, and using a recently paid subscription to Office 365. &nbsp;I have also been having a problem with searching my emails for specific requirements, and this has been ongoing for some weeks. &nbsp;I have
 installed Security Update KB 4022725 on 3rd July, and STILL there is this problem. &nbsp;I still get the message "Something went wrong, and your search couldn't be completed" &nbsp;I have tried to reset Outlook Indexing for Outlook 2013 &amp; 2016, but as far as I can see,
 there are no &nbsp;OST files in the Data files tab, only .pst.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I do next, as this is now well beyond a joke for many users.</p>

            Hi Mike,<br />
<br />
Conflict with the Windows Desktop Search Service is one of the possible reason why you are having a issue searching emails on your Outlook. To resolve this, we suggest that you follow the troubleshooting steps on this
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Outlook-known-issues-in-the-June-2017-security-updates-3f6dbffd-8505-492d-b19f-b3b89369ed9b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> and refer to the section<strong>, Issue #5: "Something went wrong..." or "Search results may be incomplete" error when searching in Outlook [FIXED]</strong>.<br />
<br />
Important: This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection,
 back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, refer to this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/322756/how-to-back-up-and-restore-the-registry-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Knowledge Base article</a>. <br />

<p>This took me some time to work out, as the word "link" did not appear to be linked anywhere, and it was only after several attempts of reading your response did I get the link to work. &nbsp;At one stage, Microsoft asked me 3 or 4 times to login with my password,
 even though I was fully logged in. &nbsp; I did as requested, went through File&gt;Office Account&gt;Update Options&gt; Update now, and was advised that all my updates were correct, up-to-date and in place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not recall ever seeing the screen message "Event Log warning.............."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see that the fix was issued on June 27th, It came to me directly from Microsoft on July 3rd with a large update that took approx 25 minutes to be installed, all of which was done automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume that as the fix has been released, I have downloaded and installed it, and the Status is now declared as fixed, there is no need for me to do anything else. &nbsp;However, in trying to carry out a simple search, I still get the message telling me that
 "Something went wrong.................couldn't be completed"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume that I still have to do something, but what?</p>

<p>G'day,</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, I'm afraid my problem is not resolved. &nbsp;The problem continues to bug me as of this minute.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe I am missing something. &nbsp;My understanding is that if the correct update has been installed, then the problem is resolved. &nbsp;By "resolved" I assume that the update will fix the problem automatically. &nbsp;Well, earlier this afternoon, I checked on the latest
 update to Windows 10. &nbsp;I did this via Settings, Update and Security, Update History. &nbsp;There I was advised that "Your device is up to date, last checked today (July 19th) at 10.29.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the responses I received in a post, lead me to believe that it may have been Office or Outlook that needed updating, so I visited the "What Version of Office am I using?" &nbsp;I have found the following details in this respect;</p>
<p>I am using an Office Subscription Product, MS Office 365 Pro Plus. &nbsp;Office updates are auto.....installed, and I was using version 16.0.6741.2021, this was about 3 hours ago. &nbsp;Further information says that I have version 1706 (Build 8229.2086 click to run).</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what I can see, I have later updates than are shown in Office 365, where I am told that the latest update for &nbsp; Windows Desktop is 1706 (build 8229.2073) &nbsp;As mentioned above, I have 8229.2086, which is surely later than 2073?</p>
<p>
</p><p>From all this, I can only assume that either I have misunderstood something, or I have failed to carry out an essential manual update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Gabriel Bratton in his email to me of 14 July says that if I have the updates from 7/12, and by this I assume this means July 12th, then I have the search fix. &nbsp;As recommended, I did Control Panel&gt;searched Event Viewer, clicked on View Event Logs, &gt; Windows
 Logs,&gt; Application log to look for event 36. &nbsp;There are 81,680 events in the Application Log. &nbsp;I then went to Actions &gt; Find &gt;event 36. &nbsp;It took 55 seconds to search through the list, and then the message "...there is no event that contains....string" &nbsp; &nbsp;Gabriel
 says in his post that &nbsp;"If this is not getting logged anymore, then you don't have the bug caused by the ....Updates"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Gabriel also notes that there was a previous bug in Feb-March..."if you first configured Outlook during that time. ' I first configured Outlook on this computer on March 22nd
<strong>2016.</strong> &nbsp;I cannot remember when the search problem was first noticed, but it was relatively recent. &nbsp;Also in that Answer, it is suggested that if I still have problems, contact https://support.office.com . &nbsp;I did that, and it asked me to outline
 the problem as fully as possible, as the more I wrote, the easier it would be to understand the problem. &nbsp;In an maximum of 250 characters?? &nbsp;Little hope, but I did try. &nbsp;I have not seen a response to this from Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really would like to resolve this once and for all. &nbsp;If having read the above you can see where my problem lies, and if you would give me step by step instructions on how to resolve it, I would be MOST grateful. &nbsp;I sincerely hope you can assist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards, &nbsp;Mike&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mike,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen some other forum reports with this but have not had a chance to follow up much yet. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some questions that will help me better understand:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Please describe the issue.&nbsp; Are you still getting the error "Something went wrong, and your search couldn't be completed"? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; What kind of accounts is this happening with?&nbsp; In Outlook click File, Account Settings, Account Settings.&nbsp; What is the Type listed next to your account(s)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; What version of Windows are you on?&nbsp; Right click the Start menu and click Run and type Winver and press Enter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp; What version is tquery.dll at location&nbsp;C:\Windows\System32.&nbsp; Right click the DLL and click Properties, version tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To help with troubleshooting please try creating another Outlook Profile and add at least one account and check if search works for that account.&nbsp; I recommend keeping the current profile.&nbsp; When you create a new profile there is an option on the Profiles
 tab to "Prompt for a Profile".&nbsp; Click that radio button (see below) so when you start Outlook you can pick between the old and new profile.&nbsp; This article has steps for creating the new profile,&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Create-an-Outlook-profile-F544C1BA-3352-4B3B-BE0B-8D42A540459D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Create-an-Outlook-profile-F544C1BA-3352-4B3B-BE0B-8D42A540459D</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mike,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have the fixed build that addressed the Windows bug so that is not the issue. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only other thing that I know will cause the error is if Outlook is not checked in the Indexing Settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Click into the Outlook search box, click Search Tools, Search Options, Indexing Options,</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Click Modify</p>
<p>

    <title>Strange symbols in Word Equation Editor - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> redgugy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Strange symbols in Word Equation Editor</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>This morning I opened my computer to take notes for class when the Word Equation editor began acting unexpectedly. These symbols have appeared since the last time I used word, and when entering short cuts, for subscript for example, using the underscore,
 it does not work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue does not persist when using a pre-made formula, only when creating a new formula.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2d0abf0d-7c67-4a9f-88eb-077fd98c8bd3?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2d0abf0d-7c67-4a9f-88eb-077fd98c8bd3?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            Hi,
<br />
<br />You are in design mode.
<br />
<br />On the Developer Tab, unselect Design Mode.

<br />Apparently, some sort of switching to Design Mode is being caused by a recent update and is catching a lot of "basic Word users" who "didn't know Design Mode existed." Microsoft is investigating the problem according to recent posts.

    <title>Concatenate Form Fields in WORD 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Concatenate Form Fields in WORD 2013</h2>
                    WORD 2013. On a protected word form I have three form fields . How do I add a new field that will add or concatenate the three text values entered into the&nbsp;one string. Do I need to use VBA or is there another way or doing this?

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>You can do this using a field as long as the three formfields are set to calculate on exit and bookmarked Text1, Text2 and Text3:<br />
<br />
For example a Quote field inserted in the document as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>{ Quote { REF Text1 },{ REF Text2 },{ REF Text3 }}</span></p>

</p><p>Hi Sumit,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your advice. I've uploaded the minidumps, MSInfo32 and system details to my onedrive here:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://1drv.ms/f/s!AvODMxFtRdCFgY8ftBEQvgHmVuulxA</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, safe mode with networking exludes wifi and the workaround (accessing networks through the login screen) also doesn't work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll be doing a clean install and leaving the insider program, as I've had far too many issues with the preview builds.</p>

<p>Did you actually do a clean install or just run setup.exe from within windows? On a clean install you would boot from the flash card and do a custom install, when you get to the screen showing all the partitions, you would delete all of the partitions on
 your drive till you are left with one partition with no file system. You then continue on and let windows setup your hard drive. The link I posted is for the release version. Use media creation tool to make a bootable flash card. Hope this helps.</p>

Since you are on build 17046 you need to do a clean install of the latest stable build 16299 using an Installation media. Make sure you backup all important data.</p>

<p>Hi Johnny,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried a fresh install from a USB version of Windows 10. The install fails to detect my c:/ but if I select "install a driver" a windows explorer window appears showing all my drives and my documents folder. Do you have a link for a work around?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Did you actually do a clean install or just run setup.exe from within windows? On a clean install you would boot from the flash card and do a custom install, when you get to the screen showing all the partitions, you would delete all of the partitions on
 your drive till you are left with one partition with no file system. You then continue on and let windows setup your hard drive. The link I posted is for the release version. Use media creation tool to make a bootable flash card. Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Yep i did.&nbsp; I followed the steps using the iso tool and flashed it onto a usb. I then selected troubleshooting and booting from usb. I didn't have to select setup.exe as i didn't explore the usb from the troubleshooting blue screen section.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The install section goes up to the select storage media but states no storage media detected.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Check in your bios and try disabling Secure Boot Control and see if the drive shows up. Have you just tried booting from the usb and not run troubleshooter. You might have a function key you can press to boot from the usb, otherwise you have to change the
 boot order in your bios.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does the disk even show up in your bios for changing your boot order.</p>
