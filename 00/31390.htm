<h3> doc_abs  say:</h3>
<h2>            DVD &#38; CD-roms not found</h2>
                    
<p>My DVD rom (NEC DVD+-RW ND-3530A ATA device) and CD rom (LITE-ON CD-ROM LTN-489S ATA device) are not working since I upgraded to Windows 7.&nbsp; The computer does not find them listed in the drive options.</p>
<p>I have already attempted going in through the control panel &amp; uninstalling the drivers &amp; attempting to let the computer reinstall upon re-boot.&nbsp; This does not work.</p>
<p>I have already attempted running the offered Microsoft Fix-it tools (both the one specific to DVD/CD/Blu-ray drives as well as the general hardware isn't working one).&nbsp; This does not work.</p>
<p>I saw prior advice in several places about trying to uninstall or remove corrupted HKEY files or whatever you call them, but the directions for this are only specific for Vista &amp; XP.&nbsp; If I try to follow those options of going in to Accessories --&gt; Run --&gt;
 typing in the instructed HKEY-thing-a-ma-jig it says to search for, the computer says it cannot find this.</p>
<p>HELP!!!</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Since the system originally had another version of Windows did you run the Upgrade Advisor and<br />
check the Compatibility Center for the CD/DVD compatibilty (and other devices as needed).<br />
<br />
Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor - please run this now.<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/get/upgrade-advisor.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
<span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/get/upgrade-advisor.aspx</span></a>
<div>
<div>
<p><br />
Also check the Compatibility Center (for major devices)<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx</span></a></p>
<p>Check with the System maker and the Device maker for information about drivers for Windows 7.<br />
(BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and other major device drivers).<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Check these :</p>
<p>The DVD drive does not function after you install Windows 7 - these are different Sony drives<br />
however the same issue could be affecting your drive.<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/975270/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/975270/</span></a><br />
<br />
FIX: The DVD drive is not recognized after you install Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/976187" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/976187</a></p>

<p>-------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>If the System can run Windows 7 AND there are drivers for the devices these might help :<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong></p>
<p>Stage 1 : Please do all the below even&nbsp;if you have done some before as it is often the total<br />
process which solves the issue.<br />
<br />
Try this - Control Panel - Device Manager - CD/DVD - double click the device - Driver's Tab -<br />
click Update Drivers (this will likely do nothing) - then RIGHT CLICK the drive - UNINSTALL -<br />
REBOOT&nbsp;this will refresh the default driver stack. <strong>Even if drive is not shown&nbsp;continue<br />
below.<br />
</strong><br />
Then work your way through these - remember the drive could be bad, could have a loose<br />
cable or slight corrosion on the contacts (usually for a laptop) and other issues.<br />

<br />
Another possibility is that the cables are loose. Remove ALL power, then check cables in both<br />
ends. Remove and replace, do not just snug. For laptops you can often clean the power and<br />
<br />
Some DVD&nbsp;drives do not use the Windows default drivers so check with the System maker and<br />
device maker to see if there is firmware or drivers for you drive if needed.<br />
<br />
===============================<br />
<br />
Stage 2 : You could have drive issues as the CD/DVD is actually 4 drives in 1 case ( CD &amp; DVD<br />
burn and CD and DVD read). So it is not unusual for 1 or 2 parts to not function while the others<br />
do so properly. <br />
<br />
Did you complete the troubleshooter for the drive that still does not work? There are some<br />
registry entries that the troubleshooter does not fix and those "might" be the cause.<br />
<br />
Check with your System Maker and Device maker for both possible <strong>firmware updates</strong> and the<br />
correct Registry entries for your drive. <br />
<br />
These are the keys I think are the ones in question&nbsp;- for the CD/DVD drive sub-keys of course<br />
as there will other sub-keys in these keys. Be sure to ask for specific keys involved as well as<br />
the settings.<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Hardware Profiles\0001\System\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
You probably can find more info here and maybe even the exact registry settings for your CD/DVD<br />
drive from someone with the same model.<br />

<br />
Use DevManView to locate CD/DVD in registry (be careful and make a Restore Point before<br />
changing anything) - find the device in&nbsp;DevManView&nbsp;and then Right Click on it Open in RegEdit.</p>
<p>DevManView - Free - an alternative to the standard Device Manager of Windows, which displays all<br />
devices and their properties in flat table, instead of tree viewer<br />

    <title>Xbox One Stereo Headset Echo - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> enderswolf zero  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One Stereo Headset Echo</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm having a very irritating issue with echoes while using the mic on my MS Stereo Headset. &nbsp;Seemingly randomly I'll start to hear everything I say repeated back to me. &nbsp;The issue will sometimes last a few seconds and sometimes a few minutes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've done all contoller updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unplugging and replugging both the headset cord and the adapter doesn't clear it up. &nbsp;Nor resetting/rebooting the Xbox One.</p>
<p>It occurs regardless of having the controller wired or wireless.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I sit less than 6 feet from the Xbox One and all other devices that might cause interference are on the other side of the room.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas why this might be happening or solution/troubleshooting tips will be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Stafford</p>

            <p>Hey Enderswolf Zero!<br /><br />Sorry to hear about the echo issues. &nbsp;Just to make sure that we have not missed any troubleshooting steps, I would like you to try a few steps to see if we can get this sorted,<br /><br /><strong>Please give the following steps a try:<br /></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Disconnect your headset from the controller.</li>
<li>Clean the plug on the headset cable with a clean cloth.</li>
<li>Press and hold the power button on your Xbox One console for 5 seconds.</li>
<li>Once your console is powered off, unplug the power cord.</li>
<li>Leave your console unplugged for 5 minutes and plug in your console.</li>
<li>Power on your console.</li>
<li>Make sure to turn down the volume on your TV.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />I would also recommend testing your headset with a &nbsp;different &nbsp;controller to see if you still experience the issue. &nbsp;Please let us know if the issue continues to occur and&nbsp; we will be standing by to help.</p>

            On my Windows 10 laptop at the action center, connect displays that it found no devices, even when my TV is in Miracast ready to connect mode. &nbsp;Also, the Miracast TV shows a pin is needed. &nbsp;What can I do to get my Windows 10 to connect to my Miracast TV?

            <p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This could due to incompatibility of the display driver in Windows 10 after the upgrade.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may want to install the latest driver available from the computer manufacturer's support website and check. If the TV still does not connect, install the same driver in compatibility mode and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a.&nbsp;Right click the driver installation file and select
<strong>Properties</strong> then tap or click the <strong>Compatibility</strong> tab.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">b.&nbsp;Place a check in the
<strong>Run this program in compatibility mode for: </strong>box. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">c.&nbsp;Tap or click the drop down box and select a previous operating system, then tap or click
<strong>OK</strong>.</span></p>

            The TV is from Sharp. &nbsp;Sharp tech support says that since my laptop was originally Windows 7 upgraded to Windows 10, it is missing needed hardware and software to work with their Miracast interface. &nbsp;Sharp has no device driver for its TVs for Windows.
 &nbsp;If you can tell me ehat device driver I can install on Windows 10 and how to install, I feel this computer will connect to the Sharp Miracast. &nbsp;Thank you.&nbsp;

    <title>Second Internal Hard Drive Access Denied After Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> david t. d.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Second Internal Hard Drive Access Denied After Update</h2>
                    <p>After the most recent update, I am getting error that prevents me from accessing my second internal hard drive that was working fine prior to the update. I am using an account with administrative privileges.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Location is not available</p>
<p>F:\ is not accessible.</p>
<p>Access is denied."</p>
<p>
</p><p>This drive is a 6 TB WD Blue drive. It is 3 months old. S.M.A.R.T. readings are "Good".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I CAN access the drive on the same user account when I boot into safe mode. The files are fine and I can copy them over, but 3TB used out of the 6 TB total are hard to copy over when I have no other drives of that size.<br />
</p>
<p>I have tried:</p>
<p>- I've tried setting permissions, taking ownership, and I checked effective access and it tells me I should have access to it.</p>
<p>- I can access my third internal hard drive.</p>
<p>- I have tried changing the drive letter and labels. This does not change anything</p>
<p>- I tried rolling back the update but the damage is done.</p>
<p>- I made a second administrator account and tried accessing it on that one and I could not, even after adding privileges.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is appreciated. I need access to this drive.</p>

            Hi David,<br />
<br />
Most of the time, if you're getting the said error message with you're internal hard drive it simply says that you donâ€™t have the privilege of accessing to the disk partition. Good to know that you've already tried setting permission and taking ownership of
 it. You may also restore to default to fix "Location is not available" error. To do so, you may follow the steps below:<br />
<br />
1. Go to the drive where the Windows is installed, for most users, it's&nbsp; C:\Users (or ).<br />
2. Open the folder name with your username.<br />
3. Right-Click on the Desktop and select Properties.<br />
4. Under the Location tab, click the Restore Default button.<br />
5. Restart PC.<br />
<br />
Update us on the outcome so we can provide further assistance.

<p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply. I did as instructed, but when I clicked "Restore Default", nothing happened. The path above the button didn't change. Still, I clicked "Apply" and restarted my computer. There was no change. I still cannot access the other drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should add, Disk Management has always listed the drive as empty, even during the time when it was working fine. But AOMEI Partition Management Assistant can see the drive and how much space is empty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've actually been deleting (all my games, particularly) and shuffling files between other drives (all old drives from previous computers, all under 200 Gb) which weren't plugged in when this problem began, so they aren't causing the problem and neither
 is the SATA port because I changed that twice too.) I've moved as many files from the problem drive as I can while in safe mode (when I can still properly access the problem drive and move files from it), but I still have a terabyte of work-related and archives
 of old school assignment nostalgia files that I really do not want to lose, and no space to move it to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, none of the drives are shown as "in the red" capacity-wise. The problem drive is only 1/6th full now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, thanks for the help and any future help you can offer.</p>

<p>I ended up just deleting backup work data (a slight risk, but it should be fine) and then I created a new partition on the drive. I deleted the old partition and resized the new one. Now I can access the now-empty drive fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll be worried when downloading future windows updates, but with luck it won't happen again.</p>

    <title>&#91;Complaint&#93; A bad after-sales service experience - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> å®‰felix  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#91;Complaint&#93; A bad after-sales service experience</h2>
                    <div>Microsoft used to be the top international company I think of in the world, so I bought one when Microsoft just launched surface pro4. But the experience I just experienced made me experience the worst after-sales service.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The specific experience is as follows:</div>
<div>My surface pro4 battery drum kit, so I hit Microsoft China 400-820-3800 phone.</div>
<div>On the phone, let me send the computer to the repair center, and have its repair center to carry out the after-sales service process.</div>
<div>Since my surface pro4 purchase is relatively old, I have repeatedly confirmed whether it will incur maintenance costs.</div>
<div>The customer service reply is that as long as the repair center receives it, it can go through the process for maintenance. There will be no cost.</div>
<div>Repair the after-sales center, normal reception, due to return to the factory for repair, so only the data in the computer can be cleared.</div>
<div>On the third working day, I received a call from Microsoft China and said that my computer repair order has been generated, but I need to pay the maintenance fee, totaling 3600RMB, about 680$.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Complaint:</div>
<div>1. Why can't I call the maintenance fee?</div>
<div>2. Why is the after-sales service center receiving the notebook and not notifying it?</div>
<div>This is the worst after-sales service experience I have ever experienced. I hope to be a certified company as an international company.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Note:</div>
<div>*My English is not good, so the email was written using translation software.</div>
<div>* Microsoft does not have a service complaint in China. I don't know how to improve the service quality of the company.</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If 64bit is the original OS and all you did was install SP2, there should still be a Recovery partition on the Hard Drive to use.</p>
<p>HP does&nbsp;only&nbsp;allow you to make disks once, but it does not stop you using the Recovery partition to reinstall from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Press F11 repeatedly at Boot to start the Recovery process back to new condition</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers.</p>

            <p>Thanks Bill...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided to update from a recovery disks I bought on a website....Since it had SP2....One of the main problems were the drives for my computer...Specifically the display driver and the WIFI card...I managed to get the display driver....many others required
 drivers are failing...Any way since Microsoft does not support IE 7 anymore....it is hard to download SP2 or even upgrade to IE9..for my 64 bit....The web pages start banging you out...without any luck... The other main problem is the Windows License key...I
 manage to updtade the Product Key to my HP Windows Original with no problem...I assume that if I recover fresh from my HP partition all this have not to be done....But the SP2 is lost...so IE9....and so on...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I manage to get the IE9 64bit...Everything was perfect running until I installed IE9 64b....the system start giving me the Igfx service error and recover... computer start freezing.... I manage to strat up in safe mode and the system downloaded automatically
 3 updates.... after that the igfx error went out and my wifi start working with a new driver....Goood....I manage, as soon as the system&nbsp;started, to change my screen resolution to 1280x 600 to avoid the problem of the igfx again...</p>
<p>Since this is a fresh start...I need to start installing...first Norton then the other most used software...Up to now all working good in low resolution display...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I learned in this process that you can still use IE9 32 bits once IE9 64 bit is installed so I am using the 32 bit version to avoid any other performance issues and see how my system goes here on....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me clarify...website disk&nbsp;thing was a recommendation from none microsoft people...so I can have a startup Disk...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks;</p>

            <p>For those interested in IE32 running on a 64bit system...If you have installed 64bit version, since 32 bits will not install in 64bit system....you go to Windows Explorer Start, under programs your will see IE9 32bit version it right above the IE9 64bit
 version. You can pin this version to your tool bar and to the destop and use it&nbsp;instead of the 64bit version...in my case my HPdv6930us does not allow to install more tha 4GB memory....so memory is an issue for me...another problem is my windows Sp2 with IE9
 64bit and Norton 360...that alone have eaten my 80% of my HD capacity (200GB HD)...Now I have to install MS Office etc...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something..Also noticed since I am using this IE9 64bit&nbsp;Version is that the different instances that the OS runs,, start building up memeory comsuption......Crazy nuymbers until you system can not support the amount of mmemory it demands and the season locks
 or stop responding....That is why I am trying to limit my usage to the 32bit version...</p>

            <p>So after some test the igfx error came again...Freezing my computer in a black screen and stamping "display driver igfs stopped working and recovered"&nbsp;and I have to edit my registry&nbsp;the TrdDelay to 8 seconds
<span>Timeout Detection and Recovery</span> feature to let it more time to complete&nbsp;operation as recommended by HP....<a href="http://h20564.www2.hp.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?docId=emr_na-c04258322&amp;DocLang=en&amp;docLocale=en_US&amp;jumpid=reg_r1002_usen_c-001_title_r0001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://h20564.www2.hp.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?docId=emr_na-c04258322&amp;DocLang=en&amp;docLocale=en_US&amp;jumpid=reg_r1002_usen_c-001_title_r0001</a></p>
<p>Apparently this is the only thing can help to aliviate the igfx display driver error...after installing IE9... I change my registry under
<span>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE ---</span><span>SYSTEM---</span><span>CurrentControlSet -----</span><span>Control---</span><span>GraphicsDrivers----</span><span>Edit</span>,---<span>New---</span> either
<span>DWORD (32-bit)</span> or <span>DWORD (64-bit)</span> depending your operating system and add the
<span>Timeout Detection and Recovery</span> as "<span>TdrDelay"-</span> type <span>
8</span>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<span>Value data</span> --- <span>OK -- verify and restart...</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow the provided link where HP explains this&nbsp;</span><span>Timeout Detection and Recovery delay.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Good thing is that my SFC /Scannoe corrupted files are gone..SFC has not found any error after restoration...then nor error after installing IE9...then no errors after installing Norton 360...and no error after igfx crash...and no error after registry
 edit the TdrDelay...</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Now to start installing all my MS Windows Offcie Pack...and Check for errors and so on my other software....</span></p>

            <p>It still gets back to these Recovery disks that you bought online, as they had SP2.</p>
<p>We have no idea what they were originally for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You say that you had problems with Drivers.</p>
<p>If you had used the Recovery partition that would have included all Drivers and we could have assisted you with SPs.</p>
<p>But using a different installation method will have destroyed that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes Microsoft gives you Updates for 3rd Party Hardware: Graphics, Network Adaptors, etc.</p>
<p>You should only obtain the latest Drivers for them from the actual Hardware Manufacturer's website (HP), as Microsoft normally does nor have those latest Drivers available as Microsoft relies of the 3rd Party Hardware Manufactuer to supply them.</p>

            <p>I had found a driver for my problems in the Ricoh R5C592 PCI Card Bus/IEEE-1394/SD card/Memory Stick Controller etc...This is the last device failing to update its drivers...Now I am running ok with the basic installation. I have manage to Isolate the problem
 for my updates since i stopped the following updates that has the most impact in my system. I will try each one separately until I found the one causing the main problem..This will be later. My systems is acting in good shape. i have noticed high disk usage...this
 also was a problem for me before my fresh start....Also the common USBs problems....like the port most close to the power port..is hanging out....I need to disconnect the power and then restart in order to refresh it...besides this problems that I had before
 fresh start...everything looks good now....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had lot of trouble in IE9 since it start giving me a lot of error of some pages like HP support pages...I need to deactivate the debug mode and deactivate the messages...as recommended by microsoft article...However, I still have compatibility problems
 in the HP support web page like formatting and links that do not respond...Apparently caused by IE9...I had this problems before fresh start but not like those presented now...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I happy as it is right now...I will start installing others software I use to have like Adobe Reader, Printer drivers, Office, PhotoShop, Autocad..etc</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not expected that my new fresh installation will destroy the HP recovery...It was in a separate partition...But I do not have it now since when I try to use system Recovery..It ask for my disk...and do not look in that partition...I checked the partition
 and apparently HP recovery content is gone unless it is hidden...I still have the directory in that partition but is&nbsp;empty..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are the Updates I stopped...</p>
<p>1. Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer 9 for Windows Vista for x64-based Systems (KB3021952)&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5.2 for Windows Vista x64-based Systems (KB2901983)</p>

                    <p>I bought a second-hand Panasonic toughbook cf-52 a year ago. &nbsp;The previous owner had installed Win does 10 and had tried to fit it with a wireless card but had been unsuccessful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I've been hookin my smartphone up to wireless WiFi and then tethering the laptop to it, and that has been working fine for Internet access for nearly a year.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An automatic update was installed last week and now the laptop is locked in airplane mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help would be very much appreciated!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The hardware switch on the laptop is set to 'wireless on'.<br />

<p>Hi Kapil,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is quite an old laptop (though it has been running Windows 10 successfully since I got it). &nbsp;There is no radio tower symbol on the Fn &nbsp;keys. &nbsp;Underneath the handle at the front there is a physical wireless switch , currently set to 'on'. &nbsp;I've just
 tried &nbsp;turning the switch off and on again with FN depressed &nbsp;- no change, still locked in Airplane mode.</p>

</p><p>With registry manipulation, I got as far as searching the CONTROL folder for RadioEnable using Find.</p>
<p>
</p><p>REG_DWORD bootdriverflags, dirtyshutdown, &nbsp;lastbootshutdown and lastbootsuceeded were all there but nothing shoeing for RadioEnable.&nbsp;</p>

            It looks like there is a bunch of people around with this issue.

Did you try this?

<p>Hi Ugo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the delay in replying.&nbsp; After you sent your previous message, I tried all the advice given at the link you provided.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately none of that worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have completely re-installed Windows 10 and that seems to have solved the Airplane mode problem (even though it meant losing my data - thankfully most of it was backed up on Onedrive).<br />
<br />
Unfortunately I can't get USB tethering to work with my mobile any more, but I am now online (at last!) with a USB Wireless Adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Phew!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks to you both for being so helpful!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best wishes,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kamal</p>

            If you want to find word or phrase in the content of a file (and not in filenames):<br />
Type <strong>content:"The particular phrase"</strong> in the search box.<br />
<br />
(If it is just a word then&nbsp; you may omit the hyphens.)

<h2>            Opinins On How Game Begins&#63; &#42;may be spoilers&#42;</h2>
                    
<p>I was just wondering what your guys opinion is on how this game kicks it off.&nbsp; Do you think they could have had a different start to focus more on Connor, like every other Assassins Creed did with Altair and Ezio, or do you think it was perfect to explain
 how Connor came to be?</p>
<p>In my opinion I think one sequence would have done it right, but I find that 4 sequences into it and you're finally playing as a full assassins was a bit of a stretch.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well, I kinda assumed that the OP is asking about this because in his original reply he says that maybe they should have started as connor, and the next reply also kind of&nbsp;alluded it too. If I was on the forums and just started playing the game, I wouldn't
 click on a thread that is called "So how is your opinion on the start of the game?".</p>

<p>It says START, not half-way through. And someone wondering why they start as someone else other than Connor might go looking on the forums why.
</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>And to the OP: I believe it was a good choice to explain how Connor came to be, since they did do it for Ezio as well, also it was a good tutorial to people who haven't played the previous games, I know of several people that this was their first game to
 play.</p>

<p>Forums are a great place to find answers if you were to get stuck on parts, or having some difficulty in some areas. You would think, that other forum users, wouldn't want any of the story spoiled for them, so they wouldn't divulge information that could,
 because it would ruin it for others. Its just some common curtsey to not talk about the story without giving some type of notice that you are about to. Any thread that is about the story line has (Spoiler) in the title itself, and if not then the individual
 poster should warn the readers if they are about to possibly ruin the story. Think about others is all I am saying, just because you stray from forums doesn't mean everyone does.</p>

    <title>Can I participate in the Advanced Exchange Program&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jmm17  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I participate in the Advanced Exchange Program&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When I scheduled a repair for my Surface 2 laptop, I noticed that there was mention of an Advanced Exchange Program in the terms and conditions, but that this program was only available in certain locations. Despite my best efforts, I can't find out if I
 happen to be in one of these locations and would like to know if I can participate in the Advanced Exchange Program. Does anyone know where this information is?</p>

<p>Saving them that way was not the optimum choice. Create a folder(s) on the Desktop. Copy the messages to that folder. Check the properties. Do they have an eml file extension? If so, you should be able to drag them into a WLMail folder. Without the eml file
 extension, I have no idea if you can get them in WLMail.</p>

    <title>Different Bug Check codes in ntoskrnl.exe only after wake up from - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johanneszab  say:</h3>
<h2>            Different Bug Check codes in ntoskrnl.exe only after wake up from sleep.</h2>
                    <p>Here are some mini dumps and system event entries and a system information report:
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=529B106A3007062A!1012&amp;authkey=!AIMEXbWQd-Cw1Lw&amp;ithint=folder%2czip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Onedrive">

<br />
<br />
The system is a new build (2 weeks) and i commonly run into a system that won't wake up after putting it into the sleep mode. It's not always the case, but maybe 1 out of 3 times, it won't wake up properly. After trying it to wake up per keyboard/mouse, the
 power LEDs lid up for maybe 1-2 secs and then the system shuts down. When i press a random key on the keyboard, the num lock LED still turns on.<br />
<br />
Besides the mini dumps, i also get "Event 41 - Kernel Power" entries in the system log. Bug Check Codes: 0xd1, 0x1e, 0xef.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>The system is new, so maybe hardware related?</li><li>The Stop Codes only happen after sleep during wake up so far.</li><li>I am sure that i had the same problem with the one week i was running <em>Windows 8.1</em> before i updated to Windows 10. So it's maybe not Windows 10 related.</li><li>I did run a <em>sfc /scannnow</em>, it passed without errors.</li><li>I already removed a gigabyte driver <em>gdrv.sys</em>, after I tired to solve the problem and thought it is driver related. I
<em>ran verifier.exe</em> on non microsoft drivers and in the one day i way running it, that driver caused some shutdowns.</li><li>I already updated all drivers</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>So, can it be a hardware problem, even though it happens only during wake up after a sleep, otherwise the system is just fine?! The
<em>mcupdate_GenuineIntel.dll</em>, in the address stack after a driver_irql_not_less_or_equal sounds wired to me, since it suggests the Intel microcode?
</p>
<p>On the other hand, the newest Stop Code suggest a mcupdate.dll, which i couldn't even find on my drive. The AV_mcupdate could even mean avast (besides microcode update)? I am sure i never installed that on purpose, so maybe i had to uninstall it after the
 java installation. But would they break the kernel?</p>
<p><br />
I'm really not that much the windows guy and it's too much guessing for me, and maybe there is more information in the bug code and it's parameters. So, maybe someone can help me out here? I'm happy to deliver any more informations if necessary.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance, Johannes.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the description, I understand that you are facing some issues using Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This might have occurred due to some third party application conflicts.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try the methods.</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 1:</strong> Start computer in safe mode and then perform clean boot.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start computer in safe mode</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. When you hit the power button in Windows 8.1 (through Charms Bar), hold down the
<strong>Shift key</strong> when clicking the <strong>Restart button.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. The next screen will present you with three options. Click
<strong>Troubleshoot.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span>c. Next, hit <strong>
Advanced</strong> options followed by <strong>Windows Startup Settings</strong> from the next screen.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Your PC will now be rebooted to enable the advanced parameters, which include Safe Mode as well. Once it restarts, youâ€™ll get nine options whereby the following commands apply:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>F4 for Safe Mode
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>F5 for Safe Mode with Networking
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>F6 for Safe Mode with Command Prompt
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>For more information you may refer to the article mentioned below.</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>Windows Startup
 Settings (including safe mode)</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 2:</strong> Perform clean boot to avoid any third party software conflict.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps
 eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to
 perform a Clean Boot.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></span></a><span>
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2: </span>
</strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to
<strong>temporarily disable the antivirus security software program</strong> installed on your computer and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Antivirus software helps protecting your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software.
 If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software and\or troubleshoot any pertinent issue, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer
 is vulnerable to malware attacks.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Hope this information helps. Please let us know if you need any other assistance with Windows in future. We will be happy to assist you.</span></p>

            <p>Thanks for you answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the clean boot option, there was no difference and in the meanwhile i generated some more minidumps (which are also uploaded now). Again, only BSODs after wake up from s3-sleep</p>
<ul>
<li>I did a memtest86, it passed without any errors in 8h.</li><li>I removed vmware, and veracrypt, and right know i'm only on Intel, Microsoft, AMD and Realtek (real hardware) drivers and i still get some stop codes.</li><li>Since most of them point to the mcupdate_GenuineIntel.dll, i'm guessing it's either a driver fault in windows, or more likely a hardware error in either the mainboard, or the CPU. I still could reflash the latest bios or run the machine under a linux install,
 but i'm not sure if that would help much.</li></ul>
<p>I found <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/bsod-caused-by-address-haldll-1260e0-dump-file/6105e970-d935-42b6-b5ec-f0d6b653f45e?auth=1">
this post</a> from 2010 which sounds very related. Unfortunately, the OP did now post how it turned out for him. I think i have to RMA the board and/or the CPU, even though it still find it weird to be hardware related that the stop codes only happen after
 sleep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help though.</p>

            I'm happy to announce that I found a solution to my sleep problems. After running a successfull test with the Intel Processor Diagnostic Tool and multiple perfect working sleep/wakeup cycles under linux, it must have been some Windows issue.<br />
<p><br />
Thanks go over to the the&nbsp;<a href="http://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Operating-Systems-and-Software/Windows-10-Laptop-won-t-go-into-sleep-mode/m-p/5204894#M309138" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HP Forum and this dude.</a></p>
<p>I never would have come up with that, since i didn't even know my consumer mainboard would have a Intel Managment Interface installed. So, an outdated driver causes the issue in my case. I'm sure i also didn't install any driver for that in the first place,
 so maybe Microsoft could ship a newer version with some Windows 10 update or update their online search for a newer version.

            Just to let you know, I finally found a solution and it wasn't the IMEI driver at all. The system still ran into BSODs, I just wasn't running any high memory applications which masked the error..<br />
<br />
After buying a 28â‚¬ GT210 von MSI and running into the same problems, I focused back on the mainboard / ram, since the board was the only thing I really didn't swapped out for testing. I figured out, that indeed not only the OS memory was screwed sometimes,
 but also the applications memory, but mostly windows services crashed and immediately restarted and nothing I regularly see on the desktop and noticed. The wired thing though was, that running the system for, say, three days straight without entering the sleep
 mode, everything was perfectly fine, no crashes, nothing in the Windows Event Viewer. But starting a high memory usage application like Battle Field 4 to fill the ram and entering suspend immediately corrupted the ram content.<br />
<br />
So, I reloaded memtest86, this time for 6 passes and not a single error. I was really out of ideas and went back to searching the web to specially search for
<em>crucial ballistix gigabyte sleep issues</em> and found that many people with gigabyte boards run into sleep errors which mostly weren't resolved. But I found a single post were someone mentioned that raising the ram voltage solved his particular problem.
 I thought I'd give it a try and tried the JEDEC instead of the XMP profile with no luck, but raising the ram voltage by one tick from 1.50V to 1.52V successfully brushed away all my stability problems! I can finally use this crappy machine! The exact ram DIMM
 is even listed on their compatibility sheet.<br />
<br />
<strong>tl;dr</strong>:<br />
<br />
For everyone having sleep issues with application crashes, BSODs <em>after entering sleep</em> and having a totally fine system else, might give a try in raising the ram voltage a bit. It looks like the voltage drops below some specific threshold by entering
 the S3 state which corrupts the DIMMs content. I cannot explain it otherwise.

    <title>Alternate 3&#58;2 display resolution - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> _jf04_  say:</h3>
<h2>            Alternate 3&#58;2 display resolution</h2>
                    I have some applications that do not&nbsp;look correct&nbsp;on high DPI and I would like to lower my surface book screen resolution from 3000x2000 (set to 175% text/apps size) to something lower at 100% text/apps size. I was surprised to find out that no alternate
 resolutions are 3:2 ratio. Using any lower resolutions causes letterboxing effect and at 4000 CAD, I would like to be able to use 100% of the display area of the SB screen... Does anybody knows how to enable custom resolutions (such as 1500x1000 or 1800x1200)?
 Or any driver update available or planned&nbsp;that offers 3:2 alternate resolutions?

    <title>Windows Live Mail upgrade to Windows 10 Mail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joe chai  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Live Mail upgrade to Windows 10 Mail</h2>
                    <p>Noted that I can still use my Live Mail ID in the new Windows 10 Mail.</p>
<p>Does that mean that I can still use Live Mail (as it is now in WIN 7) when I've upgraded to WIN 10? No change at all !<br />
</p>
<p>On the other hand, should WIN 10 have a new Mail system, does the mails I've stored in my present&nbsp;<strong>Live Mail Storage folders</strong>&nbsp;automatically move to the new Mail storage?<br />
I presume mails in my&nbsp;<strong>Inbox</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Drafts</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Send items</strong>&nbsp;will automatically be transferred too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance!</p>

</p><p>You can continue to use WLM in win 10.&nbsp; IMHO the native win 10 mail client is a poor replacement for WLM and has most of its features stripped out.&nbsp; As always I would back up your windows live mail data just to be safe.</p>

            <p>Noted with many thanks, Akheel Ahmed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I separate my personal and company mails with WLM (used for many years) and Office Outlook. WLM has been a great help, to keep my connections, etc., whenever I change jobs or been given a new laptop.</p>
<p>I have WLM &amp; Office Outlook icons in my Task Bar for easy and quick connection/use. So, I presume this is also possible with Windows 10. Please confirm.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Anniversary Update failed install - - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> themightyo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Anniversary Update failed install - &#34;critical_process_died&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I have a custom build PC about 6 months old (GA-Z170N-Gaming 5/Intel mobo) that has always worked flawlessly running Windows 10. After being away for a month, I came back yesterday (Oct 11) to a prompt asking me to install the Anniversary Update. I downloaded
 the helper and ran the install. Everything went fine with the install until it came to starting up into the new version of Windows -- the dreaded&nbsp;"critical_process_died" blue screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had no option to boot into safe mode (and the repair option, or whatever it's called, didn't work) so the only thing I could do is roll back to my previous version of Windows 10. Someone on Microsoft support chat (the worst, I know) suggested that I update
 my drivers, bios etc. before installing the new update. I tried that but after going through the Anniversary Update install process again I was greeted by the same&nbsp;"critical_process_died" screen/boot loop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously I'm fine using the version of Windows 10 that works well on my computer, but I would like to install the Anniversary Update at some point. Does anyone have any suggestions how to make this week? Am at a loss. (Building this PC in April was my my
 first experience with a PC as I'd always used Macs prior).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

Thank you for the clear advice, Gerry.</p>
I've now set up the necessary&nbsp;exclusions for both Malwarebytes Anti-Malware Premium and also my Avira Antivirus Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard" style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
I ran ADWCleaner and saved two log files (linked below) and removed&nbsp;the items it suggested.</p>
- Log File after scan,&nbsp;before hitting "Clean":&nbsp;https://1drv.ms/t/s!Ao8PcLwtPqZYhXH0G_hW8Kcli3qQ</p>
- Automated log file after removing items and&nbsp;reboot:&nbsp;https://1drv.ms/t/s!Ao8PcLwtPqZYhXDNssEhXOzHyX3v<br />
</p>
<p>Have updated my audio drivers as suggested.</p>
</p>
Here is the DriverView report: https://1drv.ms/t/s!Ao8PcLwtPqZYhXL0QaAkVHgZizdZ</p>
</p>
Looking forward to the next lot of guidance. Thanks again!</p>

<p>
</p><p>I tried everything you suggested but unfortunately encountered the same "critical_process_died" error after the install was finished.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I rolled back to my previous version of Windows and was greeted with a message that read:&nbsp;"We couldn't install Windows 10" and gave the codes 0xC 1900101 - 0x4001F "The installation failed in the SECOND_BOOT phase with an error during UNKNOWN operation"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea what I should try now?</p>
