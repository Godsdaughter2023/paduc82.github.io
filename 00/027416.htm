            Hi Bernie,
<div><br />
<div>Try this,</div>
<div><br />
<div>1. Uninstall the program from Programs and Features.</div>
<div><br />
<div>2. Then run Microsoft Fix it in&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501</a>&nbsp; to completely remove its remnants.</div>
<div><br />
<div>3. Then reinstall and check</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>You can also run Microsoft Fix it in&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2809219" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2809219</a>&nbsp; if issue persists.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks</div>

            I know what it is. I'm sure you&nbsp;<span>got some add-on which is causing them to crash.</span>
<div><br />
<div>Do this:<b>&nbsp;</b></div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Exit any running Office programs.</li><li>Click&nbsp;<b>Start</b>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<b>All Programs&nbsp;</b>&gt;&nbsp;<b>Accessories</b>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<b>Run</b>&nbsp;in Windows 7,
<br />
or, go to your&nbsp;<b>Start</b>&nbsp;screen in Windows 8, type one of the following commands:<br />
<ul>
<li>Type&nbsp;<b>excel /safe&nbsp;</b>and press&nbsp;<b>Enter&nbsp;</b>to start Excel 2013</li><li><span>Type</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b>winword /safe&nbsp;</b><span>and press</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b>Enter&nbsp;</b><span>to start Word 2013</span></li></ul>
</li><li>If the Office program runs normally, its an add-on causing the problem (may be&nbsp;ABBYY FineReader add-in).<br />
<br />
If the Office application doesn’t start in Safe Mode, the add-in is not causing a problem.</li></ol>
<br />
<b>Disabling the </b><span>(ABBYY FineReader)</span><b> add-in:</b>
<ol>
<li>With the Office application still running in the Safe Mode.</li><li>Click&nbsp;<b>File</b>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<b>Options</b>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<b>Add-Ins</b>.</li><li>On the bottom, next to the&nbsp;<b>Manage</b>&nbsp;list (set on COM Add-ins), click&nbsp;<b>Go</b>.<br />
see here:<br />
<a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.solaris-cookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Image-2013-03-14-09-25-001.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://i2.wp.com/www.solaris-cookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Image-2013-03-14-09-25-001.png</a><br />
<br />
</li><li>Uncheck the add-in (probably it would be ABBYY FineReader) and click&nbsp;<b>OK</b>.</li><li>Restart the application (not in Safe Mode this time).</li></ol>
<div>You would have to disable the add-in in the same way for both Word and Excel.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks,</div>

<p>I downloaded some themes over the internet. Turns out, I don't like them. I want to remove them, but it doesn't give me an option to delete them. I tried looking for the rootfile, I think I was able to delete them, but they are still there. Where is the
 rootfile for the installed stuff in themes? Thanks so much!&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.uklv.info%2fg.php" /></p>

    <title>Has something recently changed with the email alias addresses&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danmossor  say:</h3>
<h2>            Has something recently changed with the email alias addresses&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I came here for one reason, to figure out why I can no longer send using my email aliases. It appears that something changed within the last two weeks, as there seems to be a rash of problems with aliases over this period.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My specific problem is this - I've been using aliases since I started with outlook.com, and they've worked flawlessly. I subscribe to many support mailing lists using one of my alias addresses, and filter the mail into folders using the address as a primary
 rule. Since I subscribed to these mailing lists with the alias, I am only allowed to post to them from the alias address - this has not been a problem until last week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had not attempted to post anything in a while, so I'm not sure when this started, but I noticed it last night. I tried to send a mail from Thunderbird, the application I've been using for over a year to manage these lists and had never had a problem with
 previously. I sent the mail, and waited for it to post. It never did, and I discovered why when there was a mail in my primary mailbox from the listserver saying that my mail was being held for moderator approval because I wasn't a subscriber. This is when
 I noticed the mail came from my primary alias - note, my primary alias is NOT my primary account that I sign into outlook.com with, it is an alias itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried to send from Kmail with essentially the same configuration as Thunderbird - same response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a last troubleshooting step, I attempted to send it directly from the outlook.com interface, selecting the "From" address with the drop down while composing the email. Again, I got the response from the listserver addressed to my primary alias.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In short, I can no longer send mail from any alias except my primary alias. I have double checked the aliases, and none of them say send or receive only, they should all work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the question is - what changed, Microsoft? Are you going to fix it, or force us away again after such a great start?</p>

            <p>I tried four different browsers on two operating systems - On Fedora 20, I tried Google Chrome 34, Firefox 29, and rekonq 2.4.2-1, and on Windows 7, I tried IE 11, Google Chrome 35 and Firefox 28. I cannot send mail from any alias except my primary one,
 no matter which address I select via the drop-down in the browser, or which address I specify in my Thunderbird and/or kmail configurations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not tried to use Outlook 2010, 2013, or 365 (I have licenses for all three versions) or Windows Mail on Windows 8, as those are not my primary computers and I rarely, if ever, check my email on those systems. If you would like me to set one of those
 up as a troubleshooting step, I'd be happy to.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Sorry to say I agree with Dan. Something has definitely changed in the last couple of weeks or maybe less. My wife and I both use the same account with my wife's address being one of the aliases. We have been signed up to outlook.com for only about 4 months
 but up to now everything has been satisfactory. She could send, receive and reply without problem and people receiving e-mails/replies from her saw her e-mail address as the sender. We use Thunderbird for e-mail and Google Chrome for browsing. During the last
 week she received an important e-mail that needed a reply. That reply would previously (and logically) have used her e-mail address automatically, but this time (un-noticed) it apparently went out from my address instead. The consequence of this was that the
 intended recipient's automated system refused to accept the message because it did not come from the address associated with the matter at hand, so it sent an automated reply to this effect. She tried around 3-4 more times in different ways to get the message
 through on her own address. This was an important matter at the time and we became increasingly frustrated by the situation. Eventually with my help we somehow managed to get one through but I can't remember how because by this time we were on the point of
 chucking the pc out of the window.</p>
<p>So it doesn't matter what you say there is definitely a problem that has just recently been created. What Dan and I, and probably many others soon, want to know is how to solve it easily. It doesn't help for you to just keep repeating the same basic statement.
 Sensible advice is what is needed.</p>

            <p>Thanks for trying Ron but it still baffles me. The sent folder in Thunderbird has all the offending messages shown as originating from my wife's address but in the sent folder on outlook.com the same messages have the sending address as mine and that is
 the way the recipients see them. Even when we tried replying directly from outlook.com in the browser a reply to a message that had been addressed to my wife was sent out from me with no say in the matter. Even when my wife thought she had deliberately chosen
 her own address the recipients still saw my address. When someone clicks the reply button they really expect to be the one doing the replying.</p>
<p>This has only just started happening in the last week. Until now everything worked normally and as expected so something has definitely changed.</p>
<p>For info in Thunderbird one can have several different identities in the same account (just as you can have aliases in outlook.com) and that is the way we use it. I think you can have completely separate accounts also. I might be wrong but I don't think
 that would make any difference.</p>
<p>If we have to change the primary alias and default sender every time we want to change senders we are going to run into problems very quickly as I believe the permitted frequency of change is limited to 2 changes per week i.e. once there and once back then
 wait for a week to send another message from the alternate address. This is just talking silly. In fact I had already tried this and still had problems and am now in a period of waiting to change it back again as when I initially tried to change back I accidentally
 chose a dead address that really should have been deleted. So now I have to wait a week to get back to where I started. My own silly fault I know.<br />
</p>
<p>Incidentally I disagree re Dan's problem. I think it is exactly the same one.</p>

            <p>Hi Ron,</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure I tried but to be sure I'll do some tests and check it out again. On first inspection the choices for "default from" don't inspire confidence. Lets say aliasA is my address and aliasB is my wife's then the choices appear as
<strong>"My Name(aliasA)"</strong> or<strong> "My Name(aliasB)"</strong>. In both choices my name appears first. Anyway I'll give it a try and get back to you later. It might take some time to get replies from contacts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's going to be a damn nuisance if we have to log in every time and change this address before we can send a message. This has not been necessary until now. It effectively means the use of Thunderbird as an e-mail client is now futile and we find that very
 disappointing as it is for us a convenient way of working. In addition Outlook.com becomes an inconvenient way of working which up to now has not been the case.</p>
<p>Ian</p>

            <p>Thanks Ron. I appreciate you trying to help and am sorry to be a nuisance.</p>
<p>I've set up a separate account for my wife in Thunderbird as you suggest but used the outlook alias address for it. It would involve too much hassle to use a completely new address, - too many registrations to change. I sent out a test e-mail from the new
 separate Tbird account and it looks like two emails have gone out, both from my wife according to Tbird but one from each of us according to Outlook.com, yet I only sent once. This was with the default in outlook set at my address. I changed the default to
 my wife's address and tried again. Again 2 messages were apparently sent by one send, but this time both from my wife according to both Tbird and Outlook. I can't quite understand why 2 messages now seem to be going out but it must be something to do with
 the alias. (Or perhaps its only one that is appearing twice for some reason. I've got no answers back yet so can't be sure)</p>
<p>In Tbird the messages and duplicates all appear only in the sent folder of the new account and not at all in the account with multiple identities. On outlook.com they all appear in the common sent folder.</p>
<p>Would this new duplicate message problem be solved by deleting the alias in Outlook.com? Or am I talking total nonsense? I looked at deleting it but a message said the address would not then be available for 30 days and then anyone could take it over. I
 was unsure what to do in case the address became totally unusable so I cancelled. Maybe there's something else can be done.</p>
<p>I'm trying to be systematic about this but with so many variables and strange happenings it's difficult.</p>
<p>I still believe there must be some sort of glitch. I can understand the benefit of having a default send address but it surely shouldn't override a specifically chosen one.</p>

            The way I was able to remove it was by changing the email address I use to sign into fb. I used my yahoo email address to sign in and disabled the hotmail address on fb, so that there is no longer any link between fb and microsoft hotmail.

    <title>6101 email settings for use with Tesco mobile - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pumpkinpie---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            6101 email settings for use with Tesco mobile</h2>
                    Hi, My Nokia 6101 uses a Tesco Mobile SIM card. I can access the web with no problems via the "Tesco WAP GPRS". I don't seem able to get the email to work. I downloaded email settings from the Nokia website - however Tesco Mobile aren't listed as a network
 provider, so I used O2 instead because I believe that Tesco Mobile is part of O2. My email provider PlusNet were listed. Having downloaded and "installed" the settings I can't access my email - when starting email it says "Connecting. Web Setting O2 GPRS"
 followed by the error message "Subscribe to GPRS first". I suspect my "settings" are set to use the O2 GPRS and need modifying to use the Tesco GPRS. Does anyone know how to change the GPRS setting so my email application uses the correct GPRS ? Many thanks.
 Tom.

            The WAP gateways normally block non-WAP traffic. First contact Tesco and verify that GPRS has been enabled for your SIM card. Secondly ask them the settings for Tesco GPRS.<br />
How to change the data connection setting - check page 54 on the User's Guide.<br />

            Thanks for that Pet, I had previously sent an email to Tesco Mobile support but they never replied. When I contacted them by telephone they made the astonishing admission that "email doesn't work on the Tesco Mobile network - O2 don't allow it" ! Apparently
 many other customers have had the same problem and it explains the errors I encountered. Needless to say I returned the Nokia for a full refund this evening. I fully intend to purchase another 6101 but I shall be much more careful about who I choose as the
 network provider - to give them their due, Tesco didn't hesitate about the refund though. Cheers.

<p>Yes it should support that format for audio.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However I checked out the specs page - and they lie a bit. &nbsp;The N86 and the N97 have the same player - lookig at the video playeback&nbsp;formats it lists h.264 as a supported video format - this i know is untrue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With that said the best rule to use is if you put it on your phone and it works, then it works - and it it does not, get a 3rd party player as the worst player of them all is the RealPlayer found on Nokias.&nbsp;</p>

            Yes it supports mp4 or m4a. Camcord a video(thats the supported format). Even if it's just audio mp4 file, it will still play using the real player. But I suggest use mp3 format for the music player.

    <title>How to Sync Outlook.com with Mail App&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dmorganoh  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to Sync Outlook.com with Mail App&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I just bought a new HP computer, I have Win10, an Office 365 subscription, and formerly used Windows Live Mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After setting up my Windows Mail App, I just went to Outlook.com and noticed that the folders that are online are NOT syncing to the App, and I can't find a way to create folders in the app.&nbsp; I read another thread saying, "just create them in Outlook.com
 and they will sync to the App."&nbsp; But this is not happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Understand, the emails ARE loaded into both the App and Outlook.com, but the folders (and therefore the rules I wish to set up for certain incoming email) are not syncing, and they are not showing across devices either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?&nbsp; Much thanks.</p>
<p>DM</p>

            <p>Hello DM, </p>
<p>
</p><p>To troubleshoot the syncing issue from your Outlook.com to Windows 10 Mail application, we suggest checking the workaround on this
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Resolve-sync-issues-in-Mail-and-Calendar-apps-in-Windows-10-0dd86c69-18f3-4f73-9d3d-375bdc9c3e34" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>. The issue in the article is about the Calendar apps,
 however, it also applies to your case specially with the Mail application settings, it might be the cause why your folder is not automatically syncing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

    <title>Using One Drive for Business as a laptop backup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jtpryanbe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using One Drive for Business as a laptop backup</h2>
                    <p>I manage the IT in a small company of about 30 users. &nbsp;They &nbsp;are all on laptops. &nbsp;None use a lot of local storage for documents, but they do keep files in My Documents they would not want to lose. &nbsp;None are very large (Word, Excel, PDF, etc.) &nbsp;They are running
 a mix of Windows 7 pro and 10, in the process of migrating to 10. &nbsp;Using Office 365 (just email, Skype, sharepoint, no Office apps)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have started moving their "my documents" location to the One Drive for Business folder and this seems to work just fine. &nbsp;My problem is the ever changing install process. &nbsp;I do this part time so I do some whenever I am in the office or can get on somebody
 remotely. &nbsp;Lately a new process seems to have emerged. &nbsp;Now, after I install One Drive from the Office 365 site it then wants me to install the personal Onedrive App. &nbsp;In the &nbsp;end this leaves me with 2 One Drive locations. &nbsp;Each time I do this it seems to
 be just a little different, and it is always confusing. &nbsp;This means I can find no way to write a document to reliably instruct the users to do this on their own. &nbsp;This means I need to do each one. &nbsp;While this is fine from a billing perspective, I don't like
 to see them incur my expenses if I can direct the users to do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess my question is am I going about this the wrong way? &nbsp;Should I not be installing from the Office 365 site but somewhere else? &nbsp;Is there an installation package I could get somewhere that would do it all at once so I can give that to the users or push
 it out to them?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Jim</p>

            <p><span>HI </span><span>jtpryanBE</span><span>,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>According to your scenario, I would suggest you use the OneDrive Next generation sync client, the installation package can be found here:
</span><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=248256" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=248256</span></a><span>. If you only want to sync files to OneDrive online library, there is no need to install
 the previous OneDrive app from Office 365 site.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Meanwhile, I'd like to explain that the "personal OneDrive" you mentioned is the OneDrive Next Generation Sync client which is a separate app built in Windows 10 system. It’s the
</span>newest<span> OneDrive Sync client which is more stable and reliable. Please refer to this article:
</span><span style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">&nbsp;</span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Get-started-with-the-OneDrive-for-Business-Next-Generation-Sync-Client-in-Windows-615391c4-2bd3-4aae-a42a-858262e42a49?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Get
 started with the OneDrive for Business Next Generation Sync Client in Windows</span></a><span>.
</span></p>
<p>The OneDrive for business sync app you download from the Office 365 site is the pervious OneDrive app. Now for the OneDrive online library, it has priority to use the newest OneDrive Next Generation Sync client to sync files and this is the reason you got
 the prompt when you use the previous OneDrive app. </p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the Next Generation sync client could only sync OneDrive online library, if you want to sync SharePoint library, you need to use the previous OneDrive app which could be installed from the Office 365 site. The two OneDrive app could co-exist in
 one computer and create their own local folder. For more details, please refer to:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Which-OneDrive-sync-client-am-I-using-19246eae-8a51-490a-8d97-a645c151f2ba" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Which OneDrive sync client am I using?</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

    <title>Support Code&#58;80072eff when ActiveSync 4.5 connecting to Windows XP - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joshcsmith13  say:</h3>
<h2>            Support Code&#58;80072eff when ActiveSync 4.5 connecting to Windows XP Home w&#47; Outlook 2002</h2>
                    I have been using PocketPCs for years.&nbsp; Most recently, I had an HP iPaq 2110(?) with Pocket PC 2003, sync'ing with my home PC (Win XP Home &amp; Outlook 2002) and my work laptop (Win XP Pro &amp; Outlook 2007); both working wonderfully.&nbsp; I was running ActiveSync
 4.2 I believe.<br />
<br />
I got a new LG Incite (CT810) with Windows Moblie 6.1.&nbsp; Using the CD supplied with the phone, I installed/upgraded to&nbsp;ActiveSync 4.5 on both PCs I have been using.&nbsp; I connected it to my work laptop with the USB cable and was able to successfully synchronize
 everything I needed (Contacts, Calendar, Tasks, Notes, Favorites, &amp; Files).&nbsp; So far, so good.&nbsp; Sadly, I was not so lucky with my home PC.&nbsp; When I attempt to connect there, I get the "You must unlock your device" (or something like that) message and do so.&nbsp;
 Then it appears to spin its wheels for a minute before placing a red "!" on the ActiveSync graphic and a providing a "Status" link that displays a message to the following effect:<br />
Could Not connect to Server.&nbsp; Support Code:80072eff.<br />
<br />
Everything I've found in regards to this code says it's an SSL issue with an exchange server - but I'm not connecting to a server!&nbsp; I have never connected to a server.&nbsp; Even my synchronization at work is done with the PC.&nbsp; I've tried checking [and unchecking]
 the "Enable Advanced Network Functionality" option in USB to PC connection settings, but with no luck.&nbsp; The same error remains.<br />
<br />
Please help!<br />

            Josh, there is a NEW ROM upgrade available for your device.&nbsp; You can <a href="http://experiencemobility.net/?p=2520" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>read about it here</strong></a> and download and install.&nbsp; The link is in the second paragraph.&nbsp; Since it is an upgrade, it will wipe your device but not only will your now have the latest ROM available but it will give you the chance to redo the partnership
 and hopefully the issue will go away.

 and got the same error.&nbsp; :(<br />

is the only way to "post" a picture to have a link to it???&nbsp;&nbsp; again, that's more time than I have.&nbsp; (this would be the first time attempting such a feat.)<br />

            Hi FlyntM
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Press CONTROL + FN + RIGHT ARROW to reach to the last cell in your Excel sheet. Then you can select A1 to this particular cell to select your range and copy this select range.
<br />This copied portion can be pasted into target workbook.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

<p>I'm not sure I understand what you are trying to do...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you copy an <em>entire sheet</em> it cannot be pasted into a smaller range. IOW, you cannot paste
<strong>A1:XFD1048576</strong> (17,179,869,184 cells) starting anywhere other than in A1 because the right &amp; bottom portions of the copied material would extend off the sheet. No additional rows or columns can be created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think what you may actually need to do is select the specific range you want to copy rather than selecting the entire sheet. The simplest way to select a range is to use the
<strong>Name Box</strong> at the left end of the <strong>Formula Bar</strong>. Click in that, type the reference of the range you want to select [e.g.,
<strong>A1:K1000</strong>], then press <strong>return</strong> &amp; copy the range. You then will be able to paste it anywhere on the destination sheet as long as the starting cell doesn't cause the copied content to exten off the sheet.</p>

<h2>            Trouble &#39;safely ejecting&#39; Lumia Windows phones from Windows 8.1 PC</h2>
                    <p>For months, after plugging in a Lumia 830 to a Windows 8.1 desktop PC (Dell i5)&nbsp; - getting the error "Windows can't stop your 'Lumia 830 (RM-983)' device because a program is still using it. Close any programs that might be using the device, and then try
 again later." </p>
<p>
</p><p>Getting the same error when unplugging a Lumia 520.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions on how to troubleshoot what process is using the Windows Phone? I've checked I'm not syncing the phone, not accessing it in Windows Explorer or using it in any way.<br />
<br />
I've uninstalled the Intel Rapid Storage Technology driver, uninstalled the Dell Backup program, ungraded the Windows Phone desktop sync app -- but still getting the error.
<br />
<br />
Is there a way to figure this out? Would it make sense to somehow uninstall the Windows Phone driver and reinstall? How does one do that?

Any suggestions? </p>

<h2>            Preliminary detection yet no scan results</h2>
                    Hello.<br />
<br />
I have just&nbsp; scanned my computer and external harddrive with MSE. <br />
During scanning the message 'Preliminary scan results show that malicous or potentially unwanted software might exist on your system. Review detected items when scan has completed'&nbsp;
<br />
At the end of the scan nothing was coming up in the history section or anywhere else on the home page.&nbsp;
<br />
Does this mean there weren't actually any items detected, or where are they for me to view and remove or quarantine?<br />
Any help is greatly appreciated!<br />
<br />

            <p>During scan if any Malware been detected MSE won't show you right away and will keep it in quarantine until end of scan and then it will show result of scan once it done. It is possible that it was in temp area and before scan been complete it been removed,
 for example it might be temp internet file and you delete browser history and Malware been deleted.
</p>
<p>In this case, I suggest first go to history tab and click on show all items and see if anything will come up.</p>
<p>Also try run full system scan and see if anything will detect, if in full scan nothing detect then you are safe, but if you have same issue please let us know.</p>

            <p>Hi Cyrus,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please see the following links for information about logs and other options that may help you determine what occurred:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>See: <a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msescan/thread/b9feaa4d-7300-4a76-97cb-fda4393ac50f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If they are not showing&nbsp;up in detected items or quarantined items (or in any of the above logs or reports or in Event Viewer (which should identify all detections), then either they were removed or MSE somehow "lost" them between preliminary results and
 final scan results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To be certain, I recommend treating the situation as if you are infected and then we can be certain when done that all is well.&nbsp; It's better to be safe than sorry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*******************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First I suggest the following settings for MSE (they are what I use and if you don't like them, you can return them to what they were before after this test is done):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure that ALL threat levels are sent to Quarantine where you can then decide whether or not to allow them or leave them there, or remove them. It is the safest solution for having the most options for dealing with the situation. Quarantine is as safe
 as removed, but in some cases you may want to remove them to be more certain - and with this one I would remove it (when the time comes). To do this, open MSE, click on the Settings Tab, and for each of the threat levels, set the action to be Quarantine and
 save.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the History tab and click on allowed and unless you specifically placed something in allowed, remove everything else from the allowed category. Only put things there that you ABSOLUTELY know are not problems (are "false positives") and triple-check
 before you do it as doing this could allow a real threat to bypass security and infect you and it won't be detected or rather won't be reported or acted upon by MSE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on Real-time protection and check all the boxes and save.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on SpyNet and click on Advanced and save. This is not at all dangerous to you and no information sent will be used by Microsoft to identify you even if some minor identification information is sent in terms of defining the
 infection, but it can sometimes help with new threats by initiating an immediate update to deal with the problem if it is in the SpyNet database (and it helps Microsoft update definitions to provide you and everyone else better protection).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Go to the Settings Tab and click on Advanced and check the box for save Quarantine items and change it from one month to three months so you have more time to decide if you want to restore something.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>****************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now update MSE and then run a Full Scan and see if anything turns up detected and/or in quarantine.&nbsp; Leave things as they are for the moment and no matter what the results were (though they may help later with diagnosis or confirmation that all is well by
 the experts), proceed as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, try the following programs if you haven't as they may help. I recommend you download, install, update, and run full scans with Malwarebytes:<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a> and SuperAntiSpyware:<a href="http://superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://superantispyware.com/</span></a>
 and then run a full ESET online scan: <a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner</a>. This may or may not remove the infections, but will probably not repair any damage caused by them. Even if they or your current AV software seem to work or indicate you aren't infected or the problem goes away, you
 shouldn't completely trust them and need to continue with the recommendations that follow (so it's up to you if you want to try them first or just skip over all of this and get the expert help you really need as described below).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Properly and completely removing such infections can be complex and often require manual removal procedures (which may or may not be entirely effective either). Even if they work, I'd suggest the following anyway, so we may as well start there (you can ignore
 the above removal methods if you want as this is really the way to go, but it won't hurt to try them).</p>

<h3> johnlilo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mailmerge not working Office 2013</h2>
                    <p>We regularly use Word to link to excel spreadsheets that act as data sources for an email merges that go out via Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>These processes work fine when running on Win 8.1 and Office 2013 but fail on machines running Win 10 and Office 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We are using:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Subscription product MS Office 365 Small Business Premium (2013) V: 15.0.4833.1001 with updates automatically downloaded an installed</li><li>MS Windows 8.1 pro V:6.3.9600</li></ul>

<p>
</p><p>I have just commissioned a brand new Win10 plus preinstalled Office 2016 and it works fine in that configuration. Seems to be an issue with the Office 2013 we have installed. (We need to use 2013 rather than 2016 due to lack of facility to set up and Exchange

            <p>One certain way to do it is to use the Merge with Attachments facility (you do not need to be sending attachments) on my Merge Tools Add-in.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">You can download the MergeTools – 20150422.dotm Add-in that I created from the following page
 of my One Drive: </span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
</span></span><a href="http://bit.ly/1hduSCB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>http://bit.ly/1hduSCB</span></span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Do NOT open the MergeTools – 20150422.dotm file.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></strong></span><span><span>(There are no user serviceable parts inside and it should NOT be used as the basis for creating your mail merge main document.)<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The MergeTools – 20150422.dotm file needs to be saved in the Word Startup folder.&nbsp;
</span><span>In Windows Vista and Windows 7, 8 or 8.1, and 10, the default location for that folder is
</span><span><br />
C:\Users\[User Name]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Word\STARTUP<br />
<br />
If you do not see the AppData folder: - <br />
<br />
In Windows 7, - In Windows Explorer, click on the Organize drop down and then on Folder and search options and in the Folder Options dialog, go to the View tab and select the item "Show hidden files, folders, and drives".&nbsp; While there, it is a good idea to
 uncheck the box for "Hide extensions&nbsp;for known file types".<br />
<br />
In Windows 8,</span><span>&nbsp; </span><span>8.1 or 10, in the File Explorer, click on Options on the View tab of the ribbon and then on the View tab in the dialog that appears and select the item "Show hidden files, folders, and drives".&nbsp;
 While there, it is a good idea to uncheck the box for "Hide extensions&nbsp;for known file types".
</span><span><br />
</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>When that has been done and Word is started\re-started, the tab shown below will be added to the Ribbon:

</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><br />
</span></span></span><span><span><span>The requirements for using the system are:</span></span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span><span>The mail merge main document must be of the Letter type, though that does not mean that the output cannot be sent as an e-mail message.

<span><span>For the Many To One, Merge with Attachments and Merge to Individual Docs utilities, the data source may be either a table or query in an Access database, or in the form of
 an Excel worksheet and that worksheet must be the first sheet in the Excel workbook. If the data is on some other sheet, you can easily move that sheet so that it is the first sheet in the workbook by clicking on the sheet tab and dragging it to the left.
<span>&nbsp;</span>For the Chart Merge utility, download the Mail Merging with Charts document that is also on that page of my OneDrive for additional requirements of the data source for use with that utility<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span><span>For a data source in the form of an Excel worksheet, the field names must be in the first row of the worksheet and there must be a field name in all of the cells in that
 row that are within the range of columns that contain the data.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span><span>For both types of data source, the field names must contain only alphanumeric characters (No @,#,$,%,&amp;,(,), etc) and the field names must not start with a numeric character

</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span><span>For a data source in the form of an Excel worksheet, the data must start in the second row of the worksheet and there should be no empty rows within the range of data that
 is to be processed.<br />

            <p>Dear Doug,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks and I do appreciate you taking time to&nbsp;reply and note that you have offered MergeTools as a workaround in response to similar/same issues over several years.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However I should not need a 3rd party add-in to&nbsp;achieve functionality that is has been inherent 'out of the box' in the MS Office suite since before 2003. i.e. Email merging from an Excel spreadsheet via a Word merge template&nbsp;out through Outlook. This is
 an issue across 6 out of 10 of our workstations, all six of which are new machines preinstalled with Win10 and then with a downloaded Office 365 Business Premium 2013 install. The only 'bespoke' aspect is that we have had to&nbsp;install Office 2013 rather than
 2016&nbsp;in order to set up MS Exchange Accounts in Outlook. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Win8.1 + Office 2013 is fine. Earlier versions of Windows with earlier versions of Office are fine. We have one very new machine with Win10 + Office 2016 (both preinstalled)&nbsp;and this seems fine. It is only the combination of&nbsp;Win10 + Office365 Business Premium
 2013 that gives this problem. It would be good to have it either identified as a bug that I cannot solve until an MS update is provided or given a solution to make it work as it should.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps an MS technician could pick this up..... rather than just moving the issue around threads!</p>
<p>
</p><p>*** UPDATE. Have now uninstalled Office 2016 on newest PC (where Mail merge was working) in order to install Office 2013 (from Office 365 account) so as to be able to link to Exchange 2007 Mailboxes. and... wait for it... now Mail merge does not work...

                    I am running in a Virtual Machine and installed the technical preview with no internet connection (away from home) and the only option for internet connection at the moment is an ethernet cord. Is this because I installed it without a connection or there
 aren't any drivers present? I also connected a Linksys Compact Wireless-G USB Network Adapter and it lit up green when I connected it to the VM, but still the only listed connection option was Ethernet. Any suggestion?
