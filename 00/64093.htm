<h2>            Cant get The Sims 1 Complete Collection to start up</h2>
                    Everything goes fine until I actually tried starting the game. I get a black screen for a few seconds and then it crashes back to the desktop. I've tried using compatibility mode in Windows XP, 98, ME, 95, running it as an administrator, disabling desktop
 composition and none of those worked. (I have a Windows 7 64 bit laptop).

Can you recommend some graphic emulators that can play old games on my Windows 7 Laptop then?

            The Sims 1 does run on Win7 . <br />
I don't have it installed at the moment, and no longer have the disk, but it did install and run on<br />
Win7 64bit. I don't recall using Compatibility settings, but if I were to install with&nbsp; any compatibility settings I would be inclined to use XP sp2.
<br />
<br />
There is a Windows security Update -&nbsp; KB 2670838 - that can stop games from loading as you
<br />
describe if you are off line at the time (the update causes Windows to check for an update to the game).<br />
This update is&nbsp; required if you use IE 10 , but you can un-install it if you don't use IE 10.<br />
<br />
It may be the game may not run on laptops that use integrated graphics, as it may not recognise<br />
the Integrated graphics chip as a viable graphics card (having no dedicated VRAM is sometimes a problem).<br />
<br />
If Integrated graphics is not the problem and you have been installing to the default location
<br />
- Program Files (x86) - try using a 'custom' install location. <br />
A separate partition or Hard Drive are best, but you could also make a new folder to install games
<br />
to in the C:\&nbsp; drive/partition. <br />
This method more commonly helps with permissions issues, but can be useful with other problems&nbsp;
<br />
( DOOM3 crashed my machine when trying to install to the default location) on occasion.<br />

I uninstalled the security update, right clicked on the exe, selected run with graphics processor, then high performance NVIDIA processor instead of Integrated graphics, and uninstalled the game and reinstalled it to D drive instead. None of those worked. Still
 crashes back to the desktop after starting the game.

            Hmm - Maybe something different between the 'Complete Collection' and the 'Deluxe' version I had ?<br />
If you're using a torrent download version that would be the problem. They do things different from
<br />
legitimate versions.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
[- Oops - I think I got a detail of that update wrong . I believe it was an 'optional', not 'security' update.]<br />

I tired it both with an legitimate copy and a torrent. At first I thought my CD was perhaps too scratched to work properly (I did notice several small scratches). So I used a torrent and followed the steps but i still got the same results.

    <title>Constant issues with windows update .. suspected to be graphics driver - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> inpiri0n  say:</h3>
<h2>            Constant issues with windows update .. suspected to be graphics driver problem.</h2>
                    <p>I have been having continuous and repetitive problems with windows 10 updates.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all I updated from windows 8.1 to windows 10, which worked fine initially and then as soon as it updated itself after install of 10 the computer would no longer get past the sign-in screen without crashing (screen would freeze no keys would work
 and cursor not moving), I forced shut down and when rebooted same would happen again and again and again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried all troubleshooting options given to me from forums and online support articles. But nothing changed. So I did a reinstall but keeping my files, but this also did not work. So I did a total wipe of the system and reinstall from boot disk for windows
 10. This made the computer work again, so I made a recovery disk image in case something happened again. But soon enough it happened again, but I reinstalled from my new disk image, and while researching on problems with updates,somebody suggested disabling
 the forced updates by changing to a metered network connection. so nothing is installed without permission. So now my computer works, but obviously the problem with this is that I am afraid of updating anything in case it messes my computer again, plus I am
 a graphic designer and so need to use my graphics card which no longer works without an Nvidia driver update, and I strongly suspect this is the problem, as I have heard that &nbsp;other have had the same problem with the windows 10 update for NVidia, most have
 suggested that it works fine if you install directly from the website and not windows, but the problem is that I need to update other things like security etc, but if I take off the metered connection then it will force me to update the graphics driver to
 one that might totally mess up my computer again I cannot afford to go through this as I am fearful I will loose work files. I have already wasted several days worth of hours on this as well.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. Let me help you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to download and install the latest drivers from Nvidia official website and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, install it in Windows 8.1 compatibility mode and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Run the program in the compatibility mode.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If a program or driver written for an earlier version of Windows doesn't run properly in current Windows, then you could try using
<strong>compatibility mode</strong> on the program to hopefully allow it to run properly.</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to run the program/game in the compatibility mode and check if it helps. Follow the below steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Right click on the program icon, click on
<strong>Properties</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Click the <strong>
Compatibility</strong> tab.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Check the <strong>
Run this program in compatibility mode for</strong> box and select the Preferred <strong>
Windows</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Click on <strong>
Apply</strong> and click <strong>OK</strong> button.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>Check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope it helps. Keep us posted on the issue. We will be happy to assist you.</span></p>

</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community. </span></p>
<p><span>Sorry for the inconvenience caused to you. Let me help you to fix the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I appreciate the troubleshooting steps you have performed trying to fix the issue. Go to the Windows update installed and let us know which Windows update KB number is conflict to the issue.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Type update on the windows search bar and select View installed update.
</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Check for the KB number.</p>

</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Meanwhile, let’s try simple troubleshooting steps and check. At first, I suggest you to install the graphic card driver and try installing the Windows update. Go to the below link and click on AUTO DETECT YOUR GPU. It

            So I did as you said and installed latest compatible driver from nvidia website, and half way through the installation the screen/cursor freezes, so it is still definitely a graphics driver issue as this had not happened since latest install while blocked
 updates. What I will do is force shut down go into safemode uninstall nvidia drivers if possible, then I don't know what to do maybe will try again in Windows 8 compatibility mode&nbsp;

<p>I have had problems similar to yours for three years. I have even purchased four different (very expensive) laptops to try and resolve these issues (and worked with HP tech support, Geek Squad, Dell, and two independent IT consultants – I also went to Best
 Buy and had the sales guy plug different high-end laptops into different monitors, and they all looked like crap).</p>
<p>
</p><p>My conclusion is that Windows and NVIDIA simply don't play well together. Unfortunately, I can't find any rationale discussion of how a designer is supposed to get around this seeming incompatibility. (Using a Mac is not an option in my world.)</p>

            This error might occur if you have a corrupted file in the Component Based Servicing (CBS) manifest. To resolve this, you will need to perform a repair installation.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Performing a repair installation will restore the current Windows installation to the version of the installation DVD. This also requires the installation of all updates that are not included on the installation DVD.<br />
<br />
Note: Performing a repair installation will not damage files and programs that are currently installed on your computer.<br />
<br />
To perform a repair installation of Windows, follow these steps:<br />
<br />
1.Close all programs, and then restart the computer.<br />
<br />
2.Insert the Windows DVD in the computer's DVD drive.<br />
<br />
3.In the Setup window, click Install Now.<br />
Note If Windows does not automatically detect the DVD, follow these steps:<br />
<br />
a.Click the StartCollapse this imageExpand this image button, and then type Drive:\setup.exe in the search box.<br />
Note The Drive placeholder is the drive letter of the computer's DVD drive.<br />
<br />
b.In the Programs list, click Setup.exe.<br />
<br />
c.In the Setup window, click Install Now.<br />
<br />
d.Click Go online to obtain the latest updates for installation (recommended).<br />
<br />
e.Click Yes to accept the Microsoft Software License Terms.<br />
<br />

<h2>            Getting message &#34;server DNS address could not be found&#34; on a Windows 7 machine</h2>
                    <p>I haven't used my laptop in awhile (it's an Acer with Windows 7) and now when I go to Google something it pulls up the results, but if I click on one it says "This site cannot be reached" then it gives the URL and says "server DNS address could not be found".
 It's obviously not a network connectivity issue or else it wouldn't have been able to search something in the first place. I've tried resetting Google Chrome settings with still no luck, I even was desperate enough to test Internet Explorer and it had the
 same issue, someone please help me out this is beyond my knowledge.</p>

<h2>            Xbox one games and console updates</h2>
                    
<p>I don't know if this is a problem my end or if everyone has/think's this but,.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why does it take so long for the xbox one to update? Doesn't matter if it's a game itself, console update or installing a game but it takes bloody ages! The 360 done all of these so fast I barely noticed, now when it pop's up I press ok and have time for
 a nap. Just me or what? Why?</p>

<p>I've got my Xbox on Instant On mode, and automatic updates on. &nbsp;I say this because for the last few months I never see updates, they're downloaded in the background when the console is 'off'... the system updates also now install and reboot the console when
 it's 'off'. &nbsp;Game updates are pre-downloaded and installed the moment you boot up the game.</p>
<p>IMO it's infintely better than the 360 system, it's all ready to go when I want to game.</p>

<p>Possibly because the updates are so much bigger than the 360? Bigger updates means longer downloads and longer installs.</p>
<p>Do what I and other people do, leave your console in "instant on" mode, then updates are downloaded as soon as they are available, usually when your at work. &nbsp;For example the last system update happened and I didn't even know it had updated untill I noticed
 the "what's new" tile on the dashboard.</p>

<p>Updates on the 360 were limited to 8MB each originally, because the original 360s came with no internal storage and the cheaper models came with a small memory unit instead of a hard drive.</p>
<p>On the Xbox One, as every console has a hard drive there are no such restrictions on developers, which is a bit of a double-edged sword. With the 360, devs had to bear in mind that they only had 8MB to play with before the game even shipped and they would
 have to make sure their patches were super tight (in terms of coding), but it also limited developers a few times due to the small file size limit.</p>
<p>The Xbox One has been designed to be used in "instant on" mode with a broadband connection, so many of the patches and updates should be downloaded and installed while the console is in sleep mode. It can be a bit of a pain for people with slow broadband
 though, particularly when you install a disc-based game for the first time as it will also check for (and download) any patches that are available at that point.</p>

<p>Well technically when the console is in "instant on" mode it really isn't completely turned off, but in a low power state.

<p>It's never "completely" turned off, because even in energy saving mode it's consuming a trickle of power to check for you pressing the on button. I know what you're saying though, so I'm just being pedantic. :D</p>
<p>Here's the power consumption figures recorded by Anandtech (PS4 figures in brackets for anyone that cares): -</p>
<p>Energy saving mode (off) = 0.22 Watts (0.45)</p>
<p>Instant on mode (off) = 15.3 Watts (8.59)</p>
<p>Idle on the dashboard = 69.7 Watts (88.9)</p>
<p>Under load while gaming = 119 Watts (139.8)</p>
<p>Under load while watching a Blu-Ray disc = 79.9 Watts (98)</p>

<p>So, it saves more on electricity than Sony's console in most cases? ...awesome.<br />
<br />
I wish that with the updates, we had a more streamlined and universally-standard way of seeing what exactly was updated (like patch notes) through the games and apps screen. The star is a nice touch, but I hate seeing it knowing that something was updated,
 but not knowing what changed. Right now, the only way to really tell is if the developers publicly announce it.</p>

<p>I turn everything to do with my t.v off at the main's at night (no particular reason, although it saves a few pennie's) when I first got the XBone I left it on the instant on mode but noticed that the power supply box stayed pretty warm, so then I changed
 it to the power saving mode so everything cooled down when I wasn't using it. But those updates being done whilst the console is in standy is pretty good and would help. What about when you buy a new game and the initial install? and if you d/l a full game
 (like I had to with my copy of COD Ghost's) that d/l time I thought was a p**s take.

<p>There's not a lot you can do about buying a new game and having to install it. At least it only has to be done once.</p>
<p>With downloadable games, if you have a friend who has the disc-based version, you can install that to your Xbox One and then buy the game digitally and it won't need to download the entire game again as it's already installed on your hard drive. It will
 still download any patches released since the game came out though.</p>
<p>I've just upgraded to 160 Mbps broadband, so I'm all good for download games and patches. :D</p>

<h2>            Windows update failing to work on Surface RT &#40;8.1&#41;</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>I got a used Surface 1 RT with Windows 8.1 running, without any updates installed after the OS update. Windows update never ran successfully. It keeps on checking for updates for an unlimited period of time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided to run the troubleshooter for Windows Update. I got this: </p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8cf9d4c4-46cf-439d-a815-f9bbbab00b15" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8cf9d4c4-46cf-439d-a815-f9bbbab00b15" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, I tried to check for updates, it gave me this error:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6e2e8da0-c292-43cf-a70f-e395d62414dd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6e2e8da0-c292-43cf-a70f-e395d62414dd" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I pressed try again, but it has stuck on Checking for Updates again...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I restarted the device, then ran the troubleshooter again, and I essensially got the same error as before:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9a79e28d-ef6d-47d4-a41d-49cff4a943c1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9a79e28d-ef6d-47d4-a41d-49cff4a943c1" /></a></p>

            I used <strong>sfc /SCANNOW </strong>and now I am able to&nbsp;use the troubleshooter&nbsp;again. It gives the same result as that of the third screenshot in the post above. Windows update still takes forever to check for updates, too.

<h2>            Boxset season pass isn&#39;t complete  - how to raise missing episodes&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought the first series of 'What We Do In The Shadows' (the TV series) as a season pass on the Xbox Store. I'm sure that when I bought it, all 10 episodes were listed in the season (the last two were not playable as they hadn't aired yet on BBC but were
 still listed). Since buying the season pass, both my download in Films and TV and the Store itself only list the first eight episodes and are missing the last two. The series has ended now so the full set of ten episodes should be available to watch, but nothing
 has been updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried explaining this to the chat agent a couple of days ago but they said that the season only has eight episodes, and the only other option was to refund the item. I bought it originally as BBC iPlayer only keeps programs for so long before they're removed,
 and would prefer to keep it and have the full set. Unfortunately the store receipt email only lists the season pass as one item and doesn't show what episodes are included.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I raise that a store item is incomplete?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            Report it thru the console is all i can think of, also try doing a hard reset on your console as well. There are 10 episodes so the last two should be playable.

            You have to wait until the episodes are added. Sometimes its instant other times you have to wait.

<p><strong>Update: </strong>I rang Microsoft after waiting a little longer to see if the episodes would catch up. The answer was a bit weird; the person I spoke to looked on the store and stated there were only eight available, and that this was all that was
 supplied to Microsoft by the company (FX). They suggested that I raised the problem with FX as there was nothing more they could do. On the FX/Microsoft supplier page there were only eight episodes listed, even though FX Canada, BBC and Wikipedia are showing
 all ten. </p>
<p>
</p><p>When I asked, there wasn't any way of raising that this was incorrect through the Store or from Microsoft. I can't get the main FX site because I'm in the UK, but I tried the FX Canada site and couldn't get a reply (not surprising really). I've looked but
 I can't find any other way of saying there's a problem with a store item, whether it's through the console or on the Store websites. I even thought of asking TiVo as they are listed as supplying some of the content on the Store page, but I doubt they'd answer
 either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other ideas? I know it seems stupid to try and chase down two episodes, but I'd really like the full set.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Okay so like an idiot I upgraded to Windows 10 ...I really didn't want to, I was very happy with Windows 7, but that stupid window kept popping up asking me to upgrade,and now I'm dealing with this ****. Every time I open my File Explorer it crashes, the
 Taskbar keeps reloading/refreshing itself every 20 seconds, and everytime it does that whatever else I have open gets deselected and pushed to the back(like when you open a new tab, but there's no new tab) ...its driving me nuts! Please someone help me!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel like I've tried just about everything at this point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the Microsoft System File Checker, but it didn't find anything...</p>
<p>I've scanned my PC using Malwarebytes to see if it was a virus or maleware related issue, but it also found nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And! then I went through each and every program file to check for anything Malwarebytes may have missed, but nothing!</p>

            I tried both methods and it's still getting the same error message, the Taskbar and background are still refreshing every few seconds, and the file Explorer and the start menu are still crashing everytime it happens. Is there anyway I could just go back
 to Windows 7?

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yellow entries are references in your registry usually to files that no longer exist on the system.&nbsp;You will also notice that Image paths for those files will probably say 'File not found'.&nbsp;Sometimes Autoruns may incorrectly mark some items as "file not
 found" when the referenced file is actually present and also may NOT mark some entries as "file not found" where in fact the referenced file is not there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you tried deleting anything?</p>
<p>Did you see any yellow highlighted Image Paths that ends&nbsp;with sysMenu.dll?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggest you to create a <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/create-a-system-restore-point" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
restore point </a>before you make any changes to those files that are highlighted in yellow.</p>

            Hi Stuart,<br />
<br />
Corrupted system files are one of the many possible reasons why this issue is happening. We recommend performing clean install instead of reset. Follow the steps on this

    <title>HDMI Port not Working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mrlesserman  say:</h3>
<h2>            HDMI Port not Working</h2>
                    
<p>Ok, about 3 months ago I moved my Xbox 360 S up from my basement to my living room and connected it to my tv using my HDMI cord, it didn't work. For the last 3 months I have had to use the compound (is that the right word?) cable that came with my Xbox,
 which looks terrible. Its not my cable, because I bought a new one, and it's not my tv because I tried my other one. I did every trouble-shooting idea I have found, nothing has worked. I actually did talk to support about it, but apparently my warranty ran
 up 2 weeks before a year, so they didn't do anything.&nbsp;&nbsp;If anyone has anything that has worked for them, could you please tell me, it's really annoying, and I'd prefer not buy a new Xbox.</p>

<p>Hey.Have you tried hooking other HDMI devices up to see if they work?And have you made sure you switched to HDMI in the settings area of your 360? Also iam sure you did but in case you didnt try other HDMI Ports on your tv...If nothing works then its your
 360....Be sure to check your settings on your tv as well.Good luck..</p>

<p>In addition to what jaspertodd suggested, have you tried connecting your Xbox to a different HDMI device? maybe a friend's TV or a monitor. Bonus if they already have a 360 hooked up, so you'll know if it's yours or theirs.</p>

<p>If you've swapped cables and tried different devices, then it's pretty much narrowed down to your XBox itself. &nbsp;Sadly, there is likely something wrong with your HDMI port.</p>
<p>Component shouldn't be that much worse though. &nbsp;Composite is the yellow, red, white cables, while Component is the Red, Green, Blue + Red, White cables. &nbsp;Make sure you are connecting Component and make sure that the switch on your adapter, at the base where
 it connects to the XBox, is switched to HD. &nbsp;</p>
<p>HDMI carries a digital signal, as does a component cable on HD quality. &nbsp;Digital signal means it either gets there or doesn't, there should be almost no difference in quality. &nbsp;The only issue you might have is that a lot of TVs don't support 1080p on Component,
 but you can still hit 1080i or 720p on them, so still HD quality for sure.</p>
<p>And, of course, you can always send back your XBox and get it repaired.</p>

    <title>Internet connection keeps dropping, since Win 10 update and still no - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jemmmartin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internet connection keeps dropping, since Win 10 update and still no resolution....</h2>
                    <p>Hello once again to everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I posted a message back earlier this month and I had no response as to why this problem and how to fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I decided to post again, in hopes someone has some advice or actually knows what is going on to cause this
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">very bad issue</span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is my Internet Connection keeps dropping since upgrading to Win 10 from Win 7 Home.</p>
<p>The problem seems to be happening even more frequently now then back when I originally posted about this issue.</p>
<p>The processor has settled down somewhat, but the internet dropping is so bad, I am getting to the point I cannot download Windows Updates, because of loss of internet connection.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read and read, still to date, on various Tech sites and still not finding any solutions that work for me, as of today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>HERE IS MY ORIGINAL POST:&nbsp; 8/10/16</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I too, am having a similar problem as A Mountain Man.&nbsp; But, I am using WiFi and having the same issues as he is.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Here are some things I have considered:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>1) No other devices in my home are giving me the grief of an intermittent internet connection except my
</p>
<p>HP Desktop which was recently updated to Win 10 OS.&nbsp; </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Yes</span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">, this problem started after the update from Win 7 Home to Win 10 Home.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The current Internet connection on my HP Desktop can last from 1 minute and up to 5 minutes and then it's gone.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I have to manually disable the network device and then re-enable it to get the internet back.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I have to go through this process every 1 to 5 minutes, everyday, as long as I am using the internet.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Pretty lousy, I would say...</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Now here is where it starts to get crazy......</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I updated this PC to Win 10 in the early part of the last week in July 2016.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
This problem began immediately.</span></p>
<p>Then less then 1 week later, I updated my Lenovo Desktop PC to Win 10 from Win 8.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Can you imagine this.....</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">No</span> problem on the Lenovo Desktop with it's WiFi internet connection.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The same "<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Fall Version" of Win 10</span> was used on the Lenovo Desktop as was the HP Desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(The Live Tiles do not work on the Lenovo Desktop, but of course that is another problem to work on at another time.&nbsp; But, amazingly, the Live Tiles do work on the Hp Desktop with it's dysfunctional Wi Fi internet connection.)</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Now here is where it gets even crazier......</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Everytime the WiFi goes down on my HP Desktop, my processor starts racing and resources start going up.. up.. up.</p>
<p>I use Process Lasso to do it's job at keeping my Processes under control, but this thing is way out of hand.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What could happen to cause an inactive network adapter (when the internet connection is dead) make my processor go into overload?&nbsp;
</strong></p>
<p>I have watched in Process Lasso as to what is running so high to make the Processor scream and the only things that</p>
<p>are using a "high amount of usage" are <strong>dwm.exe, RtlService.exe and Winlogon.exe.&nbsp;
</strong></p>
<p>If I have read correctly, do these services not take a bit more resources then other apps normally?</p>
<p>But I would think they would not be responsible for dropping the internet connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what I am experiencing, this seems to be a somewhat timed event going on.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>In my thoughts, it is definitely related to the network adapter being disconnected.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>All this described above happens at the same time.</p>
<p>When the Internet connection is lost, the processor starts running high, but after re-enabling the Network Adapter,</p>
<p>and the internet is back, the processor starts cooling down and running normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am deeply concerned with my processor running high, as the HP is not a brand new PC.&nbsp; It has some season to it.</p>
<p>But even if It were a brand new PC, I do not want to burn the processor up.&nbsp; Running at close to using maximum resources every 1-5 minutes is truly not a good thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone on here have an knowledge as to what and why this started occuring since the Win 10 update?</p>
<p>More so, what can be done to resolve this particularly <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
worrisome and agitating</span> situation?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Windows Defender and Malwarebytes Anti-Malware on both Desktops.</p>
<p>Also used are Windows Firewall on both desktops.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I use pretty much the same software on both PC's.</p>
<p>I run scans daily and every other day respectfully.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I have not had anything bad show on either of the scans for quite awhile on these PC's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been to a number of forums and tried a number of things and none of them worked.</p>
<p>I have also read a number of Technical related Blogs, and tried a number of things and they too did not resolve</p>
<p>this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am here to hopefully hear of some other options that I have not read about and tried thus far, that would once and for all resolve this troublesome issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do hope the rest of those on here with similar problems find a resolution quickly.&nbsp; I truly empathize with you all!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you so much in advance!</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>Drogon10,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My sincerest thanks, for that superbly important Microsoft link on the loosing your</p>
<p>Network Connection.</p>
<p>I would have not found that link on my own, the past two months, even with all the research I have done on this issue.</p>
<p>I am not a new person to Windows, as I have been using it for around 23 years, but this was</p>
<p>one of the more baffling issues I have come across over the years.</p>
<p>So again, sincerest thanks Drogon10!</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Now for all of you who have this same issue with Win 10, listen up, please.......</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I had tried everything I had come across to resolve the Internet Connection drop issue.</p>
<p>I had gone from forum to forum, reading Technical Website resolutions to Technical Blogs, and
</p>
<p>still, none of them provided <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">me</span> with a resolution.</p>
<p>I was not going to revert back to Win 7, like it seemed many of disappointed users were doing, according</p>
<p>to what I was reading online.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I chose to keep Win 10 because I like it and I do not want to go back to (<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">for this PC</span>) a troubled OS.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I really just had too many issues with Win 7 and was tired of dealing with them for around 8 years.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>But I think overall, Win 7 was a good OS for most.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, with the fact I wanted to keep Win 10, I read and re-read this link Drogon10 suggested, I worked down the list and behold...</p>
<p>At this time, there is a resolution to the connection drop.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I seem to once again, have a solid internet connection.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">What worked for my PC:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I went down the list, as I said earlier, step by step and stopped @ "temporarily turning off my firewall and anti-virus</p>
<p>software.</p>
<p>By the time I reached this suggestion, I noticed that webpages were loading and I was no longer coming up with error pages, from no internet connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I rebooted the PC and yes, it was holding the wireless connection.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I also noticed my PC's processor was not singing at close to it's top note.&nbsp; The processor is running</p>
<p>normally, once again.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This was a side affect of the dropping connection for this PC.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I still do not understand where that comes into play with a connection issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I seriously doubted that the Win 10 Firewall and Microsoft Defender, which are the protector's I use on my</p>
<p>machines, were really at the core of this issue.</p>
<p>So with that in mind, I stopped short of turning them off temporarily.&nbsp; </p>
<p>By this time, was my realization that I had internet for much more then 2-5 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, my issue was not a simple fix like just going into the Windows Network &amp; Sharing Center and</p>
<p>resetting the Network Adapter or running the Windows Network Diagnostics, for it to find the issue and fix.</p>
<p>My issue required more knowledge from someone, of proper network settings, which honestly, I am not super knowledgeable of.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had already tried everything on that Microsoft link, up to the point of temporarily turning off my firewall &amp; anti-virus programs, (but not including) "Running these Network Commands."&nbsp;
</p>
<p>This was one area I had not seen any write-ups online, yet.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">My resolution came after doing the "Running these Network Commands."</span></p>
<p>Something must have not been configured right from the beginning of upgrading to Win 10 from Win 7 Home.</p>
<p>Following the instructions must have reset/flushed it to the correct setting/configuration for my network connection to work correctly on this particular PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">So, my conclusion:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are experiencing this issue, <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">do</span> check this Microsoft link out:&nbsp;
</p>
<p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a number of steps in this Technical Sheet of such, that may very well get your connection back.</p>

Greg Carmack,<br />
<br />
<br />
As I had stated earlier in a response to this forum, I am not very knowledgeable to Network issues.<br />
<br />
But, in a response to your question, you ask:<br />
<br />
<br />
When the issue became quite apparent, just after upgrading to Win 10, I tried everything a standard user would try to resolve the situation.<br />
<br />
This included using the troubleshooter in Windows and out of I would guess 100++ times I tried that, there just was nothing that showed up for me to fix.
<br />
<br />
This baffled me, because some of those many times of no connection, the wifi icon in the systray would appear to still be active, as though it still had a connection.&nbsp; Yet, as the user, there was no internet...No webpages loading, no email....nothing.&nbsp; In win
 7 or 8 your wifi icon would either have a red line through it or faded to let you know that<br />
<br />
you were not connected.&nbsp; Win 10 is different in that area, on this PC.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, I did the next step a user would do and that was opening the network and sharing option and checking the network adapter for problems.&nbsp; Part of the time it would tell me There is no internet connection available and other times it would say there were connections
 available, but it would not join up with my network.&nbsp; Whatever causes this.....<br />
<br />
<br />
So I found that if I disabled the network adapter and then re-enabled it, I would get the internet back, for a little bit.&nbsp; Try doing that every 2-5 minutes...for two months...<br />
<br />
It seemed to me, at that time, that something was wrong with the network adapter if it would work and then not work.<br />
<br />
<br />
So I then went and re-downloaded my wireless network adapter, which it was already the most recent network adapter driver, but went ahead and installed it again and rebooted and the same problem existed.&nbsp; Nothing had changed.<br />
<br />
I did not roll back the driver that was listed in the Microsoft link because I believed it was not the issue by this time.<br />
<br />
<br />
I already knew it was not a modem problem or my ISP because all other devices and PC's in my network were having no problems with an internet connection.&nbsp; So, of course this comes back to it being something to do with this particular PC and it's OS/configuration
 of the Network connection.<br />
<br />
<br />
Honestly, there were other things I tried along the way of my journey with this issue, but they did not work either and I cannot even remember what they were.
<br />
<br />
<br />
So then we get to the part of the step of running the Network Troubleshooter again, and following the step and as usual, the troubleshooter could not find any issues.&nbsp; So I continued on with the next step related in the Network Trouble Shooting which is this:<br />
<br />
<br />
If that doesn’t fix your connection problem, try these things:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reset the TCP/IP stack<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Release the IP address<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Renew the IP address<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flush and reset the DNS client resolver cache<br />
<br />
To run these networking commands in a command prompt window<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the search box on the taskbar, type Command prompt, press and hold (or right-click) Command prompt, and then select Run as administrator &gt; Yes.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the command prompt, run the following commands in the listed order, and then check to see if that fixes your connection problem:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type netsh winsock reset and press Enter.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type netsh int ip reset and press Enter.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type ipconfig /release and press Enter.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type ipconfig /renew and press Enter.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type ipconfig /flushdns and press Enter.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is where I believe the problem was. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Somewhere in these commands, it flushed or fixed the issue, because after running these commands, the internet was back and holding.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now if these commands are considered a flush, what does this mean:&nbsp; ipconfig/flushdns?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do this mentioned flush (2) times weekly in my maintenance steps I have setup for both PC's.
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would this not be doing a similar flush?&nbsp; If so, in the past, this never worked for this particular PC's connection issue.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had an issue with a VPN a several years back and after banging my head against the wall with the issue of not holding on to or at times even getting a connection with the VPN server, the company's higher tier of Tech Support told me to do the DNS flush
 to clean out the DNS cache and that may resolve the issue of extremely slow connection or just not holding onto the VPN connection.
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seemed to resolve that particular issue and I have gotten into a habit ever since, with both PC's of doing just that, twice a week as maintenance.
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be it this helps or not, my (connection regular or VPN) does not seem to get bogged down like years back.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was especially bad in Win 8.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now how do the IPconfig/flushdns differ from the commands that were used from the Microsoft Tech sheet that I followed that were apparently flushes too?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could you explain what exactly those commands did for my network?<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will be going over the Windows 10 Integrity Checklist link you recommended and see what happens there.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for that recommendation.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for a clean install, I had planned on doing that anyway for both PC's down the road, because I do not believe that upgrades necessarily give the user the best experience, as sometimes issues creep up from things that did not upgrade properly from the
 previous OS and it can be a world of grief.&nbsp; Been there, done that.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just wanted a break from getting the upgrades done and finding out if I even wanted to keep Win 10 or not and then do a clean install if I found I was happy with it.
<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I discover anything new on my PC's or something that would help someone here in the forum, I will post again.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a few other issues I am having that are non related to this topic, but definitely Win 10 issues, that I probably will post on here to see if someone has answers to.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for the response and hope I have given a clearer explanation as to what went on my end and what steps were taken to get my internet connection back on this PC.

<p>Oh how I feel your pain Jemm. I've been having exactly the same problems on my HP laptop and I am so close to chucking it out the window. I know its definitely something to do with a Windows 10 update or Windows 10 itself and I wish to god I had never installed
 it. </p>
<p>For quite a few months now, my internet connection has been sporadically dropping every half hour for no reason yet it's fine when I use my other halfs old Lenovo laptop.</p>
<p>Did all the standard troubleshooting stuff. Didn't work. I tried completely resetting my laptop which didn't work, then tried to uninstall the latest update that was shown. All seemed fine until it decided it was going to reinstall the update again (at this
 point I really hate you Microsoft!)</p>
<p>Like Jemm, I am not technically minded at all. I am going to try going through the list and hope that something there will fix this. If not, does anyone want to buy a second hand HP laptop? Works great unless you want internet from it haha. May have a few
 dents and scratches from being thrown out a window!</p>

            Try setting your router to a specific channel (ie: Channel 1 or 6 or 11) instead of automatic, this worked for my Qualcomm Atheros wireless device.

<h2>            Free Windows 10 upgrade on taskbar.</h2>
                    This morning I saw an icon on my taskbar that says Get Windows 10. When I click on it it says I can reserve my free upgrade to Windows 10 when it's released. Is this legit or is this a virus?&nbsp;

            <p>It's legitimate. Windows 10 will be free when released and notifications are going out to anyone who has either signed up to receive info (like joining the "Windows Insider" program) or has installed the update availability notification tool that was recently
 released as a "recommended" update.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>On just got my notification of the free update and it leaves me wondering (as the FAQ link gave me a 404 ERROR).&nbsp; Hopefully someone will be able to answer my questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My biggest concern is what I will lose by moving to Windows 10, as shown by first question.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>I'm using Windows 7 Ultimate x64.&nbsp; What are the differences between Windows 10 and Windows 7 Ultimate? Specifically, what am I going to LOSE, if anything.&nbsp; I use most of the Ultimate features (specifically the media center, as my some of my TV recording
 devices requires media center).</li><li>Will this free upgrade allow me to do a clean installation now and down the road?</li><li>Will Vista drivers work on 10, I have several systems and one of them is a Dell Precision 390.&nbsp; Dell only stopped releasing drivers with Vista for the 390.&nbsp; This is part of #1, but specific enough to justify its own question.<br />
</li><li>Will the upgrade allow me to set up a dual boot environment?&nbsp; (Use both till 10 is able to run 100% of my drivers and applications.)</li><li>I have several systems, will this upgrade work on each or do I need to get upgrade offers for each individual system?</li><li>Will this upgrade expire or require some money at some point to run fully?</li><li>What else should I be asking / worrying about?</li></ol>
<p>I used to use OS/2 (for MS-OS2 and then later OS/2 Warp) and finally with Windows 7, Microsoft exceed OS/2.&nbsp; I trust Windows 7 Ultimate and don't want to lose functionality just to gain something new for the sake of being new.&nbsp; ESPECIALLY, when new interfaces
 aren't - IMHO, such as cards - very good / useful / etc.&nbsp; (My main issue with cards is the need to scroll and scroll and scroll.&nbsp; I'm originally from the Unix (System V, BSD), UNICOS) and IBM VM/370-ESA world so command line and GUI make sense to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed others asking about what computers one has .. The ones I have running Windows are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dell Precision T7500 (12 physical/24 logical cores, 192GB RAM)</p>
<p>Dell Precision 390 (4 physical cores, 8 GB RAM)&nbsp; -- TWO of these systems</p>
<p>Dell Inspiron 15&nbsp; (12 physical cores, 16GB RAM)</p>
<p>Alienware 17M2 (8 physical cores, 32GB RAM)</p>
<p>Dell Inspiron 9300 (single core, 2GB RAM, XP 32bit, don't think it can upgrade to Windows 10).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm excluding the systems running Unix/Linx and OS/2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you, in advance, for your help and positive replies.</p>

<strong>The logical successor to Windows 7 Ultimate is Windows 10 Pro 64 bit.<br />
You will lose Media Center.<br />
</strong></li></ol>
<p><strong>Is Media Center supported&nbsp;in Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>No. Persons who need to use Media Center should consider carefully before upgrading from their previous version of Windows. The Windows 10 upgrade will automatically remove any installations of Media Center.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>So what are the alternatives if I need Media Center?</strong></p>
<p>Your best option is to continue running your existing version of Windows with Media Center.</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 7 editions that include Media Center will continue to be supported until January 2020.</li><li>Windows 8 Pro with Media Center will continue to be supported until January 2023.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Will this free upgrade allow me to do a clean installation now and down the road?
<strong><br />
</strong><strong>Yes, you will be able:<br />
</strong></li></ol>
<p><strong>Will users who take advantage of the upgrade offer for Windows 10 from Windows 8.1 and Windows 7 also be able to obtain recovery media?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft recently noted the following options available:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">&nbsp;<em>With Windows 10, you can create your own recovery media and back up the pristine state of the operating system and preinstalled software. If things go wrong and you are unable to refresh or reset your device successfully, you
 can boot the device using recovery media and reset to the prior pristine state.</em></p>

</span></a></p>
<ol>
<li>Will Vista drivers work on 10, I have several systems and one of them is a Dell Precision 390.&nbsp; Dell only stopped releasing drivers with Vista for the 390.&nbsp; This is part of #1, but specific enough to justify its own question.<br />
<br />
<strong>Its not a guarantee Windows Vista drivers will work, some might.<br />
</strong></li></ol>
<p><strong>Will my existing programs work on Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Most applications designed for Windows 7 or later should work with Windows 10. Of course, with significant changes expected in Windows 10, it is best you contact the developer of your software programs to find out about support for Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What about my hardware?</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft has not released details regarding hardware compatibility, this will be determined at a later date as we approach the launch of Windows 10.
</p>
<ol>
<li><br />
</li><li>Will the upgrade allow me to set up a dual boot environment?&nbsp; (Use both till 10 is able to run 100% of my drivers and applications.)<br />
<strong>That option is not available with the free upgrade. The free upgrade requires a previous qualifying version. If you wish to install on a separate drive or partition, you need to purchase a full retail license or OEM System build license.<br />
</strong></li><li>I have several systems, will this upgrade work on each or do I need to get upgrade offers for each individual system?<br />
<strong>You will need to get the upgrade offer each system or download the .ISO which should be available and upgrade each system individually.<br />
</strong></li><li>Will this upgrade expire or require some money at some point to run fully?<br />
<strong>No, it will not expire. <br />
</strong></li></ol>
<p><strong>How much will Windows 10 cost?</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft has not revealed all the details about pricing for Windows 10 yet, but they did announce that Windows 10 will be free for the first year to all Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and Phone 8.1 users.
</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: center"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3daa41103e-800b-45a9-9da4-a030066edde4" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Wow, thats cool, but does that mean, I will have to pay for Windows 10 after the first year?</strong></p>
<p>No. Its a promotion to get as many users to upgrade their existing Windows 7 PCs and Windows 8.1 devices to Windows 10. As Microsoft Program Manager for Windows&nbsp;Terry Myerson&nbsp;described it:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span><em>This is more than a one-time upgrade: once a Windows device is upgraded to Windows 10, we will continue to keep it current for the supported lifetime of the device
</em></span><span><em>–</em></span><span><em>at no additional charge. </em></span></p>

<p>I used to use OS/2 (for MS-OS2 and then later OS/2 Warp) and finally with Windows 7, Microsoft exceed OS/2.&nbsp; I trust Windows 7 Ultimate and don't want to lose functionality just to gain something new for the sake of being new.&nbsp; ESPECIALLY, when new interfaces
 aren't - IMHO, such as cards - very good / useful / etc.&nbsp; (My main issue with cards is the need to scroll and scroll and scroll.&nbsp; I'm originally from the Unix (System V, BSD), UNICOS) and IBM VM/370-ESA world so command line and GUI make sense to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed others asking about what computers one has .. The ones I have running Windows are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dell Precision T7500 (12 physical/24 logical cores, 192GB RAM)</p>
<p>Dell Precision 390 (4 physical cores, 8 GB RAM)&nbsp; -- TWO of these systems</p>
<p>Dell Inspiron 15&nbsp; (12 physical cores, 16GB RAM)</p>
<p>Alienware 17M2 (8 physical cores, 32GB RAM)</p>
<p>Dell Inspiron 9300 (single core, 2GB RAM, XP 32bit, don't think it can upgrade to Windows 10).</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your quick reply! :-)&nbsp; I'll be reviewing it, but in the meantime, I'm wondering . . .</p>
<p>
</p><p>What does Microsoft have against the Media Center?&nbsp; I'm asking as there are various applications, such as TV cards and USB device, which require it.&nbsp; I don't mind it going away, as long as there is replacement programs for these devices.&nbsp; I hate good hardware
 dying just because and without a good reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, what's up with Microsoft killing off Media Center?&nbsp; Why even give it to us in the first place?&nbsp; Why not give us a functional replacement?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yeah, what is the functional replacement for Media Center in 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>One last thing:&nbsp; So my Windows 7 Ultimate x64 system would automatically get the Windows 10 Pro license / upgrade, right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Guess, there is yet another one last thing.&nbsp; What about hardware where only Vista drivers exist?&nbsp; In the case of Dell Precision 390 where Dell says for Windows 7, use our Vista drivers.&nbsp; Will Vista drivers work on 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again thank you,</p>

<h2>            Headphones &#43; Speakers at the same time</h2>
                    How do you get sound from both your headphones and speakers at the same time? I have been playing with the settings, but it seems that you need to select each and make them "default" to get sound from them one at a time.&nbsp; I would like to use both my headphones
 and speakers and not have to continually change the settings.

            Hello MurseIRL,
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for your post. &nbsp;To clarify, are you trying to get sound from your speakers and headphone at the same time, or are you trying to get sounds to play simultaneously on different applications. &nbsp;It isn't possible to play sounds at the same time from
 speakers and headphone because only one can be default at a time. &nbsp;You can, however, play sounds from two different applications (ex. WMP12 and Video Game). &nbsp;To do this, follow the steps below:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Open WMP12, play a song with headphone being the default player.</div>
<div>Open your second application and change the default player to speakers.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Your music will continue to play through your headphones while your second application plays through your speakers.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Please let us know if this does or doesn't answer your question.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Cheers</div>

<h2>            VX-5000 records loud humming noise when capturing video</h2>
                    I have a new LifeCam VX-5000 and when I use the microsoft software to record a video and I play it back there is a really loud humming noise playing in the background. I've tried holding the camera far away from the speakers thinking it was a feedback
 issue but that did not help. I've also plugged it into different USB ports on my desktop computer but that again doesn't help. And I installed the camera (using the microsoft software) on a entirely different computer and I get the same background noise when
 I record video. <br />
Furthermore, when I try using Skype, the other person hears the loud noise as well. If I&nbsp; turn off the video feed and use the webcam as a microphone, the humming noise disappears, and when I turn off the microphone and use the webcam just as a camera it works
 fine, but when I try and use them at the same time I get a loud humming noise.<br />
Any suggests??? Is this a hardware issue???<br />

            It sounds like a hardware issue inside the VX-5000. A simple test would be to try the webcam on a different PC, if you get the same results, it's likely the VX-5000, itself, that has a problem.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>As of&nbsp;the information is available on the windows 7 compatibility center, software publisher has not updated the compatibility information.
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?type=Software&amp;s=DVD shrink" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?type=Software&amp;s=DVD%20shrink</a></p>
<p>I suggest that you install DVD Shrink 2008 in compatibility mode and check.<br />
To do this:</p>
<p>1. Locate the installer.exe or setup.exe file in your file system and right-click on the file.<br />
2. From the contextual menu, choose Properties &gt; Compatibility. <br />
3. Choose the version of Windows you want to emulate and select the “Run this program in compatibility mode” checkbox.
<br />
4. Run the installer</p>
<p><br />
If you need further information on the above provided steps then you can follow the link provided below.&nbsp;<br />

<p>You may use your favourite search engine and find out other softwares are compatible with Windows 7 which will help you to burn the shrink files.</p>

<h2>            primary mouse button changes itself</h2>
                    <p>Since I upgraded to Windows 10 several days ago, I have been having problems with my mouse. &nbsp;Without any apparent reason, the primary mouse button setting changes, but without actually changing the setting in the settings panel. &nbsp;So if I have my primary
 button set to left, when it changes all by itself, the right button becomes the primary button. But when I go to the settings panel, it still says that my left button is the primary button, but it is actually working as if it had been set to the right button.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a short term fix, I can set the mouse settings panel to be opposite what I want and have it function as intended, at least until the setting changes on it's own again, or I restart the machine. If the button was set opposite for the short term fix, it
 will have to be set back again when the machine is restarted.</p>

<h3> alli webb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Refunds through Paypal &#40;Xbox360&#41;</h2>
                    My son made a purchase (unauthorised) through Xbox Live for a game which cost £44.99. &nbsp;I noticed straight away what had happened and contacted Microsoft to delete the game (which they did) and asked if they could refund the money which they did there and
 then, I was over the moon as the purchase was made on our debit card through Paypal. &nbsp;This was on the 30th September and neither myself or my Paypal account have received this refund. &nbsp;I have chased Microsoft three times now and they just say its been sent
 but that was 16 days ago and it seems to have just disappeared meanwhile our bank account is feeling very sad. &nbsp;I have spoken with Paypal who have confirmed they haven't received this refund so what can I do now as it seems to have gone on forever? Many thanks.

            <p>hey,</p>
<p>I suggest you to perform the following steps one by one and check if it helps.</p>
<ul>
<li>Running the App troubleshooter</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;Run the App troubleshooter named Windows store Apps from control Panel and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If not then,</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Perform System File Check (SFC)</span></li></ul>
<p><span>Follow the steps:<br />
<br />
a. Press “Windows Key + Q” to open search Bar.<br />
<br />
b. Type&nbsp;<strong>“<em>cmd</em>”</strong>&nbsp;without quotes in the search box.<br />
<br />

<br />
d. Type&nbsp;<strong>‘<em>sfc /scannow’</em></strong>&nbsp;without quotes and hit enter.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>If still not helps then,</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>&nbsp;run the System update readiness command. It detects incorrect manifests, cabinets or registry data, it may replace the incorrect data with corrected version available. Follow the steps.</span></li></ul>
<ol>
<li><span>Press&nbsp;<strong><span>Windows key + X</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click&nbsp;<strong><span>command prompt (Run as administrator)</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands.

<p>I also ran PC one touch scan a MicroSoft partner program that advertises it can fix glitches like this.</p>

            I have same problem with EDGE. Worked at first and then quit. Now&nbsp;Using IE 11 as default browser. Works fine in many cases. However there are connection problems that IE cannot solve. 'Windows feedback' for one. (That's probably why MS doesn't get EDGE
 complaints)There are other areas where I get messages stating that I have no internet connection even though I am obviously connected. IMHO I&nbsp;suspect there is a tie in to EDGE not working.

            It's not quite correct to say that Microsoft Edge is not working; it's more correct to say that Edge is not&nbsp;<em>yet</em> working. Edge is due several major upgrades to install missing features. That should make a big difference (one hopes!)

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the quick reply unfortunately that did not resolve the issue.&nbsp; I followed your directions exactly and when in playback devices the Bluetooth headphones indicate disconnected. &nbsp; Trying to reconnect did nothing, I disabled the speakers and again
 tried to connect to Bluetooth, nothing.&nbsp; I renamed the Bluetooth headphones to match my set and tried reconnecting, nothing.&nbsp; I re-paired the headphones and again went through your instructions, this after a reboot and nothing.&nbsp; The headphones work on other
 devices....I appreciate any further advice and help.</p>

<p>Have you tried this, it worked for me when my bluetooth headphones would pair but not connect:</p>
Uninstall the device from device manager and restart bluetooth service.&nbsp;<br />
Start &gt; services.msc&nbsp;<br />
Right-click "Bluetooth Support Service."<br />
Choose Automatic.<br />
Go to device manager and &nbsp;right-click on your computer name and click "Scan for hardware changes"<br />
Install the bluetooth device drivers from the manufacturer's website, if any.&nbsp;<br />
