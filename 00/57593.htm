<h2>            Xbox One Support for Getting my Account Back</h2>
                    <p>Alright Xbox, Riddle me This.</p><p><br /></p><p>So...... I sold my Xbox one console, forgot to delete my account and had sent a message to my friend so i could remember my password, they somehow got onto my account and changed all of the emails and info, so i contacted Microsoft and they put a temporary email on my account and also gave me a temporary password to use until i can change it.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>See..... You guys " Take Security Very seriously ", so i changed my password and immediately went to log back in, my new password did not work, i have been contacting about this for around 2 and a half years, so in order to reset the password for the temporary email, when i try it want's me to fill out a form, so i have tried at least 25 times, how am i supposed to fill out information to recover an email i did not make?

            Hi Pouya 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />As far as my knowledge is concerned, Bitlocker recovery key changes only if drive is decrypted and encrypted again. 
<br />Hence, you would be able to use recovery key till you meet the above condition.

<p>Currently I am using Ulimate 64bit windows 7 desktop. And I checked that the detection is experiencing DirectAccess error. If I want to completely reset the network on my computer, how do I do it? Because I think maybe I have set up the wrong configuration.??
 Previously when I used cmd, type "ipconfig / all" what I found was completely different now. That's IPv6, it's not as tangled as it is now. How do I reset it? Another problem is why I use a computer at home, connect to a home network, but what is the problem
 of not being able to connect to the workplace? I still do not understand why I am involved in this issue. Currently my "leave homegroup", outside of my Desktop, the Network and Sharing Center displays a yellow exclamation mark, when I right-click and open
 it I see all showing no life. That's when I choose Troubleshoot problems, it's the opposite, Internet notifications are healthier than ever. I give up with this. : D</p>
<p>&nbsp;It was really hard to accept an error, when I used Windows 7 for 10 years, but I just found out. This is really confusing, because this error, I understand, requires new knowledge to be overcome. This is challenging me, because my network knowledge is =
 0. I hope a lot in this forum will help me fix the problem. Before posting this article, I learned a lot of ways to fix it but it seems that this error currently has no exact fix, so there are no detailed instructions. Because of this, I don't know how to
 start. I desperately need positive feedback from everyone. Because I'm sure that I will use that comment to try and solve the problem. As I said, my knowledge is very small, so hopefully get detailed instructions. Thank you</p>

<p>You can ignore the IPv6 address. It is irrelevant. Only the IPv4 address counts. It is assigned automatically by your router's DHCP server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You cannot connect directly to your workplace's computer. You either need a tool such as Remote Desktop or TightVNC (not easy to set up) or TeamViewer (easy to connect but expensive).</p>

<h2>            Anyone fixed the error&#58; a pointer device has no information about the monitor it is attached to</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>We are getting two warning messages in the event log</p>
<p>'a pointer device has no information about the monitor it is attached to'</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>'a multi touch device reported inconsistent contact information'</p>
<p>
</p><p>at the same time the screen turns black for 1-2 seconds and then returns to normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how to fix this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hardware: 42" ELO touchscreen with i5 ELO computer module.</p>
<p>OS: &nbsp;Windows 8.1 Embedded Pro Industry.</p>
<p>Based on an image that ELO provided.</p>
<p>Running a WPF 4.5 application that responds to touch events (shows videos and can touch to find out more)<br />
</p>
<p>We get an information message that&nbsp;</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p>The start type of the Touch Keyboard and Handwriting Panel Service service was changed from auto start to demand start.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The two warnings above and then</p>
<p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>The start type of the Touch Keyboard and Handwriting Panel Service service was changed from demand start to auto start.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</p><p>Note disabling the service removes the information message in the event log but the warning still occurs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running our software with the same ELO screen but an Intel NUC computer using the same OS works without the screen blinking at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it seems to be an interation between the ELO media player and our WPF software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Others things we have tried:</p>
<p>Removing ELO drivers</p>
<p>Updating ELO touch drivers</p>
<p>Updating Graphics Card drivers</p>
<p>Removing all windows updates</p>
<p>Swapping the ELO computer modules to a different ELO screen in case it was hardware related</p>
<p>Ditching the ELO supplied image and starting with a clean image based on installing Windows 8.1 Embedded Pro and teh minimum drivers required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: ELO technical support have not been able to discover the issue.</p>

<h2>            Why does my Windows Defender not work&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Windows Defender was built into my Vista Laptop from the very first. However, today I tried opening it and it showed an error message saying "Applications not found". I went on Microsoft's download center and tried downloading Defender again but during the
 install, a message popped up saying that Windows Defender is a built in program in my computer and that I don't have to reinstall it. How do I get Windows Defender back?? Please help!!</p>

            Hi, <br />
<br />
If you downgrade from Windows 10 to Windows 7, you'll be missing a lot of things. One is Cortana the digital assistant, Cortana can be of assistance in a flash. Two, you'll also miss a lot apps that can run on smartphones and tablets in smaller versions that
 also runs on desktop PC's through Windows 10. On Windows 7 you are limited to standard applications available on all Windows operating systems.
<br />
<br />
If downgrading is really important, We suggest visiting this <strong><a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contact/menu/software/windows/ts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> and use the reference code that was provided
 to you. <br />
<br />
Let us know how it turns out.

<h2>            Windows 7 clean install  64 bit  from Vista home premium 32 bit</h2>
                    I currently have an HP Pavilion with AMD Quad 64 bit cpu. &nbsp;When I purchased the computer, HP installed Vista Home Premium @ 32 bits.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I should like to do a complete clean install of Windows 7 &nbsp;to run at 64 bits. The performance Information on my computer states my computer is capable of running 64 bit os. &nbsp;Will 64 bit Windows 7 run on my computer even though I will be deleting Windows
 Vista 32 bit? HP does not have system recovery discs for 64 bit Windows 7. &nbsp;After the installation of Windows 7, then what?</div>

            As long as your processor is 64 bit capable and you meet the minimum requirements, you should be able to run Windows 7 64 bit without any problems.
<br />
<br />
Minimum requirements for Windows 7 64 bit:<br />
1 GHz processor<br />
2 GBs of RAM<br />
20 GBs of free hard disk space.<br />
<br />
Of course, there is no upgrade path from 32 bit Windows, so you will have to backup your personal files and settings using the Windows Easy Transfer utility, restore it on Windows 7 and reinstall your applications.
<br />
<br />
&lt;Will 64 bit Windows 7 run on my computer even though I will be deleting Windows Vista 32 bit? HP does not have system recovery discs for 64 bit Windows 7. &nbsp;After the installation of Windows 7, then what?&gt;<br />
<br />
I am bit confused by your last two sentences. You system came preloaded with Windows Vista, HP does not provide Windows 7 for you unless you purchased your computer as part of the free Windows 7 Upgrade offer which started on June 26th. If you purchase the
 Windows 7 upgrade separately, you will be able to use that to reinstall the OS, or you can use the built in System Image tool in Windows 7 right after installing the OS to create a backup your installation.<br />

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then you can continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />For on-demand scanning I'd also use Malwarebytes and AdwCleaner from Step 10 above which are the best scanners.  
<br />
<br />But if Defender still won't scan after the above you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>

<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            If Windows Defender Offline Scanner is not working, I recommend an alternative called the ESET Sysrescue offline scanner. Its very effective. Its possible Defender Offline Scanner might have been circumvented and compromised. You need a third party utility that can thoroughly scan clean the system.

<p>Tried it after a supposed Defender Update, and - lo! - it worked! But nowhere did results appear. Tried it again a few moments later and... same problem. I think this is all related to the headaches I've had since last week's updates. Each time Windows releases
 an update, my machine is crippled for a week to 10 days, while I attempt to restore, remove updates, re-update, reboot, repeat and.... after 10 days of this nonsense, the machine works. Until the next update...</p>
<p>Will try to go through your steps.</p>

            Hi again -
<br />  
<br />
<br />There's a lot of turmoil in Windows Updates right now.   So unless it's interfering with performance I'd give them a few weeks to sort it out. 
<br />
<br />If it is interfering then there is a new guided walk-through from Microsoft for repairing Windows Update that leads up to resetting components if necessary:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>.  Try running that first.
<br />
<br />You can try installing Updates manually from Microsoft Update catalog by searching for them here:  <a href="http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=windows%207" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/sit...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also install this tool to tell you exactly your level of protection needed for the CPU threat, how it may affect performance, and what you can do about it:  <a href="https://www.grc.com/inspectre.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.grc.com/inspectre.htm</a>
<br />
<br />You can get more control over Windows Updates with some new features in the last two versions at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update under Restart Options and set Active Hours when you don't' want to be bothered.
<br />
<br />You can block Windows Updates and Version Updates using these methods:   <a href="https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automatic-updates-install-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automat...</a>
<br />
<br />You can set a Metered Connection or turn off Windows Update service and only install the Version Updates twice a year when you are ready via the most stable method - which isn't Windows Update anyway, but by running it from Media Creation Tool or the media it creates:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  All previous Updates are rolled up in the Version Update.
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Thank you for confirmation that Update is a mess right now. It has absolutely hobbled my machine for a week and counting. I was pretty sure the issue was WU, because the same thing happened with January update, but I was checking for malware just to be sure,
 which is how I discovered that offline scanning wasn't working properly. I have since scanned with the other two utilities mentioned in your original link and have not come up with any issues there. I had also tried the WU trouble shooting utility, which would
 identify problems, "fix" them, only to identify the same problems immediately after (evidently it wasn't actually fixing them).&nbsp; I am somewhat reluctant to move on to the next step outlined in the "Fix WU" article, lest I mess up something worse, but we'll
 see...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the "AskVG" article about managing the updates, most of the options shown in the screen shots do not exist for me. For example, I see no way to defer updates. Perhaps he is incorrect that "all the options will work on all versions of Windows 10?"&nbsp;
 I do not see a date on the article, so I am not sure how current it is.&nbsp; Perhaps my best bet is to enable the group edit on my Windows 10 Home version, as is suggested possible here:
<a href="https://www.askvg.com/how-to-enable-group-policy-editor-gpedit-msc-in-windows-7-home-premium-home-basic-and-starter-editions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.askvg.com/how-to-enable-group-policy-editor-gpedit-msc-in-windows-7-home-premium-home-basic-and-starter-editions/</a>Can you speak to this article's currency and accuracy?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Metering my connection is not quite useful - I use so many different and changing connections that the minute I forget to set the latest one to metered - BAM! My computer is fouled. Likewise, the options to delay a restart aren't really helpful. Rebooting
 is the least of my problems, the problems root from </p>
<p>1) Not being able to decide when to use my bandwith for downloading</p>
<p>2) Not being able to back up before updates (good practice!)</p>
<p>3) Not being able to install updates one at a time (good practice!)</p>
<p>4) Not being able to defer the whole process when I am up against a deadline</p>
<p>5) Not even being informed WHEN my computer is downloading updates ("What the heck is suddenly wrong with my machine??" *wastes half a day trying to figure it out*)</p>
<p>
</p><p>As to HOW my machine gets hobbled each time Windows updates: It seems it gets stuck in an endless loop of downloading which slows it down to almost useless.&nbsp; That is what I have deduced, anyway, based on: the timing of the issue (immediately after the original
 February update), the similarity to the problem with the January update (eventually sorted itself out, after about a week),&nbsp; the WiFi traffic noted in Task Manager, the lack of any malware that I can detect using three different utilities, and no other software
 running on machine.</p>

            If you can't use Metered Connection then turn off and set to Disabled the Windows Update service in Services.msc until you want to deal with them.  I wrote very specfically in my post about how some are reporting back now after turning them off and waiting for the next Version Update to install it Manually bypassing buggy Windows Update, which includes all previous Updates rolled in.  If you have problems running the new version 2x year as an in-place Upgrade, do the Clean Install which resolves most problems and gives such a fresh start it's always better than getting a new PC.

<h2>            Is this typical for the case fitting at the rear of the One X&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have two launch Scorpio X's, but one of them died, so I ordered a new one from Amazon. However, when it arrived, I noticed it looked "bowed out" at the back and underneath at the rear of the machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;It looked like the case hadn't been assembled properly. Here is a hastily taken picture, before I sent it back to Amazon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I'd actually tried to push it back together at the centre at this point, thinking it might click into place. It doesn't look like much, but that gap was enough to push down the base of the console so that the casing rested on my TV unit rather than the
 rubber feet at the rear, causing it to wobble! I've done some googling, and seen some other pics of newer consoles, and the back looking like this. It seems a bit shoddy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I didn't want to keep it, because if I ever had cause to send it to MS under warranty, they could claim it looked like it had been opened.</p>

<p>The casing should fit together really nicely, so that's definitely abnormal. I also would have sent it back to Amazon. Personally, I like to buy consoles in person so I can check them out first.</p>

            I agree with CamicaziBoss on this one.&nbsp; I should not wobble around like that and should be flush all around.&nbsp; My question is, how did the console come?&nbsp; Was it in an original Xbox package and sealed?&nbsp; Was it from Amazon Prime or a third party selling on
 Amazon?&nbsp; If it wasn't in an original package, the console could have been tampered with.&nbsp; Good call on sending it back, I would have done the same. &nbsp;

<p>Yeah, buying from Amazon is great and they rarely quibble about such things. Unlike you, CamcaziBoss, I can't get around easily because of permanent injuries to my legs, otherwise, I was like you and always went into stores to check stuff before buying :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Amazon is the closest replacement for that I think. But watching several unboxing videos, some consoles out there, do really look similar to this one, which is a bit worrying, and it looks shoddy.</p>

<p>It was from Amazon themselves. It was the Division 2 bundle. I did have concerns because it did look at though somebody had had a go at peeling off those circular anti-tamper sticker things you get on the outside of the box.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;But when I opened it, it did look new inside and untouched. But who knows!</p>

<p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p>
</p><p>That seems odd because the Scorpio edition was never included in any kind of bundle. The Scorpio edition was a special edition only available during the Xbox One X launch. No more were manufactured after launch and definitely not included in a Division 2
 bundle. The <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/xbox-one/consoles/xbox-one-s/division-2-1tb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Division 2 bundle</a> provided directly from Microsoft includes an Xbox&nbsp;One S, not an Xbox One X so some third&nbsp;party definitely&nbsp;just opened the box from the real bundle and put in the Scorpio edition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since&nbsp;Amazon&nbsp;fulfills most of the orders for third parties, I'm glad you already took it upon you to contact them about this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have any other questions!</p>

<br />
EDIT: i disabled all sound devices then used the auto troubleshoot and it fixed itself.<br />

                    <span>
<p><strong>Hello,</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>I am trying to network a laptop that is running Windows Vista and my desktop that is running Windows 7. Both can get on the internet on the same wireless connection, but I cannot set up any kind of a network. The
 vista laptop can see the wireless router and the desktop in the network folder, but the desktop cannot see any of the devices.</span></strong></p>
<p>I am no expert but I think it has something to do with the IPv6 connection on the desktop, which says I have "No Internet Access" but obviously I do since I am posting this from the desktop. The connection speed on the desktop also says "18.0 Mbps" compared
 to the laptop which is at 54 (as it should be).</p>
<p>Also, on the desktop, when I open the network and sharing center there is an X through the connection from my PC to the internet, but again I am on the internet.</p>
<p>I have been trying to figure this out for almost a week now and any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EDIT: I just thought to try using a wired connection instead of wireless and I'm having the same issue.</p>

<div>since you have a Vista computer, you can't use the Homegroup function to</div>

<div>IPv6 would not impact network sharing. It is normal to have No Internet Access</div>
<div>displayed for IPv6 UNLESS you have an IPv6 tunnel, dual stack, or other advanced</div>
<div>option (and you would know if this were the case).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Leave Ipv6 alone. </div>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>For general knowledge.</p>
<p>IPv6 is Not the mainstream Internet protocol and thus play No roll in Internet connection.</p>
<p>IPv6 can be use for local network sharing, but even there it is Not necessary. I.e. File and Printer Sharing can be done just the same with the IPv4 protocol that is also used to access the Internet.</p>
<p>In many cases when using peer-to-peer Network, and the user is Not a network expert, to avoid confusions it is probably better to Disable it.</p>
<p>Just log to the Wire, and or Wireless Connection properties. Uncheck the IPv6. Make sure that the IPv4, and File and Printer Sharing is checked.</p>

<div>Bindu, this is not the correct solution. The OP wants to network mixed versions</div>

            Sorry for the delayed response, I was traveling for work. I've never tried to network these computers together before. I just moved in with my girlfriend and the laptop (vista) is hers. Prior to that I had the same issue with my desktop, where it wasn't
 showing a connection, but it was never a problem since I didn't need a network. So I don't think I have a safe spot to restore my desktop to, if that makes sense.

<div>&gt;Sorry for the delayed response, I was traveling for work. I've never tried to network these computers together before. I just moved in with my girlfriend and the laptop (vista) is hers. Prior to that I had the same issue with my desktop, where it wasn't
 showing a connection, but it was never a problem since I didn't need a network. So I don't think I have a safe spot to restore my desktop to, if that makes sense.</div>

<br />
That way you will receive the best help there.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Try these steps:</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Besides using an anti-virus, also scan for Malware/spyware</span></span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>:</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></a></span></p>

<p><span>Malwarebytes is as the name says, a Malware Remover!</span></p>
<p><span>Download the Free Version from the link above.</span></p>
<p><span>Download, install, update and scan once a fortnight..
</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to use Malwarebytes after it is installed and Updated:</span></span><span><br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;Open Malwarebytes &gt; Click on the Update Tab&nbsp; across the top&gt; get the latest updates.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;On the <strong><span>Scanner</span></strong> tab, make sure the the
<strong><span>Perform&nbsp;quick scan</span></strong> option is selected and then click on the
<strong><span>Scan</span></strong> button to start scanning your computer
<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;MBAM will now start scanning your computer for malware. This process can take quite a while.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp;When the scan is finished a message box will appear<br />
<br />
5.&nbsp;You should click on the OK button to close the message box and continue with the Malware<strong><span>
</span></strong>removal process.<br />
<br />
6.&nbsp;You will now be back at the main Scanner screen. At this point you should click on the
<strong><span>Show Results</span></strong> button.<br />
<br />
7.&nbsp;A screen displaying all the malware that the program found will be shown<br />
<br />
8.&nbsp;You should now click on the <strong><span>Remove Selected</span></strong> button to remove all the listed malware. MBAM will now delete all of the files and registry keys and add them to the programs quarantine. When removing
 the files, MBAM may require a reboot in order to remove some of them. If it displays a message stating that it needs to reboot, please allow it to do so. Once your computer has rebooted, and you are logged in, please continue with the rest of the steps.<br />
<br />
9.&nbsp;When MBAM has finished removing the malware, it will open the scan log and display it in Notepad. Review the log as desired, and then close the Notepad window.<br />
<br />
10.&nbsp;You can now exit the MBAM program.<br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Run the Vista System File Checker Tool:</span></span></strong><span><br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
1. Open a Command Window in Administrator mode:</span></p>
<p><span>* click
<strong><span>Start</span></strong><br />
* click <strong><span>All Programs</span></strong>, then
<strong><span>Accessories</span></strong><br />
* right click on the <strong><span>Command Prompt </span>
</strong>option,<br />
* on the drop down menu which appears, click on the <strong><span>Run as Administrator
</span></strong>option.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>* If you haven’t disabled User Account Control (and you shouldn’t!) you will be asked for authorisation. Click the Continue button if you are the administrator or insert
 the administrator password.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Start the System File Checker</span></p>
<p><span>* In the Command Prompt window, type:
<strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong>,<br />
* press Enter.<br />
* You’ll see “the system scan will begin”.</span></p>
<p><span>The scan may take some time and windows will repair/replace any corrupt or missing files. You will be asked to insert your Vista DVD if it’s needed.</span></p>
<p><span>Close the Command Prompt Window when the job is finished.</span></p>
<p><span>One caveat: you need a Windows DVD to enable SFC to make more than minor repairs.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
<br />
If SFC finds serious errors it can not fix, you may have to do a Vista&nbsp;Repair Upgrade Install.<br />
<br />
If&nbsp;you do not have a Microsoft Vista DVD, borrow one from a friend.<br />

    <title>Windows not starting up - restarts itself - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thomas vikstrom  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows not starting up - restarts itself</h2>
                    <p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<p>On 13 August my Win10-laptop (Acer 7730G) probably got updated through Windows update as it started to restart itself continuously with BSOD + 'PAGE FAULT IN NON PAGED AREA (WdFILTER.sys)'. As such this is nothing new, it did it already with Win7 if Windows
 Defender was turned on during the update process. Had though hoped this would've disappeared with Win10 but not. I've had Win10 for several months and don't have the option to downgrade to Win7 anymore</p>
<p>Due to time constraints I <strong>forced the computer to shut down</strong>, could not leave it restarting itself for several hours.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong></p>
<p>Since then it is not starting properly, stays 20-30 minutes with the spinning circle with a constantly blinking harddrive LED.
</p>
<p>- Pressing ALT+TAB shows 2 icons: Windows Sign-In and another without name.&nbsp;<br />
- Pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL shows for a few minutes the background having the window through which light is shining.&nbsp;<br />
- After a long while (perhaps 20-30 minutes), I might get a message 'Something went wrong...' and then it restarts itself. At least once I was able to see something related to the same WDFILTER.SYS in the message.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What I've tried:</strong></p>
<p>What I've tried without avail:</p>
<p>- Started in Recovery mode and tried reverting to previous build, restoring a previous system restore point, repairing. All failing</p>
<p>- Started in Safe mode and run sfc /scannow. This did not find any problems</p>
<p>- I've created a Win10-image with the MediaCreationTool but got scared when I rebooted from the USB as I was afraid it might wipe out data and applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What to do?</strong></p>
<p>I don't want to reinstall Win10 as I have a lot of old software to be reinstalled and reconfigured, the computer is from 2008...</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do? Anything to be checked while in Safe Mode?</p>

<li>'Compatibility report: The computer started using the Windows installation media. Remove the installation media and restart your computer so that Windows starts normally. Then, insert the installation media and restart the upgrade.</li></ul>
<p>But my problem is that Windows does not start normally! And when I tried to run the installation in Safe mode, I got a message like 'This cannot be done in safe mode, please restart Windows normally'. How can I start the repair then?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your reply</p>

            Tried many different options with no avail. As I need my computer for real work and not for troubleshooting out of 'fun', I ended up in resetting it = losing all applications, some of which cannot be installed anymore. Thank you Micro$oft for all your
 help (=lack of) in 'resolving' this issue that your buggy software initially created :-(

    <title>ESENT errors - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tjg_27  say:</h3>
<h2>            ESENT errors</h2>
                    <p>Thank you in advance for any help. I'll explain the issue in full, but I'm only looking for a yes or no answer.<br />
<br />
Got a "Your computer is low on memory error" when I only had Firefox running, been having similar errors for some time with every sort of application. All drivers are up to date etc etc.
<br />
Checked event viewer under Windows Logs &gt; Applications.<br />
Absolutely full of ESENT errors, 467, 474, 467 from C:\Windows\system32\SRU\SRUDB.dat.</p>
<p>Just so you don't have to look it up the Task Categories are&nbsp; "Database Corruption" and "Database Page Cache".<br />
Now here is my actual question.<br />
<br />
Is this memory leak most likely caused by the bad sectors on my faulty HDD?<br />
I wish to know whether I should replace the part (as I am planning on doing) or whether this indicates some other component is bust, meaning I should write off the whole laptop and not waste money on the HDD replacement.<br />
</p>
<p>I had previously assumed it was due to the HDD fault, but someone on an obscure forum post said it wasn't. I didn't really trust them but needed to be sure so I thought I'd check with people who know.<br />
<br />
Thank you.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community. </span><span>I appreciate your efforts towards resolving the issue. I will certainly help you with the issue that you are facing.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>It is rather difficult to answer your question in a simple yes or a no. As we cannot judge where the issue is. We need to diagnose this issue further and narrow down the reasons to what is exactly causing this on your PC.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>To diagnose this issue, try the following methods.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1: </span></strong></p>
<p><span>Step 1: Try <strong>Safe Mode</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Safe mode is the configuration of Windows, when it is running on only basic set of drivers and all the startups are disabled. To know more about safe mode, follow the article below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue is resolved in safe mode, follow step 2 after restarting the computer in regular mode.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Step 2: <strong>Clean Boot</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows.
 To know more, follow the article below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span>Note: After troubleshooting, refer to this section ‘<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>’.</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>To check the hard drive, try method 2.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Check a drive for errors<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Check-a-drive-for-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Check-a-drive-for-errors</span></a><strong>
</strong></p>
<p><span><strong><span><br />
<em>Note: </em></span></strong><span><em>While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost</em><strong><em>.</em></strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If the issue persists, follow the steps below:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>Press Windows + X while you are at the desktop screen.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Click on command prompt (admin).</span></span></li><li><span><span>Type the following command and hit enter.</span></span></li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><span><span><strong>chkdsk /f /r</strong></span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><span><span><em>Note: If this asks you to run on restart, type y and hit enter and close the command prompt.</em></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Restart the computer and check if it works.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you get errors or bad sectors on hard drive, it can be the hard drive causing this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try method 3 to check for corruptions in Windows files.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3: Run the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe)</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore
 corrupted files. It will scan your system files and to repair missing or corrupted system files in Windows. To run the SFC scan, refer to the Microsoft article below.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Hope this information was helpful. Let us know the results once you have tried these methods. We'll be glad to assist you further.</span></span></p>

            <p>1. Tried safe mode an clean boot. Did not resolve. (indicated in my first post)</p>
<p>2. Cannot run chkdsk commands due to bad sectors (indicated in my first post)</p>

I'll just assume it was caused by the HDD hardware issue.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As stated in my previous post, it was not a yes or a no straight away. Without diagnosing the issue completely we can not tell if it's only the hard drive which is causing issues on your system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you are unable to run a chkdsk on your hard drive, then yes the hard drive is faulty and I would suggest you to get it checked either from a local technician or by contacting the hardware manufacturer of your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also try to do a clean installation by deleting a creating new partitions and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Note: This process will delete all your data on the hard drive. Make sure you have the backup of all your data.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, replacing the hard drive would be a good choice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this reply was helpful for the query.</p>

We need the make and model to be able to really helpl.&nbsp; I would caution you, to not update unless there is an issue requiring it, and I would suggest you make a backup if there is, just in case.<br />
<br />
<br />
We arent able to help you unless you help yourself by providing us with as much information as possible.<br />
<br />
We need things like system specs, errors, and more.<br />

    <title>Partitions on SSD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> david von  say:</h3>
<h2>            Partitions on SSD</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to upgrade my desktop HD to a SSD.&nbsp; My SSD is 1tb and my HD is 2tb with a 500 mb partition for the OS and software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to clone the 500mb partition to the 1tb SSD.&nbsp; The first attempt was with the Apricorn EZ Gig Cloning software, but it clones the complete HD regardless of partitions.&nbsp; 2tb HD won't clone to 1tb SSD if it has more than 1tb of data on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second attempt got me closer.&nbsp; Using EaseUS todo Backup Home I was able to capture and clone only the 500mb partition of the HD, but it also partitioned the 1tb SSD into a 500mb drive.&nbsp; It doesn't show that any more space is available...</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I need to somehow clone the 500mb partition of a 2tb drive to a 1tb SSD and retain full use of the whole 1tb.&nbsp; Or remove the current partition on the 1tb SSD while keeping all the data on it intact keeping it bootable and 1tb in size.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your time and help!</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Maybe the free version of Macrium Reflect can do it too. You would need to try it out.</p>

<p>If you have Acronis Disk Director then you can use it to resize your partitions at any time. If you don't then you should delete &amp; recreate them now as per your preference.</p>

<p>Things didn’t go according to plan this morning. &nbsp;</p>
<p>AcronisWD came on my EZ Gig Cloning CD, but it won’t install without first uninstalling Acronis 2013 from my computer.&nbsp;</p>
<div>I can open and run Acronis 2013, I can locate it on the hard drive, but nowhere is there an option to uninstall it. &nbsp;It doesn’t even show up in Control Panel - Remove Programs...</div>
<div>Sometime during this whole process Win7 decided it wasn’t happy and restored to an earlier restore point losing some critical CAD software updates that required registry tweaks to install. &nbsp;The first one is in and it’s working on the second. &nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>Got called away to a meeting and no progress made on the SSD issue other than finding out what I’ve cloned isn’t complete. &nbsp;</p>
<p>So whats my best option to start over with the SSD? Format or remove/move the partition to get back the unallocated space?</p>

<p>So whats my best option to start over with the SSD? Format or remove/move the partition to get back the unallocated space?</p>

<p>I have a fully paid up version of Acronis True Image and Acronis Disk Director. If you do not have these tools then maybe Macrium Reflect will let you do this. As I mentioned before, I have not used Macrium Reflect myself.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to create bootable media to do what you are trying for it to work best..</p>
<p>You should be able to do that with the Acronis 2013...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would delete everything on the SSD and start fresh...</p>
<p>It would actually be best to create a ISO of your 500GB partition to a external drive preferably using bootable media...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then reload the image to the blank SSD using bootable media... Acronis will partition and format as needed...</p>
<p>Acronis TrueImage has the option to resize the partition size the image is restored to... It is maybe the next to the last screen...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also just do the 500GB partition as id to the SSD, and then Expand it to use the remaining space in Windows Disk Management...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If all else fails, do a search for bootable Acronis TrueImage ISO's of the 2013 version you have...</p>
<p>I personally use version 2011 most of the time, but any of the newer versions will reload Images it created...</p>

<p>Good morning,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for the advice, but I’ve had to backtrack to get the OS running better before cloning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>More background. &nbsp;Before starting the cloning I updated Solidworks 2017 to sp5 and installed SW 2018 sp1 which required help from a SW tech because there was an issue with 2 files in the registry that needed to be disabled so the software could properly
 update/install the files. &nbsp;So good so far. &nbsp;Then I decided I’d better clean up the OS before cloning. &nbsp;I put the win7 disk in and did a repair. &nbsp;That didn’t work well and it wanted to revert back to a restore point that was working. &nbsp;I assumed it was going
 back to the point just prior to the repair attempt, it didn’t, unknown to me it went back further. &nbsp;My next step was to fire up PC Tools and go through and fix dll’s and cleanup everything. &nbsp;At this point all was well and I started my cloning attempts. &nbsp;After
 I discovered my SSD was only 500mb in usable size I also realized that my Solidworks update and install were completely gone...</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I’ve re-updated/installed Solidworks and like before I had to tweak the registry to do it. &nbsp;And now Windows and Solidsworks are not happy and things are running really slow and hanging. &nbsp;I need to fix this before trying another cloning, unless
 it’s my HD failing... &nbsp;If I can’t get everything running right there’s no point in cloning and I’ll be doing a fresh install on the SSD...</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck with that...</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW... If you still have the 500gb partition on the SSD, you could expand and use that...</p>
<p>It might mask any issues you are having though, due to it's speed...</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Kernel Mode Heap Corruption</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><span>Hi, I have a BSOD happening during the shutdown of Windows 10 and whilst browsing the internet quite frequently - 2 /3 times per day.&nbsp; It's a newish (now 8 months old) ASUS build with GeForce 1060 6GB graphics SSD and 16GB
 RAM. Graphics already been replaced last week but still this continues.&nbsp; Also the BSOD function doesn't restart the computer once it has collected the info it needed to 100% and force shutdown is required. Seems to happen less if internet browsers are not
 open .. I use Edge, Opera, Chrome and Firefox but can happen when any one of them is active. Security is MBAM Premium and Bullguard, a bitdefender trial came with the machine. When I contact the PC supplier they already told me replacing the motherboard was
 next step, but now wondering if even replacing all the parts will actually fix the problem? Always comes back with tcpip.sys causing the crash.<br />
</span><span><br />
</span>Have managed to access and save multiple minidump files. <span>
Any help would be appreciated.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>SMXO</span></p>

            Hi SandManXO 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />To know what exactly is causing the crashes, I need to analyze minidumps generated by crashes with WinDBG. WinDBG is the only tool which can do end to end complete analysis of ..dmp files generated by BSOD (Blue screen of death).
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Minidump 
<br />Zip the contents of the folder corresponding to date and time of your crashes. 
<br />Upload the content to Onedrive or any other file sharing site for me to locate the problem. 
<br />
<br />If you are uploading Memory.dmp also, please upload it separately as the size of memory dump is very large.
<br />
<br />If you don't get minidump files in above folder, you will need to enable minidump generation. If you need help to generate Minidump - <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-system/blue-screen-of-death-bsod/1939df35-283f-4830-a4dd-e95ee5d8669d">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

<br />
<br />Please uninstall malwarebytes which looks to be causing this:

<br />*** ERROR: Module load completed but symbols could not be loaded for mwac.sys
<br /> mwac+0xb4fa

<br />
<br />C. Recommendations
<br />
<br />1. Create a system restore point so that if something wrong happens you can revert. 
<br />Type restore point in Cortana Search &gt; Create a Restore point &gt; Check whether against your drive, Protection is ON or not. If not ON, click Configure button below to Make it ON &gt; Now press Create to create a restore point 
<br />
<br />2. Update Malwarebytes and Bullguard to latest and see whether BSOD goes away. If doesn't, uninstall these 2.
