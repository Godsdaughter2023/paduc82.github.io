<h2>            I keep getting this error Message after uninstalling HP software</h2>

<p>
</p><p>I recently uninstalled The HP 8600 Officejet Pro software from my computer because I have another printer that I use more regularly and I needed to make space on my SSD. &nbsp;I used the HP Uninstall to do so. &nbsp;The problem is every time I reboot the above error
 message pops up. &nbsp;It's not a major inconvenience or anything it's just annoying so I'd like to get it to stop. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Windows 7 Home Premium.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The HP software that I still have running is HP FWUpdateEDO2, HP Officejet 4620 Basic Device Software, HP Officejet 4620 series help, HP Officejet 4620 series Product Improvement Study, HP Photo Creations (Not Sure If I need this last one, should I uninstall?),
 HPSupport Solutions Framework, and HP Update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>The uninstall process has probably left a reference to 'HPStatusBL.dll"<em> ( or similar )</em> in one of the startup files/folders or reg keys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have a look in <a href="http://www.7tutorials.com/how-use-system-configuration-tool-all-its-awesomeness" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
MSCONFIG</a> [Startup] tab probably in the 'programs' column to see if you can spot a reference to it there. If so, try un-ticking it and restarting. If not, download
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
AutoRuns</a> and have a look with that. A similar idea but more powerful tool.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
There are many possible reasons why this issue is happening. To help better understand and isolate the issue, we'd like to ask the following questions below:<br />
<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Did you make any changes on the computer prior to the issue?<br />
</li><li>Are there any programs running on the background whenever this issue is happening?<br />
</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you done so far?<br />
<br />
</li></ul>
<p>We'll keep an eye out for your response.</p>

            1) Earlier it was shwing DCP watchdog error.2) &nbsp;Google chrome used to become unresponsive first. 3) No recovery point left. I have shifted to windows 8 but still the windows is becoming unresponsive.

            Hi this.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Windows Update(s) then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Another thing you can try is to reset the apps if available at Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features &gt; App Name &gt; Advanced Settings &gt; Reset.  If Reset is not an option then choose Uninstall.  Restart PC and then reinstall with a fresh download from the app maker's Support Downloads web page.  
<br />
<br />For deeper system problems go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your indepth reply, unfortunately, this is a MS Windows update, its the April release - I have tried the standard uninstall/reinstall a number of times and the Reset app, but they don't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the latest Windows update and I'm not going to back it out as it will just rear its ugly head again in a few weeks - I am hoping that others see this and set about fixing it, its definitely not isolated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The current Apps that are all seeing the same error:</p>
<p>- Garmin Connect Mobile</p>
<p>- TwitDuck</p>
<p>- AU Weather</p>
<p>- Carsales</p>
<p>- Baconit</p>
<p>- AFL Live</p>
<p>… and these are just the ones I've tried, so as you can see this isn't a small list and they all have two things in common: 1) They all worked before the update and 2) They all have the same error occurring</p>
        </p>

            That's why I gave you not only how to remove the Updates but also how to block them from coming back.  See above.
<br />
<br />So I'd take note of the ones that were installed at the time this began, try uninstalling them or System Restoring before then.  Then immediately install the Hide Updates tool to search for, catch and hide the Updates.  
<br />
<br /> If you want to report this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback. They will not even see it here. This is a tech forums staffed mostly by volunteers trying to help others with your problems.
<br />
<br />If you want to post back a Share link from your Feedback here others who see this thread can vote it up and add to it. If you are an Insider I can also vote it up with my MVP badge and track the issue for you.

<h2>            Windows 10 Build 10586 - November Update LAG Issues - SOLVED</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I currently have 3 devices at home that I have just updated to the latest Windows 10 Build 10586, the dreaded November update that many are having issues with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My devices are as such:</p>
<ul>
<li>Desktop PC - i7, 8GB, 64-bit, 2 GB Nvidia GTX 750 Ti, 256 GB SSD</li><li>Laptop - emachines E732Z (Piece of **** that is some 4 years old)</li><li>Laptop 2 in 1 - acer Aspire R3-13IT-P73T (2 days old)</li></ul>
<p>Now the PC works fine as you would expect with those stats, the emachines thing, that also works fine, both of them have no issues, **** the emachines is even faster now with Windows 10 than it was with Windows 7, for a four year old paper weight that is
 a good effort from Microsoft to be able to reduce the OS to the point it can run on much older devices, something past versions of Windows would not have been able to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The real problem is the new 2 in 1 acer Aspire. Before the update I had zero issues, it ran fine for the first few hours before I decided to do the November update. The update worked fine, albeit it took some time, it did work without issues. Now that it
 is up and running I am experiencing lag on everything, and when I say everything, I mean everything. Even just having the PC running with NO open programs you can see the mouse lag.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I open Task Manager, all stats are in the low %, only the memory is around 40%, the rest are as low as zero and up to 10% at most, very similar to my PC. Lag still.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tested this with any number or variety of programs open, still get the lag. So I tested to ensure it was not just the mouse, opening Google and going into View Source so I can get a long **** page of plain text, press the down arrow and... lag. No
 matter what I do and how I use it, I get computer lag, not mouse lag, computer lag.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went through and updated ALL the windows drivers through Device Manager, tried to enable and disable everything I could think of except the default applications that came with the Laptop, I read through every forum I could locate since the update was released
 to the public that had anything to do with Windows in any form or variety that had others in a similar situation, start up issues, computer lag, video lag, general lag, anything that could be attributed to anything Windows from November onwards, I still face
 the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now here is the kicker, I removed something I though to be useless from Device Manager, it was a Trusted Security something, I did not take much issue as to what it was and ran the device Safe Mode. I removed that as it looked to be the only thing I did
 not actually need, never have I ever had any issues with any of my PC's over the last 25 years that was not directly attributed to my own doing. Lo and behold, no lag. Although nothing really works in Safe Mode, I am happy I don't get the annoying lag.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far upon restart on the login screen not in Safe Mode, no lag. So either it is that security thing I disabled, or it is a start up program that comes with new fan dangled laptops. Since my emachines is a piece of **** that should be flushed down the toilet,
 and every time I have decided to take notice of anyone else having any issues with the latest update it was always fancy laptops, touch screens, gaming machines and so on, I attribute it to something that new laptops have which old ones do not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now upon starting in normal mode, that Security Device - Trusted Platform Module 2.0 is back. Windows asked me to turn back on some security features after removing this, and when I looked back in Device Manager, it was back. But, no lag. I now have 100%
 disk usage, decided to turn on everything whilst the Antimalware Service Executable is also running, 100% CPU and 40% Ram, NO LAG. NONE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>10 minutes ago I had lag on the Desktop, I removed that security thing, restarted in Safe Mode, restarted in Normal Mode, NO LAG...</p>
<p>

</p><p>No lag in the login page. No lag on the desktop. No lag when I run all the programs I could get a hold off. It seems either the security thing being removed and re-enabled, or the start in Safe Mode has solved the issue, one or the other, I don't know, I
 done both at the same time. Either way the security thing is back and I have NO LAG!</p>

<h2>            Why can&#39;t I open .jpg files&#63;</h2>
                    <p>For some reason, I'm not able to open some files that are titled things like ._IMG_1846 and things like that. This is starting to worry me since these documents are important for my work. With any other file, it works. The rating is unrated, but all other
 properties are shown. When I try to open a file of this kind, it simply says "We can't open this". Will somebody please tell me how to fix this issue?</p>

            Hello allenj3,<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting to the Microsoft Answers Forum.<br />
<br />
You can try to use Compatiblity mode and see if you can get SPSS 13 to work. There are two ways to try and run in compatibility mode.<br />
One, Right click on the program’s icon and go to the <strong><em>Compatibility</em></strong> tab, and&nbsp;choose&nbsp;the program for the version in which&nbsp;it ran successfully.&nbsp;This&nbsp;patches up APIs and generally makes things friendly for the old application.<br />
<p>Second method: Type in “<strong><em>compatibility”</em></strong> in the Start Menu and select
<strong><em>Run Program made for previous version of Windows</em></strong>, which launches Program Compatibility wizard.&nbsp; And then you walk through a Wizard, explaining what worked before, and it will suggest what it can do about it.&nbsp; Try the recommended settings
 first, and troubleshoot program second.<br />
<br />
Depending on the version of Windows 7 you have installed, you may be able to use Windows XP mode.<br />
Running Windows XP Mode requires:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. Windows 7 Professional, Enterprise, or Ultimate editions.<br />
2. A computer capable of hardware virtualization. This means your computer has a central processing unit (CPU) with either Intel-VT or AMD-V virtualization features.<br />
3. Virtualization features turned on in your computer’s basic input/output system (BIOS).<br />
&nbsp;<br />
To determine whether your computer’s CPU is capable of hardware virtualization, go to the Windows XP Mode and Windows Virtual PC support website and download a utility that can check whether your Intel or AMD CPU is compatible.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/support/configure-bios.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/support/configure-bios.aspx</a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
To find your brand of processor so you can download the appropriate utility, click the Start button , right-click Computer, and then click Properties. Under System, next to Processor, you can see what type of CPU you have.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Even if your CPU can run Windows XP Mode, you might also need to turn on virtualization settings in your computer’s BIOS. Procedures vary depending on the BIOS manufacturer. For more information, see BIOS: frequently asked questions.</p>

    <title>Windows Date &#38; Time constantly out of sync - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aaroncreek  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Date &#38; Time constantly out of sync</h2>
                    <p>A couple moths ago, while I still had windows 8.1, I had to change my Microsoft outlook password for some reason. And ever since I did, windows had a problem trying to sync the date &amp; time. I was hoping that once Windows 10 released I would install it and
 it would fix itself somehow, but it didn't. So if I want the exact date &amp; time I have to go into the settings, turn Set time automatically off and back on so that it will resync. But when I do that it only stays correct for a little while, and when I go back
 to check the time later it's off sync again. I tried syncing to different servers, but I get the same problem no matter what. Please help, I have no idea why it keeps going out of sync.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>How can I remove all the countries themes&nbsp;except for the one I am currenctly in ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note: I do not want to completely delete the themes as I know they ALL come preinstalled within a hidden folder.</p>
<p>I simply want to remove them from appearing under my themes to reduce clutter; but I still want to be able to use it if I change my locale when I move.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Help ?</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Welcome to Microsoft Answers.<br />
The extra regional themes, if displayed in your "theme Window" - should refer to the following registry key:<br />
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Themes\InstalledThemes\MCT<br />
Under there, it shows what regional themes are displayed/installed.<br />
If you delete them from there, they won't display in your "Theme Window" anymore. This won't delete the hidden themes itself, you can add them back if you want.<br />
Also see here for easier explanation: http://www.askvg.com/how-to-access-additional-hidden-regional-themes-in-windows-7/<br />
Below, it has a "registry script" where it also has the fix to remove them again from view.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<h3> josh myn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 &#40;Reset computer during driver update, keep getting Critical Died BSOD&#41;</h2>
                    <p>So, I was updating my display drivers in trying to fix a bug where the adjust brightness option disappears. However, I accidently hit the power button during the update (the screen actually went black during the update and that's when I hit restart) So,
 when the computer restarted, I got a critical process die bsod. After restarting from that, I got an endless loop of Diagnosing your PC, to Your computer didn't start correctly, then to Critical process died.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Afterwards, I tried to do a system restore, but I didn't have the driver protection on, so that didn't work. So, I tried a full system reset and a reset where you keep your files. Got an error there saying, couldn't complete process or something along those
 lines. Only option left is to create a recovery drive, which I'm doing in the morning. If that fails, what else can I do?</p>

<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : <br />
<br />
Run DriverView -&nbsp;set&nbsp;VIEW to Hide&nbsp;Microsoft drivers - update&nbsp;those without <br />
Dump in their names (and&nbsp;update BIOS and chipset).<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address of the driver,&nbsp;description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the <br />
most&nbsp;current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down <br />
the make and&nbsp;complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's <br />
tab - write down the&nbsp;version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do <br />
anything as MS is far behind&nbsp;certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -
<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the driver&nbsp;stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard<br />
if&nbsp;3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers
<br />
you&nbsp;have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and<br />
then&nbsp;Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their <br />
latest versions.&nbsp;(Look for BIOS, Chipset,&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's <br />
site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT&nbsp;after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing&nbsp;actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed&nbsp;(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot
<br />
- check to be sure it is&nbsp;installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - <br />
heck manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

    <title>Backwards Compatible Disc Games - Lag Every 15 Minutes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> x ramb0 4 l1f3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Backwards Compatible Disc Games - Lag Every 15 Minutes</h2>
                    
<p>For my backwards compatible (BC) disc games, every 15 minutes on the dot, I experience a lag spike which lasts several seconds. This not only results in a frustrating death on most online games, but for some games, such as a personal favorite of mine, Call
 of Duty: Black Ops (Zombies), it often results in a game over, causing me to then restart from the beginning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've contacted Xbox Support about 8 or 9 times to this point. Each session lasted about an hour on average, and consisted of me trying different troubleshooting methods. The problem does not have to do with my Internet, because the issue does not occur on
 my digital BC games, my digital Xbox One games, or even my Xbox One disc games. It's exclusive to the BC games which I only have a disc copy of. The problem is not with my discs, because they work perfectly fine on the Xbox 360, and they have no scratches
 anyway. &nbsp;It's not the fault of a particular game developer, because it occurs across a wide-range of games made by different game developers. Oddly enough, my good friend has the same exact lag issue, yet I can't seem to find anybody else talking about it
 on various Online forums.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I requested a digital replacement for at least one of my games as compensation for my problem and the inconvenience. If they ever fixed the problem in a future update, I would have no trouble giving up the digital copy, but they've been unwilling to accomodate,
 and quite frankly, they seem uninterested in solving my problem. This is obviously an issue on Xbox's end, and I would just like to get to the bottom of it. If you have any recommendations or have experienced this issue before, please let me know. Thanks for
 reading.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Just to clarify, these are some of the troubleshooting methods I've tried thus far:I deleted the games off my storage and re-downloaded them, I cleared my alternate MAC address, I cleared my persistent storage, I cleared my local Xbox 360 storage (option
 found on the Xbox One), I gave the console several hard resets, restored the console the factory defaults, tried playing the games under different Xbox profiles, tried using different discs of the same game (same problem persists), played the games on the
 Xbox 360 without issue, played the discs on a friend’s console without issue, contacted my network provider for port forwarding troubleshooting (internet not problem of course since all digital &amp; Xbox One disc games run smoothly, amongst other reasons), I
 was referred to an Xbox "specialist" who gave me certain steps to follow which included installing the game while Offline (which you can't even do), I opted out of the Xbox Preview Program to no avail, and finally, I even downloaded numerous game demos in
 an attempt to eliminate possible corrupted clusters in the storage. I’ve probably taken other steps as well which I may have forgotten at this point.</p>

            <p>Hey, guys! It sounds like the disc reader might be failing in your console if you've tried all of the troubleshooting you've listed above. Especially if the discs work on another Xbox One console and another Xbox 360 console.</p>
<p>To test this out, you can put in a DVD (not a Bluray, but an older DVD) into your Xbox One. If it happens to not read or does stuttering while it's playing, then the disc drive is failing and you will need to set up your console for repair. Give that a shot and let us know what happens!</p>

<p>Hello, thanks for responding. I popped in and watched a DVD of a film and it loaded just fine and played without any issues or stuttering. Yet, my disc-based backwards compatible games still have the described issue.

            <p>Thanks for testing that out! Does this happen only while playing Call of Duty online or are you experiencing this with offline games as well? If it''s just while playing online it sounds like it may be a network connection issue. Keep us in the loop :)</p>

<p>It happens on the offline mode of COD as well. But it's obviously not a network issue because it only occurs on disc-based Backward Compatible titles, whether it is Call of Duty: Black Ops, Left 4 Dead 2, or Gears of War 3. But all my digital Backward Compatible
 games, my digital Xbox One games (including other Call of Duty titles), and my disc-based Xbox One games work perfectly fine. It goes without saying that network issues do not affect such a specific type of games, in this case, disc-based Backward Compatible
 titles. </p>
<p>Also, I now found two friends with identical issues, where they lag every 15 minutes on disc-based Backward Compatible titles, but on nothing else. I'm starting to think this is a bigger issue which needs addressing on Xbox's part through some sort of update,
 but after spending over 10 hours with Support, I've nearly given up because nobody from Xbox is willing to take responsibility for the issue.

<p>If you don't mind, it's also a good idea to submit the <a href="http://twtpoll.com/backcompat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            SSX 3 Paid, but can&#39;t play.  Says I don&#39;t own it.</h2>
                    <p>I know I've stated this on other threads but seriously, I wanted to play this game today &amp; it's starting to tick me off that I&nbsp;can't.</p><p><br /></p><p>Myself &amp; others are experiencing an issue where we PAID&nbsp;for the game but can't download or play it.&nbsp; I&nbsp;was super excited to be able to play this today, but no... You gotta take my money &amp; then it says I&nbsp;don't own it.&nbsp; Seriously, how long does it take to fix an issue like this?&nbsp; I&nbsp;have the receipt, I&nbsp;was charged for the game.&nbsp;&nbsp;When am I gonna be able to play it?&nbsp; It would be nice if MS had actual customer support instead of a public&nbsp;forum &amp;&nbsp;a dumb AI that does literally nothing.</p>

<h2>            Xbon one controller - spins in circle</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, &nbsp;I have recently purchase the XBOX ONE controller + cable for windows and can't use it to play my games (my PC runs Windows 10). &nbsp;Whan I activate the controller in my game it act as if I was keeping the direction stick to the left at all time so it is
 impossible to play. &nbsp;I tried with Assassins's creed I and II and have the same results. &nbsp;I did calibrate the controller a couple of time but that did not solve the problem. &nbsp;I also tried to plug it in différent USB port with no better results. &nbsp;The controller
 seems to be working well except for this which make it unusable. &nbsp;Would any one have an idea or had the same problem ?? regards</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Check the Screen Saver - Right Click the desktop - Personalize - Screen Saver - untick on Resume<br />
display logon screen - APPY /&nbsp;OK. If it unticked then tick it as if you planned to leave it that way and<br />
then go back and untick it again.<br />
<br />
Also check Control Panel - Power Options - upper left Require a password on wakeup - tick Don't<br />
require - Save Changes. If already set the change the settings as if you planned to leave it that<br />
way and then go back and set back.<br />
<br />
Check the Power Plans while you are in Power Options.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.

                    Connecting An old hard drive via USB on Windows 10 the hard drive came out of the laptop that no longer functions I need to say the pictures and documents off of the but I can't seem to get Windows tend to see it it's easy to find under computer management
 but it says that it needs to be initiated and that would be counterproductive as it would delete everything on the drive

<p>I already know how to create Windows on the go our windows to go or any of the other multitude of names used this does not help what I need to reiterate I have a hard drive from a laptop that no longer works several circuits are burned out I need to recover
 some of the data off of the hard drive which still works what I need is a way to pluck the hard drive into my computer that's running Windows 10 so that I can open it and download the pictures and the data see not complicated at all</p>

<p>this is the original hard drive from a Dell laptop plugged in via a usb adapter&nbsp;plugged into a Dell alien desktop but the laptop and the desktop were running Windows 10 both of them are 64 bit if you go into computer management and then into disk management
 the drive will show up it shows up with the full size of the drive it's a 500 GB and it shows roughly 489 of that 500 it shows it all as open which it's not&nbsp;so it does not differentiate between the amount of free and used&nbsp; and it tells me that the drive needs
 to be initialized you don't even get that little bell sound that you normally get when you hook up a USB I hope this helps you help me I've done this before I had this problem once before but I cannot remember what I did to fix the problem I have three different
 USB adapter plugs and I get the same with all of them. Thank you in advance for your time</p>

<p>The type of computer that it's plugged into is a Dell alien desktop, the drive is out of a Dell laptop both units have windows 10 installed on them the hard drive from the laptop and my desktop the hard drive from the laptop is a Western Digital 500 GB&nbsp;plugged
 into an adapter for USB when you plug the USB into the desktop you don't get the normal bell sound however oddly enough when you unplug it you get the sound you can find the drive by going to computer management/disk management the drive will show up but it
 shows all of the drive is being free and that it needs to be initialized I hope this is enough information I should've included all of this in the original question but needless to say I was a little bit frustrated I've done this many times I've have run across
 this problem before but I can't remember what I did to fix it anyway thank you very much for your reply and thank you very much for any help that you can give me have a wonderful day</p>

<p>Thank you for your time;</p>
<p>I should start by explaining all the different steps I've taken so far and try to be more &nbsp;precise, the actual hard drive when I plug it in and I run the disk management tool reads as "disk 12 unknown 465.76 GB not initialized", it then shows a white rectangle
 box with a black bar over it and the words 465.76 GB unallocated. The disk actually probably has 150 or so gigabytes of free space the the hard drive came out of a working laptop so it has windows 10 home edition I believe installed on it the screen on the
 laptop was destroyed so basically all I'm trying to do is recover the pictures and the documents that was on the hard drive that are on the hard drive I have 4 different desktop computers three of the 4R Dell desktops one is a workstation Dell so I have tried
 different USB ports both 2.0 and 3.0 I have restarted all the desktops with the hard drive connected and without the hard drive connected when you connect the hard drive the little bell does not sound however when you disconnect the hard drive the little bell
 sounds. I hope this answers all your questions I will try to get a picture of the computer management disk management screen and uploaded to hear</p>

<h2>            HOW TO CHANGE GAMER TAG TO XBOX 360 GAMER TAG</h2>
                    
<p>I need help to add my old gamer tag shefuxndope to my xbox one system. For some reason it wouldn't let me use my old 360 gamer tag on my new console. I had to create a new gamer tag. I just want to know if there is a way I can transfer my gamer tag Shefuxndope
 to my Xbox one. My new gamer tag is shefuxkndope but my old tag has way more achievements and game progress so I would like to continue using that account on my new system.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can't transfer data such as achievements &amp; game saves will not transfer. You can read up on what will transfer using this Support Article -
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-one/system/move-from-xbox-360-to-xbox-one" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../move-from-xbox-360-to-xbox-one</a></p>
<p>I can't see any reason that you shouldn't be able to use your old Xbox 360 account on the Xbox One though. All you need to do is sign in to your Xbox One with your Shefuxndope account.</p>
<p>What's the specific issue you have when you try to login using your Shefuxndope account?</p>
<p>It may be that you was trying to "create" that Gamertag again which you cannot do as you someone (you) already has that Gamertag, you need to make sure you are logging into an existing account (As it can be used on both consoles) For example, I use my "M
 ahh tt" Gamertag on both the 360 and Once depending on which console/game I want to play at the time.</p>

<p>For some reason my new gamer tag linked itself to my old gamer tag email address. I don't know how to change that and to link my old gamer tag back to my Microsoft account. I believe that's why I cant play as my old game tag. Is there a way to fix that?

            <p>Hey, AnDrunkDuckie! They want you to send it in because this is the only way to resolve this error if updating manually does not. This thread is over 4 years old.
