<h2>            Skype 8.13 Ultra Sensitive Window Area Disruptive In Video Calls</h2>
                    The on screen widgets and dark overlay appear at the most inopportune times. The window is ultra sensitive to mouse cursor position and any click in the window area kills the layout continuously ruins video captures due to constant popups and and darker
 screen . Classic skype is not an option due to the huge translator icon at the bottom of screen. It is at least 3 times the size of any widget on the screen. Any way to disable the hover action over the main window?

<h2>            Widows 7 PC not recognizing home theater receiver</h2>
                    Why does my windows 7 pc not recognize my home theater receiver when connected via hdmi (pc-&gt;hdmi-&gt;receiver-&gt;hdmi-&gt;tv)? It used to work in this configuration, and now only works when directly connected to the tv.

<h2>            Right I am getting very &#91;Mod Removed&#93; with xbox enforcement team</h2>
                    
<p>It seems to me that my son is getting trolled by another gamer...My son is 7 years old and loves playin minecraft, I have heard someone keep sayin to him whilst in party mode add me or let me join or i will report you...and guess what...now the account is
 banned for no reason!!!!&nbsp;<br />
Now I dont know who is doing this all the time and all I get is the enforcement team posting the stupid ts&amp;cs everytime...</p>
<p>.I KNOW WHAT IT SAYS BUT IT DOESNT SHOW THE EVIDENCE OF WHY THE ACCOUNT HAS BEEN BANNED!!!!<br />
<br />
TROLLING IS VERY SERIOUS AND COULD LEAD TO SERIOUS INVESTIGATION BY POLICE!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>so can the enforcement team learn how to do their jobs properly instead of banning people for fun and trolling by users</p>

<p>Nice to see a parent acting responsibly, I'm an adult and have lost count of the idiots using foul language when they don't have a clue who they are talking to. if enforcement took their jobs as seriously as the give me your money squad life on the Xbox

<p>Yes it seems the enforcement team dont have a clue and just go on a whim when banning people without looking into it further, I am totally sickened in xbox having been a loyal customer for many years and this is how they repay me, they have banned my account
 and not even stated when its back online, they still havnt shown me any evidence even when I have filed a case review...they just write back that scripted
<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong> they put all the time.</p>
<p>I have lost all faith in the xbox team...and they may have lost a loyal customer too..</p>
<p>theres no wonder soo many people have crossed over to PS4...</p>
<p>XBOX -- tut tut</p>

<p>Hate to tell you this but the enforcement team don't just ban people for the fun of it.</p>
<p>They investigate a report thoroughly before taking any action on an account.</p>
<p>To find out why,read about enforcement myths or to ask for a case review then follow the instructions here
<a href="http://enforcement.xbox.com/Home/HowTo#sub-topic0-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">enforcement.xbox.com/.../HowTo</a></p>
<p>Maybe set up some parental controls instead of letting a 7 year old play with random people on xbox live,as with everywhere else,there are some untrustworthy people out there.</p>

<p>yes I have read eveything about the enforcement team but it makes my blood boil when I request a review case and demand to see evidence of why my account was banned in the first place and yet there is nothing being brought forward to show me ...apart from
 the same crap they run off a script.</p>
<p>im fed up of being shown ''your account has been suspended , it MAY include...blah blah blah''</p>
<p>is that the best they can tell us?? show me a screenshot of something that has been really investigated by the enforcement team...at least i know im paying for something useful..instead of having an account i cant do jack with</p>
<p>me and my son share the same account so therefore i monitor everything he sends and recieves...and there has been some very dissapointing messages from users saying they will report my son for not inviting them to a party or game....now if this is the reason
 why the account has been banned...well thats just pathetic!!...other than that i havnt got a clue why...they havnt even stated when its back online!!</p>

<p>Your account will never be banned just because you didn't invite someone to party chat.</p>

<p>all they sent was this scripted message:</p>
<p>This account engaged in inappropriate communications. This activity may include harassment, abusive language, hate speech, profanity, disruptive or offensive language, spamming, or other inappropriate uses of Xbox Live communications features. Temporary
 suspension impact: For the duration of the suspension this account cannot use Xbox Live communication features, including in-game and party chat, messaging, video communications, gameplay broadcasting, sharing content, and Skype on Xbox One. Permanent suspension
 impact: This account can no longer sign in to Xbox Live from any device. This enforcement affects the account's Xbox Live privileges</p>

<p>That's the reason then.Doesn't matter who "struck first",if you reply with an abusive message &amp; it's reported you will get suspended.</p>
<p>It's best to just report any abusive messages you get &amp; block the sender,never reply to them.</p>
<p>Communication suspensions are typically 24 hour,7 or 14 days long.</p>

So I reinstalled my OS(not OEM, Bought and paid for full install of Windows XP Home 2002), and after spending 3 hrs hand
 installing hardware&nbsp;controllers and drivers, was finally able to connect to the internet to do upgrades on Windows XP, and hardware. Upon reaching Windows Update site, I realized I couldn't do web updates, due to my ancient version of Windows. It won't update
 to SP3, because I need SP1 or better. So, I tried to download and install SP1a. Error states I can't reach server. So, I download SP1a on to my other computer, burn a CD, and attempt to install SP1a directly from CD. Now I get an error message stating "Error
 intalling SP1a, unable to reach server. Try again when you have web access......HELLO! I'm not trying to install from the web...why this message? I even made sure my computer was getting a good ethernet connection, just in case my computer needed to communicate
 with ?? while my computer was being updated by&nbsp;CD. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is probably something simple, but I'm getting frustrated. It doesn't help when the first thing I see on the Microsoft Update site is a special page telling me I may not be able to update&nbsp;Windows. PLEASE HELP!&nbsp;</p>

You need to use this upgrade path:</div>

<div>
<u>XP Gold</u>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<u>XP SP2</u>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<u>XP SP3</u>.</div>
<div>

Note that installing SP1a is&nbsp;<b>TOTALLY UNNECESSARY</b>!!!! (Not only that, the file available these days is the WRONG one, as you have experienced.)</div>

Here are detailed instructions:</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
<p>1. Download the installation files for SP2, SP3, IE8, and&nbsp;Microsoft Security Essentials, which is an effective antivirus/antimalware program. I prefer to keep these on a USB flash drive, but that part
 is optional. Here are the links for all three installation files:</p>

<p>2. Physically disconnect from the Internet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Temporarily disable Automatic Updates.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>4. Install SP2. Reboot twice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>7. Install Antivirus software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Very often what happens is someone has&nbsp;their antivirus program&nbsp;running while they are trying to install SP3, which often results in chaos! That is why it should be done AFTER SP3 and IE are installed.)</p>

<p>8. Make sure Windows firewall is enabled (it should already be).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Now you can physically reconnect to the Internet.)</p>

</p><p>If you still have the Windows 7 COA / Product key sticker find <span>
a friend with a "Retail" version (Full or Upgrade media, </span><span><span>just the media as you don't need their key</span></span><span><span>) of the installation DVD (must be the same as your key was for:

<p>It is now easier to recover aMicrosoft Word 2010, Microsoft Excel 2010, or Microsoft PowerPoint 2010 file if you
close your file without saving, or you want to review or return to an earlier version of the file you're already working in.</p>
<p>As with earlier versions of Office, enabling AutoRecover in Word 2010, Excel 2010 or PowerPoint 2010 will save versions while you are working in your file at the interval you select. Now, you can choose to keep the last autosaved version of a file in case
 you accidentally close that file without saving, so that you can restore it the next time that you open the file. Also, while you are working in your file, you can access a listing of the autosaved files from the Microsoft Office Backstage view.</p>
<p><b>Important</b> You must have <b>Save AutoRecover information...</b> and

    <title>M-Audio M-Track disconnects after 30-60 seconds of idle. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> op-0  say:</h3>
<h2>            M-Audio M-Track disconnects after 30-60 seconds of idle.</h2>
                    <p>I recently got a Lenovo Thinkpad Yoga Business laptop with Windows 8.1. I previously owned the M-Track, and was using it with the HP Pavilion p6310y with Win7 loaded. However, when I tried to use it on the laptop, I was met with some unexpected results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the laptop is running on battery, the M-Track will just be disconnected for no apparent reason. This is a big problem, as the disconnection and reconnection of the device are heralded by a big pop, volume dependent on the setting on the Windows mixer.
 If the volume is set high, this pop can be quite painful. If the laptop is plugged in, this problem seems to disappear completely. The device will stay connected unconditionally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went over to the M-Audio support forum for answers, and a representative and I were able to compile some data:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) The problem could be power related. The lack of the problem's appearance when the laptop is plugged in suggests that it is so. We weren't entirely sure how, though. Even when steps were taken to prevent Windows from unpowering the device, the device still
 disconnects. Turning off USB selective suspend did nothing. Preventing Windows from unpowering the USB slot it is connected to in the Device Manager only resulted in the occasional buzzing in the output following the pop.</p>
<p>2) The problem could be class-compliance related. On every other Windows version (XP, Vista, 7, 8), the M-Track has a dedicated driver. However, in Windows 8.1, the M-Track is class compliant. It is only on this version of Windows that this problem has surfaced
 (and from what the representative told me, it is very rare).</p>
<p>3) The problem is isolated. Other externally connected devices do not suffer this same problem. USB devices never disconnect, and Bluetooth devices only ever disconnect due to heavy wireless interference. In addition, these devices are not the source of
 the problem. The idle disconnect still occurs even when these devices have been removed.</p>
<p>4) ASIO works perfectly with the M-Track. There is no disconnection as a result of idle even if the device is left for hours without doing anything. This suggests that the issue may lie in the drivers.</p>
<p>5) I was fortunate enough to find a workaround in my experimentation. If I select "Listen to this device" on any available recording device, the problem goes away even if that recording device is muted. The representative told me that "Listen to this device"
 creates a constant stream of communication between the device and the Windows drivers. If this is the case, then it could be that the problem is the result of the driver not communicating with the M-Track when it has nothing to send to output, prompting Windows
 to disconnect it in an attempt to save power (which, from item 1, it should not be making).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you could help me with this issue.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you so much for posting your query on this forum. You have reached the right place and I will try my best to assist you with this issue.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I appreciate the efforts that you have taken in performing a thorough research on this issue and thank you so much for sharing all the relevant information regarding this issue with us in your post.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have a very valid and good findings in the 5<sup>th</sup> point that you have included in the query. This issue seems to be due to some drivers issues on Windows 8.1. Moreover, the Windows 8 Compatibility Center does not provide any information regarding
 the M-Track device with Windows 8.1 Operating System. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, let us try some troubleshooting methods and check if that resolves the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Method 1: Update the Chipset Drivers for your Computer Model from the Lenovo Website</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please visit the Lenovo website and install the latest Windows 8.1 compatible Chipset drivers for your laptop model. For this click on these links and then download and install the latest drivers:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="http://support.lenovo.com/us/en/products/laptops-and-netbooks/thinkpad-yoga-series-laptops/thinkpad-yoga/downloads/DS038348" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Intel Chipset Device Software for Windows 8.1 (64-bit) - ThinkPad Yoga</a></em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Note: For installation instructions, you may please check the README text file which can also be downloaded from the same links.</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, check if the issue persists. If yes, then try the next method and let us know the result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Method 2: Try installing the Windows 8 compatible M-Track Drivers in the Compatibility Mode</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please download the Windows 8 compatible M-Track drivers from the M-Audio website, install it in Windows 8 compatibility mode and check if that resolves the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may download this driver from this link: <strong><em><a href="http://www.m-audio.com/index.php?do=support.drivers&amp;f=1257" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">M-Track Drivers for Windows 8 Operating System - Version: 1.0.6</a></em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Note: Scroll down the page to find the download link.</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After downloading and saving the Driver Zip file on the computer, extract the Zip file and then install the drivers in Windows 8 compatibility mode. To install any drivers/apps in the compatibility mode, please refer to this article:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

                    I cannot boot into Windows XP.&nbsp; I get a message that this file is corrupted or missing:&nbsp; \windows\system32\config\system.&nbsp; I have done a search on remedies and found a way to manually recover from this problem on Microsoft's website.&nbsp; It involves the Recovery
 Console, which I can get to, but the first line I am suppose to type in is 'md tmp'.&nbsp; When I do that, after a little bit the computer comes back with 'access is denied'.&nbsp; Who in the world is denying me, the computer owner, access and how do I gain access so
 I can get my computer up and running again?

<p>You don't tell us enough - for instance, how do you get into the Recovery Console? Is it from the XP installation CD?</p>
<p>When you type md tmp, you are instructing the pc to make a directory called tmp on the current volume. If the current volume is actually the XP installation CD you will, quite naturally, be denied access.</p>

            Yes, I arrived at the Recovery Console via an XP installation CD but the prompt is for the 'C' drive which is my hard drive, isn't it?&nbsp; So isn't the command trying to access the hard drive when I enter it?&nbsp; Your response gave me something to think about
 because I have an external hard drive hooked up to my computer so I went back to see if I could access the directory of that hard drive and I can, although the computer gives it the letter 'D' designation where Windows always referred to it as drive 'G'.&nbsp;
 I tried to type the 'md tmp' command at the 'D' prompt and, again, I got the response 'access is denied'.&nbsp; I think I may have to install another hard drive in the computer, install the OS and then add my original hard drive back into the system as a slave
 drive in order to access the information I have stored on there.&nbsp; That should work, shouldn't it?&nbsp; Thanks in advance for any and all help you, or anyone else, cares to give me in this matter.

            Firstly, apologies for the long delay in response - I went off to do other things &amp; this is my first time back on this site.<br />
<br />
The changing drive letters and the "access denied" message suggests that your HD is either defunct or has some major problem.<br />
<br />
As you suggest, you can try installing Windows on a new HD &amp; then trying to access the information on your original HD, but that may not work.<br />
<br />
Go onto the web-site of your original HD's manufacturer - they generally have software to enable you to check the drive &amp; possibly correct errors found.<br />

            Boot to the Recovery Console and when you get to prompt run a Chkdsk on the drive by issuing this command:&nbsp; chkdsk c: /r<br />

    <title>USB device cannot start on bootup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sallywg  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB device cannot start on bootup</h2>
                    Using 64-bit Vista (with SP2 installed) on a machine that has never had any other OS, whenever I boot up my USB device drivers do not load. These are not extraordinary new device drivers but core Intel ICH9 Family USB Universal Host Controllers.<br />
<br />
I uninstall each one, scan for hardware changes, and they will work... until the next reboot. And I have to do it all over again.<br />
<br />
I have tried all the traditional fixes, including reinstalling drivers, looking for updated drivers, and so forth.<br />
<br />
None of the Hot Fixes that I've found relate to this issue.<br />
<br />
Below is the copy/paste from the Problems record. Please tell me you have an answer for me.<br />
<br />
Thanks, Sally<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
You can go through the following articles and try to perform the steps mentioned in the below article.<br />
<br />
1) <strong>A USB device may not work when you start a Windows Vista-based computer or when you wake the computer from sleep<br />
<br />
</strong>&nbsp; <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/941996/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/941996/en-us</a><br />
<br />
Note: this article talks about a hotfix, install it and check if the issue is solved.<br />
<br />
2) <strong>How to troubleshoot USB device problems that may occur after a portable computer that is running Windows Vista resumes from sleep or from hibernation<br />
<br />
</strong>&nbsp; <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/953367/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/953367/en-us</a><br />

            Unfortunately, when I run that hotfix (and several others I have tried), I get the message that it doesn't apply to my system.
<br />
<br />
Nor is this a portable system. It's a desktop workstation.<br />
<br />
I have all the latest service packs and Windows updates installed. But still my USB ports don't install on boot up.
<br />
<br />
I am also now&nbsp;getting Driver State Failure blue screens. The only new driver I have added has been removed by using system restore. But I'm still getting Blue Screens.<br />
<br />
I pray someone can help. This is one expensive doorstop that's quite necessary to my work.<br />
<br />
Thanks, Sally

<h2>            Odd Bluescreen freezes and forces the PC to Restart</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, the weirdest of the issues has started to affect my PC today. It first started in the morning while I was playing, when I was in a load screen the PC froze and a blue screen appeared (not the blue screen of death, this one had no messages only white
 lines), the PC got frozen, I could hear a continuous hum coming out from my speakers and then the PC automatically reset. Then, after 2 hours or so, I wasn't even on the PC so nothing was running, but I was around and saw it, same error, but this time without
 the hum, PC restarted again. Then I ran a benchmark and nothing happened, the temperature was also normal. My drivers are up to date as well. Then I played for a little over 3 hours and everything was fine, after a while I was listening to music on the PC
 and nothing else was running and the error happened again: this time with the hum again, but no reset. I unplugged the HDMI cable, the hum continued, then I plugged it again and the screen was the same, finally I forcefully rebooted it through the reset button.
 However, the last time I was able to take a picture, note that is possible to be see the task bar, it's the only thing that remains normal during the error.
</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Well, does anyone know what this problem is? Because I have no idea what it might be. My PC's specs are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Motherboard Asus&nbsp; H81M </p>
<p>12 GB Ram </p>
<p>Core I3 3.60 GHz </p>
<p>VGA Geforce GTX 960 </p>

<p>Hi <strong>Leon</strong>,</p>
<p>The issue that you’ve encountered may be a software or hardware related. This can also be due to a software conflict. To learn more about this concern, we’d like to confirm if there were any updates or changes that were made prior to the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, let’s try to isolate this issue by <strong>performing a clean boot</strong>. This troubleshooting technique will help us determine if there are applications, other settings, services that may be causing the issue. Please check this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Click here">article</a></strong> for the steps. Once you’re in the clean boot environment, try to observe its behavior and check
 if you’ll get the same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Note:</strong> After the troubleshooting, refer to this section: “</span><span><strong><em>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean

 article</span></a><span><span>&nbsp;</span>to boot the computer in normal setup once the issue has been resolved.</span><span>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, you can run the <strong>System File Checker</strong> tool in Windows 10 to detect any possible corrupted system files and can be one of the reasons why the issue has occurred. Here are the steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Type Command Prompt in the Search box from Start.</li><li>Right-click on it, then select Run as administrator.</li><li><span>Enter </span><span><strong>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</strong></span><span> (note the spaces before each "/").</span></li><li><span>Enter <strong>sfc</strong> <strong>/scannow</strong> (note the space between "sfc" and "/").</span></li><li>Once done, try to check if it resolved the concern.</li></ol>

</p><p>Hi, thanks for the reply. Well, I still haven't followed what you said because my issued kind of changed: You told me to confirm if there were any updates or changes made... well, I actually had installed a new video drive some days before the issue started
 happened, so before trying the clean boot I decided to go back to the previous VGA drive. After going back that problem hasn't happened, but rather now, I'm getting the blue screen of death sometimes, with an error saying something about "drive", I wasn't
 able to read it completely the last 3 times it happened, but I'll keep an eye for the next time so I can report the exact error that the blue screen shows. I'll keep you posted.</p>

    <title>Lenovo laptop died during Windows 10 update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> max433  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lenovo laptop died during Windows 10 update</h2>
                    <p>My Lenovo G580 laptop's battery died at exactly about 95% into a Windows 10 update (which happened automatically without me asking for it).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went downstairs to grab my charger and when I plugged it back in, all that comes up is my Lenovo loading screen, it'll go to a black screen where I can see a blank box pop up for half a second. Then it will restart and continue to do this over and over
 again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried everything I've seen on other forums but nothing has worked as of yet which is why I am now making my own post. I am in the middle of revision and if I can not get this to work I will have to travel back to university and spend everyday in the
 library (if I am lucky enough to find a computer).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully I have attached a video so that you can all see the issue first hand. Any information you have will be very useful and thanks very much.</p>

    <title>WMF thumbnails do not display - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tom_rawls  say:</h3>
<h2>            WMF thumbnails do not display</h2>
                    
<p>I have a lareg number of WMF files (Windows Metafile) from the Microsoft Clipart site. In XP they always displayed as thumbnails, but since I changed to Vista I'm unable to see any of them. I am seeing some JPG and PNG files showing up as thumbnails, but
 none of the WMF files.<br />
<br />
I've checked the settings under Folder Options and verified that "Always show icons, never thumbnails" is NOT checked. Also the View is set to Medium sized icons, but it does not matter what I choose from this drop down as none of the WMF files display.<br />
<br />
Even more curious is that folders which contain multiple file types (such as PNG, JPG, WMF) will show thumbnails of everything but the WMF files.<br />
<br />
Any help someone can provide would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!</p>

            Hello Tom_Rawls,<br />
<br />
Thank you for your post.&nbsp; The reason that you can't&nbsp;view&nbsp;.wmf thumbnails is because&nbsp;the file format&nbsp;been recognized as a&nbsp;serious security threat, thus Microsoft disabled this feature in Vista.&nbsp; If you still wish to view the thumbnails you will have to get a
 3rd party software from the web such as <a href="http://www.xnview.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.xnview.com</a>.&nbsp; I have attached a couple of articles that explain the security threat for your review.<br />

    <title>Left Thumbstick Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vetvideogamer65  say:</h3>
<h2>            Left Thumbstick Issue</h2>
                    
<p>I have seen others post about the left thumb-stick issue on other threads with no answer being provided.</p>
<p>My stick started acting up on about two beta updates ago (yes, I agreed to be a beta tester for the XB1 updates)... on the dashboard and in-game, I have what appears to be forward/upward movement due to the left thumb stick issue. It gets frustrating to
 attempt to select an option only to have the on-screen cursor moving all the time or to play RBI Baseball and/or BF4 with your on-screen character moving forward all the time. I can make it subside by pulling back and releasing the stick, but that only stops
 for a moment. Then, it returns to its forward/upward movement again.</p>
<p>The issue started with a MS beta console update. Before that, my controller worked just fine. I hope that MS will stand by its product.</p>
<p>I reported this immediately to Xbox Support only to be told that my controller is out of warranty - that I will have to buy a new controller. How is it that my console has a 1 year warranty, but the controller that came with my new XB1 has only a 90 day
 warranty. Shouldn't the whole package have a 1-year warranty? It was sold together on Day One!
</p>

<p>One last note... if a software update caused the issue, shouldn't the company responsible for causing the issue be responsible for correcting it - even if that company has to replace the affected controller(s).</p>

<p>Hi guys. I have also had the same issue, I purchased my XBOX One console from GAMEUK in April &amp; since April i've had about 5 controllers replaced but because they're the Day One edition the fault on the left Analog occurs after a week or two. I've had my
 5th or 6th controller now since Wednesday &amp; I've just had to be a little less robust when playing FIFA 14 as heavy use of the analog will cause it to stick and make weird clicking noises, I notice the problem doesn't occur with everyone as my brother also
 owns a XBOX 1 and he's controller seems more solid. and many other of my friends have not had no issues whatsoever, it jus seems we are the unlucky ones. There must be second edition or less faulty ones being issued by outlets, but I refuse to pay to send
 my controller to Xbox Support. They should demand a total recall and supply new and improved ones, or let us sync our Xbox 360 controller to our XBOX ONE like Playstation have did.

<p>I have since purchased a replacement controller, that has yet to give me any issues (knock on wood). I still believe the issue stemmed from an update, since I had no previous issues. But how do you prove that? Oh well, better to move on (as long as no additional
 issues come up) and enjoy all the gaming goodness coming this fall. Let's see... already enjoying Diablo III, Madden 15, Minecraft and Destiny, soon to play Mordor, NHL 15, The Crew and the BIGGEST of all... Halo: Master Chief Collection!!! Life is sure getting
 REALLY good!!! I will be set for winter, that's for sure!</p>

<p>I have the same problem with mine. The left stick has a clicking noise when going to the left and holding the analog stick down. That, in turn, makes the bottom right of the stick useless: you cannot move anywhere to the right or down. This occurred after
 playing NHL 15 WHERE you push in the analog stick to skate faster. How come these controllers are not built like the 360 ones? Never had a problem with those. Why should I have to pay for a repair or replacement if it is a micro$oft issue? And I used my buddies
 controller that was bought 4 days ago and boom same thing happened.</p>

 my controller?? Do I get compensation for the 10+ days I can't play games online due to no controller??</p>

<p>I now have 2 controllers that have developed this creeping forwards of the left thumbstick issue.
</p>
<p>It has made playing The Golf Club almost impossible as each time i try to line up a putt, before i know it im aiming 80ft longer than i wish to be putting. For me, this issue seemed to have gotten much worse the last time it suggested i update my controllers.
 As both of my controllers are very clean and in great condition this is not a problem caused by me. What are my options???</p>

<p>New controller that guys sent me...Has the same problem. Can't even use it this time. It seems as though a piece of plastic just breaks off where the analog stick connects because if you shake the controller it starts rattling. I can't afford to send it
 in and wait 2 weeks for a new one. Can we get some compensation as now it'll roughly one month without a controller. NEED SOMEONE TO ANSWER US.</p>
