<h2>            cortana for android</h2>
                    Earlier this year I had to get a new phone, I chose the galaxy s6 edge. While i loved my Lumia 830 and would have upgraded to another windows phone there are no windows phone being sold by carriers in Canada anymore. While i love my s6 edge and have synced
 all my Microsoft apps, I miss cortana. Google play store says cortana and bing are not available in canada. Does anyone know if and when they will be available?

<h2>            How do I get the absolute value of a mapped drive&#63; I mean P&#58; &#61; C&#58;&#92;abc&#92;def for example.</h2>
                    <p>I have an application in Access 2010 running on both windows 7 and 8.1 machines. It works on data using a mapped drive mapped outside the program (user's tools, etc).</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the features is to make a backup of the data relative to the location of that mapped drive - for instance P:\backups. But when the mapping is lost later the user needs to know the path to the backups in absolute terms - c:\abc\def\backups for example.
 I want to "tell" the user where that is (msgbox, report, file, whatever).</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I translate the mapped drive to it's path in VBA?</p>

<p>Hi<span>&nbsp; </span>Ram2694,</p>

this thread.</a></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>I actually got a request from someone else who was working on an existing document and this was happening to him as well.&nbsp; He also showed me a seperate document where the comments pane wouldn't open when they added a comment.&nbsp; So, this is very sporadic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a test I created a new document and&nbsp;it started to do this in the new document as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Final: Show Markup</p>
<p>Show Markup: Everything is selected with Balloons: Show all revisions inline</p>
<p>
</p><p>View is in Print Layout Mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is pretty frustrating.&nbsp; There has to be an option somewhere to turn off the comments pane for good.</p>

            <p>To prevent the Revisions pane from appearing in Print Layout view as you add a comment, you have to choose some other setting than Show All Revisions Inline (found at Review | Show Markup | Balloons). Note that this display setting is not saved with the
 document; instead, it is specific to your machine and your login.</p>

            <p>No, not if you want to hide all comment balloons at the same time... </p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, you can choose to display balloons for formatting changes and comments (but not for tracked changes), if that helps.</p>

<h2>            Nokia E71 Manual Network selection Problems</h2>
                    HI<br />
<br />
I have the E71 on the Three network and it allows roaming in this country (something thats usually locked off) to avoid roaming charges I went to change the phones network select option from Automatic to manual, I get the usual pop up to select the network
 I want to connect to but when I go back to the network options screen it shows as automatic and does indeed allow roaming. How do I actually change to manual network selection.<br />
<br />
Cheers

            I'm getting the same fault. My phone keeps switching to roaming and costing extra charges.<br />
But it is not binding to the 'Manual' setting for desired network provider.<br />
Very frustrating. I spoke to my providers support who wanted to do a hard reset of my phone.<br />
I declined to do this as I would loose my settings.<br />
Seemed like they didn't know.

            I went into my phone supplier and the salesman told me that the 'automatic' setting is a feature and that it cannot be turned off. The manual setting is only there to allow a once off selection of an available network.<br />
What he suggested was that I change the 'Network Mode' to UMTS, which I believe stops the phone from being able to the find the 'roaming' (other network than 3G) option.<br />
It seems to have done the trick, but still not good that Nokia does not allow users to hard set the networks which you want to or dont want to use.<br />
Hope this helps.

            I can't believe that Nokia have not resolved this problem.<br />
<br />
The problem gives a direct influence on the cost of calls, which is very excessive.<br />
<br />
I spent 3 hours on the phone to Three to try to resolve the problem and nothing worked. Tried removing sim card and putting it back in, factory reset and hard reset.<br />
<br />
For a regular traveler this phone is a nightmare. Call charges can range from £0.25p to £1.50 and 0.12p to 0.25p. Also call charges may be applicable in the UK depending on your network provider.<br />
<br />
Quite simply not fit for its purpose. A mobile phone by definition is "a hand-held mobile radiotelephone for use in an area divided into small sections, each with its own short-range transmitter/receiver provided by a specific network carrier".<br />
<br />
Unfortunately the phone does not meet this definition. Under the Trade Descriptions Act of 1968 should be entitled to a refund as customers have been mislead by the sale of the handset. Also the phone directly misleads roaming customers.<br />
<br />
Also under the Sale of Goods Act of 1979 the mobile phone should be "fit for purpose". Unfortunately the E71 is not fit for purpose as a mobile phone does not meet its definition and as a customer the network provider does not provide a fair service carried
 by the network. Most networks are contractually bound to do so.<br />
<br />
If you have a problem with this phone please contact Nokia or your provider to try to resolve the problem and push the new firmware as soon as possible!

<p>Hi, I<font> have a nokia black E71-3 from 3. </font></p>
<p><font>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font>I have the exact same issues with locking it to a network. I have noticed a mate has bought the exact fone through a retailer outright and in his network selection he has Umts, GSM or dual mode. Mine only has Dual mode or UMTS. I believe
 that 3 have set this fone like this so it cannot roam on telstras gsm network at all and uses telstras Next G network only when roaming.</font></p>
<p><font>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font>My mate has telstra next g on his E71-3 and has full signal strength and me being with 3 has dismal signal strength and im standing right next to him. Very disapointing considering we both live in NEwcaustle oz 2 hrs north of Sydney
 where 3 use their own network.</font></p>
<p><font>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font>I get better coverage in the gsm mode on my mates nokia e71 with my 3 sim card then with the 3g roaming option on my fone. Is there anyway i can reset the fone to bring back the gsm option on my e71-3 handset?</font></p>

<p>Attention 3 Customers Australia!!!! Further to the netowork issue with the Nokia E71-3 , I have been informed today by 3 Customer Care and Technical services that my fone is not suited to roam on Telstras Network and that after 3 months of continuous complaining
 they can only offer me a $25 credit to my account. NOT GOOD ENOUGH 3. I have been mislead like hundreds of other 3 customers. I was told that I would get a better service then my previous gsm roaming service. I can assure you that this is not the case and
 I will be taking this matter to the ACCC and DEPT OF FAIR TRAIDING as I have been mislead by 3;s&nbsp; advertising and sales staff.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was told by a Telstra Rep that 3 customers roaming on the Telstra 3g network will have access to 40% and this is why I have not been getting good signal from my handset because I will not be getting the same service as a Telstra Customer would. I would
 strongly recommend if anyther 3 customer is having the same issue when roaming outside 3s network to please email me or reply to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

</p><p>Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I understand, whatever emails you receive from&nbsp;Outlook team or Account team are in Hindi. You want to change it&nbsp;to English.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Do you receive all other emails in English?</li><li>Did you make any changes prior to this&nbsp;issue?</li><li>Which language is set on the system?&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>If Outlook team sends you in&nbsp;Hindi, you will receive it in Hindi.&nbsp;So it depends on the sender not on the receiver.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if you change the language to&nbsp;English on Outlook.com, you will still receive the language in which sender has sent you an email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The email you might have received&nbsp;could be a spam and it might not be from Outlook Team.</p>

            Hi DK
<br />
<br />Because you have the full paid for Office 2019 suite installed, it will not be possible to upgrade to the subscription based model
<br />
<br />You would need to completely uninstall that version, sign up for a subscription to Office 365 and then install that version . . .
<br />
<br />Purchase a subscription to Office 365:

<br />
<br />
<br />Use this tool from Microsoft to remove all remnants of the previous Office 2019 Installation:

            Some details would help as Preview builds may change the core build, which may cause issues with some devices all of this needs to be posted in the Feedback Hub with details about your system this way MS people will see.

<p>Thanks, but I didn't see anything relevant in those links.</p>
<p><br />
As far as specs, I'm already running Windows 10 so I don't believe the minimum requirements would change:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 Pro</p>
<p>Processor: Intel i7-7700K @ 4.2GHz</p>
<p>RAM: 32GB</p>
<p>Hard Drive: 250GB Samsung 850 SSD</p>
<p>Graphics: Nvidia GTX 1080TI</p>
<p>Display: 144HZ @1440P</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps Microsoft is preventing custom built PCs from being included in this preview build?</p>

<p>1. Is your current copy of Windows 10 activated? Required.</p>
<p>2. Make sure your Settings in Update &amp; Security under Troubleshooting are correct as Windows 10 can fix certain areas of concern with or without your knowledge.</p>

<p>I can't say for sure that it is activation related. My copy of Windows is activated and i still got the error. I did manage to find a solution though:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went here https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-insider/at-home/troubleshooting and downloaded the ISO for build 18290. Created a bootable usb using the USB/DVD download tool from here&nbsp;</p>
<p>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/windows-usb-dvd-download-tool</p>

<h2>            Calculate hours between two dates&#47;times, exclude weekends</h2>
                    <p>I work on at a call center and am responsible to calculate the number of hours it take to return calls.&nbsp; We do not work weekends, however we receive some calls on weekends that would need to be calculated based on the first business day after the weekend
 (usually Monday).</p>

</p><p>I have tried using the following formula except when the call comes in on the weekend.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">=(NETWORKDAYS(A2,b2)-1+MOD(b2,1)-MOD(A2,1))*24</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you have not clarified is that when (what time) will the work start on a Monday for call that comes on Sat/Sun.&nbsp; So, if a call comes at 17:00 hours on Saturday, then what start time will you consider on Monday?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways, try this</p>
<p>
</p><p>=NETWORKDAYS(A2+CHOOSE(WEEKDAY(A2,2),0,0,0,0,0,2,1),b2)-1+MOD(b2,1)-MOD(A2,1))*24</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

            Hi Slipkid,<br />
<br />
Have you personalized the security code of your phone? If no and the default code which is 12345 is not working, you can try to remove the phone's back cover and battery, replace them back and then turn on the phone. Wait for 10-15 minutes and then enter the
 default code.<br />
<br />
If above would fail, you have to bring the phone to a Nokia Care Point to have the code reset back to factory default.<br />
<br />
Cheers.

<h2>            PLEASE HELP&#33; Why is my computer saying &#34;Unsupported operating system&#34; when I try to install Office 2016&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Please help! I am a student trying to download Microsoft Office 2016 on my Macbook Air OS X Version 10.9.5 (no clue what this means but hopefully it will help you answer my question). Everytime I go to install, it says "Unsupported operating system</p>
It looks like you’re on an unsupported operating system. You'll need Mac OS X 10.10 or newer to run Office on your Mac." What can I do to fix this? I need to update my computer right? Well everytime I go to update it, it says my software is up to date! If I
 take this to a Microsoft store, will they help me install Office? I hope I did not pay $150 for nothing... ugh! Please help and THANK YOU!!!

            El Capitan is a lot better now than it was when it first came out. Unless you have a specific issue then you will probably be OK with El Capitan, assuming there isn't some particular software you have that doesn't work in El Capitan.

<h2>            setting time zone</h2>
                    <p>Hi :)</p>
<p>I need some help please. &nbsp;I'm trying to set up Outlook for the first time. &nbsp;I'm using Windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>I succeeded in setting a password and hit the next arrow. &nbsp;It has 2 drop down windows - one for language (set that) and one for time zone. &nbsp;I clicked the correct time zone from the drop down and then clicked save - got a red error message telling me to set
 a time zone. &nbsp;Tried again only this time I clicked the next arrow instead of save but found out they were both the same. &nbsp;I tried setting time zones in other areas of the world with the same negative results! &nbsp;I have no idea what is wrong. &nbsp;Any help would
 be welcomed.</p>

            Thank you so much for the reply. &nbsp;I sincerely appreciate your help! &nbsp;It didn't work. &nbsp;I used IE and the same thing happened. &nbsp;Then I set up an alias and made that primary. &nbsp;I was sure that I did it right, but evidently not. &nbsp;To see if it worked, I used
 my Yahoo mail to sent to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. &nbsp;I expected that it would show up in my gmail account (that I made primary) but it didn't. &nbsp;I looked in my spam folder just in case and gave it plenty of time. &nbsp;I don't know what I did wrong, but that mail that I
 sent must have gone to my outlook mail account that I can't seem to get into. &nbsp;

<h2>            9926 fails to complete update.  &#34;Inaccessible boot device&#34; error.</h2>
                    <p>My system has tried unsuccessfully three times to update from 9879 to 9926. &nbsp;It gets through 100% setup and then reboots. &nbsp;When it comes up again it says the update failed because of "inaccessible boot device" error. &nbsp;I have the KB3025380 update installed
 as mentioned in the insider hub. &nbsp;I saw a forum post reply that mentioned KB3025379 also being required and I can't find that listed in my updates nor does it show up in available updates. &nbsp;I went to windows support and found the file. &nbsp;I downloaded it and
 went to execute it. &nbsp;It comes up with the security popup and I click allow then nothing seems to happen. &nbsp;I haven't attempted to update again yet, so I'm not sure if this did anything. &nbsp;I'm wondering if this missing update KB3025379 may be what is causing
 so many problems with this build installing. &nbsp;I'll update after the next upgrade attempt.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>As far as I knw, the Zune Pass system does not accept "gift cards" as a means for paying for the Zune Pass. That reason being is that the Zune Pass system is a "recurring" subscription system.</p>
<p>I do not know about purchasing Microsoft Points. As such, what I do know is that the C1001A23C error code is more or less a generic error code and doesn't necessarily direct the person who has encountered the error in any specific directio as to the cause.
 One of the Support people suggests reading this "<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928763" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Error message when you try to update or to add credit card information for a Zune account: "Credit card authorization failed"</a>" Microsoft Support Document.</p>
<p>The other suggestion is to "<a href="http://www.zune.net/en-US/support/contactsupport.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contact Support</a>" directly - They can verify your account information and provide you with more details regarding the use of a Gift Card as well as why you are
 encountering the error.</p>

    <title>Windows IE 10 problem with secure websites - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> harold sheroff  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows IE 10 problem with secure websites</h2>
                    Since the inception of IE10, many secure websites for Banking, Insurance Companies, even the MySpace website will not allow access to their sites with this browser.&nbsp; I asked the Microsoft customer support agent (about five months ago) if this problem was
 being addressed, and he said that in September, 2013 a newer version of Internet Explorer will be introduced and these security issues with certain websites will be corrected.&nbsp; As far as I can&nbsp; see, this has not happened (I keep the automatic update utility
 "on" at all times).&nbsp; I am using the Windows 7 Home edition (fully updated)&nbsp;on a full sized PC.&nbsp;Can anyone tell me when I can either get a new version of Internet Explorer, OR: a newer version of Windows 7 that will fix these problems?&nbsp; (By the way, I have
 been using the Google Chrome browser, which works perfectly with all websites).&nbsp; Please advise, as I am getting really fed up with Microsoft's problems with their operating system software.&nb

            <p>Dear forum readers:&nbsp; My original question was: when Microsoft will introduce a new version of Internet Explorer for Windows 7, or a newer version of Windows 7 that will address the problems I'm having in accessing certain secure websites with IE10.&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon
 questioning&nbsp;the websites involved, all pointed to IE10 as the culprit, and Microsoft customer relations verified this, and told me to wait for version 11 to address these problems.&nbsp; Now, I am going to answer my own question:&nbsp; I discovered (<strong><u>on my
 own</u></strong>) that IE11 for Windows 7 DOES exist, and has since my question was asked.&nbsp; I installed it today, and most of the affected websites (but&nbsp;not all)&nbsp;are now available to view and use with this browser. &nbsp;I mentioned that&nbsp;Microsoft Corp. customer
 support is very hard to get,&nbsp;so I came to this forum for help.&nbsp;not one person&nbsp;told me of the recent update,&nbsp;but instead I was asked to examine&nbsp;virtually every program and process running on my computer to find the problem.&nbsp;
<u>The problem was INTERNET EXPLORER version&nbsp;10, NOT my computer's other software&nbsp;(which I already knew</u>).&nbsp;&nbsp;To those who tried to help me, I thank you, however this forum experience has been very disappointing, as somebody could have simply said "the new
 version is out, load it", instead of assuming my computer was at fault, not the fabulous, bug-free Internet Explorer 10.&nbsp;

<h3> mark92234  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneDrive issues after Version 1809 update</h2>
                    <p>FYI I had mulitiple issues with OneDrive on my laptop after installing the version 1809 update.&nbsp; Those issues included getting stuck in sync loop, missing thumbnails, and error messages regarding linking to Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ended up using HP's paid support.&nbsp; They resolved all issues by setting up a new user on my laptop and re-downloading all files from the OneDrive cloud.&nbsp; After that, we transferred all non-OneDrive files/folders from the "old corrupt" user to the new user,
 and deleted the old user account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything works perfectly now.</p>

<h2>            MS Office Standard 2016 on Windows 10 won&#39;t hold the activation - product key is correct</h2>
                    I have installed and reinstalled MS Office 2016 on my Dell Inspiron running Windows 10 but when I go to activate it the product key looks like it is valid but when I open any of the apps it tells me it is not activated.&nbsp; I have tried to repair it several
 times as well.&nbsp; Tried to activate from both within a program and through the contol panel.&nbsp; I have done the registry edit and removed the OEM key (found info online and had no idea what I was doing)&nbsp; I have called support and they have confirmed that it is
 a correct product code and keep giving me to different support people to try the same things.&nbsp; The last person I spoke with told me that I would have to go to a higher level of support and when she sent me to the website it wants to charge me $500+ for assistance.&nbsp;
 Anybody have any other ideas before I have to pay more for help than I did for the software?&nbsp; (purchased through TechSoup as a non-profit discount)

            Don't bother paying for extra support. Unless it is really inside MS, not a 3rd party provider, it is very unlikely that they can help with this problem.  Since the problem is with activation, you will have to work with the activation system. ONLY MS employees have access to that. 
<br />
<br />I just want to confirm, Office 2016 Standard is a one-time payment license, NOT a 365 keep paying forever "subscription", right?
<br />
<br />All Office 2016 licenses/subscriptions are supposed to associated with an email account. So the first thing to try is to see if that has happened during earlier activation attempts. 
<br />
<br />.  *  log in  to the MyAccount site <a href="http://office.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.com/myaccount</a> 
<br />.  *  Look to see if there is the Office 2016 license recorded there (see the link below)
<br />
<br />Stuff you can Do in MyAccount: Install / Deactivate / Transfer / Offline Installer / Downgrade
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/wiki/msoffice_install-mso_win10/stuff-you-can-do-in-myaccount-install-deactivate/3018f88b-d838-4cbf-afa4-e40e5a4f21cc?auth=1">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/wi...</a> 
<br />
<br />This page shows how to install Office AFTER the license has been activated.  It also shows a few other things you can do in the MyAccount site.
<br />
<br />*********************************************
<br />
<br />.  *  If your Office 2016 license IS associated with your email account then go to the following page and use the "Fix It" in Method 2 to uninstall all copies of Office currently installed on your computer (check in Control Panel &gt; Programs and Features)
<br />.  *  Then re-install Office from inside the MyAccount page.
<br />
<br />UNINSTALL OFFICE 2016 / 365 – 2007 AND MAC
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/uninstall-office-from-a-pc-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/uninst...</a> 
<br />Method 1: Uninstall from Control Panel
<br />Method 2: Uninstall using Fix it
<br />Note: If you are using a 64-bit operating system, save the fixit tool on the system and then run it from the saved location. 
<br />Method 3: Remove manually
<br />Method 2 in this tip does a more thorough job that the “normal” uninstall via Programs and Features (aka Method 2 in the tip). The Normal uninstall is designed with the assumption that you will be re-installing Office. It does NOT delete everything. It leaves configuration files like NORMAL.DOTM and other templates etc. and it also leaves configuration Registry entries. These “carry-overs” may contain corruption that is causing your problem.
<br />•	Boot the computer. After the restart go to <a href="http://office.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.com/myaccount</a> to re-install Office 365.
<br />•	<a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/uninstall-microsoft-office-2013-365" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/uninstall-microso...</a> - This page is a “how-to” on using 27390501 and has screen captures of the whole uninstall process
<br />NOTE: BEFORE you start the uninstall, if you have an “Office 2013” bundle make sure you have your 25 character product key. 
<br />If you have an “Office 365” bundle, make sure you can access the MyAccount page

<br />If that doesn't work, try doing a 'Phone Activation'.  The support people there are "specialists" in activation problems. They probably can do a better, FREE, job of helping with your problem.
<br />
<br />ACTIVATION PHONE SUPPORT - PHONE ACTIVATE
<br />If you have an activation specific error, ie things like “invalid” or “blocked” product key, you specifically have to contact the “phone activation” support reps.  Apparently “normal” support has no way of transferring you to them … &lt;sigh&gt; 
<br />The process you need to follow is rather round about:
<br />•	Start normal activation, 
<br />•	select phone activation option, 
<br />•	this will display appropriate phone number for your geographic location.
<br />•	Phone them
<br />•	do NOT reply to initial prompts
<br />•	wait, a long time, until you are offered the option of talking to a “service” rep
<br />•	explain problem to them
<br />•	ask to be transferred to a supervisor when front line support can’t help you

<br />The problem started in the fall of 2016. In Jan 2017 a MS staffer provided the following excuse. But the problem still exists! MS oops’d, and just hasn’t bothered to fix the problem for much too long.  Go to then link below to get the correct phone number for your specific geographic location

<p>Thanks for the info but it doesn't help.&nbsp; I purchased this through Tech Soup and so downloaded the software from Microsoft Volume Licensing.&nbsp; There is no email attached and it is NOT an online product.&nbsp; There is no activation wizard and no prompt to activate
 by phone.&nbsp; What I do get everytime that I open an office product is a notice to "Activate Office" and instead of entering the email or phone, I try the "Enter Product Key instead" and use that.&nbsp; It seems to work and opens a blank sheet/document but then a
 yellow box comes up and says that it isn't activated.</p>

            I have exactly the same problem and can only sympathise with you. Its so annoying!! Even got it installed and licensed and working fine by using a combination of the registry hacks, deleting all MSOffice products and not licensing until after Windows/Office
 updates; then two weeks later added a new user and the problem re occured, so it's embedded in the OEM Win10 deployment which forces you to trial Office 365 and refuses to be removed.

            It seems MyAccount doesn't recognize Activation keys obtained through Volume Licencing so don't understand why you have asked this, apart from you being part of this very annoying circle of frustration.&nbsp;

<p>It worked!</p>
<p>
</p><p>On further reflection, I think the problem is related to the Office 365 setup files shipped with most new PCs.</p>
<p>If the setup wizard is started by mistake, and even if the installation is cancelled, Windows appears to continue downloading various files in background and leaves fragments behind if the normal uninstall is done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once another version is installed with those invisible fragments present, Office still sees them and insists on trying to activate, taking no notice of the key it said was successfully installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The uninstall tool does seem to get rid of everything and after a restart all appears to be well and the activation using the product key works properly.</p>

    <title>Mail For Exchange 404 Error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> besboy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mail For Exchange 404 Error</h2>
                    I was going to add to one of the other threads but I doesn't look like they are specific to my problem. I am a long time ActiveSync user with MANY Windows Mobile devices and just switched to the E71. When attempting to sync for the first time, I receive
 a "Connection error. Try again later." message. The admin log details this as a 404 not found. I receive the same error on RoadSync but 7 mail works without a problem. Following every thread on the internet I can find, here is what I have done so far:<br />
<br />
-Installed the certificate from my company's OWA page (its a public cert anyway)<br />
-Surfed to the OWA page directly from the phone without issue (rules out the SSL certificate issue)<br />
-Used both an AT&amp;T and Tmobile SIM as well as connected directly to multiple home WiFi spots (and no proxy's).<br />
-Wiped out the phone several times (*#7370#)<br />
-Verified the Windows Mobile phones can still sync from scratch with no problems with both SIM's using the same exact settings.<br />
-When I navigate to https://server/Microsoft-Server-Activesync (using the real url) it responds with the 501 not implemented error that it should.<br />
-Used the direct IP of the OWA site and accepted the certificate mismatch.<br />
<br />
So to sum it up, I am using exactly the same server settings and credentials with 7 mail and Windows Mobile that I am on RoadSync and M4E. I'm a domain admin at a VERY large company but not the exchange admin. No security policies could ever be changed by him
 without a signoff by the CIO so I have to make it work as is. I love Nokia and hate Windows Mobile but I must be able to get push email or I will have to go back to the dark side. Anybody have any other thoughts? Thanks in advance.

            No ideas? Back to Blackberry and its ability to sync folders I guess. Nokia needs to stick to its N series and its sad attempt to compete against the iPhone. Their business phone line is a joke.

            You've done a good job troubleshooting this and it seems like strange problem. First I've heard of this anyway.<br />
<br />
Can you tell me:<br />
<br />
- Are you using the servername only, without M-S-A, in the name, meaning only the "server" portion in https://server/Microsoft-Server-Activesync?<br />
<br />
If not, our client is appending another M-S-A, meaning it's looking for<br />
<br />
https://server/Microsoft-Server-Activesync/Microsoft-Server-Activesync<br />
<br />
which is not valid and will result in 404.<br />
<br />
- Also try not using the domain namein domain setting (leave it blank). This is optional in MfE. I've seen this solve problems in some unusual cases.

            Yup, I've encountered the same 404 error problem and it seems to be occurring quite frequently as well, see for example
<a href="http://www.e-series.org/archives/404" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.e-series.org/archives/404</a><br />
<br />
The strange part is that my calendar can sync with the server (so I guess my credentials are correct), but email just doesn't sync. Everything was fine until I accidentally erased my profile, and now despite factory resetting the phone and reinstalling MfE
 I still can't get it to work.<br />
<br />
I'm at wit's end. Please help!!

            I've reinstalled MFE 2.3.0, and the 404 error has gone away!<br />
<br />
Both MFE 2.7 and 2.5.5 reported the 404 error even though I used the same profile settings that I'm now using with MFE 2.3.0

<h2>            &#34;Block&#34; option in Junk folder no longer works</h2>
                    I continually get spam email for annuities, keto diets, refinancing, Fedex packages not claimed, life insurance, window replacement ... the list goes on and on. I even get several a week with my own email address on them! These go to my Junk folder as
 they should. Up until this past week, I have been able to "Block" these senders with the click of a button. Now, I get a message that pops up stating "Cannot perform this action on your mailbox (email address)." I can delete them but, I can no longer block
 these senders. I realize there are probably hundreds of blocked addresses in a file or folder somewhere that has grown out of control through the years but still ... I don't appreciate all the "Junk" I get through snail mail in my home mailbox any better ...
 but, I thought spam filters were in place to get rid of all this senseless useless crap thousands of people receive daily.

</p><p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)">
My company has been purchasing many MS Office Home &amp; Student edition in retail box sets like this to supply to end users. This particular one was installed and been running on a Windows 10 PC for a few months until the PC ran into some problem recently where
 we had to format and reinstall the OS plus everything else.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)">
When we tried reinstalling the Office using this product key originally used and activated on this very same PC, it wasn't successful. So we contacted MS support for help - SR#1369756918. Only to our dismay, the support personnel told us that the key we used
 was a pirated key and hence blocked by MS activation server. We tried to explain how the very same key had been activated successfully the first time and been running fine on the same PC hardware, with regular software updates downloaded from MS. MS support
 repudiated and insisted that it is a pirate copy and refused to assist any further.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)">
I argued and demanded an explanation of how the key could be activated successfully the first time if it was a pirated copy, and why MS did not make any attempt to notify the user knowing it was not a genuine copy of software. The only response given by support
 is, they do not have to explain any further to us. As it is not MS responsibility that we have non genuine software running on our PC, and users are supposed to report to MS for non-genuine software that they have used.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)">
Support claimed it is not their problem, and that I should go back to look for the seller I got the software from. But MS, as I explained, we have been buying many of such similar retail box sets for different end users every now and then, and we bought different
 batches from different sellers. Since the software was activated successfully the first time many months ago, we assumed it was a valid purchase and did not keep track of the seller anymore. We insisted on genuine software and never accepted any shady or unfamiliar
 packaging. MS, if you think that is not good enough, and insisted that we should only buy from MS direct, please make a public statement, so that we consumers would learn.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)">
MS, we as your customers, have paid the full price in support of your products. We understood the importance of running&nbsp; genuine software, and we expected your system to be able to detect for any software anomaly or unauthorised alteration, and inform us in
 the first instant preemptively, in this modern computing era where every devices is connected. Isn’t that your purpose of implementing the current product activation check? You required an ID, and a connection to your server so that you knew who to contact,
 and maintained a checksum communication with all your software in the field. If you are saying this system of yours is failing, and we cannot rely on it to give us the correct status and feedback, then you are directly exposing your customers to malware and
 other security threats.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)">
If we would not have needed to reinstall the Office on this PC, and calling up your support, we would never knew the copy we running was invalid and an exposure. Do you expect every of your customers to call up your support to check if their software are safe
 and valid despite successful activation? If yes, please make a public statement too so that we learn.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>We have had a few large meetings with over 50 people in a webinar and I've noticed the conversation history was not saving to outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to&nbsp;access the conversation history from a skype meeting?&nbsp; Many people are typing at once and the conversation window scrolls past quickly and the&nbsp;buffer is quickly erased.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes I know there is a record meeting function, but besides that, where can I locate conversation history for potential security concerns or audit reasons?</p>
<p>

</p><p>After some testing, it turns out the conversation history is indeed saving to outlook.&nbsp; The problem is I have to have no chat activity for 39mins in the meeting before it will save to outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to waste your time on this Hans.&nbsp; Perhaps what i'm really looking for is a timeout setting for archiving.&nbsp; If I leave the meeting immediately, it does not save to outlook.</p>

            Yes, but when you create or record a macro, you can specify where it will be stored. The default setting is to store it in Normal.dotm, even if you have opened another template for editing. It's easy to forget selecting your template as the one to store
 the macro in.
