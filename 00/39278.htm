<h2>            Computer randomly shuts down then boots up to Recovery</h2>
                    <p>My Alienware R7 which I had received not too long ago randomly shuts down then boots up to Recovery mode where the message<strong>
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">"It looks like windows did not load properly"</span></strong> shows every time.<strong> I have reformatted my hard drives, reinstalled Windows and have scanned/updated my drivers and
</strong>hardware. I am currently on Windows 10 and I had received my desktop with a dual drive SSD and an HDD. The OS is installed on the SSD. I have updated my drivers from GPU, CPU, Hard Drives as well as Windows Update to this post's date&nbsp;<strong><em>13-01-2018.&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S: I have used <strong>Alienware's Support</strong> to scan my hardware as well as the command prompt. both of which gave me no errors to my system. I have used the
<strong>Windows' Defragment software</strong> and found nothing wrong with my hard drives or my system as a whole.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea what is going on with my Alienware R7 or Windows 10 as this has happened prior to reinstalling Windows 10 and after reinstalling it. I will contact DELL as well to see what is the issue, but to this date, I am clueless to what is happening
 to my system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You,</p>
<p>

            Hi JSN, I am Rob, a volunteer and a 10 time and dual award MVP specializing in Windows troubleshooting and Bluescreen analysis. Please remember as volunteers we are not responsible for the development of Windows or the computer hardware and drivers. 
<br /> 
<br />Definitely contact Dell, especially since the system is still under warranty.
<br />
<br />Since you have re-installed Windows it sure sounds like a hardware issue.
<br />
<br />If there are any of the below (DMP files or event viewer entries please post them so I can analyze them.
<br />
<br />Is there anything in C:\Windows or C:\Windows\minidump with a DMP extension such as memory.dmp or a minidump?
<br />
<br />=====
<br />
<br />Anything in Event Viewer at the time of the crash?
<br />
<br />Start - type in --&gt; Event Viewer ......find at top and click on it.

<br />FullEventLogView - Free is a simple tool for Windows 10/8/7/Vista that displays in a table the details of all events from the event logs of Windows, including the event description. It allows you to view the events of your local computer, events of a remote computer on your network, and events stored in .evtx files. It also allows you to export the events list to text/csv/tab-delimited/html/xml file from the GUI and from command-line.

<br />
<br />TIP  : Options - Advanced Options - allows you to see a time frame instead of the whole file - set it to a bit before and after the time of the EVENT.
<br />
<br />Please let us know the results and if you need further assistance.

<p>Hi JSN C. I had the same problem. I received my new Dell Inspiron 15 7000 7567 Gaming Series about a month ago and it worked fine for about 2 weeks, then it started to shut down randomly when I was watching videos on YouTube or playing video games. I tried
 to reset the PC (it said that it reinstalled Windows), to update all the drivers but nothing seemed to work... so I decided to call the technical support, and they told me to download the tool "MediaCreationTool.exe" that you can find here : https://www.microsoft.com/fr-ca/software-download/windows10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you've downloaded it, launch it and choose the "Update this PC now" option. It will update Windows 10 and reinstall it (it can take up to 3 hours so be patient and plug your laptop).&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've done it and now I don't have the problem anymore. Everything is working well. No more random shut down!</p>
<p>Hope it's helping. Good luck.</p>

    <title>Headset Microphone Not Working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pixelpoc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Headset Microphone Not Working</h2>
                    <p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently I got a gaming headset but upon plugging in the headset my microphone jack, I realized my computer was not picking up audio from the headset mic. I have looked through other forums but I still cannot find a solution to this problem. I have looked
 at the sound settings and saw that under the recording category, It shows a second microphone device that is only accessible by plugging in my headset. But when doing so I've noticed that when talking into my headset mic the recordings menu does not show any
 signs of sound. But if I tap my headset the sound meter goes up. This makes me think that my computer only picks up sounds around the headset and not the mic itself.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Other Info</p>
<p>1) For my sounds, video and game controllers in the Device Manager I have High Definition Audio Device and Intel(R) Display Audio listed.</p>
<p>2) I have a windows 7 upgraded to windows 10</p>

            Hi,  
<br /> 
<br />I'm Diego Rios, an Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers.  
<br />
<br />Please try the following procedures:
<br />
<br />Try to run the Apps troubleshooter to fix issues that may prevent app from working properly in the link below:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027498/windows-10-run-the-troubleshooter-for-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/402749...</a>
<br />
<br />1. Check your speaker settings:
<br />Right-click the sound icon at the bottom right corner of your desktop and click Playback devices.
<br />In the Playback tab, ensure there’s a green tick on Speakers. This indicates that your speakers are the default playback device. 
<br />If your Speakers are NOT already set as the default, this is doubtless your problem. To fix, just click them, click Set Default, then click OK and test whether you have sound.
<br />If your Speakers are set as the default playback device, and you’re still not hearing any sound, you should to do this &gt;&gt; click Speakers then Properties &gt;&gt; Go to the Advanced tab, and in the Default Format section, select a different sample rate and bit depth, then click Test. Repeat this process until you find a format that works, then click OK. 
<br />
<br />2, If the step above didn't work, I suggest to Uninstall your audio driver.
<br />On your keyboard, press the Windows logo key  and X (at the same time) to invoke the quick-access menu, then  Click Device Manager.
<br />In Device Manager, expand Sound, video and game controllers,
<br />right-click on your sound card, and click Uninstall.
<br />Restart your computer and check to see if the problem is resolved.
<br />
<br />3. If these steps didn't fix the issue, I suggest to Up Date the driver from the manufacture web site.
<br />
<br />Also, You can try the following procedures in the links below:

<br /> 
<br />Please let me know if this helped and works.  
<br />
<br />Best Regards,
<br />

<p>No rotation lock button may indicate that the driver for that sensor is not working proper.</p>
<p>You can go into Device Manager and uninstall the Hid Sensor Collection V2 driver under Sensors, reboot allowing the sensor driver to reinstall. &nbsp;It's worth a shot before you perform a reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also want to run the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=46703" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Surface Diagnostic Tool Kit&nbsp;</a>.&nbsp; The specific test is the "Device orientation test" which will verify if the Rotation sensor is working.</p>

    <title>Mouse&#39;s Left-Click Breaks in Fullscreen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bipen1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mouse&#39;s Left-Click Breaks in Fullscreen</h2>
                    <div>
<div>
<p>Whenever I launch something in full screen, my (wireless Logitech) mouse's left-click gets completely ruined.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I first noticed this when I ran the game "Rocket League", thinking it was specific to that game. Whenever I tried to get a boost in the game (which, by default, is VIA pressing and holding left click), it required constant spamming of the left-click button
 before (potentially) working. There's no constant number of clicks for it to work either. Weirdly enough, the menu worked just fine with left-clicks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This started happening in any and all other applications I ran in full screen too. I've tried using this mouse on other computers and they all worked fine (granted they were not Windows 10-based), and I've tried other mouses on this computer and they've
 all had the same problem. :l</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any potential fixes to this? Thanks in advance. :]</p>

            <p>Hi Arun!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for helping! :]</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried both methods and they didn't work, and so I fiddled around a bit more. Turns out it wasn't a software problem
<strong>or</strong> peripheral device issue. It was my laptop's USB ports. Both the ports on the right side led to this issue. The mouse and anything else connected works fine until I run something in full screen. (Pretty weird, right?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The final of the three USB ports, on the far left, works perfectly. I avoided using that port before because it didn't even occur to me that the ports might've been broken. The left port is where I plugged in my cooling pad, too, so it's this means I can't
 have both a functional left-click and a cooling pad at the same time, which is a bummer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, overall, the issue was my USB ports. Thanks for the assistance! :]&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<p>I have the same problem. I bought a new computer with Win 10 in it. I had to call TWC to enter the required info in Mail. They would get it and each time I try to get back in Mail, it tells me there is nothing there or it tells me to re-enter password that
 TWC entered in it and it tells me incorrect password.</p>
<p>When I do get it, there is no way to create folders as I had in Win 7, I believe Outlook.</p>
<p>I have to delete e-mails one at a time in Mail and not as previous where I highlight first and last, then hit Shift and deleted all.</p>
<p>When I hit delete, it doesn't do anything at times.</p>
<p>There is no way to empty deleted items from the deleted and spam folders as in the old.</p>
<p>Microsoft should be ashamed to put out this garbage on the public.</p>

<h2>            Acer laptop only powers on when plugged in an doesn&#39;t charge</h2>
                    I purchased an acer aspire 3 a315-51-3879 just over a month ago. The charger wouldn't charge the laptop so I purchased a new charger with the same specifications which is working as it starts the laptop up however the laptop would not charge anymore. I
 am guessing there is a problem with the laptop now as it would only power on when the charger is plugged in. I need my laptop ASAP so that I can do my college work so are there any ways I could solve this without having to send it to acer to sort out whatever
 is wrong with it?

<br />8. I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

<h2>            Xbox Adaptive Controller set up</h2>
                    I set my adaptive controller up when I got it a few days ago but something occurred &amp; now it is all messed up. &nbsp;I’d like to set it up so that the right pad controls the left thumb stick and when I click. &nbsp;I set it up and it was working great. &nbsp;I must not
 have saved it to a profile, thought it would just save it to itself. &nbsp;When I go in and set the left pad to be left thumbstick and to click left pad, instead of holding it. &nbsp;I then try to exit but it tells me the A button must be assigned. &nbsp;I don’t want the
 A button assigned. &nbsp;I want my controllers A button to work. &nbsp;I have assigned it, just to get out, assuming that since copilot is engaged that both would work but it does not work- the trackpad is A and my controller’s A button doesn’t work. &nbsp;Can some nice
 gamer out there help me to figure out how to do the things set out. &nbsp;Also, what is the best speed to use on the trackpad for FPS avatar movement? &nbsp;I don’t want to b

<p>Hi there Warrior,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the update on the issue with mapping the Adaptive controller. As mentioned by the Ambassador, the A button will need to mapped.
<span>The controller by design will need the A and B button to navigate on the Xbox Operating system.</span> I recommend checking out the accessories :&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/collections/XboxadaptiveControllerAccessories?SilentAuth=1&amp;wa=wsignin1.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox
 Adaptive Controller accessories</a>.&nbsp;</p>

            I received a replacement adaptive controller. &nbsp;Can someone help me because I, nor MS store help can help me figure out how to have the right trackpad act as the left thumb stick. &nbsp;Iv’ve reset my console because I can’t get it mapped successfully, &nbsp;where
 tye regular controller performs every task except the left thumb stick &amp; the adaptive controller connects &amp; click pad clicks thumb stick. &nbsp;This is all I need but Idk what’s going on because my controls get messed and when I click the trackpad, it jumps like
 the A button. &nbsp;Also, for 99.9% of the time I play FPS games. &nbsp;I’m guessing aggressive or straight are best for the speed curve for the stick but wanted input to which was better/advantages: straight or aggressive. &nbsp;

            I have a new adaptive controller and have the adaptive joystick plugged into the usb on the left side of the &nbsp;adaptive controller, yet the joystick will not control the left thumbstick in any direction. &nbsp;This is my 2nd adaptive controller keyboard and
 first joystick ( first thought pads on adaptive controller were touch pads). &nbsp;I’m hoping someone else has had this issue and is an easy fix. &nbsp;I turn the adaptive controller on first, then my regular controller. &nbsp;I’m praying this is not a second return of the
 adaptive controller or a first of the joystick.

            Ok, so I finally have everything set up, except one thing- I have the thumb stick joystick adapter plugged into the left usb port of the pad. &nbsp;The controller functions as it should, except when I click the adaptive thumb stick, it does not function to
 click the left thumb stick, which it controls. &nbsp;Is there a way to do this, or must I find another way to click the left thumb stick?

            Sorry, asking again if there’s a way to set the adaptive joystick up so that when I click the adaptive joystick, the left thumb stick ( which it is plugged into the left usb port) will act as if I clicked the left thumb stick. &nbsp;I saw &nbsp;something in settings
 to set as shift but am not sure what that is. &nbsp;So if anyone knows how to set the adaptive joystick to click the left thumb stick, please let me in on the secret. &nbsp;They really left a lot of options out. &nbsp;They obviously didn’t work close with people with disabilities,
 as why would you want a joystick that doesn’t function exactly as the thumb stick you’re replacing/taking over.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>I have Hp Compaq 2710p which &nbsp;i recently upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10 pro. Ever since the upgrade, i can't use the handwriting feature. I have read several suggestions but none of them worked. The On-Screen Touch Keyboard option is not selectable.
 The Handwriting Personalization/Recognizer works perfectly. The Handwriting Panel that converts Handwriting to text is not active. But i can write on some Apps such as One-Note, Word and Note pad. Right now, i'm short of ideas.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Itunes not working</h2>
                    ITunes is not working on my computer. I have
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Go to Device Manager</p>
<p>2. Locate your Apple device (mine was under Portable Devices. It's very possible it's somewhere else for you.)</p>
<p>3. Right click it and select "Update Device Driver."</p>
<p>4. Navigate to C:\Program Files\Common Files\Apple\Mobile Devices\Support\Drivers and select that folder</p>
<p>5. Hit next. The driver should install and you'll see "Apple Mobile Device USB Driver" under the "Universal Serial Device USB Driver" section in Device Manager.</p>
<p>But doing that did work because when I got to the second step my iPhone wasn't there. I have also tried plugging in other phones (not mine to see it was my phone).But the computer knows that there is a phone there but not iTunes.</p>
<p>I have also deleted ITunes from the computer completely and it still doesn't work.
</p>
<p>I think there could be a folder or file that is needed that was deleted. </p>
<p>MS me if you think you know of how to fix it.</p>

</p><p>Upon carefully checking&nbsp;the account you have used in signing in to the community, we confirmed that you have active minutes bundled with the Office 365 subscription. With regards to the email you are receiving every month. This is only to inform you that

<p>
</p><p>These free minutes bundled with the Office 365 subscription is renewed every month which is also the reason why you receive such notifications. Since your subscription is due to expire every 8th of the month, you will be receiving an email notification that

<p>Hi Benjie</p>
<p>The email as is is misleading and must be stopped. I would understand to get an email if my 60 min/month expired or are about to. Otherwise there s no point to it as no action would be required. Please elevate this up to the authority able to change this.
 Thanks and regards, George A.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>I recently updated my Sony vaio from windows 8 to windows 8.1 after tackling many issues with graphic card driver. finally the update was successful but my NVidia GeForce graphic card 740m drivers were&nbsp;uninstalled automatically. Now it shows that graphic
 card wasn't detected.</p>
<p>What I want to ask is should I download and install the latest&nbsp;driver from NVidia website??? I'm afraid it will result into my system crash once again, or this driver is stable?? what do I do? please help!!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, Windows update shows a different version update for graphic card and NVidia site shows a more latest version&gt; which one do I go for? Which would be more stable?? I don,t want my system to crash again.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
I would absolutely recommend getting your drivers from Sony's website first as opposed to nVidia's. Never use Windows Update for updating drivers as the drivers are not the latest version and aren't updated often whatsoever. Don't use Device Manager either
 as Device Manager goes directly to the Windows Update servers.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />
Patrick<br />

<h2>            When using digital projector I only get an extended desktop</h2>
                    I am using a Dell Laptop running XP.&nbsp; I use it in a classroom with a digital projector.&nbsp; I can't get it to show the same one desktop on both screens.<br />
I have unchecked "Extend my desktop on this monitor" then I can switch the output to the projector but I can't get it onto both screens at the same time.&nbsp; When I have output to both screens, one is an extended desktop.

            Hello,<br />
Unfortunately, this one doesn't have "Graphic Properties" Right click on the desktop brings up Display Properties.<br />
In Display Properties setting, there is no external monitor choice only monitor 1 or monitor 2.<br />
In monitor 1 the choice of "extend my windows desktop" is grayed out.<br />
In monitor 2 the choice is not grayed out but also doesn't change the fact that it only shows as an extended desktop.&nbsp; I can toggle Fn + F8 to get the desktop onto the projection screen but repeated toggles still don't give the desktop onto both the laptop
 monitor and the projection screen.<br />
In the menu Advanced and Monito I have the choice of Plug and Play monitor or Default Monitor.<br />
Neither choice gives the desired result.<br />
In Display Properties there are the choices of:<br />
1. (Multiple Monitors) on Dell C840<br />
2. Plug and Play Monitor on Dell C840<br />
<br />
All software is updated through Windows update.<br />
<br />
Many Thanks,<br />

<p>I have exactly the same problem also with a Dell laptop using WinXP. I get the same result as jhesteratclemsonedu when using Display properties to switch out of extended back to mirrored display mode. I uncheck "extend my windows desktop.." and OK. That
 sets the system to single display, but as soon as I press Fn+F8 to turn the second monitor display back on the setup is back to extended desktop again.</p>
<p>On another laptop with Vista I can switch easily between mirrored and extended desktops using either Windows mobility center or the utility provided by the graphics manufacturer (nVidia). The Dell has ATI Radeon graphics with no similar utility supplied
 and XP appears to have no equivalent of Windows mobility center.</p>
<p>Can anyone suggest a way ahead?</p>

<p>After a lot of searching I eventually found a method that worked on a Dell Inspiron 9200 to get it out of extended desktop mode.</p>
<p>1. In Display Settings click on monitor 2 and uncheck Extend my window...</p>
<p>2. Click on monitor 1, then Advanced</p>
<p>3 That brings up the Radeon configuration window. Click on the Displays tab</p>
<p>4 Click on the button at top right corner of the icon for monitor 2. It goes red. Click Apply.</p>
<p>5 An error message appears "Your selected configuration is not available.....". Ignore it. Close it by pressing OK.</p>
<p>6 Click on the top right corner of monitor 2 again to turn off the red button. Click Apply again.</p>
<p>7 Step back in amazement. It's back to clone mode.&nbsp; Just OK to all windows to close them.</p>

<p>Maybe midmost's answer works IF you have an ATI display card... but for those of us with nVidia or Intel cards nada, no joy...&nbsp; I have been waiting for several YEARS now for an answer to the question of how to CLONE a desktop on multiple monitors, using
 different resolutions for each monitor. In the world of Linux it has been solved and works wonderfully but you may have to use a panning mode. One would think that after all these years Microsoft, nVidia, ATI, Intel etc would have solved this problem by now,
 there are SO MANY USERS complaining about it and wanting a solution, just do an Internet search and it will boggle your mind, that this is still an unsolved problem and questions on how to clone the desktop across multiple monitors go back for years with no
 solutions found.... Even midmost's answer, if indeed it works for ATI cards, is a crappy undiscoverable solution at best...</p>
Microsoft's answer from their knowledge base thinks that displaying a desktop on multiple monitors means to extend the desktop to multiple monitors. That IMHO is a weird interpretation of what it means to display the SAME desktop on multiple monitors, guess
 they are, as usual, trying to re-interpret the English language.. Sigh..

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I proposed that last post as an answer thinking I was able to "propose an answer".. oops. Anyway here's the answer for Dells with Intel graphics cards.. Follow the instructions above for the ATI card, but when you get to the advanced screen, you need to
 click on tab for the media driver. The tab on my Dell Latitude says "Intel Media Accelerator Driver for Mobile". Click on that, then click on graphics properties. Click the button under the display devices&gt;multiple display&gt; heading for Intel dual Display clone.
 Hit apply and ok/close all the screens to get back to teh desktop. Should work now, and should work with the Function+F8 (or screen changing key combination you have..)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

            That last solution doesn't work for me as on my Dell Inspiron 2650 the advance screen has no media driver tab.&nbsp; The GeForce2 card may be too old to support cloning/mirroring the screen to a projector.&nbsp; Any other suggestions?&nbsp; Thanks in advanced.&nbsp;

            I doubt that it is too old for clone mode. Cloning was around well before Extended desktop.<br />
I do sympathise with you though if you cannot find how to change back to Cloned mode (also variously called Mirrored or Duplicated) . The problem seems to persist even in Windows 7 where the Display settings dialog is able to switch into extended desktop by
 checking Extend my desktop.. but is not able to switch back to clone by unchecking it. It is always necessary to open the Graphics chip manufacturers own driver dialog and it is often not clear what you do then. I can only give you general hints based on having
 done it on a couple more computers since I wrote the earlier post.<br />
<br />
Your first step will be to find the tab that displays icons of the monitors. It may not be called the same as for other graphics cards but there will almost certainly be one somewhere.<br />
As far as I can make out it is usually first necessary to turn off monitor 2 because the settings cannot be changed out of Extended desktop until you have done so. If there is no button or checkbox try right clicking on the monitor 2 icon to see if there is
 a context menu with the option.<br />
You then have to find some way to tell monitor I to delete its setting for Extended desktop mode. Otherwise you will be straight back into it as soon as you turn monitor 2 back on again.
<br />
Again unless it is obvious how to do it try right clicking on the monitor 1 icon. It often takes a lot of persistence before you stumble upon the way to do it.<br />
<br />
While you are searching around look out for anywhere that allows you to save the configuration&nbsp; if&nbsp; you do succeed in setting it back to clone mode. You can often assign a keyboard shortcut to the saved configuration and it makes it so much easier to restore
 it next time.<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />

            Hi,  
<br /> 
<br />I'm Diego Rios, an Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers.  
<br />
<br />I suggest you to follow the troubleshooting methods listed below:
<br />
<br />1, Try to run the Apps troubleshooter to fix issues that may prevent app from working properly in the link below:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027498/windows-10-run-the-troubleshooter-for-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/402749...</a>
<br />
<br />In case didn't work, Please try the following procedures:
<br />
<br />1. Check your speaker settings:
<br />Right-click the sound icon at the bottom right corner of your desktop and click Playback devices.
<br />In the Playback tab, ensure there’s a green tick on Speakers. This indicates that your speakers are the default playback device. 
<br />If your Speakers are NOT already set as the default, this is doubtless your problem. To fix, just click them, click Set Default, then click OK and test whether you have sound.
<br />If your Speakers are set as the default playback device, and you’re still not hearing any sound, you should to do this &gt;&gt; click Speakers then Properties &gt;&gt; Go to the Advanced tab, and in the Default Format section, select a different sample rate and bit depth, then click Test. Repeat this process until you find a format that works, then click OK. 
<br />
<br />2, If the step above didn't work, I suggest to Uninstall your audio driver.
<br />On your keyboard, press the Windows logo key  and X (at the same time) to invoke the quick-access menu, then  Click Device Manager.
<br />In Device Manager, expand Sound, video and game controllers,
<br />right-click on your sound card, and click Uninstall.
<br />Restart your computer and check to see if the problem is resolved.
<br />
<br />3. If these steps didn't fix the issue, I suggest to Up Date the driver from the manufacture web site.
<br />
<br />Also, You can try the following procedures in the links below:

<br /> 
<br />Please let me know if this helped and works.  
<br />
<br />Best Regards,
<br />
<br />Diego R.

<h2>            quicken won&#39;t install, error code 1601</h2>
                    <p>I am having problems installing Quicken on my Vista home basic machine.&nbsp; I am contiually being told that there is a problem with the MS installer, error code 1601.&nbsp; I have looked for the folder under msconfig and it does not exist.&nbsp; i was recently told by
 the tech at Intuit that i should open a new user account and install it there.&nbsp; i did open a new account, but can not change users. When i click on the change user button it appears to go through the motions but that is all, it will not let me log on as a
 different user.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Any help will be greatly appreciated., thanks</p>

<h2>            Trying to access local resources in RDS session, only 1 user&#39;s resource shows</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to set up an app to be able to copy files to an RD user's local drive.&nbsp; I have the user's Remote Desktop options set to make their C: drives available to the RD session on two remote computers.&nbsp;&nbsp;When&nbsp;I&nbsp;log on to the server from one remote computer,
 I can see&nbsp;its C: drive in the left pane of Windows Explorer.&nbsp; When I log on with the second one, however, the C: drive from that computer isn't shown, and I can't access it.</p>
<p>My app will have more than one concurrent user most of the time, and some of the programs need to send data back to their respective local computers.&nbsp; Is there something that I'm missing, or is there another way to accomplish this programmatically or by
 command line copys?</p>
