            I see many people like me who used Equation Editor now are having trouble to display/edit the old files with the stuff from Equation Editor. If
<span>Equation </span>has some security issues, then just fix them! I don't see the point why MS should have removed it! Because MS doesn't want to pay more money to the third party company? I guess. But before MS came out with something similar of
 its own, Equation Editor should remain!!!

</p><p>I have some math stuff written in Equation 3.0 in my old Word files. I didn't try to modify them for long until recently. When I tried to modify them, Word says something that this Equation is not supported anymore.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My point is that this is not enough! Word should give more info of what's the replacement and how to get it and what common issues and their solutions. Even better, just keep the same interface and have a smooth transfer from the old Equation to the new
 one! Just like you can convert between pdf and doc, I don't think that it's too difficult to convert the math stuff of old Equation to be readable and editable by the new MS built-in equation.</p>

<p>The new equation editor only works for Word documents saved in the *.docx format. The older *.doc format does not support it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said, if you want to, you can install MathType which is fully compatible with the old Equation 3 (they are provided by the same company).</p>

<p>MS bought the Equation Editor program from someone else, 15 or more years ago.&nbsp; Since then they lost the source code, so they can't fix it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the original problem was announced, some die hard hacker was able to hack in to the executable program and make a fix.&nbsp; But it was just dumb luck that they could find enough space to squeeze the fix in.&nbsp; Unfortunately, after the initial bugs were fixed,
 people found some more bugs. Those subsequent bugs could not be fixed.</p>

<p>The issue is that Microsoft Word was using a licensed cut-down version of MathType to edit equations. &nbsp;That license ran out, so they can no longer legally include MathType in their product.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft instead uses the new PC-version of Microsoft Equation in Word 2016. &nbsp;That software cannot edit Equation 3.0 artifacts</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am told that if you install MathType from design Science, both will continue to work.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Installation Issues</h2>
                    Hi,&nbsp;<br />
I have an Asus ROG 20 and I have already tried installing Windows 10 twice and the same issue keeps happening. Ive asked around and it hasnt happened to anyone else, but after 30-32% of the process, the PC reboots and just goes to a blank black screen. No one
 else has had this trouble from the people I've asked and I want to know what may be causing it.&nbsp;<br />

<h3> neiljmac  say:</h3>
<h2>            Transfer of account billing from provider to customer for Office 365 account.</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>An friend of mine has an Office 365 business account, which he has been paying a hosting company for. The hosting company has changed their business model and are shutting down a number of small accounts, my friend's being one of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As he logs in to Microsoft online with an Office 365 login, does he actually have to go through the process of starting up with a new provider, or can he simply take on the billing for his Office 365 account, to be billed by Microsoft instead?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is possible, what is the procedure?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for your advice.</p>

<br />
<br />He just need to go to the buy services option as a Global Admin, buy the licenses and Microsoft will charge him.
<br />
<br />After that make sure that you add the new licenses to the users and you're good to go.

<p>
</p><p>I have read your reply in the Private Message tab. I am glad to hear that you are now able to send and receive emails on your mobile devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regard to your query about the Two-step verification, please be informed that it helps protect your account by making it more difficult for a hacker to sign in, even if they've somehow learned your password since it uses two ways to verify your identity,
 your password, and an extra security code. After you've turned it on, some apps (like the mail apps on some phones) or devices (like an Xbox or Windows Phone, for example) will show an incorrect password error as&nbsp;they can't prompt you to enter a security code
 when signing in. You'll need an app password before you can manage your account there. For more information, click

<p>Hello, I have a Lumia 920 and have downloaded offline maps for the three times I went on to vacations. However, to my surprise, the GPS did not work at all - I could not locate where I was at. I could locate myself only when I had wifi connections from the
 hotels (guess from AGPS), but once I left the hotels I was completely lost. I did not use roaming nor did I purchase cellular plans - I'm guessing the GPS might had worked if I had data. My GPS did not work either when I was hiking in my local town (I guess
 the cell signal was weak where I was...).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>So I thought my GPS unit was broken and went to Nokia shop for repair. The service guy just updated the firmware for me (after waiting 3 weeks...), and after testing I saw that it was still not working. So I called Nokia Support and the support person
 told me that Nokia Maps is not meant to work without wifi or data connection. Is that true? If it is, I feel very cheated by Nokia - they advertised offline Maps. Yes, I do have offline maps and yes I could actually see the map when I was on vacation - EXCEPT
 I HAD NO IDEA WHERE I WAS. I went to Taipei, Bangkok and Malyasia....I could find the cities in the Map and I could zoom in to see the streets, but did Nokia expect me to somehow find where I was??? And same thing when I was hiking in town...once I lost connection,
 I was lost...the location was stuck in the prev spot I was at, lucky my friend's iphone had a working GPS otherwise we would have got lost that time...</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So yea...can someone confirm if Lumia 920 GPS is not meant to work without WIFI/Cell data?</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Can confirm that it works without WiFi or Mobile Data ..</p>
<p>You may also have a look <u><strong><a href="http://conversations.nokia.com/2012/09/20/benchmarking-mobile-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HERE</a></strong></u></p>
<p><u><strong>&nbsp;</strong></u></p>
<p>BTW did you wait long enough to see if it gets the positional FIX ? If you have travelled to a far off distance from the place where GPS was used the last time, it may take a bit longer to get the location. Though should not be more than 10 minutes ...</p>

<p>So you mean Nokia support was wrong when the person said that wifi is required? He did mention that only "Drive" works without wifi (but i do remember trying that and it didn't work).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and yes i've waited for the GPS, but most of the time i was waiting while walking around. I have definately waited over 10mins while walking, but prob only ~5mins when standing still at one spot (not sure if huge diff). So is there an issue with my GPS?
 At this stage, I don't even know what answer I want...for one, I would like to have a GPS that works without wifi. But the dilemma is that I would hate going back to Nokia Support to fix the issue as the support is actually terrible in HK (<span>I actually
 really regret buying this phone because of that, seems Nokia does not care about the market or customers here - altho the rest of the phone is great). I guess I'll test it out on my next vacation and hope all goes well...if not, do you know if support is global?
 Like if I travel to another country for a couple weeks, will I be able to get it fixed there?</span></p>
<p>Thanks in advance!!!<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>I have the same model with you, Nokia 920 and I bought it in Vietnam in January. I came to Finland for study then to France for an exchange. HERE Maps works all the time for me and it can navigate my position very well even without any wifi (and I didn't
 even have a SIM card when I first arrived in France a month ago). There is a problem, though, is that it seems not to be working when I'm using some means of transport (trams, trains,...) if there is no internet connection. Normally (when you walk or riding
 bikes), I can assure you that HERE Maps works really good, navigation and all, WITHOUT WIFI, at least in cities since I cannot be sure about mountainous areas (for where you go hiking).&nbsp;<br />
Therefore, don't be upset and contact Nokia without hesitation if your phone has defect, you should have a good one with the money you paid them. (I remembered being told that within one year from the time of the purchase,&nbsp;they can give me a total new phone&nbsp;<span>if
 the one I bought has problem. Nevertheless, it has to be in the same country you bought your phone from...).&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Hi <strong>Lakshitha</strong>,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Office Online services</strong> can be used anywhere for you to <strong>
create</strong>, <strong>edit</strong>, and <strong>share</strong> a file or document even without the installed desktop applications. Regarding your concern, copying data from Excel Online to Outlook Mail Online will result in a plain text as it was designed
 that way. Office Online has its own basic features and functionalities. Also, if you’ll be needing a concrete way of copying data together with its exact format, we recommend that you use the
<strong>desktop version of Office</strong> to get the exact outcome that you wanted to achieve.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We’re just here if you need further help.</p>

                    Some of my Facebook contacts has gone away from people hub.<br />
But they show on web and the FB app.<br />
I also experience that some comments and posts are missing in the people hub? still they are shown correctly on web and app?<br />
<br />
Why are my Facebook settings not on my phone. I have blocked all game request and updates. They are not shown on web and app, but still they pop up on my people hub.<br />
<br />
I love my windows phone, but it is quite annoying that i cant trust what i see on the people hub!<br />

            <p><span>Hi Richard,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, I need to collect some information to analyze the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. What is your Exchange version?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2. Which migration are you doing? Cutover migration, staged migration, or hybrid move migration?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3. Is this the first time that you try to migrate this mailbox? If there is any failed migration for this user before, such error might occur.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>4. Let’s use PowerShell commands to get detailed migration information.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Get-MigrationBatch | fl</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Get-MoveRequest | fl</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Get-MigrationStatistics | fl</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Get-MigrationUserStatistics -Identity *** Email address is removed for privacy *** -IncludeReport | FL</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Get-MigrationUser *** Email address is removed for privacy *** | fl</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Note:
<strong>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</strong> is the problematic user. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To protect your privacy, I have sent a private message to request PowerShell results. Please use this link to access the private message and reply to it:

<h2>            internet explorer can only access certain sites.</h2>
                    <p>Ok, bear with me on this as I am new to in depth computer anything really. But I'm very good with instruction and research. Ive googled everything about this issue, and reset everything from security certificates to winsocket. Fortunately its XP and relatively
 simple for me to wrap my head around.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My issue, i can access bing, some msn based websites, and a handful of more private forum type sites. I cannot access google, i can access a handful of microsofts pages, and some others. BUT google is nonexistant. I updated to ie7 for xp thinking something
 in ie6 was corrupt or not set right. Now i know its in the setting of the computer or internet options, securities, something like that, that i must be overlooking. I have what seems to be an overwhelming amount of programs all related to internet connections.
 Broadcom (never heard of it, but again im new to this and now playing with outdated software.) broadcom asf configuration and broadcom control suite 2.&nbsp; CNSW client service for net ware? ive got a modem diagnostic the usual network connections, dell wireless
 wlan card setup, internal network card configuration. All of these are under the control panel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The little bit of history and things ive found it since purchasing it from craigslist. It was formerly in an office setting, on a large office network. Something has me thinking thats related somehow, havent found out how or where or what to possible change.
 The computer was apparently updated and wiped within 48hours of me buying it. I only have a system restore date to the day before i called the previous owner. I cannot go any further back in system restore.&nbsp; The last knows person logged into it beside the
 guy i got it from dates back to 2004 iirc. I dont have a restore disc for it, key for xp pro is on the underside.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Any advise is greatly appreciated. I just want the internet to work for basic browsing and driver downloads that sort of stuff. I cant even update xp right now because of this issue.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Yeah, that is the same thing they told me. They were going to "escalate" my case.
</p>
<p>But then after hearing nothing for three days, they closed my case and said I would have to reopen it again.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I figure after 15 days and 40 emails between MSN support and me,&nbsp;and they still&nbsp;could not get my account closed, another open case and another 15 days would not make any difference.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What I am saying is, either my email can be closed or can't be closed.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It&nbsp;has to be&nbsp;one of the two.</p>
<p>So which one is it?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>To be led on thinking that it can be closed when after 15 days and 40 emails, and still&nbsp;no closed account, it appears to me anyway that it can't.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>No matter how you look at it, this is poor customer service.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>And then to make matters worse, the moderators here keep encouraging the people here to keep on trying to close your account when it is clear to me anyway that to keep doing so is hopeless.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This is not help.</p>
<p>Help is help.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If your Outlook account can't be closed, why not just say so and be done with it?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Unless, of course there is a fundamental flaw in Outlook that MSN don't want you to know about and everything is being done to try to&nbsp;cover it up.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>May be something is really wrong with Outlook and there is a cover up going on so as not to cause a flood of people trying to bail out all at once.</p>
<p>Why is such a simple procedure made to be so complicated?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I sense something odd going on here.</p>

            <div>Well, I clicked the link below and it took me to a form to fill out that goes to a moderator.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I entered the @hotmail.com account that I wanted to close and a message popped up telling me I had to create and alias before I could close the account.&nbsp; (Microsoft just will not left you close an account that you no&nbsp; longer need).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>So, I created a new alias with: @outlook.com.&nbsp; I filled in a few more boxes and clicked closed.&nbsp; The @hotmail.com user ID was closed.&nbsp; So, I logged in with the new @outlook.com user ID.&nbsp; The old password from the @hotmail.com account
 worked with the new @outlook.com account.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>So, in effect, Microsoft didn't really close the @hotmail.com account, it was given a new name 'cause the old emails were still there, just under a new @outlook.com user name.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I don't need the new user ID @outlook.com because it is the same account with a new name.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I wanted to close the new @outlook.com account but I have to jump through the same hoops and the account still will not be close.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>After I submitted the form to the moderator, it stated they would respond in 24 hours.&nbsp; It's pass 24 hours and I haven't heard a thing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I don't know if all those other posters who wanted to close their @hotmail.com accounts and got the same error notice that I did, closed their accounts or not.&nbsp; They never replied back.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Microsoft is a pain trying to close and account.&nbsp; I guess I'll just say what the fox said when he couldn't reach the grapes: "The grapes are probably sour anyway".&nbsp; Microsoft is probably sour anyway!</div>

<p>This reply should go to him.&nbsp; I saw his link that he gave another user on how to close and account and I clicked it 'cause he says he is a MVP Wiki Author Community Moderator and I figured he knew how to close a account, but apparently he dosen't.</p>

<p>On his original post of December 12, 2013 he blocked out the: Reply, Reply with quote, Edit, so no one could reply to his answer.</p>

            <p>This follows&nbsp;the typical pattern.</p>
<p>This is how a person ends up just going round and round without result.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It seems that no one really knows and there really is not anyone in charge.</p>
<p>You really don't get any real&nbsp;answers, only suggestions.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>To then&nbsp;increase the confusion, different&nbsp;moderators suggest different suggestions for the same question.</p>
<p>Soon there are so many suggestions to solve so many questions that it is difficult to make any sense of anything.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Then when talking to MSN support, the same thing happens, different suggestions from different support staff to the same questions. You even get answers that don't even relate to the question.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As you can see, the result is you just keep going round and round until you finally give up in disgust.</p>
<p>Just look at this thread as proof of this.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Really, to close your account should be very simple, but it is not, no not at all, in fact I have yet to see anyone anywhere on this forum, so far do so.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This leads me to believe one thing and that is, YOU CAN'T!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>But for some unknown reason the moderators of this forum as well as MSN support continue to&nbsp;imply that you can.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Well if that is true, why can't I close my account?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I find this very strange indeed.</p>
<p>Well here is what I think is really going on.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>There is a fundamental flaw with Outlook and there is&nbsp;a combined effort of the moderators on this forum and MSN support to cover it up and make it look like it is the fault of the customer that Outlook don't work correctly.</p>
<p>Something is seriously wrong with Outlook and there is a active cover up in place to hide this.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Just look at this thread, look at all these posts on this forum&nbsp;with the same problem without&nbsp;result.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This is ridiculous.</p>

                    I was having problems with my HTC, the tiles were not coloring when set, it was&nbsp;recommended&nbsp;that I reset my phone,(too bad Verizon, it was really&nbsp;caused&nbsp;by the high contrast button), ANYWAY, now all apps and photos are gone though&nbsp;supposedly&nbsp;backed up....there
 is no obvious restore backed up data selection in any menu I can find...what a waste of my day...anybody know how to get this stuff back onto my phone? Or even how to download photos from Window live media?

            If you had backup activated before the factory reset, you should have gotten a restore prompt when initializing the phone with the same Microsoft Account. If you did not use the same Microsoft Account, reset your phone again and make sure you use the same
 account you previously used. There is no other way to trigger the restore of the backup.

"Went through tools"? What does that mean? If it means you tried changing the list of encryption and authentication protocols that IE should support (e.g. in Tools, Advanced tab, Security section) what did you try?</p>

<p>Unless you need to access a trusted website that uses unusual certificate settings, you should always use the default authentication settings for optimal security.<br />

    <title>being able to see open excel sheets on two different monitors - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> j. sci.  say:</h3>
<h2>            being able to see open excel sheets on two different monitors</h2>
                    
<p>I have two monitors hooked up to my computer so I can have multiple spreadsheets open and view them separately on both monitors to compare the figures. I am able to do this by going to</p>
<p>My Computer - Tools - Folder Options - File Types - Choosing XLS - Go to Advance - Uncehck "browse in same window" - Then highlight Open - Edit - and changing the application used to perform action to end in "%1" and removing the message in the DDE message
 box</p>
<p>The problem is every time office updates it goes back to the default settings and I have to do this all over again. Is there a way to lock these settings so this doesn't happen on each update? Or is there another way to move one spreadsheet off of the other
 so you can see both on separate monitors? I have to do this for each version of excel that I am using.</p>

            No. I usually have 5 or more opened at the same time and minimize them as I go between the different sheets or adjust the size of the sheet so I can get the information off of several sheets.

<br />
<div>
<p>All open workbooks are displayed within the Excel application window. If you maximize the workbook window within Excel, you can see only one workbook at a time, but you can easily switch between open workbooks by pressing Ctrl+F6 to activate the next one
 (or Shift+Ctrl+F6 to activate the previous one).</p>
<p>You can view two or more workbooks next to each other as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Activate the View tab of the ribbon. </li><li>Click Arrange All. </li><li>Select one of the options, then click OK. </li></ul>
<p>If you want to view workbooks on two screens, you'll have to start two separate instances of Excel. Start Excel, then Shift+click the Excel icon on the Windows taskbar to open a second instance, and drag the new window to the other screen (if it is maximized,
 un-maximize the window first).</p>

            Keep in mind that if you open two instances of Excel, copying and pasting between the two instances will be like copying and pasting between different applications. You'll lose some of the special features available when copying internally.

    <title>Excel after using Ctrl Y to redo an action, can&#39;t undo. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hengkuanwu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel after using Ctrl Y to redo an action, can&#39;t undo.</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question as subject. I open an excel and deleted a sheet. After working on other things for a while i came back to excel and i wanted the most recent change, so i pressed ctrl + y for a few times and press ctrl + s to save. Little did I know i deleted a
 few sheets, and pressing ctrl + z to undo does nothing. It says im already at the oldest change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I left the workbook alone in case there is some way to get the sheets back. Then I tested this on a new workbook and found out that YOU CAN'T UNDO (AN ACTION THAT WAS DONE BY (REDOING SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT UNDONE)).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What this means is that redo has 2 functions:</p>
<p>1) actual redoing - when you undo a few times, you can redo a few times to go back to latest action</p>
<p>2) repeat latest action - when you do an action, it repeats the last action you do each time you press it</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 2nd function cant be undone. At least for the 10+ times ive tested. So those sheets are gone forever once i saved it. So this is either a bug, or if there is a workaround can someone let me know?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: I just found out that the above only applies to creation and deletion of sheets. Normal actions that are repeated with ctrl + y can be undone.</p>
<p>Edit 2: Added brackets to (hopefully) make this clearer to future people with the same issues reading this.</p>

            Actually deleting sheet can't be undone even if you don't save it. The only thing in this case, you can do is to close your sheet and lose all changes done if you need to retrieve the deleted worksheet.
<br />
<br />However, you can right click on the file &gt; Properties &gt; Under Previous version, do you see any previous version. if yes, retrieve that.
<br />
<br />If you feel your findings are a bug, you should report this to Microsoft. 
<br />You should report this to Microsoft so that Microsoft developers should look into this. There are 2 ways to give this feedback -

                    <span>Hi everyone!<br />
<br />
Yesterday my Nokia N95 8GB (v31) suddenly having weird problem. It will shut down itself, without giving any notice. The shut down case happen when it run about 30 minutes. I suspect is battery problem, but during it was charging, the phone also auto shut down
 itself.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The weird part is after it auto shut down, it can't be boot up again, unless I manually take out the battery and wait for some time and put it back, then it only can boot again.<br />
<br />
Anyone here know what is the problem? It is battery or the phone? I need a solution...&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fs.lowyat.net%2fstyle_emoticons%2fdefault%2fcry.gif" />&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I've re-formatted the memory card and hard reset the phone, also no luck...<br />

            Hi drBRETHART 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />As first step of troubleshooting let's try to rule out Skype client as the source of trouble. Let me know the results after below steps to advise you further on this.
<br />
<br />You may need to go for Skype for Desktop, if you are using Store version of Skype. Use below method to uninstall and install Skype to solve this problem.
<br />
<br />CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to invoke Task Manager &gt; Kill any instance of Skype.exe
<br />
<br />A. If this is UWP (Microsoft Store) Skype app of Windows - Windows Key+i &gt; Apps &gt; Click Skype and Uninstall
<br />Install Skype again from Microsoft Store. You can install from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDNCRFJ364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDN...</a>
<br />
<br />If above doesn't work -
<br />
<br />Choose to install desktop client of Skype from and use Skype for Desktop <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />B. If this is Skype for Desktop client 
<br />Copy the below line and Windows Key+R and paste into Run window by CTRL+V and Enter
<br />%appdata%\microsoft\Skype for Desktop
<br />Rename this folder also to something say Skype for Desktop_Old
<br />Reinstall Skype again from <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

    <title>Map OneDrive &#40;for Business&#41; to a drive &#40;e.g. Y&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Map OneDrive &#40;for Business&#41; to a drive &#40;e.g. Y&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I aim to map my onedrive (for business) to drive on my computer, e.g. Y or Z.</p>
<p>The methods describes I found (using CID + https://d.docs.live.net/) does not work, as when I access my onedrive there is no CID in the browser address bar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My use case is that I aim to backup my PC directly to onedrive. My backup software (Acronis) does not support yet to login to onedrive.</p>
<p>If I would backup to the one drive folder in C:\users ... the backup software creates the image on my local drive which is then synced to onedrive -
<br />
BUT the local drive is not big enough to hold the backup too ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>So does anybody have a hint for me please ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Christian</p>

<p>Sorry I wasn't clear. The functionality you want (mapping OneDrive like another drive in Windows) isn't supported. You'll need to place files and folders in the OneDrive folder for them to sync. I mentioned in my previous post that you can move the OneDrive
 folder to another, larger drive. You can deselect folders you don't want to sync and they'll remain in OneDrive.com but won't sync locally but that doesn't help you now. The Creators Update should allow more granular control over specific files and whether
 or not to keep them online only or offline too.</p>
