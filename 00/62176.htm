<h2>            keyboard faulty</h2>
                    <p>Since upgrading Windows 10, I have to press down the fn key to get the right letters or numbers. The space bar does not work with fn held down, so I have to lift my finger up before pressing the space bar. Also, c and v do not work with the fn - they work&nbsp;only
 without Fn.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows 10 black screen after restore</h2>
                    <p><strong>*Long Post Alert*</strong></p>
<p>Thanks in advance to yall trying to help me, im experiencing a boot failure, as stated in the title.</p>
<p>
</p><p>More details about the situation: </p>
<p>For some reason, i had a sense that my system is infected with virus that i couldn't track, so yesterday I decided to restore my windows from a restore point&nbsp; which is created on 12 jun and everything works fine as expected. Actually i was creating an installation
 media using usb on my dell inspiron 5559 laptop, but it constantly failed to create. I kept trying for a few days and even after the restoration. Since the media creation tool takes some time to complete, i left my laptop idle while i went to sleep. Here comes
 the problem, when I'm awake, i found that my laptop is running and my screen went black without cursor. I thought it had restart for updates, so i wait and wait for like hours but still nothing but black screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What i had done after problem occurs:</p>
<p>1. Restart laptop</p>
<p>2. Boot into safe mode with connection: screen only shows dell logo and nothing else is done, the screen just freeze at that point.</p>
<p>3. Restore from a restore point: this problem occurs right after i restore my windows, so no other restore point is available</p>
<p>4. System image recovery: no system image available</p>
<p>5. Cmd: sfc/ scannow : windows resource protection could not perform the requested operation</p>
<p>6. Reset this pc→keep my files :i tried once before and get message"there was a problem resetting your pc", now im doing second try and stucks at 1%</p>
<p>
</p><p>*My windows always works fine with every updates, plus this problem isn't occur after any updates so i guess this isn't one of the other common update issue*</p>
<p>What else i could do for my problem? I'm hoping any expert here can fix my problem asap thanks again to yall.
</p>
<p>*Staying online for solutions*</p>
<p />

<p>Hi ChineseKid,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Corrupted boot system files is one of the possible reasons why you are having issues booting your computer. We suggest that you try to boot your computer from the Windows 10 installation media and perform an Automatic repair from the Windows Recovery Environment
 (WinRE). The Automatic repair can detect and resolve the issues that prevent the computer from starting normally. You may refer to this
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> to download the Windows 10 ISO file and create the installation media on another computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can follow the steps below to perform Automatic repair on Windows 10 computer:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Insert the media such as (USB or DVD) and restart your computer.</li><li>If you see a message asking you to “<strong>Press any key to boot from DVD</strong>,” do so.</li><li>When you see the <strong>Install Windows </strong>page, tap or click on <strong>
Repair your computer </strong>to start the Windows Recovery Mode.</li><li>In the <strong>Windows Recovery Environment</strong>, on the <strong>Choose an option
</strong>screen, tap or click on <strong>Troubleshoot</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Advanced Options</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Startup Repair</strong>.</li></ol>

 around early august did a roll back and everything worked fine. The blue screen would pop up when I would successfully connect to a wireless network; didnt have time to mess with it so i just rolled back the update; finally got to updating the driver today
 and it blue screened after installing the driver so I'm at a loss any help would be very beneficial.

<p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. I will certainly help you with the issue that you are facing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Miracast requires a display adapter which supports Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM) 1.3, and a Wi-Fi adapter that supports Wi-Fi Direct.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In order to mirror the monitor on a third-party device, you need to make sure that the source as well as the receiver have Miracast support. If the manufacturer of the third-party device has mentioned that the device supports wireless display, then
 you can be rest assured of the Miracast compatibility with the device.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To use miscasting on your computer, please follow the steps below and check if that helps.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>To access project option on <strong><span>Windows 8.1</span></strong>, press the
<strong><span>Window + P</span></strong> keys together.</span></li><li><span>If your computer supports the Miracast display, then you will see an option as
<strong><span>Add a wireless display</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>Add a Wireless display. </strong>It will start searching for the new displays which are available in the range provided. Once you find the required device on the search results, click on the
<strong>device name.</strong></span></li><li><span>Now<strong> Windows </strong>will<strong> </strong>install the required drivers on the device and shortly you will see the third part display displaying your device.</span></li><li><span>Later if you want to disconnect the device, you can do the same from your computer by going to the project screen (<strong><span>Windows + P keys</span></strong>) and clicking on the
<strong><span>disconnect option</span></strong>.</span></li></ol>

            As I said in my original post, the option to connect a wireless display isn't available on my PC.&nbsp; I know that the wifi chipset supports miracast though, and there's no reason that the AMD GPU shouldn't support it either.&nbsp; I'm trying to figure out whether
 there's another setting (group policy perhaps) that might prevent this from working.&nbsp; I did already make sure that the domain wireless policy was not restricting wifi direct connections.&nbsp; I also wanted to check whether there was another tool I could use that
 would audit the hardware to determine if it supported all the required features for miracast.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the update. There is no Microsoft tool to check if your computer supports Miracast or not. All the systems that support wireless display are supported.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To test the specification and hardware, you have to contact the system manufacturer and check. You may also check the website of Dell for your system model specifications&nbsp;and check if it helps.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need further support to diagnose and check if the hardware in your computer supports wireless display or not, I would recommend you to contact Dell for the same or read the manual that you might have received along with the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information was helpful.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the suggestions, but still no luck on this-at least not consistently.&nbsp; I did manage to get the "connect to a wireless display" option to appear, but only by re-enabling the switchable graphics in the BIOS (which was causing a bunch of other problems
 with Windows before I disabled it).&nbsp; Evidently, the Intel graphics supports Miracast, but the AMD one does not (at least, not without an AMD APU).&nbsp; The problem now is that I can see the display, but as soon as I try to connect, the connection drops.&nbsp; There's
 no way to force the graphics to intel only (unless I disable the AMD GPU I suppose).&nbsp; Strange that there's not a better way to support this tech-it seems promising otherwise, but the current implementation in Windows is a mess.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Doesn't seem to be any better in Windows 10 either.&nbsp; I upgraded this PC to 10074, and the option to add a wireless display was there (even with switchable graphics disabled), but it failed to connect.&nbsp;

            <p>Hello Chris,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the Update on this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Getting Wireless Display may vary from&nbsp;one computer to another. It might not work on few models due to hardware compatibility as well. That is the reason why I recommend you to contact Dell Support regarding the compatibility of Wireless Display on your
 model.</p>
<p>

    <title>&#34;Unallocated Spaces of 0 mb&#34; x 2 crashed my Hard Disk. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            &#34;Unallocated Spaces of 0 mb&#34; x 2 crashed my Hard Disk. </h2>
                    I am a student, but I wanted to try Windows 7, so I installed Windows 7 Ultimate for 30 days trial period, but I was not content, so after getting near to the expiry of the grace period, I decided to format my PC and reinstall Windows.
<br />
<br />
But on booting up with Windows 7 installation disc, on the screen where I am supposed to select partition to install Windows on to, I saw&nbsp;<strong>two
</strong>"Unallocated Space of 0 mb", one above the unnammed "System Reserved 100 mb drive" and another at the bottom.
<br />
<br />
I tried to delete all partitions &amp; then create again to merge the "Unallocated Spaces of 0 mb" into logical drives but&nbsp;they prevailed. So I ignored the existance of the
<strong>two </strong>"Unallocated Space of 0 mb" and continued installing Windows 7 on Drive C:, copying of files completed successfully, the computer restarted after that but on boot up it halted on the boot screen where BiOS automatically detects Hardwares
 like Hard Disks &amp; DVD-Drive, it appeared like BiOS is experiencing difficulty in detecting Hard Disk, I dismounted my Hard Disk &amp; mounted on to another PC, even that PC halted on boot up. I found my Hard Disk is gone and all data is lost.
<br />
<br />
But I have installed Windows 7 on my friends' PC, and it didn't experience this glitch.
<br />
<br />
It has happened to my PC many times, and I have lost many hard disks &amp; Data along with it every time.
<br />
<br />
Please if someone could help my in this, as I am afraid of installing Windows 7 again on my PC, as it seems atleast to every one in my home that this has something to do with Windows 7.
<br />

            I had the same problem with windows 7 it crashes HDD. But the HDD is not broken it is just blocking it. Just unplug the diskt and boot from ubuntu from live CD before ubuntu start plug the disk in and when ubuntu is loaded you can see your entire disk
 and delete the C (windows) partitions in ubuntu reboot your PC and the disk will be OK. The other partitions will be saved and you will have your all data. But what is causing this problem I dont know, but I know that I will stick with XP for a wile.

But how would I diagnose my Hard Disk, if I am unable to boot <strong>any </strong>
PC with this crashed Hard Disk, even if mounted as secondary Hard Disk besides bootable primary hard disk.
<br />
<br />
You didn't understand it doesn't even proceed to that screen where I can be prompted to boot from CD/DVD by pressing any key.

<br />
First of all, did you see the <strong>two </strong>"Unallocated Spaces of 0 mb", when you made your PC to boot from Windows 7 installation DVD in an attempt to format your system, on the screen when you are prompted to select drive to install windows on.
<br />
<br />
And, second thing, on ignoring the <strong>two </strong>"Unallocated Spaces of 0 mb", followed by installation process,&nbsp;on completion of copying of files to selected logical drive, when system restarts it doesn't even proceed to that screen where&nbsp;one can be
 prompted to boot from CD/DVD by pressing any key. <br />
<br />
And, third thing, can Hard Disk be pluged-in/mounted on to the mother board, even when Power Supply is
<strong>ON</strong>, wouldn't it crash my entire PC as I have always been told to Power OFF&nbsp;my PC before pluging-in or out Hard Disk/DVD/CD-ROM.
<br />
<br />
But you told to "<em>Just unplug the diskt and boot from ubuntu live CD before ubuntu start plug the disk in and when ubuntu is loaded you can see your entire disk</em>".
<br />
<br />
On booting up with Ubuntu Live CD, do I have to plug-in my Hard Disk to the Board, before Ubuntu Live CD could load its files on to, with having Power ON.

            Yes there ware two "Unallocated Spaces of 0 mb" one totally in front of the partitions before the first partition ant the second one was after the windows partition. The installation of win 7 was completed but when the PC restarted BUM it blocked before
 the bios loads.<br />
Your PC wont crash if you unplug during the boot it will just not detect the disk (the PC crashes when the disk is loaded and windows is started). So you just need to unplug the HDD from the power supply then start your PC (you will then see that you can even
 go into BIOS), after you have started the PC put ubuntu live CD and before ubuntu loads it drivers you need to plug the power supply into the disk so ubuntu can install disk driver (otherwise if you wait for ubuntu to start and then to plug the disk ubuntu
 will not install the disk drivers and you won't be able to see the disk in ubuntu).<br />
After you do this when ubuntu is started just start GPARTED (it is automatically installed in ubuntu 9.10) and delete the Primary WINDOWS partition and you will see that those 2x0 MB unallocated space will be merged with the whole partition you have deleted
 for example 40 GIG just click APPLY and you are done, restart the PC and everything is back to normal. Your disk will work like new ;)<br />
<br />
If you didn't understand something of the explanation feel free to ask me what to do, because I had this same problem and at first place I thought that my HDD was dead but then I got this idea and it worked. At first I was worried too if the disk will be detected
 if I unplug it from the power and then plug it back but everything worked just fine. ;)<br />
<br />
GOOD LUCK<br />

You mean to say, I have to keep the power cable plugged-in to the defective Hard drive but only not to plug-in the drive to Mother board through SATA cable that detectes the drive.

<br />
First of all, THANKS as your idea sounds somewhat of a solution to my problem. <br />
<br />
Secondly, I will download Ubuntu Live CD Image through Internet, but which Operating System you are having now installed on your computer after that, I mean after deleting the infected partition, and creating &amp; merging unallocated spaces to new partition, do
 I have to reinstall and stick to that Old Windows XP, or can I attempt again with installing Windows 7.

            If you attempt to install Windows 7 the same thing will happen you will be stuck again on your bios load with 2xo mb partitions, and you will need to do the same thing again starting ubuntu and deleting the partition ( I know this because I have tried
 many times every time I get in Win 7 partitioner and when I try to create system partition the 2x0 mb partitions are shown). So you will need to install XP or other OS that you want Ubuntu, Vista .... what ever you like except Win7.<br />
I'm waiting for a solution for this problem too but nothing is fixed so far. Maybe when Win 7 release the SP1 for win7 the bug will be fixed ( if there is SP1 in the near future for WIN7)<br />

            Windows 7 has some know problems with it Disk Manager as far as creating partitions during an install or after the install. This is why I suggested XP.

<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually<br />
by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

==========================================<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show<br />
a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp;<strong> &lt;-- best method<br />

            <p>So, I called Microsoft Support. The Engineer had me boot the system by unplugging my power supply right at the BIOS flash screen, 3 times, but it did not solve the problem. The Engineer advised me to call the Microsoft Store nearby and take my PC in for
 support :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thankfully, I'm running Acronis True Image 2015 (with a Disks and partitions backup). I had to Restore to last Monday's backup, but I am now up-and-running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No idea exactly what caused the issue, but I suspect the March 1st Updates - one or both of the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Update for Windows 10 Version 1511 for x64-based Systems (KB3139907)."</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1511 for x64-based Systems (KB3140743)."</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT:</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the Acronis restore, I did not have a chance to stop Microsoft Updates before they downloaded and prepared the above listed updates, so I just let it run its course overnight.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thankfully, the system did finally boot to login, but now it takes several hours to get to that point, what gives Microsoft???</p>

<h2>            windows 8 has deleted my windows.old&#47;programfiles &#63;&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    I was rather annoyed that windows 8, instead of integrating my existing programs and settings, shoved everything including settings in windows.old/ProgramFiles (what was the point of having a tick box that said "keep existing settings" if it didnt and
 even made my email inaccessible till I downloaded windows live mail again?)
<div><br />
</div>
<div>However after hours of fiddling I managed to do a combination of re-install and running programs with tricky settings from the windows.old/program files directory via desktop shortcuts</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Over the last few days the short cuts stopped working and I see windows 8 has deleted my windows.old/programfiles directory!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Its not in my Recycle bin, its not in my AVG virus vault</div>
<div><br />
Any one know where this is!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I couldnt understand why windows 8 had to stuff all my programs out of the way so it would take me hours to make shortcuts...but deleting the whole directory and my settings? Come on, this is rediculous</div>

</div>
<div>HELLLLP!!!<br />

<span>Hi ,</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community Forum.</span></p>

<span>It will also delete automatically when the Windows drive has less than 10% free space.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>As I understand the process, the Windows 8 upgrade will copy your existing files and settings into&nbsp;<em>\Windows.old</em>, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>PerfLogs</li><li>Program Files</li><li>Program Files (x86)</li><li>Users</li><li>Windows</li></ul>
<p>It will then create new folders for all of the above, and migrate the files into the new folders. The&nbsp;<em>\Windows.old&nbsp;</em>folder is really just there as a part of the upgrade process, but it does act as a temporary backup folder. If you don't
 need anything from there in the first month, then you're not likely to need anything from there ever (as most / all of it is already in the new folders, and the old folder is likely taking up gigabytes of space).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Now, if you've upgraded from Windows 7, then congrats, everything has been moved to the new folders, including installed programs and drivers.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you've upgraded from Vista or earlier, then your documents and settings have been migrated, but you're expected to reinstall the programs yourself, and the upgrade makes this clear. If you're foolish enough to create shortcuts into<em>\Windows.old\Program
 Files</em>&nbsp;and hack the registry to point into that folder, then you've dug your own grave.</p>

 I start to load up MineCraft, it signs me out of XBox Live and I cannot access it. &nbsp;I opened ports to my XBox 360 because I was having problems with my NAT type being ?Moderate and not open. &nbsp;It still does not want to work and I have become very stressed out
 over the situation. &nbsp;SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME!!!</span></p>

<p>Hey there, sorry to hear about your troubles. Let's try a few things before getting too stressed, pal! Now, have you tried deleting and re-downloading the game to see if it works? Also, try clearing your system cache as well. If those don't work, you may
 want to try deleting and re-downloading your gamertag. If your connection is still being annoying, have you tried plugging directly into the modem to your 360? If disconnects are still an issue, it may happen to be either your modem is a bit faulty, your ISP
 is throttling your connection or your lines may need a look, or even the simple fact that perhaps your console is telling you it may need a new ethernet port. Also, you may want to make sure that you're signed into the proper profile as well before starting
 the game up. I do hope this helps and you get into playing Minecraft online very soon. I also have to ask, do you get disconnected from LIVE on any other title? If not, the fix should be one of the first few suggestions, hopefully. Let us know!</p>

            I had the same issues and none of the suggested fixes worked.&nbsp; Ultimately I logged out of windows live and went to a non-MS login and was able to get the app downloads to work.

</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Download and Run the fixit.</span>
</p>
<p><b><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span></b><span>When it asks, select the option:

<p><span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Once done, restart the system and check.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>

<h2>            Human interface device for touchscreen gone</h2>
                    Shortly after I updated to 8.1 my touchscreen stopped working intermittently and than stopped working all together. I looked in the device manager and the HID category is completely gone. I waited to see if it would be reinstalled with the upgrade to windows
 10 but it was not. I have checked the manufacture website for the driver with no luck as well as the Microsoft website. I just want my touchscreen back. How can I get the Human interface device back on my computer so I can use my touchscreen?

</p><p>I suggest that you download the Chipset drivers from the Manufacturer website and install. If the Manufacturer Chipset drivers fail to resolve the issue then you may download the chipset drivers from the Mother board manufacturer website and install.</p>

            Hi Kent,
<br />this game is old so may be incompatible with Windows 10. Please try to set compatibility modes in game file's properties.
<br />If you will not be successful you need to use virtual machine such as DOSBox, install old Windows version and game into it and run game from this virtual machine. Unfortunately one need additional license to run Windows in VM.

    <title>Volume Shadow Copy used by System Restore not working. Error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> carlos_oh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Volume Shadow Copy used by System Restore not working. Error 0x81000202</h2>
                    
<p>Hello. I am running a Win7 Ultimate version. Today, I did many things that are on Microsoft´s suspicious list:&nbsp;</p>
<p>[1] I moved large files from my&nbsp;hard disk&nbsp;to an external USB hard disk. There were not any problems with that.</p>
<p>[2] I uninstalled a version of PDF-X-Change Viewer which seemed to take too long (<a href="http://www.tracker-software.com/product/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tracker-software.com/product/</a>) During its removal I could see the progress bar showing many Windows Installer
 registry lines being removed. After that I noticed some programs were not working properly, and I tried to reinstall them. All .msi installers failed saying there was a problem with Windows Installer. I tried to restore to an earlier time, but system restore
 is not only disabled but whenever I try to activate it, I receive the message that Volume Shadow Copy used by System Restore not working. Error 0x81000202. I already tried to boot in safe mode, to no avail.</p>
<p>If everything fails, I would like to reinstall my copy of Win7, but I should do it online, as I don´t have any backup DVD or system restore facility, is that possible ? I have not much time to spend on this as I am close to deliver a presentation, so if
 not quick fix available, I would do an online installation of Win 7.</p>
<p>Best regards, Carlos</p>

<p><span><span>Hi Carlos_OH,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>I would suggest you to follow the steps mentioned below and check if it helps.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></span><span><span>&nbsp; Make sure the services related to system restore
 are started and set to automatic, to do this, follow the steps below:</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Volume shadow copy, Multimedia Class Scheduler, Remote Procedure Call (RPC), DCOM Server Process Launcher, Plug and Play.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Please follow the steps below and set all of the above services to Automatic.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>a)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click
 the start button, and in the search box type in: “Services” (without quote).</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>b)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Press
 'Enter' to open Services window.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>c)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Find
 related services list above, and check the Status (started) and Startup Type (automatic).</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>d)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Double
 click the service to change the status to started and set startup type to Automatic.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>If the above services are running properly stop and restart the service again.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong></span><span><span>&nbsp; T<span>his process&nbsp;also deletes
 all current restore points, so fixing System Restore&nbsp;will remove your ability to access any of the current restore points.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></span><span><span>&nbsp; Perform System File Checker (SFC) scan from the

<h2>            Not prompted to enter password for wireless connection.</h2>
                    
<p>I have windows 7 and have been able to access wifi connections without any problem. However, today I am at a new location and when I click on the desired connection I get no prompt to enter the password or key. I am accessing the connection currently from
 my wifes laptop so i know the connection is working properly. I went under control panel, network configuration, and manage connections and removed all my other connections. I rebooted &amp; still cannot access the desired connection because I can't enter the
 password. I also tried adding the connection and it still didn't work. Thanks for your help!</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>At the exact same location, your Wireless computer does not work, and your wife's computer prompt for password and works OK with the password?.</p>
<p>The prompt to password appears only after the computer is actually connected to the Access point.</p>
<p>May be your computer firewall is blocking the capacity to connect to the Access Point.</p>
<p><strong>Wireless connection in general.</strong></p>
<p>Most Laptops have a physical switch for the Wireless card. Read the computer's manual and make sure that the Wireless card is On.</p>
<p>Check the Device Manager for valid Wireless card entry.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_dm.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_dm.jpg</a></p>
<p>If there is No valid entry, delete any Bogus Entry, and re-install the Wireless card's Drivers.</p>
<p>Check the Network connections to make sure that you have a Wireless Network Connection Icon/Entry, and that the Properties of the Icon (right click on the Icon) are correctly configured with TCP/IPv4 protocol in the Network Connections Properties.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_connection_tcp.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_connection_tcp.jpg</a><br />
<br />
<strong>Make sure that if there is a vendor's Wireless Utility the utility is Not Running together with the Windows native Wireless utility.</strong></p>
<p>Make sure that No Firewall is preventing/blocking the Wireless components to get to the Network.</p>
<p>If everything above is OK and it is not connecting to the Wireless router. Log from any computer that is, or can be connected to Wireless Router with a Wire, disable the Wireless Security, make sure that the Wireless broadcast is On, and try to connect with
 No Wireless security.</p>
<p><strong>When working turn On the Wireless security.</strong></p>
<p>Note* People sometimes make mistakes in writing and retyping the security passphrase.</p>
<p>Alternative way is to copy it from the Router's menu, and then paste when asked by the Wireless card.</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>I really checked and configured every thing and it does Not work.</strong></p>
<p>Software Firewall application that is Not configured to allow local traffic (between the computer and the Router is a possible issue too.<br />
some 3rd party Software Firewalls keep blocking aspects of Local Traffic even it they are turned Off (disabled). If possible configure the Firewall correctly, or totally uninstall it to allow clean flow of local network traffic. If the 3rd party software is
 uninstalled or disables, make sure that Windows native Firewall is <strong>On </strong>

            Most likely reason is that your firewall is blocking this. You can turn off your firewall for a minute or two and check. Turn on firewall after testing is completed.

    <title>Windows 10 Wifi not automatically connecting after restart - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tim dude  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Wifi not automatically connecting after restart &#40;Solution&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi there!</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For a very long time now, </span>I had this persistent issue that my wifi would never automatically reconnect to my router after a restart, or cold bootup. I had to manually click on my wifi and reconnect it every time after a restart, or I had to
 disable wifi and enable it again, in order for my wifi to connect. This started happening a good while ago after some major Windows10 update (maybe fall creators?). Before the update I didn't encounter this issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally found the solution for this issue, which, btw., is very odd and noteworthy that Microsoft should look into this issue further, because its not normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution was:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to device manager</li><li>go to network adapters</li><li>now <strong>deactivate ALL WAN Miniport entries</strong>. If you can't see them, go to "view" and click "show hidden devices".</li><li>I also uninstalled "Microsoft kernel debug network adapter", which shouldn't even be there in the first place.</li></ol>
<p>My wifi now automatically connects to my router everytime after a restart, like it used to do before the Windows10 update long time ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps some of you.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: @Microsoft support, consider this as a bug report.</p>

            I haven't been able to resolve the issue. The point is moot now in any case as it is now past the 29th July. I certainly won't be paying for Windows 10 given the frustrations encountered.<br />

    <title>Bluetooth devices no longer working - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Bluetooth devices no longer working</h2>
                    <p>I set up a brand new build for a conference room. &nbsp;I purchased the Microsoft Sculpt Comfort mouse and keyboard. &nbsp;They didn't come with a Bluetooth transceiver so I purchased a non-Microsoft one (because I couldn't find a Microsoft one -&nbsp;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008AO6X0O/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I set up the computer and paired the two bluetooth devices. &nbsp;They worked for a while, but then stopped working. &nbsp;Mostly was a problem when the projector was turned on and the device wouldn't pair. &nbsp;Sometimes the keybaord would and mouse wouldn't. &nbsp;Sometimes
 the other way around. &nbsp;Most of the time both didn't wake back up after the computer had been asleep. &nbsp;I repaired them several times because they wouldn't show in the available devices, but they would randomly stop working. &nbsp;I was told they would sometimes
 stop working even after they had been working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to pair them again, but now the devices (both) aren't being discovered. &nbsp;I replaced the batteries in both and depressed the button on the back (one at a time so they wouldn't compete). &nbsp;The device would blink green and red (showing that it is discoverable),
 but it wouldn't show on the list of devices to pair. &nbsp;They were not on the list of devices when I went to pair them either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the Microsoft Fix-It button and it updated the drivers for the bluetooth receiver, but the keyboard and mouse still won't show in the device manager or in the available devices (in the control panel). &nbsp;It also brought up the keyboard and mouse center
 thing. &nbsp;It showed a picture of the bluetooth keyboard but I didn't see where I would set this keyboard's bluetooth settings. &nbsp;I checked the devices (in control panel) and it wasn't listed there. &nbsp;There was an unknown bluetooth keyboard there, but it didn't
 have any tabs in the settings - just a general tab that said that it was an unknown bluetooth keyboard. &nbsp;I have made sure that the bluetooth service is set to automatic and is started. &nbsp;The bluetooth receiver does show in device manager and is enabled. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going crazy. &nbsp;No one can use that conference room and it is really becoming a problem. &nbsp;I know the physical bluetooth device works because it has worked in the past.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Windows 7 Pro with a core i5 processor, 16GB ram (I know that is overkill). &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thanks for taking the time to respond. &nbsp;Unfortunately, I tried all of your suggestions prior to posting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I don't get any error messages - it just won't discover the devices. &nbsp;They have been paired to that bluetooth receiver before and the receiver shows in the list of devices in device manager and in the system tray. &nbsp;It just doesn't find any devices anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I don't have any other bluetooth devices other than this keyboard and mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1 - I had already tried that. &nbsp;I don't remember exactly what came up when it was done, but it was basically that there wasn't a solution available or everything was up to date, I don't remember exactly. &nbsp;But I do remember doing it and it not being
 helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2 - I also had already tried both of these. &nbsp;The computer is on a domain and is automatically updated (but I checked and it still says it is up to date). &nbsp;I put fresh batteries in both devices and neither came up on the list of devices to pair. &nbsp;The
 devices themselves did the blinks to show that they were able to be discovered (I did one at a time so the computer wouldn't get confused) and had power.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried the additional information links before posting.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks for your help and the time you took to respond. &nbsp;I had already tried all of the above before posting. &nbsp;That is why I was at such a loss for what to do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you know if Microsoft products don't work with certain bluetooth receivers? &nbsp;Maybe the brand I had worked for a while but then something happened (maybe a windows update) and it decided to not work anymore? &nbsp;I don't know. &nbsp;I've ordered a new bluetooth
 receiver, but am worried it isn't going to be a good one either or that it isn't the receiver but maybe some option that isn't checked off correctly. &nbsp;I looked around in services and there are some bluetooth options, but I didn't see anything blatant that
 looked like it was preventing it from finding the devices. &nbsp;Plus it found them before. &nbsp;I'm the only Admin so no one else could have changed any of the settings since it last worked.</p>

            <span>Hi,<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to try the fixit from the following link and see if that helps.<br />
<br />
Bluetooth devices do not work correctly on a computer that is running Windows 7<br />

            Thanks for your response, but I already had tried this tool. &nbsp;I figured I'd try again, but it didn't change anything. &nbsp;I actually got a new bluetooth receiver to rule out that it was the receiver, but I'm still having the same problem. &nbsp;I can see the bluetooth
 symbol in the system tray and try to "Add a device" but nothing happens. &nbsp;I made sure that only one was trying to connect and that it was flashing the lights it was supposed to to be discoverable. &nbsp;I'm about to reinstall windows. &nbsp;Does anyone know anything
 else I could try before going this route?

            Thanks for the replies. &nbsp;I received a new Bluetooth receiver and it didn't work either. &nbsp;Since it is a conference room computer, I just reinstalled windows and so far, they are working with no struggle. &nbsp;I'm not sure what could have gone wrong the first
 time since it was a new install when I was first trying to pair them, but I guess I'm just happy it is working now.
