    <title>My left headphone randomly lowers it&#39;s volume. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            My left headphone randomly lowers it&#39;s volume.</h2>
                    <p>Suddenly, a few hours ago, for some reason my left headphone's volume was lowered. Since I wasn't sure if it was my impression or the headphone actually not working properly I used a stereo tester:&nbsp;https://www.audiocheck.net/audiotests_stereo.php and, after
 I used it (actually whenever I used it to reproduce left headphone or right headphone) the volume of the left headphone became the same again. It happened again every 10-15 mins and every time I did the same and it was temporarily solved. I'd like to know
 if there is a permanent solution to this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case it's relevant, it was produced while I was playing a game while watching videos on my other screen.</p>

            Hi Ayres2,
<br />
<br />It seems the shared driver is not compatible with Windows 10 1803.
<br />Follow these steps: from the computer, you are sharing the printer, press Windows key + R
<br />Type: control printers
<br />Click: Enter
<br />Select the printer
<br />Print Server Properties
<br />Select Sharing
<br />Additional drivers
<br />Follow the instructions. You will be able to add updated drivers for the printer the user can install automatically from Windows 10 1803.

<p>Hello&nbsp;Ayres2,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This can be related to having a third-party antivirus application. Can you confirm if your system host has any? If so, try disabling it for the meantime and let
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17187/windows-10-protect-your-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Defender protect your device</a>. You can also try reconfiguring the share permissions for the printer.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you would like me to provide additional advice, simply respond to this thread. I will get notified and I’ll reply to you as soon as I can.</p>

                    At some point a couple of weeks ago, my computer downloaded a windows update and only now am i restarting my computer, the update will not go past 12%. I restarted my computer to see if this would change but it will constantly go to 12% then just stop.
 I can't access the desktop as far as i have tried and i don't want to have to delete files on my computer.

            Hi Liam71,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for bringing up the issue on Microsoft community!</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Here are a few steps which you can follow to resolve the issue </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Disconnect all the external devices (printers, scanner, USB (universal serial bus) drives, etc...) except mouse and the keyboard and then boot up.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Boot the computer in Safe mode and check if the issue persists. Follow these steps to start the computer in safe mode.</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press the ‘Windows + C’ key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) Click on settings, more pc settings and then general.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Scroll down to advanced startup, click restart now.</span></p>
<p><span>d) Click on troubleshoot, advanced options, Windows Startup Settings.</span></p>
<p><span>e) Click restart, select safe mode with networking and then press enter.</span></p>
<p><span>Note: Restart the computer to start in normal mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to perform a clean boot to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts. Follow these steps to start the computer in clean boot.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 1<br />
</span></b></p>
<p><span>a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Click the ‘Boot’ tab and uncheck ‘Safe Boot’ option.</span></p>
<p><span>d) On the ‘General’ tab, click to select the option ‘Selective startup’, and then click to clear the option Load startup items check box.</span></p>
<p><span>e) On the ‘Services’ tab, click to select the ‘Hide all Microsoft services’ check box, and then click ‘Disable all’.</span></p>
<p><span>f) On the ‘StartUp’ tab, click ‘Open Task Manager’. In the Task Manager window under startup tab, right click on each startup item which are enabled and select ‘Disable’.</span></p>
<p><span>g) Click ‘OK’, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 2: Enable half of the services</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;a. Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Click the Services tab, and then click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Click to select half of the check boxes in the Service list.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Click OK, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 3: Determine whether the problem returns</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Service list.</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Service list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></p>
<p><span>If only one service is selected in the Service list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items</span></b><span> </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either
 step.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Startup Item list.</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Startup Item list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></p>
<p><span>If only one startup item is selected in the Startup Item list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem.
</span></p>
<p><span>Go to step 6.</span></p>
<p><span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either
 step.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 6: Resolve the problem</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box for the
 problem item.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 7:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.</span></p>
<p><span>c) On the ‘General’ tab, click the ‘Normal Startup’ option, and then click ‘OK’.</span></p>
<div>
<p><b><span><br />
</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p><span>If the above doesn’t works, we would suggest you perform Automatic repair from windows recovery option and check.</span></p>
<p><span>Boot using Windows 8 Installation disk and perform startup repair. </span>
</p>
<p><span>b. Insert the disk into DVD drive and restart the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Press F12 key (typically this is F12, but it can differ between computer manufacturers) and choose the drive that you inserted the installation media into.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Once the Windows Setup window appears click Next.</span></p>
<p><span>e. Click on Repair your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>f. Click on Troubleshoot and then select Advanced Options.</span></p>
<p><span>g. Click on Automatic repair.</span></p>
<p><span>h. Follow the on-screen instructions and finish the repair.</span></p>
<br />
Method 3<br />
<div>Click on the link and follow the steps: “Windows hangs or freezes”.</div>
<div>(My computer hangs or freezes when it installs updates) </div>

<h2>            Windows audio - waveIn functions - recording from mic captures static&#47;hiss</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have created an application that uses waveIn functions to capture audio (speech, primarily) from the microphone (internal or external/USB) to record speech. It works fine, but I have found that it records a lot of of static irrespective of the mic used
 or the PC/laptop where the application is installed. This is not to say that the level of noise is very high - just that it is high enough to cause fatigue given that each recording is at least 60 minutes in length.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The audio is recorded with the following settings:</p>
<p>Sampling rate: 22050 Hz</p>
<p>Bit depth: 8-bits</p>
<p>No. of channels: 1 (mono).</p>
<p>Mic level: 100%</p>
<p>
</p><p>Development platform: Windows 7, C++ (native DLL for the record/pause and close functions which internally uses winmm.lib), p/invoked from .Net 4.0 windows application</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Even if the mic level is set to zero, the recorded file still has static.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried everything from filtering, noise reduction (using sox.exe) but to no avail. Note that I cannot use UI based audio editing tools, since the noise reduction has to happen in the background.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried to reduce the mic volume to about 50% but this results in the usable audio (speech) getting a lot more attenuated than the noise. I also tried reducing the sample rate to 11025 Hz, but the static remains.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if there is a solution to this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rohit</p>

            <p>Hello Ramesh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The device drivers are all up-to-date. The issue is present only in this particular application, and there have been no recent changes - as I said the application is deployed on various other computers and this issue is common to all. In fact recording with
 mic level set to zero results in static being recorded - a kind of hiss. Regarding checking hardware, since the application is installed on other computers, it is not possible for me to check each and every one of them - my development machine does not have
 any hardware issues. I have tried unchecking "Allow applications to take exclusive control..." check-box for the mic - this has no effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Setting mic boost to +10dB only increases the overall level including the noise. Note that on other machines where the application is installed, the mic is a different USB type and does not have a boost option. However irrespective of which mic is connected
 and selected, the static is common to both.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried everything form mic level to boosting to applying filtering, noise reduction using external tools, but the static remains. I believe it does not have to do with playback but with the actual recording itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recorded with mic level zero and the recorded audio seems to have the kind of noise that comes when EMI/RFI is induced due to nearby high-frequency or switching circuits and I could clearly make out the periodicity of the noise - it seems to be picked
 up not from by mic (i.e. externally) per-se but its getting induced into front-end electronics immediately after the mic - i.e. somewhere inside the sound card itself. It is somewhat like a buzz that comes from an AM radio receiver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I do believe it has to do with the way the application is capturing samples - direct from the waveIn API, and saving the raw PCM data to a wave file (of course with thre correct header information). Other applications that use the mic do not seem to
 have this issue - so perhaps there is some step programmatically required to be done when the raw PCM data is received before they are written to file - but I am not sure what that could be. As of now the WAVEFORMAT structure is initialised for 22050 Hz, 8-bit
 mono audio capture. Is this suitable to be used with the mic - this since the mic shows that it supports CD quality recording - 44100 Hz, 16 bit mono, so I believe it should work with or be compatible with 22050 Hz, 8-bit mono.<br />
</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rohit</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Child Account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cristinakuptzin-johnson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Child Account</h2>
                    <p>I keep seeing people post links to answers to this question: I CANNOT set up family safety or any other form of monitoring on my desktop PC for my son.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are three people with user accounts on my PC: myself, fiance' and my son (who I added manually via the control panel).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, when I follow the links posted all over the MS site that say "Do this [click link]" it takes me to either a page that isn't applicable or a page that does not exist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to know in easy terms:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why are my fiance' and son's accounts not showing up on microsoft.com family safety site? (Is this because my fiance' was added via our home network through his laptop?)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I set up my son's account as a child's account to monitor and limit it?? This is ridiculous. I'm sorry but I'm so frustrated with this. I am a 6.5 on a scale of 1 to 10 in computer savvy so this is not brain surgery but for whatever reason, there
 are no simple explanations for how to create an account for my son that I can control with family safety. What is going on?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>PLEASE explain - simply, without referring to any other OS besides Windows 10 (upgraded from 8.1) - just Windows 10, HOW do I limit my son's account, currently on this computer (set up via 'add new user' in control panel), so the hours used and websites
 visited are limited and/or monitored?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And please don't send me a link to another explanation for another windows OS. I've tried it. It's not working. Plus even created new email acct for my son. Now when he comes to MS.com he could probably end up in my account and undo everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a really bad set up. Should have left it the way it was.</p>

            <p>If UAC is turned off, then everything you run (and every program process, every thing you download, and every site you visit) is automatically running as administrator. &nbsp;It's a very dangerous thing to do, because even using something simple like Spotify
 to listen to music could download viruses to your computer through the advertisements. &nbsp; Normally you're protected because your programs aren't running with full admin access, but yours are since you turned off UAC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only ways to stop running everything as admin is to turn UAC back on, or create and use a standard limited account profile instead of an administrator account profile.</p>

    <title>restore from VHD file - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            restore from VHD file</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">My lenovo windows 7 became unstable. Even after help from MS forum
 after some weeks I eventually became frustrated enough to do a Lenovo factory restore thinking I could restore from what looked to be back-up VHD files on my Seagate 2 TB external&nbsp; HD. Did this then MS updates re-ran so windows should be updated. When I try
 to mount the VHD back to the Lenovo there is a message: " the sector size of the physical disc on which the virtual disc resides is not supported". The HD sector seems to be something like 2069 and the lenovo is 512. Why I was able to back up to a format that
 cannot be recalled I am not sure. Incidentanlly my Back-ups never seemed to work (failed without offering a reason - maybe it was sector size!) but there are these files so something was created although at 389221Kb it looks very small! I would not bother
 to try this except I have lost MS Office and was hoping to get it back by this restore. I have a MS Office ten back up disk but it is Generic, no key on the packaging but I did not realize that until too late. All I really want to do is get MS office back
 from the Seagate or somehow set it up from this disk maybe.</span>

            Hello Frederik, Thanks for the thought. I purchased this machine 2nd hand with Office installed and never had&nbsp; a disk or packaging with the key. Only the day after I did the factory restore by accident I found that there are ways in which to extract the
 key from one's computer but too late by then! At least I am going again. Cheers - Graeme

<p>You might want to treat this incident as a reminder that no installation, whether new or second-hand, can be considered permanent. Sooner or later the machine needs to be reloaded. It is for this reason that one must keep all installation media, product
 keys, download URLs etc. in a place that is separate from the PC.</p>

<h2>            Skype on Centos 7</h2>
                    <p>I've been using Skype under CentOS 7 for a while. Today I downloaded the latest RPM and used it to update to skypeforlinux-8.45.0.41-1 (64-bit). Of course Skype no longer works, even after I uninstalled and reinstalled it. This is under CentOS 7.6.1810 with
 the latest updates. Are previous versions of Skype available?</p>

            Hi
<br />
<br />Thank you for reaching out to us. I'm so sorry you are facing issues!
<br />My name is Margarida, I'm an Independent Advisor. I love helping other users in the Community by sharing my experience with Microsoft products. 
<br />
<br />These are the systems requirements for Skype to run on Linux:
<br />64-bit Ubuntu 14.04+
<br />64-bit Debian 8.0+
<br />64-bit OpenSUSE 13.3+
<br />64-bit Fedora Linux 24+
<br />more details here: <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/fa10328/what-are-the-system-requirements-for-skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/fa10328/what-a...</a>

<p>Thank you for your polite reply, but it doesn't address the question that I asked. From an informed source I have learned that Skype 8.4+ requires glibc 2.18. However CentOS and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8 ship with glibc 2.17. That's a lot of Linux
 users who will get a nasty surprise when they update Skype. What will they think about those nice advances Microsoft has been making to the Linux community?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So let me ask in a more direct and focused way. Apparently the last known version of Skype that worked with CentOS and RHEL is 8.34.0.78-1. Where can I find an rpm package for skypeforlinux-8.34.0.78-1.x86_64 ? Notice that this is not a request for something
 that doesn't exist, like "support" of CentOS or RHEL. It is a request for access to something that already does exist, i.e. a slightly earlier installer.</p>
<br />
<p>Before anyone replies with "Microsoft never makes old installers available" let me point out that Microsoft has done exactly that, for Windows users whose complaints were not that the software didn't run, but that they didn't like its new user interface.
 The evidence is in at least one other thread in this forum.</p>

<h2>            Keyboard non functional after Windows 10 update.</h2>
                    <p>I've found many threads on this topic, and no one had found a fix for it that has worked for most people.&nbsp; My laptop is an HP 15, I'd had it for maybe a year before Windows destroyed it.&nbsp; After the Windows 10 update, I have about 5 working keys.&nbsp; If I plug
 in an external keyboard, that works, but my internal one is gone.&nbsp; It says its an HIB keyboard, but I'm no techie.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>A discrepancy with the compatibility of the driver and Windows 10 update might have resulted in a keyboard issue. To resolve this, we recommend that you update your chipset or HID driver through the manufacturer's website. Kindly check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Your response to the solution will be highly appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi, thanks for your response.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me give you a list of what I have tried, so far:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried to Update keyboard and mouse/pointing device drivers, but it has the most current ones.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Uninstalled the keyboard driver, mouse driver, pointer driver, and restarted to let it put default drivers into place.&nbsp; &nbsp;Uninstalled and resinstalled the driver before trying this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Made sure Filter Keys box was unchecked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried, unsucessfully, to Restore to an earlier point. twice.&nbsp; First time, after an hour of "restoring" , it said it was unable to perform the action. Second time, it stalls at the Initializing screen for hours.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Uninstalled the update through the Windows process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried numerous keyboard combos that were suggested.&nbsp; (Windows key + Space, etc)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm now stuck using an external keyboard on a laptop that I've only had for a year and a half. USB-plug in keyboards work.&nbsp; &nbsp;The on screen keyboard works, but is just painful to use.&nbsp; Its the built in keyboard that is screwed up. Also, my touch pad mouse
 seems to only work sproradically.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm totally out of ideas and suggestions.&nbsp; No A, S,D, J, K, L, U, M, or F.&nbsp; The others work. Makes most words impossible!&nbsp; &nbsp;Help!&nbsp; &nbsp;I've spent weeks trying to straighten out this mess from the Windows update, which they forced on us.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Did you have a game installing or updating at the time? Might not have anything to do with it as I didn't even write down the error codes I got but when I was finishing the install/update on COD (for my kids, I'm a bf guy :) &nbsp;) &amp; thought I'd have a look
 at my bf4 clips. &nbsp;Upload studio (&amp; store come to think of it) kept giving me an error code. &nbsp;Once the install finished, happy days :)</p>

<p>I have everything installed correctly and this just started happening. I go to upload studios and I can watch my clips but when I hit the "start button" ( I'm old school ) the option to even save them is even gone. I go to upload studios to try to upload
 my clips and it gets to about 50% then the error 0x80040206 pops up. This is extremely frustrating to me as I love the option to share and show your clips.</p>

<p>The system is a little new and has clear teething issues.&nbsp; It's frustrating to be hit by this but if it's only been happening say "today" then it might simply sort itself out by tomorrow or the next day.</p>

<p>The answer to the problem is that you most likely pinned the upload app to your dashboard.
</p>
<p>I couldn't save my temp videos, upload edited video, and no one could see my videos on my activity page. As soon as I unpinned the app and restarted everything worked just fine.</p>
<p>I hope this helps you guys out.</p>

<p>Definitely needs to be fixed. I had the problem for over a week and even called xbox support. I tried a bunch of things and the last thing I thought to do was unpin the app and boom. It worked and went back to normal.</p>

                    <span>

<strong>
<p><span>I am using a new HP laptop running Windows 7, connecting through the Internet via a Netgear WNDR3700 wireless router.&nbsp; My problem happens with both Chrome and IE8.</span></p>
<p><span>When I try to download a file about halfway through it just freezes, and either tells me the download is complete (when it is not), says "Connection to server has been reset," or permanently stays at 80% complete.&nbsp; When this
 happens I can still browse the Internet, check email, etc., and it doesn’t appear there’s been a disruption in the connection.</span></p>
<p><span>I first thought it might be a problem with Windows Firewall, so I turned that off and installed Zone Alarm, but have the same issues.</span></p>
<p><span>I know it’s not a problem with the router and modem, because the other two computers that use the same wireless LAN--another HP running Vista and an Acer running XP—can download just fine.&nbsp; So is there something in Windows
 7 that’s stopping it?&nbsp; Or some hidden setting I’m not aware of that tells the browsers to give up after a certain amount of time that has to be manually changed?</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for any help, I’ve been trying to google an answer for a few days but without luck.&nbsp; And let me know what technical specs will help.&nbsp; Didn’t seem like RAM and processor speed would be particularly relevant, but what
 do I know?&nbsp; Obviously not enough!&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This error normally means that the download timed out causing the server to close or reset the connection.&nbsp; If your
 broadband connection is being <br />
slowed for some reason it can cause this issue.<br />
<br />
First, boot your computer in safe mode with networking and try to download a file and check.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Refer this link for steps:

</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Click Start and type CMD in the search box.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In the command prompt type the following command and press enter:</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>ipconfig /flushdns</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>This will clear your DNS cache.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Now try to download a file again.</span></span></p>

<p>Hi Afzal, really appreciate your reply.</p>
<p>Just tried what you suggested, but it didn't work--download timed out after 15 MB. &nbsp;But I'm still able to surf the web, download email, etc., and there's no notification that the connection was severed and reconnected.</p>
<p>Hopefully you know some other options, it's getting pretty frustrating. &nbsp;Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Need help&#33; everytime i buy xbox live one month gold subscription by using my visa card it takes the money off of my account but does not redeem to my account ...Help&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>If any one can help i would appreciate it dearly......my xbox live had just run out of live and a day later i decided to redeem it once again selecting the one month gold subscription in the accounts page. however as i confirmed the subscription it did not
 redeem taking £5.99 off of my account and sending me back to the type of subscription i would like to purchase screen. At first i thought this was a glitch or error so redeemed it once again and again it took the money off of my account but had not redeemed
 the xbox live gold subscription once again. from this i turned to deleting my profile and redownloading it, however this did not work i have several times switched off my router and i have tested to see if any other features of xbox have been effect which
 have not. so again after trying everything i attempted to redeem again ....and once again it took another £5.99 off of my account but did not redeem the one month gold subscription. i turned to xbox live support helpline however the member of staff was not
 able to help me as my email account linked to my xbox account is &nbsp;not receiving emails........ im on the verge of giving up after losing around about £24 from trying to redeem these subscriptions..... i would really appreciate any help into fixing this problem
 Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation
 Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
</p>
<p>Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate.
</p>
<p>So, there is no need to know or get a product key, if you need to reinstall Windows 10, you can use your Windows 7 or Windows 8 product key or use the reset function in Windows 10.</p>
<p>If you are prompted to enter a product key, click 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later'</p>

</p><p>On the other, that has exactly the same everything including display adapters, the 'Get Windows 10' app says:

Starting on July 29, we will start rolling out Windows 10 to our Windows Insiders. From there, we will start notifying reserved systems in waves, slowly scaling up after July 29th. Each day of the roll-out, we will listen, learn and update the experience for
 all Windows 10 users.</p>
<p><br />
If you reserved your copy of Windows 10, we will notify you once our compatibility work confirms you will have a great experience, and Windows 10 has been downloaded on your system.<br />
</p>
<p><em>If your system is not ready yet for your upgrade to Windows 10, we will provide more details during the upgrade experience. In some cases, we will include contact information so you can follow up directly with an application provider or device manufacturer
 to learn more. For most upgrade incompatibilities, you may still choose to complete the upgrade, and find alternative compatible solutions in the Windows Store after you upgrade.
</em>[emphasis mine]<br />
&lt;/QP&gt;<br />

            I have uninstalled Air Display from my system and even deleted all its related drivers but still get the same error message from the Win 10 compatibility checker. What worries me is that the only time my system has been checked remotely by Microsoft was
 back on 6/23 and not since.&nbsp; <br />

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. How is the computer connected to internet?<br />
b. Since when are you facing this issue?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To install service pack you can follow Method 3 in the article below:<br />
<strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/935791" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/935791</span></a></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can save the download onto a flash drive and then try installing it on the vista computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>NOTE</span></strong><span>: To install Vista service pack 2 on the computer you
 must have service pack 1 install on your computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To fix the DHCP service issue, perform these steps:</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 1: Boot the computer in safe mode with networking first if you have a wired (DSL/Cable) connection
 and check if it helps.<br />
<br />
</span></span></strong><span><span>a. Restart your computer.<br />
b. When the computer starts you will see your computer's hardware being listed. When you see this information, start to gently tap the F8 key on<br />
your keyboard repeatedly until you are presented with the Windows 7 Advanced Boot Options screen.<br />
c. Using the arrow keys, select the Safe Mode option you want.<br />
d. Then press the enter key on your keyboard to boot into Windows 7 Safe Mode with Networking.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Refer this link for more information:</span></span><span><br />
</span><strong><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</span></span></a></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 2: C</span></span></strong><span><span>heck
 the status of the DHCP client service in services.<br />
a. Click on start and then type services.msc in the start search box and press enter.<br />
b. Look for DHCP client service.<br />
c. If it is stopped, try to start and copy any error.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 3: Verify that the Dependency Service / components are running</span></span></strong><span><br />
<strong><br />
<span>To verify that the three dependency components are running. Follow the steps below:</span></strong><br />
<span>a. &nbsp;Click <strong>Start</strong>, <strong>Run</strong> and type
<strong>DEVMGMT.MSC</strong><br />
b. &nbsp;In the <strong>View</strong> menu, click <strong>Show hidden devices</strong><br />
c. &nbsp;Double-click <strong>Non-Plug and Play</strong> drivers section<br />
d. &nbsp;Double-click the entry <strong>AFD</strong>, and click the <strong>Driver</strong> tab<br />
e. &nbsp;Set the <strong>Startup</strong> type to <strong>System</strong>.<br />
f.&nbsp;Start the <strong>service</strong>. Note down the error message if any.<br />
g. Similarly start the three other drivers namely:<br />
• <strong>Ancilary function driver for winsock</strong><br />
• <strong>TCP/IP Protocol Driver</strong><br />
•<strong> NetBios over Tcpip</strong><br />
h. Close <strong>Device</strong> <strong>Manager</strong> and <strong>restart</strong> Windows.<br />
Now check if you can start the DHCP client service.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Also refer the below Microsoft KB article.<br />
</span><strong><br />
<span>Some services do not start in Windows Vista</span></strong><br />

    <title>EMAIL ACCOUNTS DISAPPEARING FROM WINDOWS LIVE MAIL - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> technical support queries  say:</h3>
<h2>            EMAIL ACCOUNTS DISAPPEARING FROM WINDOWS LIVE MAIL</h2>
                    <p>This issue of email accounts disappearing has happened on several occasions in Windows Live 11 and 12. &nbsp;This is currently happening on a Windows 7 computer and&nbsp;<span>Windows Live MailVersion 2012 (Build 16.4.3522.0110).&nbsp;The accounts
 were there yesterday. The only issue I was aware of with the emails was a junk folder for one of the missing accounts that recently would not empty. &nbsp;Is this a related issue?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>My hotmail account is still shown there, as is Gmail. &nbsp;Other IMAP email accounts have completely disappeared from the account list in Windows Live Mail but the relevant folders are shown in&nbsp;<span>......\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows
 Live Mail\. However, the folders for the missing email accounts are empty.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have carried out a repair via the Control Panel (which appeared to have no effect but was recommended on several other posts I have read) and will re-add the accounts one by one - a process I would prefer not to have to do
 again. This issue is frustrating and time consuming.&nbsp;</span><span>Is there a quicker way to bring back accounts that have disappeared?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have previous backups. &nbsp;If I use the import function, will that import an account or just emails into an existing account and if it is the full account what happens in respect of the emails
 sent, received or filed since then? Do they come back as part of the next send and receive request?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Do you know what causes this to happen and how it can be avoided and why only some of the accounts are affected?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

<br />
Once you have backed up your files, please uninstall the Windows Live Mail.<br />

            <p>It isn't the version-nr. for the program Paint... It's the Windows-version: Version 6.3 (Build 9600) This, you also can see, by opening Command Prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And to get a new Paint, I THINK, this will be as an ordinary update, IF it's being upgraded...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want a picture-editing-program, there is the Photo Scape - please, let a computer-savvy friend install this, because, there unfortunately is crapware, that ALSO comes, if you not is aware of this!!!&nbsp;<a href="http://photoscape.org/ps/main/download.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://photoscape.org/ps/main/download.php</a>&nbsp;</p>

 to Pro, and pay for it... With this program, you can do ordinary photo-editing, of course... AND you can make some funny pictures from your photos, like these:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.freewebsite-service.com/mnn/Phantasy.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.freewebsite-service.com/mnn/Phantasy.php</a>&nbsp;Even

</p><p>I you don't want to install a photo-editing program, there is the net with online-editor, e.g.:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.befunky.com/create/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.befunky.com/create/</a>&nbsp;When uploadet a photo and edited it, you can save the photo on your PC...</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 runs very slow and Event Log service is stopped after a weird system stop</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a ProBook 4520s HP laptop, with Windows 7 Home Premium, i3, 2GB RAM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A day before yesterday I experienced the system suddenly stopped, like interrupting its power source, despite the battery seems to be ok. I tried to restart. The menu with the start-up options (Safe Mode, etc.) became available, I chose one option, then
 after 1 second it stopped again as before. I repeated this process several times, until at a moment when it started normally. Then it worked normally for a couple of hours, and I shutdown the system normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I tried to start again many times, but the working time increased very much, and it behaves the same now. When my desktop opens, sometime I get a message that MS Security Essentials was not started, and it asked me to start it manually. Sometime
 it is stopped without this message, and sometime it is running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to take a look into the Event Viewer, but I got the message: "Event Log service is unavailable. Verify that the service is running.". I checked "Windows Event Log" and it was stopped, indeed. Also other services are stopped, despite they are set
 to automatic:<br />
- Audio Service<br />
- HP Service<br />
- Multimedia Class Scheduler<br />
- Netlogon<br />
- Skype Updater<br />
- Validity VCS Fingerprint Service<br />
- Windows Event Log<br />
- Windows Installer<br />
- Windows Media Center Receiver Service<br />
- Windows Media Center Scheduler Service<br />
- Windows Time<br />
- Intel(R) Management &amp; Security Application User Notification Service<br />
- Microsoft .NET Framework NGEN v4.0.30319_X86<br />
- Serviciul Google Update (gupdate)<br />
- Software Protection</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked other similar issues and I found this one <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-performance/very-slow-log-in-with-windows-7-home-premium-on-hp/52599d94-6412-4a01-93a1-c2f1a4591313">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-performance/very-slow-log-in-with-windows-7-home-premium-on-hp/52599d94-6412-4a01-93a1-c2f1a4591313</a>, which has the same OS on HP. I tried some of the recommendations there and I run sfc /scannow
 and chkdsk c: /f, without finding errors. I dind't try Clean Boot because I understood from
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</a> that it may permanently delete all restore points. So I stopped here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any recommendation how to proceed further, please ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,<br />
Sabin</p>

            <p>Hi Virfranz,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I chose first 2 or 3 times "Start Windows Normally". Then I chose "Safe Mode" one or 2 times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right before to experience the issue I didn't do any changes with significant impact. Only common applications. But around one week before I run some antiviruses like Malwarebytes Anti-Malware, JRT, AdwCleaner, Auslogic Boot Speed and Sigcheck. It's possible
 that some of them cleaned up the registry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What means "start-up repair" ?</p>
        </p>

            <p>Hi Virfranz,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a start-up repair it made a restored point and after the next login the Event Log started and the others as well. It seems it was fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for hint !</p>
