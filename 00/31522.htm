<h2>            HELP&#33;  Freezes, blue screens, sad face</h2>
                    <p>Hey all, I've been having major issues with my computer for the past few months.&nbsp; I've gotten multiple blue screen errors, the messages I have written down so far are:<br />
SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION</p>
<p>MEMORY_MANAGEMENT</p>
<p>PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA</p>
<p>BAD_POOL_HEADER</p>
<p>
</p><p>There have been a few others for sure and some duplicates as well.&nbsp; Other times, my computer will just freeze up completely.&nbsp; This has been an ongoing problem since about April or so, but I haven't really had the need or the time to figure out the problem.&nbsp;
 There seems to be no particular program that causes these problems.&nbsp; I've tried stopping many programs from running at start up and uninstalling ones that were installed when the problems began.&nbsp; Even in "Safe Mode", the problems I'm having still happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, I've done almost everything I can think of.&nbsp; Updated all drivers, virus scan, any type of hardware/maintenance scan Dell.com had to offer.&nbsp; Plus, any other kind of program installed on the computer that would scan for errors.&nbsp; They all say things
 are fine, but as you can imagine, they are not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything else I could potentially do to diagnose these problems I'm having?&nbsp; Perhaps this has happened to anyone else before?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd imagine the best solution to this problem would be to reformat my computer, which I've never done with Windows 7.&nbsp; Apparently, there is program found in the Control Panel that makes reformatting fairly easy to follow.&nbsp; I understand I would be starting
 with a clean slate.&nbsp; All files that I want to keep have been backed up recently, so I'm not against doing this but I just want to make sure I do it the correct way and don't lose anything major such as Windows 7 itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help here would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>So, I ran driver verifier and my computer could hardly start up afterwards, I was very worried that there was no coming back from that.&nbsp; Luckily, I got it running long enough to disable it after my computer crashed a few times.&nbsp; I created a new DMP batch
 which you can view here:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=4ACC09A7E6624AE3!239&amp;authkey=!ANnSUWOBTkvdNK8&amp;ithint=file%2czip</p>
<p>
</p><p>I only noticed that the file originally dated 8/26 was updated to 8/29.&nbsp; I have no idea how to view the contents but I'd imagine there is something new to look at on that file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried to run Memtest but my computer would not stay up long enough for it to finish.&nbsp; The closest I got was 11% on the first pass.&nbsp; The screen would change to the screen where it would list any errors, it looks like.&nbsp; However, before any errors were
 shown, it would freeze.&nbsp; The + sign next to Memtest would continue to blink, but the clock would stop and the "Running" spindle would stop as well.&nbsp; I'll continue to try to run Memtest to see if I get further.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope what little more I've collected will help diagnose this problem.</p>

</p><p>If memtest freezes there is a hardware issue.&nbsp; Since memtest works outside of windows by definition it cannot be anything in windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are overclocking STOP.&nbsp; I would pull all but one memory stick and run memtest again. if that comes back clean put the known ghood stick in another mobo slot and try it again.&nbsp; repeat until all mobo slots are done.&nbsp; then try the other memory sticks
 one at a time.&nbsp; T</p>
<p>

    <title>How to backup Windows 10 64-bit using Norton Ghost. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tcnewton  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to backup Windows 10 64-bit using Norton Ghost.</h2>
                    <p>* I am running Norton ghost 15.0.&nbsp; I had been using it to back up to an external 1 terabyte hard drive.&nbsp; That drive was&nbsp;full prior to upgrade to Windows 10.&nbsp; I was under the impression that Norton Ghost would make space available automatically to enable
 future backups and that apparently is not the case.</p>
<p>*&nbsp; I currently have about 20,000 travel photos that are irreplaceable to me.&nbsp; They should be backed up on my external hard drive along with my Windows 7 desktop.&nbsp; Likely there are multiple backups, but I am reluctant to delete anything.</p>
<p>* My desktop was built by a friend about 3 years ago.&nbsp; When I bought Windows 7 a year earlier in anticipation it came with a 32-bit and 64-bit disk.&nbsp; My friend installed 32 bit&nbsp; without consulting me and I am regretting that he did that.&nbsp; He was concerned
 that software I already had would not run.&nbsp; Photo editing software I recently purchased will only run on a 64 bit system.</p>
<p>* When I updated to Windows 10 today it installed at 32 bit system&nbsp;much to my regret and everything I have read makes it sound very complicated to fix.&nbsp; I'm starting to think I should have installed Windows 7 64 bit first before upgrading to Windows 10.&nbsp;
 I do not know how to get Windows 64-bit now and your questions and answers covers the issue as if it was explaining it to a computer expert.</p>
<p>*&nbsp;I am also concerned that my 32-bit backups may not be able to be restored onto a 64 bit system or perhaps it might simply reinstall Windows 7 32 bit system.&nbsp; I did backup the My Documents separately which I believe includes My Pictures.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure if I need to back anything up or how with my external hard drive full.&nbsp; I'm still wondering if upgrading to Windows 7 64 bit would be the easiest way to fix this and then schedule another Windows 10 upgrade and hope the upgrade is 64 bit.&nbsp; I
 am concerned that I might lose my pictures even though they are backed up because 32 bit and 64 bit&nbsp; systems are so different.&nbsp; Not sure if a backup can be made at 32 bits and restored to 64 bit system or worse restoring windows 7 32 bit backup and restore
 to a 64 bit windows 10 system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't lose these pictures and I need something more a kin to step by step instructions.</p>

            <p>The Windows 10 upgrade is like for like. &nbsp;If you had 32bit Windows 7 you will get 32bit Windows 10 because it is an
<em>upgrade </em>which has to be run from the Windows 7 desktop. &nbsp;The 64bit Setup.exe. cannot run on a 32bit desktop because it is a 64bit program. &nbsp;64bit programs cannot run on a 32bit OS. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once 32bit Windows 10 is activated you can reinstall Windows 10 using a clean install with 64bit media. &nbsp;No product key is required for that because the computer is registered as a Windows 10 Device during the first upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But whether you rollback to 7 and migrate to 64bits there or migrate to 64bits after upgrading to Windows 10 you are going to have to do it by clean install for the reasons given above.</p>

<p>Hello.&nbsp; I did steps "<span>recreating your thumbnail cache using Command Prompt" above. But, it did not work for me.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Here is some more information. When I open a folder which has pictures in it, there is a blink thumbnail from left to right and up to down. After blinking, each file is displayed as an icon. You can see as my screen
 recorded below:<br />
<br />
</span><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6adedcc1-c725-4166-85e2-040e7dd32c79" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6adedcc1-c725-4166-85e2-040e7dd32c79" /></a><span><br />
<br />
<br />
This blink also </span><span>appears</span><span>&nbsp;when I scroll down (but not scroll up). In my opinion, this blink appears when windows wants to make a&nbsp;</span><span>thumbnail
 cache for each new picture.</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I hope this information can help you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thanks very much your support.</span><br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Have you installed Samsung PC suite on your computer? If no, then please install it and check.</p>
<p><br />
If you have already installed it then, uninstall it from <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Uninstall-or-change-a-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Programs and Features</a> and then download the latest PC suite from manufacturer’s website and install it.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
You may try accessing the contents in your phone through Mass storage option.</p>
<p><br />
This connection type allows you to easily drag and drop files from one location to another, just as you would with a USB drive or other mass storage device connected to your computer. In some phone models, you may need insert<br />
a memory card into your phone for the mass storage connection. To connect your mobile phone as a mass storage device,</p>
<p><br />
a In Idle mode, access Menu mode and open the <strong>setting </strong>menu.<br />
b Select the <strong>PC connection</strong> menu.<br />
c Select the <strong>mass storage </strong>option.<br />
d Press the Power/Menu exit key to return to Idle mode.<br />
e Connect your mobile phone to your PC with a PC data cable.<br />
Note: If a PC data cable is not supplied with your phone, you can buy one from<br />
your local Samsung dealer.<br />
f Manage your files as you would with a connected mass storage device.</p>
<p><br />
For further assistance I would recommend you to contact Samsung support team.<br />

<h2>            Video missing from recording made using Skype for business</h2>
                    I had recorded a conference call with a colleague of mine using Skype for business. The recording was for 2hr and 35min and the file was created (162MB). But the recording does not show the video. Only audio is available. How do i recover the recording.
 Can you please help me on this.

<p>Hi Rubin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your description, the recording of your meeting only recorded audio. For this issue, you can check if the steps below could help you recover the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Open File Explorer and navigate to <em><strong>%UserProfile%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Communicator\Recording Manager\Temporary Recording Files</strong></em>.<br />
2. Copy the folder of the problematic meeting recording and paste it to the desktop.<br />
3. Start a new Skype for Business Meeting with someone, please also <strong>enable audio and video</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
4. Start recording the meeting. At the moment you start recording, click <strong>
Pause </strong>button.&nbsp;<br />
5. There'll be a new-created folder after you starting recording. Please delete all files in this folder except the file named
<strong>lock.lock</strong>.<br />
6. Open the Desktop folder and copy the contents to the new-created folder. And then stop recording.<br />
7. Open Recording Manager. The meeting should start to be re-converted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For your reference, see&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/cloudyhappypeople/2018/03/26/arghmy-skype-for-business-recording-failed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/cloudyhappypeople/2018/03/26/arghmy-skype-for-business-recording-failed/</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if it fails to recover the meeting recording, you may need to record the meeting again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Marvin</p>

<p>Hello Xbox live forums. My [Mod removed] has the gamer tag [Mod removed]. [Mod removed] stands for smoking illegal narcotics: [Mod removed] and Thunder is a slang term for heroin: [Mod removed] and [Mod removed], who is a local [Mod removed]. Please have

<h2>            unable to view pictures in a series in Windows Photo Viewer</h2>
                    <p>Original Title - Windows Photo Viewer</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have noticed them when I am using the WIndows Photo Viewer to view a series of pictures and I use the RIGHT ARROW to view the pictures, it skips numbers. As an example, If I am looking at IMG_0033 and click the right arrow, the next image that appears
 is IMG_0035. In some cases, it will skip 2 or more photo's. I was wondering if anyone has seen this issue and if there is something to correct it.</p>
<p>

            <p>I see this bug as well and it is repeatable.</p>
<p>In a folder with 96 jpeg images, Photos app consistently skips image 61 while advancing in ascending order.&nbsp; If I view the images in reverse order, starting with the last image, Photos app will display #61 normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In a another folder with a different number of images, a different image is skipped but also works when viewing is reverse.</p>
<p>

<p>Photos version 15.1208.10480.0</p>

            <p>There is a Universal app called <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/network-speed-test/9wzdncrfhx52" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Network Speed Test</a>, developed by Microsoft.&nbsp; It's not very good though.&nbsp; There's also a new one from Netflix at
<a href="https://fast.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">fast.com</a>.&nbsp; It measures only download speed--no ping or upload speeds.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ookla is still the gold standard.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here are results from three tests, in this order: Microsoft Network Speed Test, Ookla,
 and Netflix fast.com:</p>

<h2>            Opening Files from FTP Connection in Windows Explorer</h2>
                    I have an FTP folder mapped in Windows Explorer. However when I try to open, for example, a Word Document by double-clicking, it doesn't use Microsoft Word, but still gives me the "Open with..." dialog box and all I have to choose from are Web browsers!
 Why can't it work just like any other mapped directory and use the app associated with that file type? How can I change this?

<p>Windows doesnt have a default FTP client program other than the browser.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You might want to download the ftp .docx or whatever file and then windows will open it properly from the downloaded location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Asus wifi/router offers optionally enabled &nbsp; FTP - Samba - &amp; Media servers.&nbsp; I've enable the Samba server and plugged-in a usb attached SSD drive &amp; access those as a normal file share \\RT-AC87U\Temp etc.</p>

Do I need it it? <br />
How can I put it back as it was?&nbsp; <br />

            <p>I encountered a rude Help Desk support today (9/18/2015 12 pm MST) when I was trying to get help with Windows 10 upgrade. I called 1-855-644-1932. After the Windows upgrade I got an empty screen on my laptop, with image of a Window and 3 little icons in
 the right lower corner. I called the support and they said I have to reset my computer to its original settings, I asked, is there another way to fixed that, but in return I was yelled at. I said that I would like to get another's person opinion, but he refused
 to transfer the call to somebody else, refused to say his name, and then simply hung up.</p>

    <title>Question about gamertag ban and missing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cristal connors  say:</h3>
<h2>            Question about gamertag ban and missing &#38;quot&#59;free&#38;quot&#59; gamertag change.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I'm having a couple of issues I hope someone can help me out with.<br />
First, my gamertag (Sexlexis) was banned a couple of days ago, and I'm curious what was deemed offensive about it, since it originally was accepted during my account setup, and the words "sex" and "sexy" still seem to make it through the filters when trying
 out new names for a gamertag. I have this nickname on many different websites and have never had an issue with it, as the word "sex" in itself may be in slight poor taste, but isn't offensive. I'd understand if the name was some sort of sex position or slang,
 but it's a completely made up nickname with zero context implied. I also understand if I'm not able to recover that gamertag, but I would still like some clarification in what determined it was offensive enough to ban.<br />
Second, my gamertag was changed to something random, without an opportunity for me to choose a new one. I've never changed my name since signing up for my Xbox profile, and when trying out new gamertags, the website even told me that I had one free name change
 that is available to every user. So tonight when I went to change my gamertag, it's telling me I need to pay $10 to change it. I'm wondering if it is possible to fix this error, and also perhaps credit an additional free name change to my account so I have
 the opportunity to change my gamertag from the random one that I was given, with my original free one available in the future if I end up wanting to change it again.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>Why have my speakers and headphones stopped working but I can still - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> iwantpie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why have my speakers and headphones stopped working but I can still get sound through USB&#63;</h2>
                    This morning both my headphones and my laptop speakers were working fine. Suddenly after lunch they stopped working. &nbsp;I am now unable to get any sound (but a slight crackling) from the headphone socket either with headphones or external speakers nor does
 the laptop make any sound through its onboard speakers. &nbsp;If I connect my external speakers to the laptop through a USB connection the sound works fine, but it won't work through a 3.5mm jack connection to the headphone socket.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tried disabling and re-enabling the sound device and that didn't help. &nbsp;I've tried Troubleshooting in Control Panel and that didn't detect a problem. &nbsp;Going to the Speakers in Hardware and Sound and running the test says everything is working fine.
 &nbsp;I have also made sure nothing is muted.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Help!</div>

            Thanks for your suggestions, guys. &nbsp;I actually got home from work today and turned my laptop on and it all worked again without me doing anything. &nbsp;It's odd because I tried a restart (obviously) last night with no effect. &nbsp;The only thing I can think is
 that it was overheating as it had been on for quite a while before I turned it off last night!

    <title>Cannot Remove &#34;Con&#34; Folder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cameron wethly  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot Remove &#34;Con&#34; Folder</h2>
                    I'd encountered this issue during my usual photo edits.<br />
<br />
Through Adobe Lightroom, I was exporting completed photos into folders that I'd create in-program. To be more specific: after clicking "Export to...", a dialogue box opens showing me my File Explorer, so I may choose where to export said photos (as similar
 to most programs). Within this window, I created a New Folder (rather than doing so in the
<em>actual </em>File Explorer as I usually would) titled "Con". Let it be known that, while I was not aware prior,
<strong>I am now aware of the fact that I should be unable to create a "Con" folder</strong>. However, I have.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I was eventually left with a folder that Windows is confused about. It reads as a file folder, but does not react to deletion or the Recycling Bin. It cannot be moved to another folder, as I am met with a window explaining that another file (note that in this
 case, it does not recognize it as a folder) named "Con" already exists, even though the folder I'd intended to move it to was empty. If I attempt to open the folder, I am regularly met with an
<strong>Invalid Handle</strong> window. So this folder cannot be moved, deleted, or opened, because the computer is confused as to it's use. I am also incapable of renaming it, as it receives the same Invalid Handle message.
<br />
<br />
This would all be fine if it weren't on my Desktop, as I could just ignore it. But as it's taking up space there, I'd like to delete it, if anyone can help with that.<br />
<br />
<em>Also, I'd attempted the following in Command Prompt: "fsutil reparsepoint delete con" as stated by another person suffering the same issue, but to a different result. It did not recognize the name. As a test, I attempted "random folder" as a command to
 see the response to a non-existent folder name. As is typical, the response was "...'random folder' is not recognized as..." However, when I'd attempted to type "Con", it responded with: "...'&lt;blank space&gt;' is not recognized as..." It would not show "Con"
 as a command, and instead left it blank, as though nothing were input. Don't know if this has anything to do with it.</em><br />

<p>Hi Don,<br />
<br />
<br />
This can be caused by a software compatibility issue, or due to a malware or virus infection.
<strong>Run time Error 339</strong> occurs if the software was released without sufficient run time files.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, kindly make sure if the software is compatible with Windows 10. You can run the System File Checker and DISM tool.
<strong>System File Checker (SFC)</strong> is a utility in Windows that scans for corrupted Windows system files. If it finds a problem, it will try to replace the problematic system files from a cached version that’s on your PC. If SFC can’t replace the files,
 the <strong>Deployment Image Service and Management Tool</strong> (DISM) can check the corrupted files then download and replace the files through Windows Update.</p>
<ol>
<li>Press Windows key + X on your keyboard.<br />
</li><li>Choose Command Prompt (Admin).<br />
</li><li>Copy or type each command followed by hitting Enter.<br />
<em><strong>sfc /scannow</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</strong></em></li></ol>
<p>Running a full scan of Windows Defender can help. This is to check any malicious software or adware that might be causing the issue. You can check this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17464/windows-defender-help-protect-computer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> on how to protect your computer using Windows Defender.<br />

<h2>            Skype is signing me in using old data.</h2>
                    I tried to log in today and noticed that half my contacts were gone/offline(newer contacts didn't show up) and my profile picture was what it was a few years ago. It seems that Skype is using data from 3 years ago... I've tried updating, restarting Skype,
 and restarting the pc. Nothing seems to be fixing the problem. From another account(my brother's), It says that my contact is not added even though on my screen, it says it is. No profile pictures show up and I'm unable to accept any requests.&nbsp;

</p><p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community forum!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this can be confusing sometimes. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You may do the reset password first using this <a href="https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>&nbsp;and check if there's another account under your email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you created the Skype account long ago, most probably, you have created the account&nbsp;under a Skype name.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the recovery link I've provided you above, once you clicked "Continue" upon entering the email address associated with the account, it will show you the lists of Skype accounts under your email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you see a&nbsp;Skype name under your email address, please reset the password for that account. Then, once the reset password has been successfully done, open the Skype application&nbsp;and please make sure that you sign in using the Skype name and the new password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also try signing in using email address and its password if in case you have created the Skype account under your email account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the above information work, please do not hesitate to reply to this post. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

    <title>HP Proliant N40L - 8.1 installation freeze, network card issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mr zk  say:</h3>
<h2>            HP Proliant N40L - 8.1 installation freeze, network card issue &#58;&#40;</h2>
                    Per research and 3 update downloads (from 8.0 to 8.1) including a freshly installed Windows 8.0 machine, I have discovered that the reason my machine will not install the 8.1 update is because the network card driver is not bundled with Windows 8.1.&nbsp; I
 have attempted both the upgrade as well as a fresh install and neither method works.<br />
<br />
After disabling the network card, 8.1 successfully installs.&nbsp; If I re-enable the card after install, the system does not boot up.&nbsp; If I fresh install with the card enabled, the install hangs on detecting new devices.<br />
Details of the machine can be found here:<br />
http://www8.hp.com/za/en/products/proliant-servers/product-detail.html?oid=4248009#!tab=specs<br />
<br />
Please could you assist with a method to install the product so as to allow me to use my network card?&nbsp; The machine is currently useless since I cannot do any network activity (with the disabled network card in the BIOS).<br />
<br />
The simple solution would be to purchase a new network card but I do not want to do this, I am sure that a driver can either be written or some sort of fix may be available.<br />
<br />
Please could you assist.<br />
Thanks<br />

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This issue occurs if the network card is not compatible with Windows 8.1 operating system. I would suggest you to try installing the network card drivers in compatibility
 mode and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p><span>a. Right click on setup file.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Click on
<b>Properties</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Click on
<b>Compatibility</b> tab.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Put a check mark on
<b>Run this program in compatibility mode for</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>e. Select
<b>Windows 8</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>f. Put a check mark on
<b>Run this program as an administrator</b> under <b>Privilege</b>
<b>Level</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know the results. If the issue persists, we’re here to help.</span></p>

            Struggling with this very annoying upgrade. Did the same as Mr ZK. One time I actually could boot into Windows with NIC-enabled from Bios and NIC and it's drivers showed up just as in Win8 and _not_ in any fault mode. Though network connection showed initially
 as "disabled". Tried to enable it and now after restart attempt system freezes at startup, without any indication of system trying to access my SSD. Only NIC light flicks on kind of repeating sequenze.<br />
<br />
Now cleverly Win8 has ditched F8 option to enable boot in safe mode to easily try your solution. Sigh..<br />

Ok, got into safe mode with NIC-enabled. Only to find out that "HP NIC107i PCIe Gigabit Server Adapter" does have drivers in HP website only for Windows server versions.<br />
<br />
Why in earth does it work out-of-box in Windows 8, but driver support has been lost in Windows 8.1?<br />
<br />
*addition*<br />
Tried to remove driver in safemode and reboot. It boot's into login splash. Time and date works so it's not 100% halt, screen shows no NIC-connection, but keyboard and mouse doesn't work at all so basically you can't do anything at that point.<br />

            Didn't work for me, because drivers in Windows 8 are offered by MS. From HP's site I can find only server versions which won't install to 8.1.<br />
<br />
I tried to change driver to Broadcom NeXtreme gigabit ethernet, but it doesn't work either (was suggested on some server discussions).<br />

I've also been down this road. I also contacted hp and they simply responded by saying that the 8.1 is not supported. In my head... don't other manufacturers also use that network card...
<div>Thanks for your post... my next step is to try a wireless card I have lying around. Really sucks and I share your frustration regarding it working on windows 8!</div>

            Hi Microsoft,<br />
<br />
So I tried all of the above, in (with disabled card which of course did not installed) and out of safe mode however this did not work.<br />
<br />
Its really strange that the card was working fine in Windows 8!<br />
<br />
Had exactly the same symptoms as the others with keyboard\mouse freeze with enabled network card.<br />
<br />
I contacted HP directly and they said they only support 2012 server drivers, which I installed, which did not work out either.<br />

+1 to this. So it would seem we are at an impasse. Both Microsoft and HP seem to have dropped support for this system. Maybe for some reason neither vendor want a workstation OS on a server? I think this is a bad representation for Microsoft. I am a big fan
 of Windows 8 and have been an early adopter and champion of it. I think 8.1 is a great twist on an already great OS, however this has soured my opinion of the both the OS and Microsoft, as well as the Windows store for throwing out the virtually anonymous<span>
 0xC1900101-0x30018</span>&nbsp; error which took me over a week to troubleshoot to figure out this was the issue. I wasted so much time having to take an image of my machine, do a clean install of Windows 8, patch it because the store wouldn't show the 8.1 upgrade
 until I had... wasted so much time only to get to this metaphorical dead end. Now what to do? Do I have to conisder a new network card now to enjoy 8.1? Either that or face only having support up to 2015. 3 years out of an OS which was supposed to be Microsofts
 best OS ever? Now that IS a bad joke!<br />
