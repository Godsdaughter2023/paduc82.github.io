<p>Chrome is a memory hog.&nbsp; So, if you have a low memory machine, that could be the problem.</p>

<h2>            HOW CAN I FIND MY CPU SPEED IN REAL TIME &#63;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;Hi- I'd like to know how I can find the CPU speed.&nbsp; I downloaded Microsoft Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor &amp; the results are showing me the speed is 800 MHz today.&nbsp; I ran the check a couple months ago &amp; it showed me the speed was 1.6 GHz.&nbsp; The computer rating
 when new is 1.7 GHz.&nbsp; The only hardware changes&nbsp; I have made is doubled the RAM memory &amp; replaced my HDD with a Sandisk Plus 120 GB SSD (Solid State Drive).&nbsp; Could there be a problem with my CPU?&nbsp; The processor is an AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual Core Processor&nbsp; TK-53

<p>
</p><p>3 weeks ago, I formated entirely my computer and reinstalled Windows 8.1. Everything works better than before, except some of my programs which require .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 to work. Everytime I try to install it, I get a 0x800f080c error.</p>
<p>I searched for a few days, tried in the Control Panel, using DISM on my installation disc, transfering packages from another computer where 3.5 was successfully installed, uninstalled two security updates, tried a few unofficial offline installers, ...</p>
<p class="contentStandard">In the feature list of Control Panel I can't see .NET Framework 3.5, 3.0 or 2.0 anywhere, only 4.5.&nbsp;<em>dism /Online /Get-Features</em> tells me that NetFx3 doesn't exist.</p>

<p>It seems that Poser 6 system requirements are Windows 2000/XP only.</p>
<p>Have you tried installing in Compatibility mode?</p>
<p>If that doesn't work then I suspect you have run into a dead end, and your only option is to upgrade to Poser 8</p>

    <title>Strange behaviour , disk usage to 100&#37; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> amangrover  say:</h3>
<h2>            Strange behaviour , disk usage to 100&#37;</h2>
                    <p>My windows 10 machine is showing some strange behaviour since this morning. In the morning when I started my laptop, it was very laggy and sometimes irresponsive. When I opened the Task Manager it showed me my disk usage is 100%. When I looked under processes,
 System and Compressed memory was hogging on the disk usage. After about an hour when I checked again, windows exporer.exe was taking up all the memory, again after 1 more&nbsp;hour Nvidia streamer service was taking all memory&nbsp;and then I left for work with my system
 on. When I came back (after about 9 hours) the disk usage is still at 99% and now Windows Anitmalware executable is hogging onto the memory. I cannot understand what's causing this strange behaviour. I even tried to reset my system completely but it also failed
 saying the reset process could not be completed (after 30%). How can I resolve this issue? I don't care if resetting the system is the only solution even if it&nbsp;wipes all settings and app as long as it works.</p>
<p>Here is a screenshot of the task manager at the time when I returned home:</p>

                    Long story short I had a class mate install windows 7 on my windows 8 laptop it worked for a while then messed up and I upgraded to windows 10 but it still needs to be activated but I also want to replace the hard drive but I will do that last. I will
 first buy windows 10 then the hard drive last when I get more money for it but I know when you replace a hard drive you will need to reinstall the OS. So I will be able to use the same activation key or need to buy another one?&nbsp;

                    <p>This thing seems to haunt my Windows 10 since "some patch or other"! </p>
<p>NOW when attempting to UPLOAD a file to Fusion360 (using the Fusion360 upload mechanism in Autodesk Fusion360 The darned Broadcast DVR starts up and starts eating memory like a hungry ghost.
</p>
<p>I go into Task Manager and kill the thing BUT if the Fusion file upload has issues and I restart it...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Broadcast DVR comes back from the dead! </p>
<p>
</p><p>I previously went into the registry and tried to kill it. Darn thing has more than nine lives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can ANYONE at Microsoft help us get rid of this? Tell me what to do. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Now i worry that every time patch Tuesday comes stomping in whatever I do this BEAST will reappear.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>HINT: I'll never buy an XBOX if it is anything like the Broadcast DVR that it spawned!</p>

<p>I did as suggested but even that "tech" forum might not be the right place. Others have expressed issues on the web with this "ill-behaved beast" and it seems that MS support isn't that interested which is why "others" fight it without help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I "suspect" that some if not all of the user suggestions are "reversed" when MS does an upgrade or patch. I know they change my keyboard&nbsp; from changes I've made.

                    I have a local account set up on my computer and almost every time I try to use search (either by opening start menu and typing, or by clicking search icon) it simply doesn't work.&nbsp; I need to go into task manager and end the task "cortana".&nbsp; Then search
 will work for about an hour or so.&nbsp; I put a debugger on the process "cortana" while it was in the not working state, and attempting to search caused the following exception to be thrown:<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/44e8d101-3c1a-4d15-91d3-06ca96ce23db" />.&nbsp;
 It seems to me a bug, but maybe there is a better work-around than going in to task manager whenever I need to search?

<p><span>From all kinds of fixes offered in all Microsoft Windows 10 forums, I believe I found a
<strong>permanent fix</strong>. Frustrated users need take a deep breath and follow carefully a collection of instructions. They should NOT fear things like
<em>Command Prompt</em> or <em>PowerShell</em>. In truth, Windows beginning with version 3 is nothing more than DOS with a “pretty” face (GUI is the euphemism for that).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The main root of this Windows 10 debacle was begotten by the dreadful
<strong>“Microsoft account”</strong>, as I have written in these forums. Then, the forced adoption of the
<strong>“Cloud”</strong>.</span></p>

<h2>            Calendar , weather and Store tiles stop working in Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Suddenly these tiles stop updating. </p>
<p>Some days ago, the weather tile stopped. I tried resizing it from wide to medium and it worked again&nbsp;but only for like...2 days. After that the Store tile and Calendar tile stopped too.</p>
<p>I tried to unpin/pin but it doesn't work. Same for resizing. I tried to uninstall them but that can't be done, can't be uninstalled.</p>
<p>I have tried running the App Troubleshooter but it always say that the issue can't be detected. I'm not in a metered connection.</p>
<p>There were some updates recently so I wonder if this is caused by the windows updates.</p>
<p>Need help!</p>

            What worked for me was to enter a dummy appointment for the current day&nbsp;into the calendar. Immediately afterwards the tile began updating as usual and continues to do so.&nbsp;This is not a solution in the strict sense, but at least it brought the live tile
 back to life - until next time.

<h2>            External drive not showing up on PC, Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Ever since the large update that occurred in September 2016 for windows 10, I have been unable to connect to any external hard drive. when the device is plugged in it plays the little auto play chime and shows up under device manager, but will not open to
 allow access to the files. I have tried searching for solutions and haven't found anything to work. Under disk management I am unable to select what drive to make it. All drivers are up to date. All updates are applied to the PC. Everything displays that it
 is working properly, but I cannot access any external hard drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently experiencing this problem across multiple PC, with none of them able to open any of multiple external hard drives.&nbsp;</p>

<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />1. Are you talking about audio recordings downloaded and saved by you OR are these recordings still in the cloud?
<br />
<br />2. What is your OS and what is your Skype version?
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

            Hi Monica
<br />
<br />The recording is normally kept in the contacts conversation window. 
<br />
<br />How to Save a Skype Call Recording
<br />
<br />    From your chat:
<br />        On desktop: Click More options menu represented by the three vertical dots.
<br />
<br />Download and save the recording as an MP4 file.
<br />
<br />    On desktop: Select Save to "Downloads" to save the file directly to your Downloads folder or select Save as to choose where to save it.

            Monica, I have been very specific, its supposed to be in the conversation window of the person you were chatting/recording. It appears the recording was not successful, thats why you are not seeing it.
<br />
<br />I would prefer you not mark my replies as 'The poster reported that this response does not resolve their issue.' while I am trying to help you.
<br />
<br />
<br />I am trying to help you, but if you mark my replies as unhelpful, it makes it even more difficult to do so. Others will also be less willing to help you with your problem too.
<br />
<br />Ignore when you are prompted to give a rating (Yes or No) until we actually arrive at a solution that works for you.

                    <p>My headset works perfectly fine in a computer, it has a 3,5mm jack. When I plug it in it seems to have a loose connection (it crackles), I bought a stereo headset adapter (official). I could hear the game sounds through my headset finally again, but my microphone was then disfunctioning? Can any one help?</p>

            <p>Hello Doctor,</p><p><br /></p><p>I have two of the Xbox One Stereo Headset Adapter and Headsets and all seem to work very well. The only problem I seem to have is forgetting to toggle off the mute button. However, I'm concerned when you say "it seems to have a loose connection (it crackles)". If this is a physical connection issue, we maybe limited in what we can do. But, I would be curios that when&nbsp;you plug the headset directly&nbsp;into the controller, the Xbox should automatically recognize a compatible headset. And, in doing so it automatically makes Headset volume, Headset chat volume and Mic&nbsp;monitoring settings available right at &gt; Settings menu directly off the Home screen (kind of cool isn't it). At the top of the list of&nbsp;headset controls you will see Headset mic Off/On. With that said, I would still recommend&nbsp;that you follow up with "<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/accessories/wired-headset-help" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox One

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Actually the quickest way to do so is to right click on the picture you want to put as your wallpaper/desktop background and select '<strong>set as desktop background</strong>'.</p>
<p>If you want to change the postion of your wallpaper meaning stretch, fit, centered then right click on your desktop and chose<strong>personalise&gt;desktop background</strong>. From there you will be able to change your picture position.</p>
<p>Hope I was able to help you,</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Andrew</p>

    <title>why is my media library not visible on other machines in my homegroup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ninjatjj  say:</h3>
<h2>            why is my media library not visible on other machines in my homegroup or my PS3&#63;</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I am relatively tech savvy but I have a problem with getting my network to recognise my media library on one of my Windows 7 PCs.<br />
<br />
I am wanting to use Windows Media Player 12 to do this, I have ran TVersity successfully but I would rather use the stock capability of the operating system.<br />
<br />
I am fairly sure I had this working before:<br />
Network and Sharing Center -&gt; Choose homegroup and sharing options -&gt;&nbsp; Stream my pictures, music and video (enabled)<br />
<br />
On a remote machine I can see the libraries when I use Windows Explorer -&gt; Homegroup<br />
I can see Music, Videos and Pictures, I also see folders "My Music" and "My Pictures" (not sure why these last two are split out into their own sections)<br />
When I open up Windows Media Player though I see nothing under "Other Libraries"<br />
<br />
If I open Windows Media Player on the local machine I can see the other machines libraries under "Other Libraries" just fine. I don't see individual folders for "My Music" or "My Pictures" though.<br />
<br />
I have tried:<br />
Resetting the firewall<br />
Netstat -an -b, I can see wmpnetwork sat listening on 2869 and some svchost.exe on UDP 1900 so I am sure the process is running.<br />
<br />
I wondered if it was a permissions thing but I have tried so many different things I thought I would open the question up to the community. I did find that somehow "My Music" and "My Pictures" were not shared with the homegroup but I changed that.<br />
<br />
Also, (and I guess naturally considering the situation) I can't see the PC as a DLNA server on my PS3.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any guidance!<br />
Tom<br />

            I went with the above approach. I also added a task (.bat file) into task scheduler with "run with highest privileges" to net sh stop/start the services in the correct order as above after a 90 second sleep - not ideal but it works!<br />

<h2>            Trouble installing drivers for HP PSC 1410 on computer running Win 7 Ultimate &#40;64-bit&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been using my HP PSC 1410 with my old computer for quite a while now, without any problems. However, since the time I upgraded my computer and OS (Win 7 Ultimate (64-bit) recently, I find that, although the printer is printing my documents, and even
 scanning them to a limited extent, there is always an exclamation mark icon appearing against the device, indicating that it is not working as it is supposed to. I have tried downloading driver files from the HP website, but the problem refuses to go away.
 Any suggestions, anyone?</p>

<h3> ade38  say:</h3>
<h2>            Application shortcut does not show in Apps screen</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I am developing an application that runs on windows 7 and windows 8. I would like to have a shortcut to my application and to the uninstaller in windows 7 start menu and in windows 8 "Apps" screen.<br />
I have no problem on windows 7 but on windows 8 my uninstall shortcut does not show (while the application shortcut does).<br />
<br />
Both application and uninstall shortcut are located in "C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\MyApp\". They are named "MyappName" and "uninstall - MyappName". Do you know why the uninstall shorcut does not show in the Apps screen? Is there a
 naming convention?<br />
<br />
Thank you for your help.<br />

What I put in "C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\MyApp\" are shortcuts not the exe. That's why I do not understand why the uninstall shortcut is not present in the "apps" screen while the shortcut to launch my application is visible.<br />
<br />
I have an install program for my application that automatically create these shortcuts. When I install my application and I quickly go to the "apps" screen, I can actually see the uninstall shortcut but it disappears 3 seconds later... Is windows 8 hiding my
 shortcut on purpose?<br />
<br />
What are the rules for a shortcut to show or not in the "Apps" screen when it is present in "C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\" folder? Are there some shortcut options which can make a shortcut disappear like this? Does Windows 8 automatically
 hide uninstall shortcuts? If this is the case, how does Windows 8 detect uninstall shortcuts? What is the criteria?<br />
<br />
Thank you for your help

            <p>I am observing this behavior as well. I can only assume it's considered "by design", but I sure would like to know why someone thinks this is good "design".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows is handling uninstall shortcuts explicitly. Interestingly, it is going so far as to identify the appropriate version of msiexec.exe for the target platform of the executable. I accidentally misconfigured the installer for my x64 (64-bit)&nbsp;version
 of my program, such that it was using CSIDL_SYSTEMX86 instead of CSIDL_SYSTEM for the folder in which to find msiexec.exe, and Windows did
<em>not </em>hide the shortcut in that case. But it <em>does </em>hide the shortcut in the Start page when using CSIDL_SYSTEMX86 for the x86 (32-bit) version of my program, and when using CSIDL_SYSTEM for the x64 version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I.e. it's matching the target platform of msiexec.exe to the target platform of the program itself and only if they are the same is the shortcut hidden.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note also:</p>
<ul>
<li>the shortcut is simply being hidden in the Start screen's Apps&nbsp;page; it is correctly installed in the Start Menu directory on the disk (and can in fact be successfully run from there).</li><li>Running the 32-bit msiexec.exe will in fact uninstall the 64-bit version of the program&nbsp;(at least for my program, as there are no custom uninstall steps). So ironically, by misconfiguring the installer, I can work around this issue for the x64 version of
 my program.</li></ul>
<p>I have been searching the web for some explanation and so far have been unsuccessful. I can only guess that Microsoft decided they don't want users accidentally clicking the uninstall shortcut on the Start screen's App page, and so they just hide it.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I know what the reasoning is. I never noticed this before, but if you right-click on a program shortcut in the Start screen's&nbsp;Apps page, there are several options, including an "Uninstall" option. So I guess the idea is that since the user can uninstall
 the app via the right-click menu, they can "tidy up" the Apps page by hiding the installer-provided uninstall shortcut.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, there are at least two problems with their approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>The right-click menu uninstall is not very discoverable, especially to those already familiar with Windows (i.e. who already know and expect to find a specific kind of user interface)</li><li>Selecting the "Uninstall" options from the right-click menu does not actually uninstall the program. All it does is open the Add/Remove Programs control panel, where you then have to go find the program you wanted to uninstall, select it, and then click
 the "Uninstall" button there.</li></ul>
<p>Why they didn't just map the "Uninstall" menu item to the uninstall link they <em>
know</em> is there and are hiding from the user, I have no idea. I guess it's just part of the usual half-assery that lies behind much of Microsoft's Windows UI design decisions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But at least I think there's no mystery anymore about why Windows is doing this&nbsp;(at least not for me).</p>

<h2>            lost partition letter and name, suddenly</h2>
                    <p>My Win 7 machine "lost" a drive while I was away for a couple days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have several HDDs with partitions. Disk 0 has two partitions, one (the first) for recorded TV files (formerly VideoStuff: &nbsp;S) and one (the second) for old backups - (Backups2: Q). While I was away the drive S was set to record some Olympics and could possibly
 have filled . . . </p>
<p>
</p><p>Drive S seems to have disappeared.&nbsp; In Disk Management it shows it with no info. But Q allowed me to copy a file into it via Explorer - it had been empty. So the disk is there and working, but Windows lost the "defining" data of the S volume.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Disk Management, when I right-click and try either Change Drive Letter . . .&nbsp; or Properties for this "lost" partition, I get an error dialog box re: "Operation failed to complete because the Disk management console view is not up to date. Refresh the
 view by using the refresh task. If the problem persist close the Disk Management console, then restart Disk Management or restart the computer"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have refreshed the view, and restarted the program, and rebooted the computer, all more than once. The error box occurs every time I right-click Change Drive . . . or Properties.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help, please. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a screenshot of the management screen with the error box.</p>

            <p>More info regarding the problem. In looking at my recorded videos, which the record program automatically switched to a different&nbsp; (available!) drive, it appears the issue started a couple days earlier - I just hadn't noticed the lack of that drive in Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On that day, I had serious Windows issues.&nbsp; It abruptly failed (hung) at startup after hanging while restarting during an Avast Virus program update, and rebooting put me at "Windows Repair" which ultimately failed. I went through multiple reboots&nbsp; and did
 a full restore from on image and more reboots before one time opting for Start Windows Normally instead of Repair, and boom - back to normal operations. Since I had data backed up just before the issues - no ill effects and normal operations.&nbsp; But it would
 appear that likely that it when the partition/drive/volume: formerly "S", went away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That may provide helping clues, but the lack of "S" and use of its partition still exist.</p>

<p>its seems that in order to fix this problem.... open divice manager locate the drive under disk drives, uninstall the drive, unplug it, plug it back in and it will reinstall the drivers and the drive should now work.</p>
<p>Usnure as to why this has to be done on a plug and play device and why windows 7 couldnt istall the correct driver in the first place but it worked for me. goodluck</p>

<p>ReplyIn reply to MrMachete's post on August 12, 2010&nbsp; <br />
... While messing with diskpart in an attempt to solve my problem I noticed AUTOMOUNT in the list of commands.&nbsp; This command "enables and disables the automatic mounting of basic volumes."&nbsp; On my system, automount was turned off.&nbsp; After enabling it using the
 command, I found my remote hard drive in the device manager, and uninstalled the driver.&nbsp; Unplugging and plugging the drive caused the computer to again install the driver, but this time it mounted it in My Computer as well.&nbsp; Now my device was visible in said
 location, but for some reason my access was denied.&nbsp; I resolved this by enabling sharing under the advanced sharing tab in the device properties.&nbsp; Problem solved.&nbsp; I can now use the drive and did not have to use disk management or format anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Yay! This worked for me using Windows 7! Here is the step by step version:</p>
<p>1. From RUN, type diskpart and click OK<br />
2. At the DISKPART prompt, type automount<br />
3. From the Device Manager , find the device not being recognized. Mine was under Storage Devices, I think.<br />
4. Right click on the device and choose Properties<br />
5. Click on the Driver tab<br />
6. Click Uninstall<br />
7. Unplug the device<br />
8. Plug the device back in</p>
<p>&nbsp;The driver was automatically installed, it's mounted to My Computer and I immediately got the AutoPlay window."<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;My comments-additions<br />
&nbsp;I had tried the diskpart steps, like others, but the "volume" was not recognized - nothing there. So I tried the steps just above and they worked - the partion/volume/whatever now shows in Explorer with all data intact.<br />
&nbsp;Step 3: To get there: Control Panel - System - Device Driver - Disk Drives, then the disk that has the partition/volume wanted. Mine was a hard drive, not external.<br />
&nbsp;Step 7: at some point a reboot is also required by Windows because of the driver uninstall - I don't recall the exact order.</p>

<h2>            Why can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t I spend MY Microsoft account money to purchase an Xbox Live Gold subscription&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I bought a pre-paid card at WalMart and was hoping to come home and re-new my gold subscription, only to find out that Xbox doesn't allow you any option to purchase one month of gold with the money that is in your Microsoft account.<br />
So why the <strong>[Mod Removed]</strong> is there no option to buy the same denominations of Xbox live subscriptions through Microsoft as you can in-store? And why can I not use the
<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong>&nbsp;money I paid to Microsoft, to purchase my Microsoft Xbox Live subscription?<br />
Someone please explain how this is logical or reasonable in any manner!</p>

<p>subscriptions can not be purchased without a payment Instrument, your local currency gift Card is no actual payment Instrument, thats why it wont work.</p>
<p>on xbox.com i see 1m and 12m subscription available, while my console allows 1m, 3m and 12m, though 1m and 12m makes sense for those who never are sure if they quit the next month or who are sure they stay for Long. on ppc Prices are already reduced compared
 to systempurchase so the reason why there is no 1m propably is: because it wont benefit? who knows..</p>

<p>What do you mean when you say that Movie Maker doesn't save the photos?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Movie Maker isn't actually storing *any* media within the project file. It only references the files as they exist on your computer. Usually you import your photos and videos onto your PC. Then you add them to a project so you can preview how they will appear
 together. But the preview is dynamically loading the actual media from your computer each time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you save your project and reopen it, Movie Maker will recheck the original locations to find the source media files. If it can't find something, it won't be able to preview the clips and photos anymore. Is that what you are seeing? Are you seeing a yellow
 triangle with an exclamation point? If so, that's what's happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One common way this happens is if you are adding photos or videos that are stored on removable media (e.g. directly from a camera or SD card) and then you remove the card but still expect them to still be in the project.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another way is if you rename folders of files, delete files or change there location. In any of those cases, Movie Maker can't reload the media the next time you start up the project.</p>

            You must activate Windows. The fact that it is installed in Boot Camp doesn't change that.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no option in Windows to change the color of the progress bar. I would suggest you to browse the Internet using search engine and look for applications (or even themes)
 that can change the color of the progress bar.</p>

            Yes, its called Skype Translator:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34542/how-do-i-set-up-and-use-skype-translator?q=skype+translator" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34542/how-do...</a>
<br />
<br />        In Skype (version 8) for desktop: Right click on your contact and click view profile or you can go to your chat with them and click their name at the top. Click Start translator. A new translated chat will be created.\
<br />
<br />        In Skype on Windows 10: Right click on your contact and click view profile or you can go to your chat with them and click their name at the top. Click Start translator. A new translated chat will be created.
<br />
<br />        In Skype (version 8) on mobile: In the chats screen, tap and hold on your contact and tap view profile or you can go to your chat with them and tap on their name at the top. Tap Start translator. A new translated chat will be created.
<br />
<br />    In your translated chat you will be prompted to choose your preferred languages and whether you want a female or male voice to represent you during voice and video calls. The languages will be pre-populated but you can also change them.  
<br />
<br />    During your conversation, you will see your messages as they are originally typed and the translation in your preferred languages.
<br />
<br />    Note: Call captioning is available on Skype (version 8) and on Skype for Windows 10. To make a translated audio or video call, click on the audio or video call icon in your conversation. Your voice will be translated and the translation will also be shown as a caption in your call window. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Your translated chat will continue to be available in your recent chats with that person. If you want to start a translated chat with someone else, you'll need to start translator with them in the same way.
<br />
<br />Important: A translated chat will only support you and a single contact. If you try to add another participant or bot to your translated chat, you will get a message that the translations will no longer work until the added participant is removed. Once they are removed, you will see your translations continue as normal.
