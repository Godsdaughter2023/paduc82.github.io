    <title>How can I extract the year from a Excel 2010 cell with a date&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How can I extract the year from a Excel 2010 cell with a date&#63;</h2>
                    I have tried using the function =year(B174) for data that is formatted as dd/mm/yyyy, but, for example, for 1/20/1996, the formula returns 6/18/1905.
<br />
<br />
I have tried changing the date to a serial number then using the year function. I have tried to use the =RIGHT function for the last 4 characters.&nbsp; I have formatted the date as text, as general, etc and then tried the functions. Nothing seems to work.<br />
<br />
Any help?<br />

            <p>Be sure the cell with the formula in it is formatted as GENERAL.&nbsp; The result for 1/20/1996 is being shown as 6/18/1905 because the cell with the formula in it has automatically been formatted as a date by Excel (just another example of when a helpful feature
 becomes a big hindrance and source of confusion).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically, because Excel is auto-formatting that cell, it is then taking the result of YEAR(B174), which is 1996, and interpreting that as a number of days since Jan 1, 1900 and that turns out to be 6/18/1905.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the feedback.&nbsp; If you would mark my initial reply as "ANSWER" it would help by placing this in the "Answered" list so that others with a similar problem can find it more easily if they have the same or a similar problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes, Excel just gets overzealous in its efforts to make things easier - and just makes them harder instead.&nbsp; Not only dates get treated this way, but also other unique formats like currency can be treated similarly and unexpectedly.</p>

<h2>            Incrementing Cell References</h2>
                    <p>I have a very simple formula =A10+A11 in B11.&nbsp; I then realised I needed an extra row immediately above the formula, but when I added it, the first reference incremented, but the second did not, so I ended up with =A10+A12.&nbsp; I wanted both&nbsp;references to increment,
 to =A11+A12.&nbsp; I am still at the design stage, so it is likely I will need some more rows, so how do I ensure both cell references increment when I insert new rows.&nbsp; I am using Ecel 2010.</p>
<p>Grateful for any ideas.</p>

            <p>Well that's how excel behaves when you Insert/Delete Rows.. This behavior makes it almost always refer to the Right Cells when Rows/Columns are inserted/Deleted..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give this a Try.. Select the whole of row 11 and Use Short Keys Ctrl along with + to insert a row.. See if that helps.. :) Not very sure if that will give you what you want..

            <p>You may use this formula at B11.</p>
<p>
</p><p>=SUM(OFFSET(A11,0,0,-2))</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now whenever you will insert new row/s just above the formula, it will always sum last 2 rows only.</p>
<p>Hope it helps.</p>

    <title>Access randomly denied to different accounts in Outlook 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bella angela  say:</h3>
<h2>            Access randomly denied to different accounts in Outlook 2010</h2>
                    <p>I have six email accounts running in Outlook 2010/Windows 7 (upgraded from Outlook 2007/Windows XP Pro&nbsp;in Feb):&nbsp; 1 Exchange account, 1 IMAP account (AOL), and 4 POP accounts (1 Yahoo, 3 AOL).&nbsp; Everything runs/sends/receives/synchs just fine when I launch
 Outlook.&nbsp;&nbsp; At least once a day, however, I will get a send/receive error on one account and will get an error message that I don't have permission to access that account's&nbsp;folder when I try to open it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The problem account is random as is the timing, although it never happens to the Exchange account.&nbsp; Most often it happens after my system has been inactive long enough to go to sleep, but not always.&nbsp; If I exit and restart Outlook, the problem goes away.&nbsp;
 I never had this problem with the exact same accounts before the upgrade.&nbsp; What's going on and how can I make it stop?</p>
<p>I'm running a laptop on a wireless network, but most of the time it's plugged into the power supply and connected to the network&nbsp;via the ethernet cable.</p>

            Then clarify this statement: "I will get a send/receive error on one account" Which account? Are you expecting autopolling to work when your PC is in sleep mode? It won't, of course.

            <p>If you re-read my original question, you'll see, "<em>The problem account is <u>
random</u></em> as is the timing although it never happens to the Exchange account." That means never happens to the Exchange account but that it happens to one of the five remaining accounts,
<em>but not always the same account</em>, and&nbsp;without any discernible pattern.&nbsp; If it happened to the same account all the time, or if I didn't have access to one particular account at all at any time, or if it happened predictably after a particular action,
 I would have said so.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Also, I KNOW autopolling won't happen when my PC is in sleep mode.&nbsp;Besides, how could I get a send/receive error if Outlook weren't polling?&nbsp; I said, "Most often it happens
<em>after </em>my system has been inactive long enough to go to sleep, but not always."&nbsp; That means that
<em>sometimes</em>&nbsp;<em><u>after</u></em> the computer has been in sleep mode and <em>
after</em> it wakes up, Outlook polls ALL the accounts, but returns an error message for one of the accounts (again,<em> not always the same account</em>) and denies me access to that account folder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although I assumed it was obvious ("If I exit and restart Outlook..."), I probably should have said that it also happens when the computer is active and Outlook is minimized, but when I haven't actually been IN Outlook for a while.&nbsp; I do see the Desktop
 Alerts and the&nbsp;message icon shows up&nbsp;in my system tray, letting me know that it is polling and that I have at least one new, unread message.&nbsp;&nbsp;I probably should have given the exact error message from the Send/receive dialog as well, but it usually happens
 in the background and -- even though I've been trying to force it since I decided to report it by&nbsp;manually triggering the send/receive and watching the polling progress&nbsp;-- as is often the case, the problem has not occurred again today.&nbsp; I will be sure to post
 the Send/Receive error message as well as the folder access denied message as soon as it happens again and I can capture them.</p>

            <p><span>I believe I might have an answer. I checked the event logs, and in the three months since upgrading from Office 2007/Windows XP Pro to Office 2010/Windows 7 there are a ton&nbsp;of various .pst and .ost indexing errors, events, reconciliations, and warnings
 for all of my non-Exchange email accounts. Further searching and investigation reveals that this might be related to corruption of the .pst and .ost files&nbsp;as they&nbsp;migrated over the years from XP to 2007 to 2010 and, particularly, depending on Windows Easy
 Transfer to transfer files easily and cleanly. Not exiting Outlook completely before shutting down also appears to be a problem.*</span></p>
<p><span>The error messages and events include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Cannot expand the folder. The set of folders cannot be opened. The server is not available. Contact your administrator if this condition persists.
</span><span>(</span><span>0x80040111)</span> </li><li><span>Cannot expand the folder. The set of folders cannot be opened.

 your computer. (0x80040111) [This is what I've been doing for all the errors, and it does work.]</span>
</li><li><span>The set of folders cannot be opened. You don't have appropriate permission to perform this operation. (0x80070005)</span>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>It would appear that my options are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Try the Inbox Repair Tool</span> </li><li><span>Remove and rebuild all six profiles, but this has had very limited success anecdotally</span>
</li><li><span>Delete and recreate the .ost and .pst files</span></li><li><span>Modify the registry</span></li><li><span>Turn off indexing for Outlook</span></li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suggestions? Thoughts?</p>
<p>* Why is exiting Outlook completely before shutting down necessary now?&nbsp; I've noticed that even "exiting properly" (as we used to teach in the olden days) doesn't shut Outlook completely.&nbsp; Bug?</p>
<p>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;None of my&nbsp;.ost and .pst files&nbsp;exceed or even approach&nbsp;2G; I empty all&nbsp;my&nbsp;Deleted Items, Junk, and RSS&nbsp;folders regularly;&nbsp;and I'm not running Symantec.&nbsp; During the new install, Avast antivirus&nbsp;was set to scan email (it wasn't previously), so&nbsp;I've
 disabled that feature.</p>

            <p>It has never been possible to use Windows Easy Transfer with Outlook. It transfers nothing cleanly and corrupts the new Outlook profile.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>You don't have 6 profiles. You have six accounts. Recreating the accounts won't help. Recreating your Outlook profile from scratch would.
</p>
<p>I&nbsp;wouldn't use any of the other 3 options. Outlook is not really designed to handle such disparate account types in one profile. Using the IRT is a good move before you create the new profile.

            This reply did NOT answer my question and was NOT helpful.&nbsp; Not at all.&nbsp; This completely disregards the response that&nbsp;I posted to this "Answer"&nbsp;saying my polling interval was already set to 60 minutes.&nbsp; In fact, nothing so far has fixed the problem.&nbsp;
<p>These are the actions I’ve taken so far, in the order they were implemented:</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Disabled Avast’s Mail Shield<br />
Reason:<span>&nbsp; </span>Virus programs (especially Symantec) screening Outlook mail are a known issue<br />
NOTE:<span>&nbsp; </span>This had been turned off when I was running Outlook 2007/Windows XP Pro, but was on by default during the installation of the Windows 7 compatible version.</p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Checked the file sizes of the various .pst and .ost files<br />
Reason:<span>&nbsp; </span>File size was limited to 2GB in previous versions of Outlook (it’s unlimited, or rather limited only by…..in Outlook 2010), but migrated .pst and .ost files sometimes trigger send/receive or synchronization issues if they are
 near or over the 2GB threshold.<br />
NOTE:<span>&nbsp; </span>All my .pst and .ost files were well under 2GB.</p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Checked the Event logs for Outlook<br />
Reason:<span>&nbsp; </span>I had been unable to catch Outlook “in the act” when errors occurred.<br />
NOTE:<span>&nbsp; </span>Should have done this first – don’t really know why I didn’t.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Maybe because I couldn’t find it where it used to be in XP and it never occurred to me to just click
<b>Start</b> and type “Event” in the search box (DUH!).<span>&nbsp; </span>
Maybe it’s because when I did find it a while back and tried to start it, it started installing an “MMC snap-in” and I didn’t know if that was kosher and stopped it.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This time, I still didn’t know what MMC snap-in was (I do now!) but allowed it to run anyway and there it was:
<span>&nbsp;</span>Event Viewer.<span>&nbsp; </span>The logs revealed a host of error codes and messages that helped pin down what was happening.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Ran the Inbox Repair tool on all non-Exchange .pst and .ost files
<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/repair-outlook-data-files-pst-and-ost-HA010354964.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Repair Outlook Data Files (.pst and .ost)</a><br />
Reason:<span>&nbsp; </span>Corruption of these files appears to be the most likely cause of the problem.<br />
NOTE:<span>&nbsp; </span>The repair process went smoothly.<span>&nbsp; </span>
Didn’t need to import any data from the backups it created.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NONE of these actions has fixed the problem.&nbsp; When I get a chance, I will try creating a new profile and post back to let you know if that works.&nbsp; Until
 then, this remains an open issue.</p>

<p><br />
So why does Microsoft tell you to use it and that it works?&nbsp; If there are known issues, why don't they include that with their instructions, along with instructions on how to create a new profile and make sure that your .pst and .ost files are "clean"?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, if Outlook can handle up to 10 Exchange accounts and up to 14 POP accounts (according to another question on this forum) and size limits have been eliminated, why would it have a problem with 1 Exchange account, 1 MAPI account, and 4 POP3 accounts?&nbsp;
 And if it's not really designed to handle such disparate account types in one profile, why does it tell you you can and why does it allow it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Even Microsoft has finally&nbsp;acknowleged the fact that Windows Easy Transfer does not work with Outlook. You need to get a grip on reality and stop blaming the messenger and blame the culprit. Everything I posted is accurate even if you wish it weren't.&nbsp;If
 you care to believe inaccurate Help files instead of me, that's your choice; but don't expect me to fix what can't be fixed. Did you even try what I suggested before posting your tirades?

            <p>My "tirade" was in response&nbsp;to the fact that I received an email saying that my question had been answered, and when I came here to check, the "ANSWER" was to "make sure your polling interval is not set to anything less than 15 minutes."&nbsp; This was not the
 answer..</p>
<p>Your condescending attitude is not at all helpful, nor is your failure to read full posts.&nbsp; You repeatedly post snotty and unhelpful replies that demonstrate that you have ignored or not read what I have written.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you even read "These are the actions
 I’ve taken so far, in the order they were implemented."</p>
<p>I have read your responses to other questions on this forum and for the life of me cannot understand how you possibly earned a community star.&nbsp; The contempt you have for the people you are supposedly "helping" is obvious.&nbsp; Blaming people for following the
 information,&nbsp;instructions and procedures Microsoft provides and recommends instead of providing and/or guiding then through an actual solution indicates you have a need to prove something, but that something is obviously not a desire to help.</p>
<p>You may or may not know what you're talking about, Russ, but you're not doing a very good job of communicating it.&nbsp; As someone whose job it is to provide customer support, I have to say that you would have been fired by now if you worked for me.&nbsp; Of course,
 you're not an employee, you're a "volunteer" on this forum.&nbsp; If you do, indeed, have any real knowledge to share, you're not very gracious or generous in doing it, so I have to wonder why you're here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Jayne,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have more than one Skype account, you can send yourself some of your own Skype Credit from any of your accounts as a gift. You'll just need to add yourself as a contact first.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you forgot the password of your first account, try to do a <strong>password reset
</strong>following this Help link: <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA109/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA109/</a> </p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you were able to get back to your first account, you can now proceed to transfer Skype Credit to your other account. For more information, you may check this Help link below:</p>

<p>Hi Rob,</p>
<p>I finally got it resolved! I must admit that after some "praying" about it, I must have been helped from above. Here's how I got it resolved.</p>
<p>1. I downloaded and installed the latest version of ie8, this one customized for Bing and MSN.</p>
<p>2. I went to my Office 2010 directory (c:\program files\microsoft office\office14) and renamed the file "OWSSUPP.DLL" to "OWSSUPP.OLD", I was curious if changing the configuration or repairing office 2010, would reinstall this file.</p>
<p>3. I went to Control Panel and to my Office 2010 installation. I opted for "change, add/remove features." I went to the "office tools" and into the "Microsoft Sharepoint Foundation support" and checked "run from my computer." Although it has already been
 checked and/or enabled, I did it again anyway, clicked OK and waited for the process to finish. When it was over it did not tell me to reboot so I just closed Control Panel.</p>
<p>4. I went back to my office 2010 directory to check and there it was: it reinstalled the file, "OWSSUPP.DLL"!</p>
<p>4. I ran ie8 and clicked "reset". I closed ie8 and relaunched ie8 and tried skydrive. And voila! It worked. When I clicked on "Open in Word" button, my desktop application of Word opened the file. I tried several times editing it, from Skydrive and then
 from my desktop Word and it made all the changes.</p>
<p>I hope what worked for me would work for others. Cheers!</p>
<p>Brad</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 Folders and sent items not showing</h2>
                    Been using Outlook for 18 months on the same PC. Two days ago the format of my outlook changed when I logged in. It only shows received items and it no longers has any of the sub folders or the sent items. I can search for email that I have sent but cannot
 simply click in the folder like I used to as it has disappeared.

            <p><span>Hi Dan,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What type of account you have configured in Outlook.&nbsp; (POP3, IMAP, Exchange ActiveSync or an Exchange account).</span></p>
<p><span>Do you get any error messages?</span></p>
<p><span>What is the domain of the email address?</span></p>
<p><span><span>Was there any updates installed.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Let us try opening Outlook in safe mode and check.</span></p>
<p><span><span>To do that, close Outlook. Let us type in ‘Run’ in the search bar next to start button, click on the 'run' icon that appears – in the 'Run window' type in Outlook /safe and hit ok.
 (Note: There is a space between Outlook and /).<span>&nbsp; </span></span></span></p>
<p><span>If the application works fine safe mode, try disabling the add ins for the application and check the result,</span></p>
<p><span>Click the File tab. </span>
</p>
<p><span>Go to Options.</span></p>
<p><span>Click Add-ins.</span></p>
<p><span>In the Manage section, select COM Add-ins and click on Go.</span></p>
<p><span>Now uncheck the Add-ins and click on OK.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If issue persist, let us try the following steps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Let us press Windows+r on the keyboard (simultaneously) the Run appears.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Type outlook.exe /cleanviews (Leave a space after Outlook.exe)-&gt; Click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>Note: There is a space between Outlook and ‘/’. The above mentioned command restores Outlook to default view settings and all the custom views that you created will be lost.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Type Outlook.exe /resetnavpane (Leave a space after Outlook.exe) -&gt; Click OK.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may also try to repair Office from the control panel and check.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>I also was facing the same problem and found a simple solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please check if the mail icon is highlighted in the navigation folders area (seen in the left bottom of outlook).</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8d117222-0eec-4876-9f96-3ecbee5048a4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8d117222-0eec-4876-9f96-3ecbee5048a4" /></a></p>
<p>If yes, click on the 3 dots (...) shown in the right of the mail icon and click on the "Folders".</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/20ecf9af-bb2c-44c9-a545-145054589f48" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/20ecf9af-bb2c-44c9-a545-145054589f48" /></a></p>

<h2>            E71 is awesome</h2>
                    ok yes nokia you have produced some not so good handsets lately, E.G the n73 i had nothing but problems from day one with this handset but when i looked into upgrading i saw the E71 and thought i have Probably just found the sexiest smartest most awesome
 piece of kit i have seen. and i wasnt wrong i got an e71 last week and i still cant manage to put it down it is fantastic nokia you have done an awesome job with this handset. being a man of technology i like to keep myself up to date with all the new gadgets
 that come on the scene ive had a blackberry and an iphone but neither of them compare to the E71 if you ask me the iphone is far too over rated solely because its apple and touchscreen (big Deal). so far ive not had a single problem with the E71 and its so
 simple to use. the camera takes a nice crisp picture. internet/email runs very smoothly and quickly. and the new modes application is very clever and usefull. also i like the scanner aplication what an awesome idea that has become very usefull to me. i didnt
 have an E61 so i cant compare it to that but if anyone out there cant decide between this and an iphone then please think about it carefully because deep down you only want the iphone because of it appeal but at the end of the day its just a fashion accessory
 that you want to use to show off with. where as the E71 is a bit of class i can see myself have this handset for a long time by far your best phone ever nokia and i thought i just had to tell you<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
and well done Steve.

            Great optimistic post! Let's write here why we love our E71's :))<br />
<br />
For me, E71 is fantastic. It is<br />
<br />
-elegant<br />
- with almost all the functionality of E90 packed in a small size<br />
-fast<br />
-intuitive<br />
-fast again :)<br />
-with some great improvements (eg. contact search from main screen).<br />
-did not reboot itself so far (my earlier Nokias did)<br />
<br />
<br />
What I miss from my 9300 is more Ctrl+ shortcuts.

            <p>Hello Robert,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. Let me help you with your concern about not being able to view your contacts on your account.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please be informed that I have checked your account and it seems that contacts are intact on your account. One of the possible reasons why this is happening is because
you are using an outdated browser. </span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">As our initial troubleshooting step, I would recommend that you optimize your browser, clear browser's cache and a temporary internet file to make sure that your browser’s setting doesn’t contribute to your issue. Kindly visit
 the article below for instructions:</span></font></p>

<p>I have a document with a large number of steps. I've set up a "Step" paragraph style with numbering that generates the word "Step" followed by the step number and a colon (plus the tab that Word seems to add without my asking for it). This generates paragraphs
 that look like this:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<pre><code>Step 1: Blah blah blah...
Step 2: Blah blah blah...
Step 3: Blah blah blah...<br />&nbsp;</code></pre>
<p>That's fine. The problem is that I often want to refer to individual steps via cross-references, and I can't get the text to come out right. For example, I might want to say "As you can see in Step 2, ...". But I can't find a way to get the text "Step 2"
 to appear without the colon, and "As you can see in Step 2:," is not what I want.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In some cases, I want only the step number. For example, I might want to write, "As you can see in steps 2, 4, and 22, ...". Saying "As you can see in Step 2, Step 4, and Step 22, ..." would be cumbersome.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>How can I set up my numbering and cross references so that I can get the boilerplate text around the step numbers (i.e., "Step" before the number and ":" after it) in the paragraphs comprising the steps, but I can refer to either "Step n" or just the step
 number (in both cases without the colon) in cross-references?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks.<br />

            <p>Here's one way of addressing both issues:</p>
<p>• type 'Step ' (or 'Steps '), then insert the cross-reference in the normal way.</p>
<p>• select the cross-reference and press Shift-F9. You should see something like {REF _Ref349737907 \h} - the \h may or may not be there; it makes the cross-reference act like a hyperlink.</p>
<p>• edit the field code by adding a numeric switch, thus {REF _Ref349737907 \# 0 \h}, making sure the \# 0 is before the \h (if present).</p>
<p>• press F9 to update. Now, you should only see thecross-referenced paragraph's&nbsp; number.</p>

            This is very helpful, thank you. I had read about field codes, but it would not have occurred to me to use \# (which I had not heard of) with a field consisting of a mix of numeric and textual information.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Having said that, your approach is not, on the face of it, a terribly practical solution to my problem.&nbsp; I've simplified the situation somewhat in my post, but I have dozens of steps and hundreds of references to them. Manually editing the field code for each
 of those hundreds of references is unpleasant at best. Is there some way to get Word to generate the "\# 0" inside the REF automatically?&nbsp; (If so, I can presumably extend that method to add the "Step " text in front of the number automatically, editing that
 text out in the comparatively few cases were I want to refer only to a step number.)<br />

<p><br />
If you have many cross-references pointing to the same Steps, you could use Find/Replace to add the \# 0 switch. All you'd need to do is to expose all the field codes in the document via Alt-F9, then use the reference number (_Ref349737907 in the example I
 posted) as the Find expression, with '^&amp; \# 0' as the Replace expression (without the quote characters). Whilst this still&nbsp;isn't automated, it's better than doing it manually. Indeed, if the only REF fields in the document refer to the Steps, a single
<em>wildcard</em> Find/Replace could do the lot, where:</p>
<p>Find = _Ref[0-9]{1,}</p>
<p>Replace = ^&amp; \# 0</p>
<p>You'd probably want to execute such a Find/Replace iteratively, as there'd undoubtedly be cases where you'll want to preserve the 'Step' in the cross-reference. Anything more sophisticated would require a macro - and considerable debugging before it could
 be relied upon.</p>

You could use a numeric switch like&nbsp; \# "'Step '0" (eg { REF _Ref349737907 \# "'Step '0" \h }), but all that achieves (useful though it may be) is the elimination of the trailing colon. Not terribly useful if you have multiple references that you want to have
 appear as, say,&nbsp;Steps 1-3,&nbsp;5 &amp; 7.

<br />
This does what I need, thanks very, very much. <br />
<br />
Is there someplace I can read about what \# is doing here?&nbsp; My sense is that the REF is producing a string containing both numeric and non-numeric data, which \# then reduces to its numeric component only, which is then plugged into a pattern consisting of
 some literal text ("Step ") and a placeholder for the numeric data ("0"). Is that more or less correct?&nbsp; References I've seen to \# describe it in purely numeric terms, so I'm surprised that it will take non-numeric data and simply strip out the non-numeric
 stuff. I'd like to understand it better.<br />
<br />
Ironically, I'm actually using Word for a text about programming, and here I am discovering that there's a programming language inside Word for dealing with fields.<br />

I don't know that there's any official documentation of how one can incorporate text strings into field switches. MS has some documentation here:</p>
<p><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word-help/field-codes-formula-field-HP005186218.aspx?CTT=5&amp;origin=HA102110133" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word-help/field-codes-formula-field-HP005186218.aspx?CTT=5&amp;origin=HA102110133</a></p>
<p>but it really doesn't cover the embedding of text strings into the switches. IIRC, the total length of all characters the field switch can display is 67.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've added my own documentation on incorporating text strings into field switches in my tutorials on Word field coding. See, for example,&nbsp;'Formatting Numeric Field Results' in my Microsoft Word Field Maths Tutorial, at:<br />
<a href="http://windowssecrets.com/forums/showthread.php/58544-Word-Field-Maths-Tutorial-(v1.4)?p=320143&amp;viewfull=1#post320143" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windowssecrets.com/forums/showthread.php/58544-Word-Field-Maths-Tutorial-(v1.4)?p=320143&amp;viewfull=1#post320143</a><br />

<a href="http://www.gmayor.com/downloads.htm#Third_party" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gmayor.com/downloads.htm#Third_party</a></p>
<p>That tutorial shows how to do stuff most people wouldn't even dream of with field coding. FWIW, you can even embed additional fields into the switches, which raises all sorts of interesting possibilities.</p>

<blockquote>As I mentioned in another reply, your approach works, but what I'd really like to do is have the field generate "Step 3" instead of just "3".&nbsp; Is there a way to add content to the field so that the field generates not just the step number but also
 includes the literal text "Step " in front of it? I"m thinking of something like {
<b>"Step " + </b>REF _Ref349737907 \# 0 \h }, but that doesn't work, and googling didn't turn up anything that did.<br />
</blockquote>
You could use a numeric switch like&nbsp; \# "'Step '0" (eg { REF _Ref349737907 \# "'Step '0" \h }), but all that achieves (useful though it may be) is the elimination of the trailing colon. Not terribly useful if you have multiple references that you want to have
 appear as, say,&nbsp;Steps 1-3,&nbsp;5 &amp; 7. </blockquote>
As a coda to this thread, I realized later that I really want a nonbreaking space between "Step" and the step number, so the text part of the \# switch should be sure to use a nonbreaking space at the end.&nbsp; Entering this space is straightforward (ctrl-shift-space),
 but I thought I'd add this information to this thread for completeness.<br />

<p>Guys, I had the same issue and after almost 2 hours I found the easiest solution or at least workaround.</p>
<p>Seems like Ovi does not like the log in over wifi so, disconnect from it, change the preference order of your connection so it connects over GPRS, 3G, etc and log in normally.</p>
<p>Once loged in, just change the order again to use wifi as primary connection.</p>
<p>It worked for me at least.</p>
<p>I installed almost 20 softs on a row and stopped working suddenly and loged me off. This was the only way to get in Ovi again and I'm already installing more soft.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck everyone.</p>

<p>I had this problem also, tried everything, new firmware. Uninstalled Ovi and deleted unused accespoints. No succes. Default accespoint set to internet. What worked for me was holding the RED (Hangup) button and ended the packet connection (3G). Manually
 conected to WIFI and started OVi and immidiatly logged in.</p>

<p>I had the same problem and connecting via wireless only worked.</p>
<p>If you have your profiles on the front screen select general then select offline.&nbsp; If you dont have this hold down the power button to bring up your profiles and select offline.</p>
<p>Then press the top right hand corner to connect to your wireless.&nbsp;. Select the options to allow connection whilst in offline mode</p>
<p>Launch the OVI app.&nbsp; This needs fixing by Nokia but at least we have a work around.&nbsp; This ha only started happening to me since I updated to symbian anna</p>

<h2>            Outlook Not Downloading Images As Requested</h2>
                    <p>I have my Outlook set to automatically download images from very few senders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I click "Download images" on particular messages, it typically acts as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I receive emails from Square (credit card receipts), though, it will NOT download the images. After I click "Click here to download pictures", nothing happens (except the "Click here" message disappears).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far it seems to happen only with Square. They are not in my blacklist (obviously).</p>
<p>

            Unless the source is encoded (a bunch of random letters and numbers), the image source should be there. If the image is embedded, not pulled from the web, it will say something like &lt;img src "image01.png"

            No changes to my PC (outside of scheduled Microsoft Windows updates).&nbsp; I thought I had it fixed.&nbsp; I had Skype on my phone so I uninstalled it and that seemed to work on one sync cycle.&nbsp; Then I just did a sync today and my favorites are gone again.&nbsp; They
 are on my PC, so it's clear that the phone is not syncing those for some reason.&nbsp; I have that box checked in the sync settings.&nbsp;

Any other suggestions??<br />

            See if you can make a backup of your mobile&nbsp;favorites then try this:<br />
<br />
Delete the mobile favorites folder from your PC.&nbsp; Sync then check your device, there should be no mobile favorites.&nbsp; Now uncheck Favorites and sync one more time.<br />
<br />
Take your device and save a favorite.&nbsp; So now there should be ONE favorite.&nbsp; Connect your device and now place a check mark next to favorites and sync.&nbsp; Did it create a mobile favorites folder on your PC?

<br />
I tried that.&nbsp; Although it did create a new Mobile Favorites folder, it again deleted the favorites from my phone. However, they were not deleted from my PC.&nbsp; Maybe I shouldn't sync them?&nbsp; Unless you have another option???&nbsp; Until then, how do I manually copy
 my mobile favorites from my PC to my device?&nbsp; I can't seem to find the mobile favorites folder on my phone.&nbsp;

<br />
It is not listed as "mobile favorites" but rather just Favorites.&nbsp; Use File Explorer and navigate to Windows/Favorites on your device.<br />
<br />
You could copy the Mobile Favorites on your PC and paste them into this folder.

I'm not sure why that is happening.&nbsp; I've never experienced that issue.<br />
<br />
I certainly would consider "not syncing" and just keep them on your device.&nbsp; You could periodically just copy the favorites over to your PC for safe keeping but that probably is not worth the effort.

<br />
I'm having a similar problem with my phone. I'm using a Samsung Epix with Windows Mobile 6.1 updated to the latest firmware (pi907UCID1/i907UCID1). On my computer, I'm running 32-bit Windows Vista Business SP2 with Windows Mobile Device Center 6.1.6965 and
 Internet Explorer 8.0.6001.18783.<br />
<br />
The problem is slightly different for me, in that not all of my favorites are deleted, just a few of them at random. When they are deleted, they're deleted both from the computer and the phone at the same time.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions for troubleshooting this? Thanks!<br />
<br />

            I don't know how many you have but if it is not a huge number I might try deleting all, sync then recreate to see if it cures the issues.&nbsp;

Not very helpful since it doesn't allow the link to be captured or used.&nbsp; ; [</p>
<p>Captured using&nbsp; F12, Ctrl-b.&nbsp; Then the .js was downloaded and opened with Notepad, Word Wrap off, and Ctrl-g to see:</p>
<p>Lines 49, 50:</p>
<p>var d=document.writeln<br />
d('&lt;script language="VBscript"&gt;')</p>
<p>The code is obfuscated, so I think you will have to use the IE9 script debugger to figure out what "d" is supposed to be.&nbsp;&nbsp;Offhand I would say that syntax looks suspect anyway.</p>

<h3> sihollies  say:</h3>
<h2>            N97 Mini keeps randomly connecting to the internet</h2>
                    
<p>HI there,<br />
I was wondering if you could help please.<br />
I am new to viewing Emails and browsing the web on my mobile, and have recently subscribed to a pay monthly sim.<br />
I set up access to my hotmail account via the mailbox in the messaging section of my N97 mini.<br />
Since then, my phone keeps randomly connecting to the internet ( or the icon on the screen appears to be connected). I &nbsp;deleted the hotmail account in my mailbox, but it is still connecting randomly.<br />
Prior to this problem, my phone connected to my home network if I was within range , or prompted me to connect to Orange GPRS if I was out of range. ( which is whatt I would ideally like it to do.)<br />
<br />
Many Thanks<br />
<br />
si<br />
<br />
I Have now deleted/disabled the Orange Gprs settings ( I assume I will have to phone Orange to send me new settings when I get this sorted?) ,and now when I restart my phone, away from home, it asks if I want to search for WLan, due to the fact it cannot connect
 to Orange. When I am at home it connects to my WiFi.<br />
It is though there is a process or app on my phone needing Internet access???<br />
Would any sort of reset delete all my settings, so I can start again? I have done a backup without backing up my settings in anticipation of doing so</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>si</p>

            hi&nbsp;<br />
i think i may have found a solution for you.<br />
i had the exact same issue on my 5580 once id tried nokia email. i found that if you go into settings&gt;connectivity&gt;destinantion&gt;internet and delete your wifi access point then reboot your phone. then create a new access point using the same connection you deleted
 then it dosent seem to do it anymore. been 2 days since mine has done it now.<br />
<br />
hope that helped

<p>I had the problem of the internet staying connected (or at least there was a data connection) on my nokia n97 mini. &nbsp;I'm on a contract so it didn't really matter, although when I go abroad I imagine it would be an issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I disabled the connection on the home screen to prevent facebook updates, changed the priority destinations in connectivity settings, uninstalled many applications to try and find the problem, including facebook, weather applications, nimbuzz, and anything
 I thought may be requiring data. However it was still always connecting. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ended up spending a long time talking to someone from nokia who did a soft reset, and this didn't work either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Eventually I&nbsp;disconnected&nbsp;the nokia email widget from the applications menu. &nbsp;Ever since then I've not had a problem.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is fine for me as I'm not interested in receiving email via my phone. &nbsp;I don't know how you stop data transfer if you want to keep this widget, but I would start by looking here rather than doing what I did and delete everything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this may help someone out there to not spend days and days angry and frustrated as I was.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bye!</p>

<p>here's a simpler solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>instead of simply uninstalling the nokia email app, change its sync settings. go to the app, open settings and then untick the days when it will sync the emails (untick "Sunday, Monday, Tuesday,..."), also change the sync timing to an absurd one, say start
 sync at 12:00am, end sync at 12:01am. this way, the email client wont connect to the internet and hence wont waste the battery life. hope it helped.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As many people in this discussion i have the same issue with the "Email for Nokia" application. I think it's a great app but it's got one major bug! It keeps reconnecting. I've got mine set to "sync every hour" and only between 8am and 10pm. But even then,
 it always works fine for a few days when i freshly install it. But after a while it starts doing it's thing again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've even got my&nbsp;GPRS settings set to "Always Ask" so when it wants to connect, it asks me. But even if i select "Cancel" it still connects anyway!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's a serious bug and i'm hoping they get it solved soon! Or does somebody have a workaround?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know that deleting your access point, and creating a new one with a different name solves the issue for a few days, but once it goes into it's "funny mode" it starts doing it again!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas? Since i just deleted the application and now everything is fine! But it makes no sense having an e-mail capable phone and not being able to use it because it drains the battery in 6 hours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Come on nokia people, it can't be so hard to fix that little bug!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello All,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had the same issue after trying to configure gmail.&nbsp; Though I deleted all the mail configuration it was trying to connect to packet data (GPRS).&nbsp; I installed the task manager (Best TaskMan) to see what is running in the background which was trying to connect
 to internet.&nbsp; I found that though I had uninstalled all the email settings,&nbsp; the nokia mail application was running in the backgroud.&nbsp; I uninstalled the nokia mail application from application manager and it stoped connecting to GPRS.&nbsp; After uninstalling the
 nokia mail I found that the mail widget was missing on the main screen I re-added it and now its perfect.</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have several modules in Excel 2013 that produce other Excel files and PowerPoint files. I tested this on some computers with Office 2013 and there everything also worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I wanted to test this on a computer with Office 2010, but then it failed and said it could not open the application.</p>

<p>
</p><p>It looks to me as you have added a reference to the PP application. In Office 2013 it is named Microsoft PowerPoint 15.0 Object Library but in Office 2010 Microsoft PowerPoint 14.0 Object Library, hence your code cannot load that object.</p>

    <title>How to recover my old emails&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to recover my old emails&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>As I have read over and over the switch to Outlook has caused may people to lose valuable email documents. I am a user who used Hotmail infrequently, but I have logged in several times over the last year. Here is my problem: Today I had a password reset
 code sent to my hotmail address from my bank. Obviously I was shocked to see that I no longer have Hotmail. I cannot get this email from my bank. Several of the posts claim that it is just the interface that has changed. Well, then why am I not seeing the
 email sent to my Hotmail address in my new Outlook account? Additionally, I would like to say that ALL of my past emails are gone. Yes, I tried to recover them. Most I didn't care about but I had lots of emails from 2001 and on from my husband who wrote to
 me from overseas during deployments to Afghanistan, Iraq, and Kosovo. I kept those in folders and they told a very special story about things for our family, including special moments about our kids when they were younger. These are wartime letters and detailed
 so much about our lives. Since I did not log in to Hotmail daily, I didn't see the information about the switch. Microsoft/Outlook claim that it was a simple switch of the interface and all emails should be there. Do you really believe this after the thousands
 of us who lost important information?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not only am I locked out of my bank account because my password reset went to Hotmail (which doesn't exist) but my husband and I have lost SO MANY special memories from letters written back and forth during many deployments. Now, I ask you, microsoft, how
 are you going to make this right?</p>

            <p>Hi Paula,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1. Have you a Back up of all your important email data that you can access?
</strong></p>
<div>If your data is important it is prudent to back it up, especially if it is in the cloud and not under your control.</div>
<div>
<p>When you signed up for the email account there was (in the fine print) the Terms of use which clearly said that the user is responsible for the data and not Microsoft.</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/wiki/oaccount-oother/backing-up-your-important-outlookcom-email-data/c4b1ef9b-265e-4e9b-ba5d-6e00908f151d?tm=1422415498299"><strong>Backing up your important Outlook.com email data</strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Unless</strong> you have a back up made of the important email data it will be unlikely that you will be able to retrieve anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>2. Here are the possible reasons why you've lost your emails: </strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Due to inactivity in account:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<div>If your emails were over 365 days old, you may have lost them due to inactivity in account even before you renamed the account. If you had Self-recovery of emails turned on in your account before renamed, you can try to recover some of the deleted messages
 yourself. To restore deleted emails,<span>&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">refer to the article</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/outlook/recover-deleted-messages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Restore
 deleted email messages</strong></a>.</span></div>
</li><li>
<div>If you were accessing your emails on a mail client such as Windows Live Mail or through your mobile device, but didn’t log into your web account for over 365 days, you may lose emails due to inactivity in web account.</div>
</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>You got another option to save your Hotmail emails differently when renaming your account to @Outlook.com account:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you chose to rename your account to @Outlook.com, a prompt would have asked you – "Where do you want to save your emails?" You will have the option to create a new folder for your old account or save the emails in the Inbox of your renamed account. If
 you chose to create a new folder, the default name of the folder will be the name of your old account and the folder will appear in the left pane under "Folders". And all your old emails will be stored in this folder.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Your account was hacked even before you renamed your account:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A hacker had already deleted emails in their account before you renamed the account.</li></ul>

<h2>            How do you forward emails to SOME favorites without having the &#34;to&#34; box reshuffling after each delete&#63;</h2>
                    If you select FAVORITES to forward an email, and only want to select some of the favorites, you have to hit the "x" to delete everyone you do not want to receive the forward. When you hit the "x" outlook automatically re-shuffles the list and you have
 to scroll down to your last delete to continue viewing the list.

            <p>Hi srasue,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you don't want Outlook.com to reshuffle the list of your Favorites when sending an email. I can imagine how inconvenient this must be on your end. Please be informed though that we don't have the option to change this feature in Outlook.com.
 But we would be glad to hear your comments and suggestions so kindly please provide a feedback in this

<p>Please let us know if you have additional questions.</p>

<h2>            Which is the best memory card for Lumia 730&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have recently purchased a Lumia 730 phone. I would like to add an external memory card to increase the storage capacity of the phone. Which is the memory card that is best suited for the phone? Which company (available in India) and which class for speed?
 I am not a heavy duty user of the phone, so may not need a super speed card.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please suggest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

            Here is what I experienced:<br />
Samsung Pro &gt; Samsung Evo &gt; SanDisk<br />
<br />
So depending on the money you wanna invest, you can choose any of these. I personally use a 32GB SanDisk Class 10, but later for to admit that Samsung ones have higher transfer speeds. Don't go for anything below class 10.

            After the firmware update you have to update your SIM settings. It typically prompts for it, but in case yours didn't, go to Settings -&gt; Network &amp; Wireless -&gt; Cellular &amp; SIM -&gt; SIM 1 Settings and then finally in the middle under Mobile operator settings
 click the "Update settings" button. It should restart and then be functional again.
