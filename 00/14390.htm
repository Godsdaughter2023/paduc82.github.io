<p>Hi Joseph,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The link you provided doesn't appear to apply to my situation. The error code(s) for the link you provided don't match the one I am seeing. There must be a specific cause for error code 30183-27 (403), do you have a way of researching what that cause is?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a new (virtual) machine with Windows 10 version 1709 updated properly. We use VMs for testing our applications and how they interact with various versions of MS Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Going through the steps in the link you provided.</p>
<div>1 - Uninstall and reinstall Office</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>2 - Use the offline installer to install Office</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>3 - Temporarily turn off proxy settings</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>4 - Temporarily turn off antivirus software</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>5 - Temporarily turn off firewall</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>6 - Plug in!</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>7 - Install from home</div>
<p>
</p><p>Uninstall/reinstall: already did that. No change in behavior.</p>
<p>I used the Offline installer to start with. Installed from an ISO:&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">en_office_professional_plus_2016_x86_x64_dvd_6962141.iso</span><br />
Proxy settings are off on the local machine. Corporate proxy may be in place.</p>
<p>There is no Antivirus installed on the system (yet).<br />
There is no 3rd party firewall.<br />
Wired network connection is the only option for a virtual machine.</p>
<p>Installing from home is NOT an option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What else do you recommend?</p>
<p>

<h2>            Adjust Powerpoint 2011 grid spacing OS X</h2>
                    I am trying to change the snap-to-grid spacing to something other than the default, which is 1/12 inch. All the on-line tips suggest using a dialog box which becomes available after selecting Grids and Guides. That doesn't appear in PPT 2011 on OS X. Where
 is this option now located?

<p>
</p><p>If Snap to Grid is enabled you can nudge with the Arrow Keys in smaller increments by holding either the Control or the Command Key, but that's the extent of it.</p>

                    <p>Dear community</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently had to do a factory reset on my lenovo thinkpad which I bought in 2010.</p>
<p>Now when trying to use the microsoft word program, the system asks for a product key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not remember having a product key , also all the stickers on my machine are worn out so nothing is visible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My windows is authentic and has original office 2007 suite.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I get the product key to get my system running again.</p>
<p>

<p>I'm afraid you are out of luck, unless your computer provides a backup disc which lets you reinstall programs included with the purchase.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some versions of Office you can download a backup installation file (assuming that you have a valid product key), but Office 2007 is no longer supported, so you can't do that any more for that version.</p>

<h2>            Adding totals to Data Tables on Graphs</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am adding charts to report. I am using cluster column charts to show how many activities were completed (x axis) for each district (y axis).&nbsp; I have included a data table below the chart.&nbsp; Below is what my chart looks like.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/db9e9d82-7771-4b46-9927-0a8725af2f48" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/db9e9d82-7771-4b46-9927-0a8725af2f48" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to add the total for each year to the table without graphing the total?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

    <title>PDF Preview Handler for Vista does not allow me to open PDF files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> c sikora  say:</h3>
<h2>            PDF Preview Handler for Vista does not allow me to open PDF files</h2>
                    This morning, I am suddenly unable to open PDF files on my computer.&nbsp; When I tried to open an e-mail attachment in Outlook, I couldn't open PDF files, but I can open Word documents and other types of files.&nbsp; I cannot open PDF files from any application
 or file.&nbsp; When I try to preview in Outlook, I get the message "This file cannot be previewed due to an error with the following previewer: PDF Preview Handler for Vista. To open &nbsp;this file into its own program, double-click it."&nbsp; Double-clicking the file does
 not open it as it normally would.&nbsp; Nothing happens.

    <title>Locked out of hotmail account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Locked out of hotmail account</h2>
                    <p>Earlier this week my wife tried to log in to her hotmail account. When she entered her password a message came up "it looks like someone else might be using your account". She then completed an on-line verification form unsuccessfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>She's tried submitting a forms more than once but as she set up her hotmail a number of years ago she is unable to remember all of the answers to the security questions. Also she very rarely uses her e-mail account to compose e-mails. She uses it to receive
 e-mails&nbsp; in respect of on-line household bills, credit card statements etc. She also receives delivery updates and payment receipts in respect of on-line purchases she has made.&nbsp;The phone number that is associated with her hotmail account &nbsp;is our landline
 which cannot receive text messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sending this e-mail on my wife's behalf as she doesn't have another outlook account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help with a resolution to this problem.</p>

<h2>            Activition of Office 365 personal failed&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've recently bought a new computer with an activition card, for a 1 year subscription for 1pc and 1 tablet, that expires December 31, 2016.</p>
<p>I have made a Microsoft account, before finding out I had this activitition card, and took the free trial that was with the download of Microsoft Office 2013.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that my free trail has been expired, I wanted to activate this card and have the year subscription before it expires, but on the online ativition step it fails to complte the activatation of it. I have inserted the account I used to downlaod microsoft
 Office 2013, and yet it fails to activate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help me on this situation I am curretnly puzzled in. I have started a new semester, and there is much to do with this application.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Problem I have is that users are creating forms without delegating editing rights to any colleagues...when the users who created the forms leave the organisation then their colleagues canntoi access their results

<p>Hi Kegan1,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your description, you would like to check form results in addition to the user who initiates it. If&nbsp; this is the case, we suggest check the followings and see if the feature meets your requirement:</p>
<p>1. Go to Responses page of form.</p>
<p>2. Click … under Status &gt; Get a summary link, copy and then share it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If anything misunderstood, could you please share with us more information about the desired result? A&nbsp; specific scenario will be very helpful. And where do you create forms? Reference:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/create-a-form-with-microsoft-forms-4ffb64cc-7d5d-402f-b82e-b1d49418fd9d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Create
 a form with Microsoft Forms</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Tina</p>

<h2>            Outlook Mac 2011 EXC_BAD_ACCESS Office Reminders</h2>
                    <p>Hello All.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been facing this problem for a long time. Every time i open outlook on my MAC (OS X 10.9.2) i get 2 old office reminders with no due date and when i double click on either one of them, my outlook crash with the error down below. Only thing i can do
 is dismiss these old reminders. I migrated from Windows 7 outlook to MAC last year &amp; this has been happening since then. I can search for these email in my archive and mark them completed but when outlook is started again, these 2 old reminders pop up again.
 It like somehow they get reset for reminders upon start and have a life of their own.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way these 2 reminders also pop up with my valid reminders. Like i said, only option i have is to dismiss them. Its been well over a year an year now since i have been living with this problem. I'd appreciate if any Outlook experts out there knows
 some workaround to permanently delete these old reminders or mark them completed once and for all. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the error.</p>

    <title>MSE should have a scan log history - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pynnonen  say:</h3>
<h2>            MSE should have a scan log history</h2>
                    
<p>MSE should have a scan log history. It should show:</p>
<ul>
<li>Type of scan: quick, full, or object scan (folder or file). </li><li>Scheduled or manual scan.&nbsp; </li><li>Date and Time started and&nbsp;ended </li><li>Length of time (hours, minutes, and seconds) </li><li>Status of scan (successfull, failed to complete) </li><li>Malware found. </li><li>When updates occurs. </li><li>Option for how many entries are stored. (Default: up to 100) </li></ul>
<p>This helps to identify if scheduled scans are being completed, if someone is doing manual scans.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

Other comments: Stopped using AVG. I like the clean interface of the application.</p>

<p><span>The most accessible source for that information is Event Viewer, where you would filter the System folder for Microsoft Antimalware events. The System folder can
 be saved to a more readable text log as follows: Right-click on the System category in the Console Tree and select “Save Log File As”. In the “Save “System” As” dialogue, change the format to .txt and then name and save the file.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A more detailed MPLog-&lt;Date&gt;.log file is available in the Support folder, and several other logs can be generated there by running the “MpCmdRun.exe -getfiles”
 command line to create a Support log. This thread has the details: <a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msescan/thread/e7ed7b1a-9015-4851-b550-3c013f8d1d44" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

                    <p>I have followed this information to change the Normal Format but when I try to set it as a default I am unable to press the default button as it is greyed out. Do you know why this might be happening? I have tried closing any other Word documents that are

            <p>It really isn't clear exactly what you're trying to do... The conversation you replied to pertains to Spell Check &amp; Language, it has nothing at all to do with changing fonts, default or otherwise. Also, there are quite a few "Default" buttons in Word's dialogs
 so we have absolutely no idea which one you're referring to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before anyone can offer specific suggestions you'll need to provide a complete &amp; accurate description of what
<em>your</em> issue is. I'm afraid that just jumping into an existing conversation stating that it "did not help" gives us nothing to go on. If what worked for others doesn't work for you your situation must be different in some way -- we need to know what
 those differences are in a new message of your own :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Be sure to fully describe what you want to do, what steps you're taking, the accurate name of the commands &amp; dialog windows you're using, etc. It would also be useful if you'd indicate your present version update level of Office 2011 -- 14.3.9 is current.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The easiest way to change the Default Font is by going to <strong>Format&gt; Font</strong>, selecting what you want, then clicking the
<strong>Default</strong> button &amp; confirming it when prompted. Note that doing so pertains only to new documents you create from that point on, it
<em>does not</em> change anything about the current formatting of any documents you have open.</p>

                    <p>Original title: Microsoft Calls</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, got a call from Chicago, IL. Stating they are from Microsoft, and they are contacting me about my errors and notifications.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After speaking to me as if I am 5 yrs old, they wanted me to download and pay for a 3rd party remote program for them to come into my CPU and fix this. I have no way to prove they are with Microsoft. The number comes back as a possible for scams.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched all over Microsoft for a way to remove the custom event issues, as I can with the normal issues. Any help would be great, but if not, guess this explains why companies such as Microsoft want to charge more to do their job and fix their product.</p>

            I dumped my land line after getting lots of the same type of phone calls, some calls claimed to be "Microsoft" and wanted to access my computer because I had a "virus", some claimed to be from the IRS and wanted access to have me pay to prevent from being
 sued. AT&amp;T was very aware of these calls coming from overseas and had no way of preventing them. The local channel KNBC 4LA ran a report on these scams and many others.

<p>Hi</p>
<p>I normally handle this by getting the client to use Word for the notes and then importing them into PowerPoint (many of my clients are happier working in Word), or by exporting the notes from their copy and then importing them into mine.</p>
<p>Export the notes text of a presentation<br />

<a href="http://www.pptfaq.com/FAQ00937.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pptfaq.com/FAQ00937.htm</a></p>
<p>Always work on a *copy* of the presentations. Better safe than sorry :-)</p>
<p>While I think that's the simplest solution I'm sure we could come up with alternatives - it depends on how savvy your client is and how determined they may be be to mess about, or perhaps you are worried more about accidental damage?</p>

<p>I don't know that there's any good way to do this.</p>
<p>What I've done in this situation is to Office Button | Save as and choose PNG. This saves each slide as an image. Then I reinsert those into a new, blank presentation and copy over the speaker notes. Or I make a copy of the presentation, go through each
 slide and Ctrl+A to select all and then delete so I have blank slides with notes. Then I insert each image onto the appropriate slide.</p>
<p>This is all quite the PITA, so Steve Rindsberg made an add-in for me that does all of this automatically. You might want to give it a try:<a href="http://www.pptools.com/protect/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pptools.com/protect/index.html</a></p>

            <p>I'll leave it to John to pursue what he refers to as "advanced techniques" :-) but IMO the specs you've revealed identify the bulk of the performance issue...</p>
<p>
</p><p>By today's standards, 4GB RAM is considered 'entry level'. The published System Requirements solely for OS X 10.7 &amp; later is 2GB, with Office 2011 requiring another 1GB on top of that. I realize that 4GB may
<em>sound</em> like a lot [I go back to the time when 128 <em>kilobytes</em> was the the norm &amp; 640KB the absolute max available to 'power-users' with deep pockets :-)], but it doesn't take much to push beyond that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there are any other programs/services running (Endnote, Safari, email software, etc.) it leaves very little memory for workspace. That forces programs such as Word to rely more heavily on disk access which degrades performance immensely. For example,
 my iMac has 8GB &amp; is running OS X 10.6.8 [<em>1</em>GB system requirement]. Right now I have only Word (with a fairly simple 366 page document open) &amp; Firefox launched. According to Activity Monitor, 4.65GB is used leaving 3.35GB free.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I sincerely believe that increasing your iMac's RAM to 8GB (or more) will cure the ills... nothing you've mentioned really points to a corruption issue :-)</p>

            <p>Following up on Bob's suggestion, if you want to be geeky you can use Activity Monitor (it's in the Applications &gt; Utilties folder) application to observe what's going on with your system while that pokey document is open.</p>

<p>On the system memory tab the following should be zero or close to zero if you have enough ram:</p>

            I have a similar problem...<br />
I purchased 2 Sandisk 2GB MiniSD cards and though both my PC and PDA read the cards as 2GB, the nokia 6280 sees it as 64MB. I tried reformatting one card on the computer and it didn't help.<br />
I tried formatting the other on the phone and now both the laptop, PDA and phone all read the card as 64MB and regardless how i try and reformat it again, it will only read as 64MB... :/<br />
<br />
does anyone know how to get the Nokia to recognize a 2GB MiniSD card?

            Howdy all !<br />
<br />
The reason why you have problems with your Kingston 512MB Mini-Sd memory card is that it is pre-formatted in a way that the 6280 can`t read it. The next problem you`ll encounter is when you format it in the phone - you may then only get 64mb out of it.. .<br />
<br />
If that is the case,your only option will be buy a Nokia pre-formatted 512mb miniSD-card. This should work because it is a Nokia product... .<br />
<br />
For you with a 2GB miniSD-card problem - I am sorry to inform you that the Nokia 6280 can only handle cards up to 512mb... . I did buy a 2gb card too, but did found out afterwards why it didn`t work here:
<a href="http://europe.nokia.com/A4156071" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://europe.nokia.com/A4156071</a><br />
<br />
1. Click "browse categories"<br />
2. Click "music"<br />
3. Click "memory cards"<br />
<br />
If you click on the cards above 512 mb you`ll see that the 6280 ain`t listed as compatible.. .<br />
<br />
I do beleive the problem are to be found in the S40 operativ system - all phones that can handle cards over 512 mb are S60- phones.<br />
<br />
It seems we all have to buy new miniSD-cards..from Nokia..

            6280 can handle 1GB, at least mine do..<br />
Using SanDisk<br />
<br />
However, after it being at reparation where as my<br />
screen turned black, and they "repaired" it by<br />
upgrading the phone, which didn't solve the screen.<br />
Only after some days it magically worked again when<br />
I got it back.<br />
<br />
But now, it demands passwords for my 64MB card and<br />
the 1GB card, which I never had, nor does any computer<br />
want to read them, says no disk in..<br />
<br />
So um yeah, it's probably the updated version that<br />
has those problems, at least it does for me.<br />
First time I am not very happy with Nokia,<br />
but I think it's not really thier fault as<br />
the providers, in my case 3, has really made the<br />
phone less good with all thier stuff in it.

            i had a similar problem with my 6230i.<br />
<br />
Apparently when you put a memory card in your Nokia phone the card is locked to this phone by some kind of unique ID that the phone tells the memory card so it only work with the phone with that ID without a password (even if you haven't set one)<br />
<br />
When software is upgraded this unique ID changes so if you haven't set a password for the memory card prior to upgrade the software you are pretty much screwed. this isn't unfortunately firmware bug but the way the phone is supposed to work :( .<br />
<br />
About the compatibility issues pretty much only use Nokia ones guys, nokia won't support anything else and if you read the small print of your warranty it could be classed as a thrid party accessory and invalidate your warranty.

Hi Folks,<br />
<br />
NCL told me that the maximum miniSD capacity supported by 6280 is 2GB.<br />
<br />
For the record, my spouse is using a 6280 with SanDisk miniSD 2GB without any issue.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />
Cheers. ^_^;

            Lucky for you. My 6280 reads my ScanDisk 2GB as 64MB after using the format option of the phone. Can you or NCL tell me how to get back the 2GB capacity.<br />

            I've had the same problems, dont know if its just me thats stupid :) and this is probably the first thing you would do, but it all worked when I put the miniSD card in, turned off and on the phone and formatted it using the phone.

            I sent my phone of to Nokia last week and they claim they fixed it but my phone still has the same problem. My memory card worked on my friends Nokia 6280 but still doesn't work on my phone.<br />
<br />
How do you format the card using with the phone?

    <title>Excel File Size - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nistor petre  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel File Size</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an excel file created a couple of months ago, saved in a ZIP file.</p>
<p>After extracting the file and re-saving it (no other modifications done, just File/Save As) the file size increased from 200kb to 700kb.</p>
<p>This isn't major, but I am now experiencing an issue with file sizes in Excel, where a file that contains one sheet with 10 lines and 53 columns, and a Pivot Table based on the first sheet takes up 5MB of space. That seems a lot to me. That's exactly the
 same information that the file I first mentioned contains, and that only has 200kb Size.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help understand what causes these increases in file size?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit:</p>
<p>I spent some time and rebuilt the Excel file in question step by step.</p>
<p>All the extra file size comes from a single cell. It contains a formula, which, among other things, has a vlookup with a reference to another file (which is quite big).</p>
<p>Now that I've isolated the issue, that still doesn't explain why would a formula in a single cell (not a whole column) boost the size of a file from 30kb to more than 5MB.</p>
<p>Why does a reference need so much space? And how can I avoid this increase in size?</p>

    <title>entering new information into a combo box - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lila z.  say:</h3>
<h2>            entering new information into a combo box</h2>
                    <p>I have two tables, one is "PotentialProjects" and the other is "Client". On the form to enter Potential Project information, one of the fields is a combo box that looks at the Client table so you can select one of the clients to be "linked" to the Potential
 Project. If the client does not exist there is a button "Add Client" and another form pops up where you add a new client. Then when you close the Client form you have to use the Combo Box again to select the new client.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem is, the users are confused when the new Client form opens. They'd like to be able to just type in a new client name in the combo box to add the new client. Is this possible? When I change the "Limit To List" value to "No" I get an error "The first
 visible column, which is determined by the ColumnWidths Property, isn't equal to the bound column. Adjust the Column Widths property first, and then set the LimitToList property."</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I change the first column in the combo box to a non-zero value, the ID number of the client shows up in the box as opposed to the name and when I type a new name into the box it says"The value you entered isn't valid for this field" because I typed
 a name when it was expecting an ID number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            Take a look at NotInList.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
Note that if you are using an earlier version of Access you might find that the colour of some form objects such as buttons shows incorrectly and you will need to&nbsp; amend the form design accordingly. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link copy its text (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
This little demo file illustrates the use of the NotInList event procedure to insert a new row into the referenced table, either transparently where only the value typed into the combo box needs to be inserted, or by opening a form in dialogue mode where it
 is necessary to also insert data into other columns in the referenced table, e.g. the client's address.<br />
<br />
Note the caveat in the opening form of the demo with regard to personal names, however.&nbsp; As these can legitimately be duplicated the NotInList event procedure is an unsuitable method of inserting a new row as it is not possible to insert the name of a person
 which is already present in the database as the name of another person.&nbsp; You might think this is unlikely, but it is not as uncommon as you might think.&nbsp; I was once present at a clinic where two patients arrived without minutes of each other, both having not
 only exactly the same first and last names but the same date of birth.&nbsp; I also worked with two Maggie Taylors.<br />
<br />
My demo provides an alternative method of inserting a new person via a command button, which allows for two or more people with the same names to be added by opening a form in dialogue mode, with the value of the new person being passed back to the combo box
 in the calling form when the dialogue form is closed.&nbsp; Individuals of the same name are differentiated in the combo box's list by concatenating their address to their name.<br />
