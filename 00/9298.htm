<h2>            Battery Leak</h2>
                    <p><span>Looks like my HD7 loses battery recharge if windows 7 is shutdown while it is connected to the PC. There will be no problem if I disconnect and
 reconnect it after the PC is shut down.</span></p>

<p><span>Could reproduce the same issue on windows 7 home and business edition.
</span></p>
<p><span>Is it only my device and/or my computer/laptops or other people have the same problem?</span></p>

<h2>            Sharing Office 365 with a family member who uses two computers</h2>
                    <p>Greetings everyone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Office 365 subscription.&nbsp; I shared it with my husband under his email address for an install to one laptop.&nbsp; He has two laptops he uses regularly, so we want O365 on both.&nbsp; How do I share another install with him for his other computer?&nbsp; When I
 use his email address to send the invite, I get a message that says he is already sharing.&nbsp; How do we get it to his other laptop?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!<br />

            Hi, i hope you're doing good today.
<br />
<br />As far as i know that's not possible, you can share your subscription with up to 4 people. I suggest you to create your husband another Microsoft account and share your subscription to that account too.
<br />
<br />Regards.

<p>
</p><p>To score a meet you need to sum the lowest 5 runners from each school.&nbsp; While a school can have 7 runners, only the first 5 count for scores.

<p><span><span>Hi Patty,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I can understand your requirement, but I think there’s no 1 step formula to get the result you want. I only can suggest you use the way below to simplify your calculation:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span><span>Use =CountIf(range, criteria) to show how many students has been in place in per school in a specific place. For example: the C4 says there are already 3 students in place for K school
 in place 3.</span></span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/921042ad-78c3-4924-ac85-24da7050ed45" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/921042ad-78c3-4924-ac85-24da7050ed45" /></a></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span><span>Use =IF(logical, true value, false value) to show how many students you should delete per school when you sum the place value. For example: the F25 tells you the real place for student
 B25 should be 24-3-2-0=19. </span></span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/43b4515f-9982-40cf-8858-6e1f41ff0898" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/43b4515f-9982-40cf-8858-6e1f41ff0898" /></a></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span><span>Use filter feature to show only a specific school to calculate. For example, I would like to calculate school H.</span></span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7a2519d1-3aac-46a3-8d3b-5b33ab8abcc2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7a2519d1-3aac-46a3-8d3b-5b33ab8abcc2" /></a></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span><span>It will be convenient for you to calculate the result now. Calculate the first 5. It should be 17+18+19+22+23-2-2-2-3-1-3-1=85.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thanks,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Rena</span></span></p>

    <title>RSS Feeds in Outlook 2010 email signature - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            RSS Feeds in Outlook 2010 email signature</h2>
                    How do I insert a chrome html doc with a gif and RSS feeds into my outlook 2010 email signature? I can get the image into the signature but the image freezes whichever feed happens to be up when the image gets inserted (more of a still shot).

            <p><span>Outlook most of the times has issues when you use images in the signature. And using a gif combined with updates through rss feed is definitely
 gonna cause problems. Even if you get it to work, there is a high chance that the signature will get corrupted in a short while.
</span></p>
<p><span>If possible, I will recommend removing the rss feeds from the signature.

<p><span>It may take a long time to repair the pst file if the file size is too large or if the rate of corruption is too high. PST repair may take an hour or more to complete, therefore ideally it may read

            Because Nokia 701 etc already have belle preinstalled<br />
so unless developers update their apps they won't work in Belle

<p>You cannot know for sure which app will run fine and which app will not. Probably many apps will not have problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But for your important apps, you better check with the developer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, Joikuspot (wifi hotspot) is very important to me. It is promised on their website that it will run on Belle too shortly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even more important to me is Skype. I use Skype on all my mobile devices for many years. A device which cannot run Skype is almost useless for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore I will not upgrade to Belle unless Skype is supported. At the moment, I see the absence of Skype the biggest problem of Symbian Belle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a dealbreaker for me.</p>

            When Belle is released it will become the default OS for any of the symbian ^3 platform phones. No developer will produce anything for an OS that is less than that.<br />
<br />
The only issue will be if you either have an application that was specifically design for you, or the developer has stopped developing all together.<br />
<br />
Other than that you will quickly find that most developers will make the necessary adjustments to their apps to account for belle as needed. And more than likely they are already doing that now, ready for when Belle does roll out.<br />
<br />
So really unless you have a specially design app just for you or an developer has stopped developing, you wont have any problems upgrading to Belle.

Actually Belle runs for some months already on 500, 600, 700 and 701. And all those phones have no Skype. Not acceptable.

"The acquisition is however still under review in a few countries, and will be completed in those countries when such reviews are closed, Microsoft said without naming the countries. "<br />
so it will take some time to complete that deal which could be main reason why no updated skype version

                    <p>Hi there</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to renew Office 365 University. I had the 4 year subscription, but my studies continue, therefore I'll need to renew.</p>
<p>When I try to renew, I can't seem to find the option for Office 365 University. Just home and/or business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where and how do I renew the University version?</p>

<p>The office 365 University 4-yr subscription does allow you to buy 1 4 yr extension to the subscription. You do have that correct.</p>
<p>

 - FAQ </span></p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, Excel, OneNote, Outlook, Publisher and Access. (Office Pro)</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>US$1.67 per month, estimated price of US$79.99 for a four-year subscription (1 4 yr renewal allowed for additional $80(?) )</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Install Office 365 University on up to two computers (PC or Mac) for one user<br />
<span>&nbsp;</span>&lt;snip&gt; Choose where Office is installed at any time during your 4-year subscription. &lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Verification is post-purchase for all channels except directly from Microsoft Store, where we offer a pre-purchase verification. (same as disk based version)</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><strong>Q:</strong> What are the steps for student verification? </p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><strong>A:</strong> There are just four easy steps. If you’re not signed in to your Windows Live ID account, the site will first direct you to the Windows Live ID sign-in page. Next you’ll visit the Academic Verification page where you’ll take
 the following steps: <br />
<br />
1. Verify or select your country from the drop down menu. <br />
2. Select your preferred verification method (3 choices) <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. If you select “Get verified through my school”, you’ll be taken to the school search page where you can follow the steps to search for and select your school to complete verification.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. If you select “I have a Verification Code”, you’ll be required to enter the activation code that was given to you by either your school’s administrator or Microsoft.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. If you select “I have an ISIC card”, you’ll be required to enter your student identification card number.
<br />
3. Click “Continue”. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I chatted with Microsoft Technical Support earlier, and she confirms that installation of Office 365 University will indeed install the Office 365 Home Premium in the computer. The product will show that it’s Office 365 Home Premium,
 which is true in my case.</p>
<p><strong><span>Only in my Microsoft Account page that it shows my subscription is Office 365 University.</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, I used a student e-mail ID. My Microsoft Account page now shows I have 4 years of Office 365 University subscription. And you are right, when I activate my Office 365 University from my account, it replaces the Office 365 Home Premium
 subscription (mine only had 5 days or trial days left anyway, so no issue with that).</p>

<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FAQ for Office University ID validation (annual student validation)</p>
<p>There are other points on the above page you want to look at</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<p><strong><span>Q:</span></strong> How do I manually verify my academic status?
</p>
<p><strong><span>A:</span></strong> You can process a manual verification request by completing the Manual Verification form in AVE and uploading a copy of one of the following documents:
</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Dated student ID card </p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Current student report card or progress report </p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Dated current class schedule </p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Dated faculty ID card (Except DreamSpark users) </p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Recent faculty/staff payment stub (financial information can be blacked out) (Except DreamSpark users)
</p>
<p>Accepted upload formats are jpg, jpeg, jpe, jfif, bmp, dib, png, gif, tif, tiff, pdf, doc, docx, zip. The document should not be greater than 10 MB.
<br />
&lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>n</strong></p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Q: How often does my academic status need to be verified? </p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>A: Once a year. Or, we should say, once every 12 months from your last verification date.
</p>
<p>&lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p>Well, that is a little disconcerting. So I used the contact link on that page and had the following conversation to get clarification on the need for academic verification.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The answer is “maybe”. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The short answer is, contrary to what the advertising says, the subscription is only good while you are a student and for at most 1 year after.<span>&nbsp;
</span>MS automatically verifies your academic status every year, so after you graduate, when your anniversary date rolls around your subscription will be cancelled.<span>&nbsp;
</span>At the end of the conversation, there is a slight hope that the automatic renewal verification is simply a check to see if your EDU email address is still active. In that case, if the school allows you to continue to use your EDU email after graduation,
 you could continue to use Office 365 University.</p>

<p>Hi Sudheer,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your posting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give your problem, I recommend you can follow the steps below to troubleshoot your issue:</p>
<p>1. Open <strong>registry editor</strong> and go to “<strong><a href="https://apac01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsupport.microsoft.com%2Fdefault.aspx%2Fkb%2F291392&amp;data=02%7C01%7C%7Cce027b3e8e9b429fd98608d66587f695%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C636808032156108386&amp;sdata=ZKD7NNuW0wg5hsh6H8nKjrjn2iAg44kf26ZL%2B0w8RSU%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\Outlook\Addins</span></a></strong>”
 to check whether your add-in is installed correctly. By default, the value of LoadBehavior is “3”, with which the VSTO Add-in will be loaded when you launch Outlook, if LoadBehavior value of your add-in is not “3”, you can try to change it to “3”.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7e96306a-0eed-4bad-8564-ee9405a73af2?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7e96306a-0eed-4bad-8564-ee9405a73af2?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8ae99a88-3477-483d-aa0d-2ae067eb41e7?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8ae99a88-3477-483d-aa0d-2ae067eb41e7?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>2. Start <strong>Outlook</strong> to see whether the add-in works well. If the add-in shows up at “<strong>Active Application Add-ins</strong>” and the status of “<strong>Load Behavior</strong>” is
<strong>Load at Startup</strong>, it should work well. </p>
<p>3. If the problem still exists, you can check the error via right-clicking <strong>
This PC</strong> to <strong>Properties</strong>, and then go to <strong>Advanced system settings</strong> &gt;
<strong>Environment Variables</strong> &gt; <strong>New</strong> to add a new system variable, the variable name is “<strong>VSTO_SUPPRESSDISPLAYALERTS</strong>”, the variable value is “<strong>0</strong>”. In addition, open the registry editor and go to “<strong>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\Outlook\Addins</strong>”
 to set the LoadBehavior of your add-in to be “<strong>3</strong>”. Then when you restart Outlook client, there will be pop-up dialog describing what the error is, and share the screenshot with me.</p>
<p>4.

    <title>How do I modify HTML web pages that have been copied and pasted into - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I modify HTML web pages that have been copied and pasted into Word&#63;</h2>
                    One of the more interesting features of Word (all versions) is its ability to display an HTML web page as an editable document, including images, text, and formatting. Problems arise, however, in understanding and removing all the tables, boxes, and other
 extraneous elements that are also included on the page. If the intention is to create clean pages which contain images, text, and some of the website's original formatting, what is the best way to remove everything else?<br />

            For a start, many Web pages are created using tables, so selecting the whole document and using Convert Table to Text will often help (though you may lose more formatting than desired).

            <p>Hi, Suzanne, thanks for the helpful reply. Since you were kind enough to respond, you might be interested in the discussion thread that prompted me to rephrase my original comments more as a question. The goal is to create eBooks from websites which are
 large and rich in content. I already know how to format for Amazon Kindle and have done so on several occasions. I would appreciate any additional remarks that you feel would be helpful in this regard, especially with respect to how you yourself might treat
 a Word document into which an HTML file has been pasted. If this is more involved than you wish to become, I understand and thanks again for your time and feedback.</p>

            <p>Hello, again, Suzanne,</p>
<p>If you don't mind too terribly, just one final response to your last comments. And thanks ahead of time for taking the time; I really do appreciate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently no one else has much experience or expertise in this area, which might be expected when one introduces a potentially revolutionary concept. I suppose the whole idea is that we turn to people who possess a basic understanding of the "parts and
 process" such as the Word program itself, and then things are slowly "pieced" together to create something entirely new. Something with which few if any have had any previous experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fact that no one has told me that I'm either crazy or wasting my time (excluding your own comments :-) is its own testament (and confirmation, perhaps) of the innovative nature of this particular endeavor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My only parting request is that you file this idea away, and in the event you know or meet someone who's looking to change the world in some small way, that you might send them my way. In the meantime, I will continue seeking the additional help that I feel
 is likely necessary in these early stages of development.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for the generosity of your time.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Bob Anton</p>

            <p>Your idea isn't "crazy", and not necessarily a waste of time, but it won't be simple or fast to do what you want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This reply will be somewhat disjointed, as several points have come to mind</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, using Office XP on a computer connected to the network is not a good idea. That version of Office is long out of support so it is open to hacking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first problem is that the DOC format used by Word XP is fundamentally structured differently from HTML.&nbsp; HTML is effectively a simple text file with text and text based (words inside braces) formatting commands embedded in the string of text.&nbsp; On the
 other hand, the DOC file is a "binary" format loosely similar to a compiled EXE program file.&nbsp; For example, you can open a HTML file in a simple text editor and the content is readable, but if you open a DOC file that way most of what you see is unreadable
 "gibberish".&nbsp; DOC files use "pointers" to direct Word to another place in the file structure to find the formatting applied to the text.&nbsp; So, trying to convert from one format to the other is not a clean process.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another good way to see the difference between "native" HTML files and DOCs is to take a DOC created in Word and use the SAVE AS command to save it to HTML format (do NOT use the "filtered HTML" option).&nbsp; Then open the generated HTML file in a HTML editor
 and look at the generated HTML code.&nbsp; It is an unreadable mess because it is trying to exactly recreate the DOC structure using HTML.&nbsp; The most obvious problem is massively duplicated formatting commands.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>That being said, I do something similar to what you want to do. I regularly (daily) copy interesting articles from web pages and edit to "clean them up" and save them using Word 2003 or 2010.&nbsp; I normally use the "Save As" command to save into "Filtered HTML"
 format.&nbsp; I do this for 2 reasons. First the "Filtered HTML" format is typically MUCH smaller than a DOC format version of the file.&nbsp; Second, I use the "Filtered HTML" format because it does a much "cleaner" job of generating the HTML than the other HTML format
 option available in SAVE AS.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only time I still use the DOCX format for these copied files is when they include embedded images.&nbsp; If I use HTML format then the images get saved into a separate "Images" folder which can get lost, while in the DOCX/DOC
 format the image files are embedded in the same file as the text.&nbsp;&nbsp; I use DOCX rather than DOC because it is compressed and even for these small files there is often a noticeable (if trivial) file size saving.</p>
<p>(NOTE: when I copy this content I also copy the original Web site link to provide the source of this content.&nbsp; I got into the habit of copying content after I could no longer file some web pages I had links to.&nbsp; The pages or sites had gone off line for one
 reason or another.&nbsp; Yes I could use the "way back machine' or Internet Archive to try and find this old content, but that is a hit and miss proposition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>OK, all of that being said, you say you are working with web pages you created/own.&nbsp; So, rather than using Copy Paste to transfer this information to Word have you considered using FIle Open to open these files directly into Word, then using SAVE AS to generate
 the DOC files?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If opening the HTML file directly in Word, using SELECT ALL to Copy/Paste from a browser into Word includes too much "extraneous ****" have you considered being selective about what text you Select for Copy and Paste?&nbsp; I understand the desire to get rid
 of advertising and other unneeded "stuff" from a web page. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Exactly why do you want to remove tables and boxes?&nbsp; Actually, another way of achieving that goal is to use Paste Special &gt; Unformulated Text. This will strip out all formatting, giving you text only. You will have to copy and paste any embedded pictures
 one at a time. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: when copying from the web pages, one thing to look for is to check your embedded pictures for links to the original source picture file on the internet. Right click on the picture. If the context menu includes the options to "Edit Hyperlink", "Open
 Hyperlink" and "Remove Hyperlink", click on the Remove option. The picture will then be completely embedded in your resulting file. If you allow the hyperlink to remain, if the web page goes off line you will no longer be able to see the picture. All you will
 see is a blank "placeholder".&nbsp; Very annoying!<br />

            <p><span><strong>Hi, Rohn007 (I like the name; it sounds like a robotic version of James Bond)</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Your reply is well received, appreciated, and for the most part, understood. For purposes of clarity, because the subject is somewhat involved, please allow me to annotate my responses, thank you.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Your idea isn't "crazy", and not necessarily a waste of time, but it won't be simple or fast to do what you want.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>To be clear, the solitary end-game has been, and continues to be, the creation of an Amazon Kindle&nbsp;eBook from preexisting website pages. Since Amazon requires all submissions to be&nbsp;formatted in Word, and because I am
 familiar with the formatting process itself, the endeavor in question should be significantly easier and faster than&nbsp;writing and creating an eBook from scratch. Which, of course, is the whole idea in a nutshell. But I don't want to get ahead&nbsp;of myself.&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>First, using Office XP on a computer connected to the network is not a good idea. That version of Office is long out of support so it is open to hacking.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Because the exact details of what I'm doing and&nbsp;working with, have yet to be thoroughly explained (and may never be, depending on your patience and indulgence) I believe the XP operating system and its network vulnerabilities
 are not an issue in this particular case. </strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The first problem is that the DOC format used by Word XP is fundamentally structured differently from HTML.&nbsp; HTML is effectively a simple text file with text and text based (words inside braces) formatting commands embedded in the string of text.&nbsp; On the
 other hand, the DOC file is a "binary" format loosely similar to a compiled EXE program file.&nbsp; For example, you can open a HTML file in a simple text editor and the content is readable, but if you open a DOC file that way most of what you see is unreadable
 "gibberish".&nbsp; DOC files use "pointers" to direct Word to another place in the file structure to find the formatting applied to the text.&nbsp; So, trying to convert from one format to the other is not a clean process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Although I think your technical explanation here is above my pay grade, my response poses&nbsp;(as both an answer and a question)&nbsp;that we circumvent some&nbsp;(but not necessarily&nbsp;all) of these kinds of&nbsp;problems by initially "saving"
 the pasted HTML file in Word&nbsp;as a&nbsp;DOC file. After, once all the editing is complete and the file has been formatted&nbsp;as an eBook, the&nbsp;DOC is then converted back into&nbsp;HTML the same as any other file would be, prior to uploading it&nbsp;to Amazon. Word, of course,
 automatically separates text and images into separate folders, which is also normal. This is an oversimplification of the process, but at this stage, the basics are all that need be dealt with. The project likely rises or falls at its most fundamental level
 of development.&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Another good way to see the difference between "native" HTML files and DOCs is to take a DOC created in Word and use the SAVE AS command to save it to HTML format (do NOT use the "filtered HTML" option).&nbsp; Then open the generated HTML file in a HTML editor
 and look at the generated HTML code.&nbsp; It is an unreadable mess because it is trying to exactly recreate the DOC structure using HTML.&nbsp; The most obvious problem is massively duplicated formatting commands.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Once again (and fortunately so) none of that is our concern. After Word has its way with converting the eBook DOC files into HTML, our work is essentially done. From that point on,&nbsp;it's Amazon's baby. If this makes sense,
 especially given your own observations and reservations, it seems to me there is every opportunity for real understanding to be had in this situation. And thanks again for your thoughtful deconstruction of my basic premise.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>That being said, I do something similar to what you want to do. I regularly (daily) copy interesting articles from web pages and edit to "clean them up" and save them using Word 2003 or 2010.&nbsp; I normally use the "Save As" command to save into "Filtered HTML"

 format the image files are embedded in the same file as the text.&nbsp;&nbsp; I use DOCX rather than DOC because it is compressed and even for these small files there is often a noticeable (if trivial) file size saving.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>The foregoing scares me because I actually understood most of what you're talking about. I didn't realize I was so far along on my path to achieving "geekdom" status :-) That said, your explanation also clarifies, I
 think, the true differences in how you and I&nbsp;are dealing with similar stuff. While your efforts are essentially "one way" whereby you use the files and alter them for your own purposes -- which may or may not have anything to do with re-publishing them in
 some manner, my intentions are virtually circular in nature. By this I mean to say that what I remove from the web, I return to the web, but in a highly modified form, the final&nbsp;conversion of which is accomplished for me -- by Amazon -- for free. The whole
 thing has a sweet irony to it that I won't go into for&nbsp;now, if ever.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, all of that being said, you say you are working with web pages you created/own.&nbsp; So, rather than using Copy Paste to transfer this information to Word have you considered using FIle Open to open these files directly into Word, then using SAVE AS to generate
 the DOC files?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>OK, confession time on my part. I'm not nearly as smart or savvy as I try to make myself out to be. Which is why I need help. Not where I want someone else to do the work, but simply&nbsp;to keep pointing me in the right
 direction until such time that I can do&nbsp;away with the training wheels. My confession is that I'm new to building websites. About a&nbsp;year and a half ago, a friend suggested that I&nbsp;create my own site. I laughed, of course, and asked if he was crazy. Much to my
 surprise, things had progressed to the point where Windows "weenies" could now build their own sites using a program like "Weebly&nbsp;Drag &amp; Drop". Such programs make building sites ridiculously easy and allow those who are too lazy, dumb, or busy to learn HTML,
 to quickly create their own website. Count me guilty as charged. From what I can tell, copy and paste is my only option, other than using a&nbsp;FTP utility like Filezilla. But then the question becomes one of how to transfer those files into Word. It seems to
 me that direct "insertion" is the way to go. Given the&nbsp;circumstances as described, don't you agree?</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If opening the HTML file directly in Word, using SELECT ALL to Copy/Paste from a browser into Word includes too much "extraneous ****" have you considered being selective about what text you Select for Copy and Paste?&nbsp; I understand the desire to get rid
 of advertising and other unneeded "stuff" from a web page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;<span><strong>Absolutely, positively correcto, my friend. The idea is to be entirely selective, picking and choosing logical "portions" of the site, one section at a time. This is especially critical because many of the website pages
 are extremely deep, requiring lengthy, vertical&nbsp;scrolls before&nbsp;reaching the "bottom" of a given&nbsp;page.</strong></span><span><strong>While I don't believe it's appropriate for me to list my&nbsp;actual&nbsp;URL in this venue, I would certainly
 be grateful&nbsp;if you would&nbsp;check my profile page&nbsp;and click the link to my site, the name of which is Dragonopolis. Once there, it will become quickly apparent as to what I have in mind, per this discussion. Thank you for taking the time, if you do.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Exactly why do you want to remove tables and boxes?&nbsp; Actually, another way of achieving that goal is to use Paste Special &gt; Unformulated Text. This will strip out all formatting, giving you text only. You will have to copy and paste any embedded pictures
 one at a time.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Indeed, this was one option I considered. And still remains viable. It also represents the most time consuming method which should be used only as a last resort.&nbsp;Obtaining both images and text in the same document is
 very tempting, and greatly decreases and simplifies the balance of editing required. I believe that converting&nbsp;tables, and hopefully removing them, will resolve&nbsp;most of the "clutter" I've seen. Resizing boxes and so forth are acceptable,&nbsp;provided they do not
 interfere with the "book" creation process. In the past, they have not caused a problem when formatting my other eBooks, but I want&nbsp;to&nbsp;avoid&nbsp;any potential nasty "surprises"</strong></span>&nbsp;<span><strong>should they (or other things)&nbsp;lie
 hidden and ready to strike. Needless to say, I'm poised myself, ready to&nbsp;strike out on my own, ready to&nbsp;dive into the deep end and just go for it. It did seem prudent, however, to&nbsp;acquire some outside "approval and permission" before&nbsp;lunging ahead, somewhat
 in the dark. It's still a lot of work no matter how one slices it, and a degree of support from one or more persons who are familiar with Word, would go a long way in granting&nbsp;me the motivation and confidence to proceed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: when copying from the web pages, one thing to look for is to check your embedded pictures for links to the original source picture file on the internet. Right click on the picture. If the context menu includes the options to "Edit Hyperlink", "Open
 Hyperlink" and "Remove Hyperlink", click on the Remove option. The picture will then be completely embedded in your resulting file. If you allow the hyperlink to remain, if the web page goes off line you will no longer be able to see the picture. All you will
 see is a blank "placeholder".&nbsp; Very annoying!</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I consider this as sound advice regardless of where we go from here, if anywhere -- and thank you for the heads-up. I try to look for those crummy hyperlinks and usually remove them just as a matter of course. This also brings us to the conclusion
 of this exchange, although I sincerely hope it's not an end to the discussion. I look forward to&nbsp;your feedback now that I've had a chance to more fully explain things, and especially if you've had an opportunity to check out my site.&nbsp;Please&nbsp;sign the guest
 registry while&nbsp;you're there, if you feel so inclined.&nbsp;Most people don't which always seems odd to me.&nbsp;Then again, I'm no one to be judging strange behavior :-)&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Once again, please allow me to thank you for your time and indulgence of my personal shot at the moon. You are very kind to&nbsp;have given me the benefit or your knowledge and&nbsp;experience.
</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Grateful regards, </strong></span></p>

</p>
<p><span><strong>To be clear, the solitary end-game has been, and continues to be, the creation of an Amazon Kindle&nbsp;eBook from preexisting website pages. Since Amazon requires all submissions to be&nbsp;formatted in Word, and because I am familiar with the formatting
 process itself, the endeavor in question should be significantly easier and faster than&nbsp;writing and creating an eBook from scratch. Which, of course, is the whole idea in a nutshell. But I don't want to get ahead&nbsp;of myself.&nbsp;</strong></span><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>#2<br />
</p>
<p><span><strong>Because the exact details of what I'm doing and&nbsp;working with, have yet to be thoroughly explained (and may never be, depending on your patience and indulgence) I believe the XP operating system and its network vulnerabilities are not an issue
 in this particular case. </strong></span><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>#3</p>
<p><span><strong>Although I think your technical explanation here is above my pay grade, my response poses&nbsp;(as both an answer and a question)&nbsp;that we circumvent some&nbsp;(but not necessarily&nbsp;all) of these kinds of&nbsp;problems by initially "saving" the pasted HTML
 file in Word&nbsp;as a&nbsp;DOC file. After, once all the editing is complete and the file has been formatted&nbsp;as an eBook, the&nbsp;DOC is then converted back into&nbsp;HTML the same as any other file would be, prior to uploading it&nbsp;to Amazon. Word, of course, automatically separates
 text and images into separate folders, which is also normal. This is an oversimplification of the process, but at this stage, the basics are all that need be dealt with. The project likely rises or falls at its most fundamental level of development.&nbsp;</strong></span><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>#4</p>
<p><span><strong>your explanation also clarifies, I think, the true differences in how you and I&nbsp;are dealing with similar stuff. While your efforts are essentially "one way" whereby you use the files and alter them for your own purposes -- which may or may
 not have anything to do with re-publishing them in some manner, my intentions are virtually circular in nature.
</strong></span><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>#5</p>
<p><span><strong>build their own sites using a program like "Weebly&nbsp;Drag &amp; Drop". Such programs make building sites ridiculously easy and allow those who are too lazy, dumb, or busy to learn HTML, to quickly create their own website. Count me guilty as charged.
</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>From what I can tell, copy and paste is my only option, other than using a&nbsp;FTP utility like Filezilla. But then the question becomes one of how to transfer those files into Word. It seems to me that direct "insertion" is the way to go. Given
 the&nbsp;circumstances as described, don't you agree?</strong></span><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
#6<br />
</p><p><span><strong>Indeed, this was one option I considered. And still remains viable. It also represents the most time consuming method which should be used only as a last resort.&nbsp;Obtaining both images and text in the same document is very tempting, and greatly
 decreases and simplifies the balance of editing required. I believe that converting&nbsp;tables, and hopefully removing them, will resolve&nbsp;most of the "clutter" I've seen. Resizing boxes and so forth are acceptable,&nbsp;provided they do not interfere with the "book"
 creation process. In the past, they have not caused a problem when formatting my other eBooks, but I want&nbsp;to&nbsp;avoid&nbsp;any potential nasty "surprises"</strong></span>&nbsp;<span><strong>should they (or other things)&nbsp;lie hidden and ready to strike. Needless to say,
 I'm poised myself, ready to&nbsp;strike out on my own, ready to&nbsp;dive into the deep end and just go for it. It did seem prudent, however, to&nbsp;acquire some outside "approval and permission" before&nbsp;lunging ahead, somewhat in the dark. It's still a lot of work no matter
 how one slices it, and a degree of support from one or more persons who are familiar with Word, would go a long way in granting&nbsp;me the motivation and confidence to proceed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<span><strong>Once again, please allow me to thank you for your time and indulgence of my personal shot at the moon. You are very kind to&nbsp;have given me the benefit or your knowledge and&nbsp;experience.

<p>
</p><p>Since you are creating DOC files to be converted to Kindle format, you should talk someone familiar with that process to find out how to best setup your documents for them.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>#1 OK, you want to "convert" web pages to DOC format files.&nbsp; Can be done.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Question, when you are formatting do you apply formatting ie "Bold", Italics, indents, font changes, font size changes, "directly" from the menu/ribbon or do you use styles?&nbsp; You really should be using styles.&nbsp; Define a set of styles that cover all of your
 formatting needs and use them.&nbsp; Personally, I have taken that one step farther and defined "shortcut keys" for my commonly used styles. That way I can apply the styles directly from the keyboard rather than fuzting around with the menu or ribbon.&nbsp; ie &lt;CTL
 SHF 1&gt; is Heading 1 </p>
<p>&lt;CTL SHF N&gt; is "Normal style </p>
<p>&lt;CTL SHF H&gt; is hidden font style </p>
<p>etc</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>#2 "Office XP" and "Windows XP" are 2 separate computer programs / things. Many different versions of OFfice can run on Windows XP.&nbsp; That being said, still running either Office XP or Windows XP connected to the internet is no longer a good idea.&nbsp; But if
 you are comfortable with it, that is your choice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>#3&nbsp; Just to be clear. You want to copy content from existing HTML pages, save in DOC format while you do "cleanup" then finally SAVE AS back to HTML format for submission to Amazon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>#4 Yes, my process is "one-way". I copy content from the web to for saving on my local machine for my personal use.&nbsp; There is no intent at this time to republish the full content, I use it mostly as reference for providing answers to questions asked by other
 people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>#5 Yes, I believe that copy and paste is the way for you to go.&nbsp; Now the specific type of cut and paste you use is still in question.&nbsp; Will you decide to keep the formatting, or paste text only.&nbsp; Personally, I would go with text only and reapply formatting.&nbsp;
 That will make for a "cleaner" resulting file</p>
<p>
</p><p>#6</p>
<p>Can you provide specific examples of problems you encounter.&nbsp; For example, when you are doing you copy and paste and encounter an 'issue', paste it into a separate new document, add a description of what you see and what you want to do then put a copy of
 the file in your skydrive and post a "edit link" in this forum for us to 'play with it' to find a possible work around.</p>

            <p>#1. I always use styles when doing eBooks. We can never trust any other method to be consistent. I've never created shortcuts like you have, though. Believe it or not, I like the futzing part but only because that's what I'm used to. Plus I'm not sure how
 to create the shortcuts you describe. I told you I'm good with some stuff, dumb as a rock with others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2. For now, I'm stuck with XP everything because my computer cannot be upgraded to Win 7 (or anything else for that matter). I'd have to get a whole new machine, as this one is seven, almost eight years old. For word processing, it runs fast and smooth,
 however, so it's hard to make the change. My graphics program is more than 15 years old, was designed for 32-64MB of ram, and thus runs perfectly on the GB's of ram it currently has to work with. I know I'm operating on borrowed time, but until then, don't
 fix what ain't broken, as they say.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#3. Yes, thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#4. Got it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#5. From what I've seen in terms of what the Word program spits onto the page, I believe I can use "Paste Special -- HTML Format". That vomits everything onto a given page and assuming I can remove the tables that appear to accompany the rest of it, the
 images, all the text, and the basic formatting that is carried over from the original website looks to be something I can work with. If you're familiar with formatting for eBooks, the whole affair has to arranged according to some rather stringent guidelines,
 so I'm expecting to "adapt" the preexisting formatting as best I can. Most of it will require modification, in one way or another, but the key is having it all there, with a reasonably coherent structure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the big deals to contend with is the fact that websites are wide, while eBook screens tend to be narrow. So just setting the appropriate margins for a Kindle upload will jostle whatever formatting remains, so I'm prepared for that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#6. I've never used a cloud service like skydrive, but have no qualms about learning. I like the suggestion and see no reason why such an approach wouldn't work. Let me search the cloud service, create an account, and learn how to use it. At that point I'm
 sure I will be able to follow your directions, if need be. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I could be very wrong, but my gut instincts tell me that there may, in fact, be no major issues which common sense and some educated diddling with Word can't overcome. It's new territory as you seem to agree somewhat, if not a lot. My intuition also tells
 me that if the process is indeed doable, then it's not hyperbole to suggest that the eBook industry could undergo a secondary revolution whereby many websites (not all, of course) are reborn in the form of publishable "books".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you and I have been discussing may indeed be the forerunner of a prototype model that breaks entirely new ground. Then again, it may fall flat on its face. That, too, is a possibility. There are some drawbacks, such as large memory consumption, that
 may curtail the project. I'm hoping that a first edition, in color, and containing several hundred images, will not surpass Amazon's size restriction on memory size. That remains to be seen. Amazon is pretty liberal and a given book can be fairly memory intensive.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you've seen my site, you'll have noticed that it contains as much text as it does artwork. With lots of both spread out over a couple hundred pages. If we include the scroll-depth of all the pages, those numbers increase dramatically. Since a well formatted
 eBook might contain thousands of pages of text, we'd be loading those pages with a huge number of illustrations as well. Hence my trepidation as to memory usage. There's also a good chance that because most of the images are small, we may slide in under the
 limit. I'll just have to see how that part proceeds. </p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, there's nothing that says a single website, if dense enough, couldn't produce two, or even three separate volumes. And since Amazon provides their services for free, the crux of the endeavor will always be a matter of pure labor combined with
 consistently attractive literary and artistic design.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One last thought on the Skydrive thing, which is say that "screen shots" (with my scribbles) might well come in handy and be very useful. I assume such "pictures" are acceptable as viewable files? Then again, as I mentioned earlier, the ideal scenario is
 not having to cope with any of that. That the process may be so straightforward, though labor intensive, that it's just a matter of plugging along and seeing where it all goes. It would be kind of cool for this to be the very first thing of its kind. But would
 anybody buy a copy? I think so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once on a Kindle (or other eBook) one wouldn't need a computer or be online to casually flip through the pages of their favorite website. I can think of a lots of uses for this idea, none of which need be reviewed at the moment. Suffice it to say that this
 seems like a logical and practical exploitation of the available technology. If I don't do it, it's likely only a matter of time before someone else does. It's almost too logical, and that's always scary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Be that as it may, please respond with as few or as many additional comments with which you're comfortable. I'm all ears (or in this case, eyes) and extremely appreciative for the time and effort you've already invested in this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I'm very familiar with Anne's books which, by the way, served as an inspiration for my own books. Just between you and me (while no one else is looking) the idea for my dragons to ingest platinum in order to create fire was derived from Anne's dragons
 digesting rocks for the same reason. I tried to improve on the concept and some believe I succeeded. Small world, as always.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you once more, my friend. You're a total pal with this.</p>
<p>

<p><span><strong>Absolutely, positively correcto, my friend. The idea is to be entirely selective, picking and choosing logical "portions" of the site, one section at a time. This is especially critical because many of the website pages are extremely deep,

            <p>Well, aren't you nice for taking a look. And I mean that. My quandary, however, is that I must assume you're referring to how the Lobby page appeared in your own version of Word, once you pasted it into a blank page? Or that you intentionally wanted to replicate
 the website experience by using Word's ability to reverse black on white with white on black, or in this case, what turned into black on black. If this is correct, then a bit of added explanation is in order. See the trouble that results from trying to help
 out? Just kidding, and once again, thanks very much for your kind attention.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because the intent is to produce an eBook, we are forced to use white pages with both images and black text. The reason is because Kindle users themselves, for example, have the ability to reverse pages from black to white, white to black. If one wanted
 to design an elaborately illustrated text such that it worked equally well against a black or white background, I get a headache just thinking about it :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the time being, just building (or re-building) the site as simply as possible, while retaining most of the charm and wit of the original web content :-) is and ought to be, the primary goal. This means black on white, first page to last. This also means
 pasting the copied website HTML into blank white pages. Fortunately, Word automatically reverses the color when pasting white on white.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since we jumped ahead slightly, going a step or two ahead of where we had yet to go with this, the next step would be choosing "Select All" and converting all the text into Times Roman, one of the two fonts that Amazon recommends as optimal for eBooks. Because
 I already used Times Roman for most of my text, that particular matter is of no concern. After that, the margins must be set accordingly and then using the "Styles" menu, separate headings from body text. Sounds simple, right? Hardly, I know :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Be that as it may, please let me know whether I accurately targeted what concerned you, or whether I missed something along the way (which I am more than apt to do :-) I can't say too often, how much it means to me to have an opportunity to explain things
 in more detail, let alone be helped along the way. Thanks again.</p>

<p>Hi <strong>Sgraham2010, </strong></p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Which browser are you using?.<br />
2.&nbsp;Do you have an issue with sound on other applications?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
a) if you not able to hear sound at all, then I would suggest you to <strong>update the audio drivers</strong> and checks what happens.</p>
<p>b) If it's&nbsp;only while playing online games, check for the version of Java installed on your computer. Unisntall and re-instal Java program.</p>
<p>c) Check for the drivers and ensure that you have the latest version installed on your computer.<br />
<br />
d) As it seems to be a web based games , check for the security settings.<br />
<br />
e) Check that the speakers are plugged into the computer and also check for the power cord plugged into the outlet. Make sure that the speakers&nbsp; are "On" and the sound has not been muted.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
f) Check in the game itself and make sure that someone has not turned off the sound.<br />
Pogo games have a nice, simple way to disable the in-game sounds that you hear while playing. In each game, there is a speaker icon or button. In most games, it is located next to the '?' button in the bottom left- or right-hand corner of the screen. Simply
 click this button in any game to turn the sound on or off.</p>
<p>If you disable the sound in one game, we assume that you want it turned off for all games. So you'll need to turn it back on if you go into another game for which you want or need to hear the sound. Just click the button or icon again to enable the sound.</p>
<p>Make sure that the sound button in the game shows a picture of a speaker with sound waves (curved lines) coming out of the speaker. If there are no sound waves in front of the speaker symbol, the game's sound has been disabled.</p>
<p>If there are sound waves in front of the speaker, you may have another program running in the background that uses sound, like a CD Player. Likewise, you may need to make sure you system's sound is enabled.</p>
<p>Next, make sure your computer's sounds is not muted and is set high enough for you to hear.</p>
<p>You can un-mute and adjust your system's volume in several ways. Here are two common options that you can try:</p>
<p>Systray Icon – Click the Speaker Icon (typically located next to the System Clock in the bottom right-hand corner of the Windows Taskbar). Then just make sure the Mute box is unchecked and move the volume slider up for higher volume. As you adjust the volume,
 you should hear a "ping" noise to indicate the current volume level.</p>
<p>Start/Run – Click the Start button on the Windows Taskbar, then select Run.... Type "mmsys.cpl" (without the quotation marks) in the text field and click OK. Under the Volume tab, make sure the Mute box is unchecked and move the volume slider up for higher
 volume. As you adjust the volume you should hear a "ping" noise to indicate the current volume level.</p>
<p>If you do not hear the "ping" sound, check to make sure your speakers are plugged into your computer. If they are self-powered, make sure they are plugged into the wall, turned on, and that their manual volume knob is up.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            How do I view all Outlook content on all of my devices&#63;</h2>
                    Pardon my ignorance but I've read other discussions about calendar sharing but I need the answer even more dumbed down. I want to be able to sync all information between all devices, desktop, laptop and iphone. I have Office 365 installed on all devices
 but the only thing that I can access from one computer to the other is my inbox. Once I move something to another folder on my desktop I can no longer view it on my laptop. I haven't been able get anything from Outlook on my iphone. I thought the whole point
 of 365 was to be able to share between all devices? Help please!

            Thank you. I'm not sure that I understand your question "Where exactly is this other Calendar folder that you are moving appointments to?". &nbsp;I would like to be able to schedule an appointment on my desktop Outlook and have it appear on my laptop Outlook
 and visa versa.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I'm not sure of anything. What is a local pst file and how would I find out if it is or not? Obviously I am a new user of Outlook so like I said, dumb it down as far as possible please. Thanks again:-)&nbsp;</div>

            I use it to schedule both home and work events but as my personal calendar. So am I to understand that 365 Home doesn't allow one to view their calendar on both their desktop and laptop? I would have to purchase the business version for this kind of sharing
 between devices? Is that what you mean by a "full Outlook Exchange"?

Where did you get the idea it lacks Exchange connection? It works fine against exchange. It's not licensed for businesses to use, but individuals can use it to check their business email.&nbsp;

No, you are misunderstanding. Whether you can share your calendar between your laptop, desktop, and smartphone depends solely on what type of email account you have, not which Office suite you buy. You need to use an account that stores the calendar and contacts
 online - a POP3 or IMAP account with a local calendar can't be shared without using 3rd party software.&nbsp;
<div>The tools section at <a href="http://www.slipstick.com/outlook/sharing/sharing-outlook-calendar-and-contacts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Sharing calendar and contacts between two computers</a>&nbsp;has utilities you can use to sync the two computers. Some are free for two computers and a limited number of folders.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Since you have an iphone, another option is the icloud - it can sync one outlook to the icloud, which syncs to your phone and down to your other computer, if you install the icloud on both computers.&nbsp;</div>

            I think my question is along the same lines. &nbsp;I've installed Office 365 Home Premium on a desktop (Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit) and a "tablet"&nbsp;(Windows 7 Professional 64-bit)&nbsp;and would like both to access a common list of Contacts. &nbsp;The e-mail account
 is POP3 and I've done nothing with Outlook.com. &nbsp;Why can't Outlook data files reside on Skydrive? &nbsp;Seems very hard to find any info dealing specifically with setting up O365 Home Premium. &nbsp;Thanks in advance.

            Geoff, your Office 365 subscription comes with an email account that can be accessed by multiple devices.&nbsp; All of your email data, Contacts and Calendar are stored in the cloud; there's no need to sync this type of account as the content isn't stored locally
 (so no need to store it in SkyDrive either).<br />
<br />
Try this walk-through to ensure you are properly setting up your account with Outlook 2013:<br />
<br />
Connect Outlook to this account - office365 suite - Office.com<br />

<p>Anyone know what this is all about and if it is possible to get it back as it previously was?&nbsp; Why oh why has MS changed so many fundamental things that worked so beautifully before???????????????????&nbsp; One step forward, 2 steps back..... Hummmmm.</p>

            <p>Ctl + G is an easy way to get to the vbe, and you get the immediate window as a bonus.</p>
<p>By the way, when you get to A2010, you will find that many shortcut key combinations have changed. It is my understanding that those changes were essential - I forget the reason - but I'm sure they are not changed just for the fun of it.</p>

    <title>Can the Photo tile only scroll thru a max of 5 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeff a. davis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can the Photo tile only scroll thru a max of 5 &#34;Favorites&#34;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I ask because I have more than that marked as Favorites, all done using the same process and all 10 of them being in Camera Roll, and yet I&nbsp; never see but the same 5, ever.</p>
<p>Not that it should matter, but my phone is a Nokia Lumia 950.</p>
<p>So my guess is that there's some limit that they just don't tell us about, similar to how they don't tell us that only Favorites that are saved in the right places like Camera Roll can be shown in the scrolling at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't think pics in Saved Photos or Screenshots can ever be made to scroll as Favs.</p>
<p>Luckily, I know how to just put them wherever I want them by using my computer, a cable &amp; the computer's File Explorer.</p>

<h2>            Malware&#47;Spyware on Kindle</h2>
                    My son has a Kindle (older version-no camera) recently I found that it is full of duplicate applications: such as the calendar- the duplicates are malware/spyware. They can make passwords steal credit card info ect ect. I was under the incorrect assumption
 that the kindle was not as susceptible to these threats-any advice on how to correct? most will not be deleted (there are a lot on the device). Any help given will be greatly appreciated! Thanks-

<p>We appreciate your thoughts about this feature. As what previous moderators mentioned, by default, Skype nicknames will override those names that you've saved on your People page. Please post your opinions or suggestions to the link provided by my colleague

<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Word VBA to insert Word signature line and set the properties - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cjphil  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word VBA to insert Word signature line and set the properties</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have a macro that inserts a building block of rows into a table.&nbsp; The macro uses an input box to put a title into the first row.&nbsp; I would like to be able to use that string to be the Name property of the signature line.&nbsp; Is that possible?&nbsp; I haven't
 been able to figure out how to write the code to add the signature line yet either.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's my code so far.&nbsp; It searches for Peer Review and then inserts the bb above that.&nbsp; At first I embedded the signature line in the building block itself but I couldn't figure out how to programmatically add the string to the Name property.&nbsp; This is needed
 for the signing function to work with the CoSign&nbsp;signature process&nbsp;we're using.&nbsp; Individuals do not click on the signature block to sign.&nbsp; They go to SharePoint, click the ellipsis twice and choose Sign with CoSign.&nbsp; Then they have to select the which signature
 line choice from a dropdown list.&nbsp; That's why I need to be able to change the Name properties for the additional signers added outside of the normal template of three signers.&nbsp; Sorry&nbsp;this sounds so confusing.</p>

            Hi Cindy,
<br />
<br />I am confused! Sorry.
<br />
<br />Here is a link to Greg Maxey's article on Building Blocks and AutoText. It includes vba to insert that may help.
<br />
<br />You could certainly include a content control/field/bookmark in you building block which could be the destination for the name. That could be accessed by your code or by the user.
<br />
<br />I hope this information helps. Please let me know if you have any more questions or require further help.
<br />
<br />Regards       
        </p>

<p>Charles, my fault, I reread it and it didn't make as &nbsp;much sense as I thought when I hit submit.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My dilemma is I have a building block that is two table rows.&nbsp; The second row has a Microsoft signature line on it.&nbsp; The building block is for optional approvers.&nbsp; It works fine as far as inserting the rows and the signature line.&nbsp; When&nbsp;the building block&nbsp;is
 inserted in the document, it is inserted prior to existing required signature lines in the document.&nbsp; That ends up putting the signature line field numbering out of whack for the signers when using SharePoint/CoSign to sign.&nbsp; I may end up with two signature
 5s for example.&nbsp; To fix that I need a way to programmatically create the signature line properties.&nbsp; I did add signature names to the building blocks but they are generic.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My goal is to marry the table row title created by the input box with the Name property field of the signature line inserted from the building block.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or as an alternative, I could add the table rows as a building block&nbsp;then have a separate macro insert the signature line field&nbsp;but again, I would need to have the text from the input box saved as a string to populate the Name on the signature line property.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully this makes better sense,</p>
<p>thanks,</p>
<p>Cindy</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure if this is any clearer, I hope so.</p>

            If you want, save a sample of your template with the problem on OneDrive or Dropbox and paste a link here. Remove any confidential or sensitive information first. I or someone else can take a look at it. Include both the coding and the building blocks.

<p>Charles, thank you for your willingness to help.&nbsp; Unfortunately I don't have access to either of those options on our corporate computers.&nbsp; I may have to live with a generic name as the property of the additional signers.</p>
