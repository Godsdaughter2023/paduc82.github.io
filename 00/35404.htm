            <p>Hi Sudharshan</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply. I managed resolve the issue. It was question 4 and to&nbsp;answer your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Which program or software are you referring to? First with "Blackboard Collaborate" and then it was with any software with installer package (.msi).</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Did you make any changes to the pc prior to this issue? No, but I upgraded from Win 8.1 to Win 10 few months ago</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Is your pc connected to a domain network? No</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Have you logged in as admin on the pc? Yes, but I have to add me as a user with full control again to resolve the issue (see link below)</span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Have you started the windows installer service on the pc? Yes</span></p>
<p><span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Is the issue specific to this program or software? No</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found this link, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvPX4noRPwg"&nbsp;which helped me to fix it. The confusion was this error&nbsp;message "<span>"There is a problem with this windows Installer package. A DLL required for this install to complete could not be
 run. Contact your</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span><span>support personnel of package vendor" when I try to install. So I thought it was an error with the "Blackboard". I didn't realise until I tried to install a different
 software. And it didn't give the MS error number, I found out later going through MS error messages. If it says "admin or right issue it would have been easier to find the solution.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind Regards</p>
<p>Dinesh</p>

<p>Hi mrjackmsd!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to us with this issue. It sounds like your game is freezing up and causing the console to freeze. My recommendation is to use our
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/games/troubleshooting/game-freeze-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Game Freeze solution</a> wizard to troubleshoot the issue so that you can continue to play normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that this helps you out! Let us know the results as well please.</p>

            Also it is not a Freeze problem cause a Freeze is all is not working. I Have a partial on the screen the double circle In the right lower corner and I can hear that the game is running in the background. I used to be a Beta Tester for
<span>Sanctuary </span>Wood many years ago before they were bought out

<h2>            Region locked content</h2>
                    
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>I know every game disc i buy from anywhere at the world it plays because all xbox one games is region free.</p>
<p>But what happened with dlcs?</p>

<p>I leave at Greece(Region 2) and i want to buy a game like destiny from America because i find it at lower price so i want to ask you.</p>

<p>01. The dlc's of the game i must download when i have choose from my xbox one s menu settings -&gt; system -&gt; language &amp; location -&gt; location(The location was the game i buy) and then if i want i must return it at location(Greece)? Does it work the dlcs of
 the game?</p>
<p>02. I have try that with some digital games like unravel i buy as Greece location and turn it to United states location and the game plays normally.</p>

<p>So what really happening with dlcs of every game???</p>

<p>A lot of thanks for your time and your answers.</p>

<p>The Xbox One is a region free console so what that means is...</p>
<p>The DLC's will work just fine, you can buy them and switch back to your native region. The same can be done with redeemable codes, so if you buy a code for a game or service for the US, switch your region to the United States and redeem.</p>
<p>As long as you have a valid form of payment you shouldn't run into any issues!</p>

<p>So you mean that if I buy one game from America and I want to buy any dlc for that game I must change the locale from Xbox one to America buy some dollar gift card and buy the dlc I want and download it then I can return the locale to greece I am correct?
</p>
<p>Did you try that you describe or not? </p>
<p>If I let the locale to Greece I can't download the game from America dlc??? </p>

<p>Not what Im saying at all. Might be some bad explanation on my part. </p>
<p>You can buy the game from America and purchase the DLC from your country. But if the DLC is cheaper like the game you purchased you can switch to America and buy it there.</p>
<p>Gift cards aren't required, but if you ever get ahold of a gift card from a separate country you'll need to switch to that region and redeem it, then you can switch back.</p>
<p>Like I said Xbox One is region free, so games and DLC can be purchased from any form of retail and work perfectly fine no matter what country.</p>

<p>The Xbox One is only region free for physical copies of games.Most digital content is now region locked for that very reason.To many people were switching location in order to get cheaper digital content.</p>
<p>Changing your region/location in order to download content from a different region is against the ToU/CoC &amp; could result in enforcement action on your account.</p>
<p>You would need to buy any dlc from your own region.</p>

<p>from my understanding, region switching to access other content is not illegal, however using false payment information is.</p>
<p>so if you switch to japan to get a free Game With Gold (for example), that should be fine. &nbsp;i believe even a response from Major Nelson said that was ok and would not cause bans on your account.</p>
<p>however if you make up a fake address in Japan (or use a real one that isn't yours) for a credit card, so you can buy something only available in Japan, that is considered fraud, and you could get in trouble.</p>

<p>Incorrect.Changing your region/location to get content cheaper or that is not available in your region is classed as marketplace theft &amp; a bannable offence.</p>

<p>i would like to hear an official statement on this. &nbsp;there is a HUGE debate that arises every time some regions get a different free GWG from the rest of the world.</p>
<p>in may this statement was made by a user: "I believe there is some sort of mention of this being illegal in the ToS, but many people have given evidence that would prove otherwise like support conversations saying its ok."</p>
<p>link: <a href="http://www.trueachievements.com/forum/viewthread.aspx?tid=800884&amp;anchor=6294077#m6294077" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.trueachievements.com/.../viewthread.aspx</a></p>
<p>however i was unable to find any proof of any official support staff saying one way or the other.</p>
<p>the general basis of the debate is: "I see the confusion here. No, changing the region of your account/console is not falsifying anything, as no where in Microsoft's ToS does it state your account or console must be registered to the marketplace of the region
 you are located in. They even provide the mechanism for changing such region on the fly (on Xbox One store and Windows 10 marketplaces, at the least).</p>
<p>However, it is the case that your payment method must be a valid representation of yourself, according to Microsoft/their payment processors. Whatever you put as your payment method (including but not limited to legal name, payment type, and address) must
 be legally related to you, else you are falsifying information and committing fraud."</p>
<p>which is from this thread, spanning the entirety of page 6;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.trueachievements.com/forum/viewthread.aspx?tid=801595&amp;anchor=6479015#m6479015" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.trueachievements.com/.../viewthread.aspx</a></p>
<p>this falls in line with how i understood it: &nbsp;changing regions and downloading free or paid stuff is not techincally a bannable offense, unless you use false information. &nbsp;(or if it is bannable, it rarely ever happens, or doesn't happen anymore?) &nbsp;they allow
 you to change your region without really needing prove of a physical move, and that fact that you can change back and forth anytime (no 3 month wait), would indicate they do not expect you to actually have moved residence every time you switch.</p>
<p>but again, this is not a statement of fact, just my interpretation of the rules. &nbsp;some people agree with that, others do not. &nbsp;we need a MR MS or MRS to come in and give the final word, Please?</p>

<h2>            Bluetooth mouse stops working when using remote desktop</h2>
                    Hello, I have a Dell i7 using Windows 8 and a bluetooth Sculpt comfort mouse.&nbsp; Both work together well, but whenever I use remote desktop, the mouse stops working.&nbsp; I have checked the windows logs, but don't see anything apparent that would account for
 the bluetooth mouse to stop working with RDP.&nbsp; Is this a known issue?&nbsp; And is there any known fix?<br />

            <p>Hi Sharief, thanks for the quick reply!&nbsp; I think I might have found my own solution to the problem.&nbsp; I ended up deleting the bluetooth driver that came with my Dell laptop and allowed the Microsoft Generic bluetooth driver to take over.&nbsp; Now the mouse works
 like a charm, especially when I'm using RDP.&nbsp;&nbsp; I haven't had a problem yet on the generic driver.&nbsp; Thanks again!<br />

            Homegroup has actually been removed from Windows in the latest updates.

<h2>            Can&#39;t Reserve Windows 10 Update on my Toshiba Tablet</h2>
                    <p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Toshiba WT8-B&nbsp; seven inch tablet.&nbsp; I recently got a notification on my Toshiba Laptop to reserve Windows 10 for a free update.&nbsp; I tried to do it on my Toshiba tablet, but I did not get a notification in my taskbar. I then went to the Windows 10
 website and clicked on the reserve Windows 10 link button (the blue button),....but nothing happened. Whether I try to click on it using the desktop IE11 or Metro/Modern IU IE11, it doesn't work. I have already installed all updates for my Windows 8.1 OS&nbsp;including
 KB3035583 (which is what I was told needed installing from looking at another forum).</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's my next step...or is this free upgrade not compatible with tablet computers?</p>

<h2>            My Dell Lat E6430 won&#39;t boot from my SSD</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Recently I bought a Samsung 500gb SSD for my Dell Laptop.</p>
<p>I followed the instructions migrate my Windows 10 from the existing 320GB Hard Drive onto the SSD.</p>
<p>Eveything went smoothly and I have used and enjoyed my faster laptop for several months without a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning I tried to Boot up and though the montior came on after a few moments the screen went blank and the computer seemed to be searching for the Boot drive but nothing happened. I have remove the SSD and used a USB to SATA adaptor connector cable
 to plug the SSD into my PC to check it.</p>
<p>I get an error message "Do I want to scan and fix the Drive because they maybe problems with some of the files?"</p>
<p>
</p><p>The SSD was new so is the SSD faulty ? or is it a problem with Dell ?</p>
<p>Could it be caused by a Windows 10 update? How should proceed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kevin</p>
<p>P.s my Dell only has the SSD drive so I have no other way of booting up.</p>

            <p>It is always sensible in this situation to run a check for malware</p>

<h2>            Win 10 key &#34;already used on another PC&#34;, support of no help.</h2>
                    On Saturday I've build myself a new PC and got myself a new copy of Win7 Pro. I downloaded the ISO for Win 10 and used that and the new key to upgrade to Win 10 Pro (via a clean install). The activation went fine, but I soon made an error, which essentially
 left my Windows unusable, not having much to lose, I just did another clean install, but this time I was unable to activate my copy. I tried to register by phone today which was unsuccessful. I was forwarded to a man with a machine gun mouth. I have literally
 no idea what he said, I just know that I've given up and felt a bit perplex. Google came up with nothing suitable so I'm asking here: Is there another way to get this activated without having to call those people again?
<br />
<br />
Sorry for the long story.

            <p>Instead of using the key again reinstall Windows 10 but when setup asks for the key use the "I don't have a key" option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although you can upgrade Windows 7 to 10 using a key the end result is your computer is registered with having a digital entitlement on the Microsoft Servers. Now when your computer needs to authenticate it will find that the hardware hash is already registered
 and will authenticate automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead of reloading the PC Windows now has the Reset function. Go to Start, Settings, Update &amp; security, Recovery. Look at the options under Reset this PC.</p>

            I live in Germany, which is a bit unusual in that respect. You will find that buying OEM licenses is perfectly legal for everyone here. I'm not sure if the seller would technically have had to bother with shipping an actual product, but with access to
 high speed Internet a lot of people don't see the need anymore. Sending a photo of the sticker or just the key is a valued customer service and I don't know anyone but me who has bought a physical copy since Win 7 was released.

            So I just install it on top of my current installation? I shall try that tonight! Thank you! :) Otherwise I guess I'd have to buy a new key.

            <p>And most of that is possibly why it might not be genuine </p>
<p>oem key resold to anyone willing to buy them = scam.</p>
<p>The only exception would be If the key was for a single system builder channel and not listed as a oem in a mag report.</p>
<p>A true system builder would be listed as such.</p>

            <p>I have to agree that a key only purchase has to be treated with extreme caution. it does not matter where you are Microsoft have NEVER sanctioned key only sales for Windows 7 OEM or Retail product, they never implemented electronic distribution and only
 had the Get Legal program for a while. In fact single license OEM would be in contravention of the terms and conditions, system builders are required specifically to include original media.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to eliminate the error being due to reusing the key your only option is to try the no key install and see if it activates after the event. Follow that same path as before but check the Activation screen for "digital entitlement" although it can
 take a day or two.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it still fails then almost certainly the "another PC" is almost certainly not yours i.e. a pirated key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your next option is then to buy Windows 10, legitimately available electronically direct from Microsoft.</p>

            Selling OEMs to everyone has been entirely normal in Germany for a very long time. Anyone can walk into any electronics store, including big multi-nationals, and legally buy or order OEM Windows. There is nothing shady about this.

            Hi tovahschwartz,
<div>When you logoff, Windows must close all programs (programs cannot continue running if no user is logged in). &nbsp;You might try using the
<i>sleep</i>&nbsp;command instead, which leaves your programs running and ready for the next time you use your computer.</div>

            <p>At best I believe all you can do is Pin word to your Taskbar,</p>
<p>Enable jump lists of Recent items,</p>
<p>Right click your Start button and select Properties,</p>
<p>Check both Privacy boxes,</p>
<p>Then at least you will have this item/ items on the jump list where you can open it straight away when you log back in.</p>

<p>You will still have to Manually save your work or set word to Auto save every minute/ 60 seconds....</p>

<p>The Over Forty Clan [OFCx].&nbsp; We know you're out there</p>
<p>[Original text by ftmomesa10]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Welcome To The [OFCx] (Over Forty Clan) Recruitment Thread.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; The OFC is a multi-platform gaming community made up by gamers, for gamers who have been here since the dawn of modern gaming.&nbsp; We didn’t play by the rules, we created them.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; We cut our teeth on “Pong” and the early Atari, Coleco and Intellivision systems.&nbsp; We were shocked at the bright colors and the awesome graphic improvements of the first 8 bit Nintendo and Sega systems.&nbsp; We saw the light with the inception of the 16 bit systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 And finally, we stood there, salivating with mouth agape in anticipation of the first CD and DVD based consoles.&nbsp; Oh yes, we have been there and experienced it all.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; We now would like to take this opportunity to extend an invitation to the XBOX gamers who, like us, have been there from the beginning.&nbsp; But first, a very brief history.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
&nbsp; The OFC was formed in early 2009 by a group of gamers who had these things in common, they all loved video games and they were all 40 (or close to) years old or older.&nbsp; They knew they were not alone.&nbsp; These few brave men (pioneers, if you will) knew there
 was a yearning, a niche that needed to be filled and they saw a beacon of light in the dark.&nbsp; That beacon was the OFC.&nbsp; After a few weeks of grueling labor (I’m sure some colorful language as well) a forum was born.&nbsp; A forum that was unlike any that came before
 it.&nbsp; They knew then that they had created something special.&nbsp; This forum was a tribute, nay, an homage to the middle aged gamer.&nbsp; They also knew, these Gods of men, that this was their legacy.&nbsp; Thus was the birth of the OFC.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; Now that I have your attention, let me tell you what we’re about.&nbsp; We are a non-competitive clan who are just into having fun.&nbsp; In fact, that is our number one rule.&nbsp; We know that at the end of the day you want to just relax and blow off some steam, and what
 better way to do that then with people want the same thing.&nbsp; We are all around 40 years old (some younger, some older) who want to kick back enjoy some time with people our own age who share the same interests.&nbsp; We have over 400 members from all over North
 America, the U.K. and throughout Europe.&nbsp; We believe that we have something special here and would like to share it with our fellow gamers.&nbsp; If you like what you are reading, check us out.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; Here is what we expect from you:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; Have fun.&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; Be respectful toward the other clan mates.&nbsp; Offensive members will not be tolerated.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp; No cheating, hacking, glitching or boosting.&nbsp; If you do so, you will be banned and reported to Microsoft.&nbsp; We believe in the fairness of play.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.&nbsp; No console bashing.&nbsp; We are a multi-platform clan who all wear the same clantag.&nbsp; In fact, since a lot of games are cross platform, we post in the same threads.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.&nbsp; You must be at least 40 years of age. (or close to 40)<br />
<br />
If you don’t think that you can comply with these or any other rules set forth by our founding members or site Administrators, then we thank you for your time and ask that you move along.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you think what has been posted here looks pretty good, all we ask
 is that you check us out.</p>

    <title>MW3 Matchmaking Connection Issues When Using Same Internet - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            MW3 Matchmaking Connection Issues When Using Same Internet</h2>
                    
<p>Hello. I recently started to have a problem when trying to connect to a match with my brother. He lives in the same house as me and we both use the same internet. (FiOS internet as I live here in NY) Things were working fine until literally 2 nights ago.
 2 nights in which NOTHING has changed. When I try to connect to a match by myself, I connect quickly and with no problem. Same goes for him. We can even start separate games at the same time, and play. However, when we are in a party together, the game seems
 to endlessly search for "good games" and never really finds them. When it finally does it typically ends up being us two, and maybe one or two other person, where all the others were kicked or didnt connect for whatever reason. I am not sure if this is one
 of the billion issues with this game that Activision and Infinity Ward seem to so carelessly ignore (must be easy to do while you take a bath in $100 bills) or what. Because I am no novice to networking or computers, and this one has me stumped. And very very
 aggravated. I would also like to add that it says both of our NATs are OPEN, so the issue is not there. Nor is it any simple or obvious answer, by my guessing. Any help, insight, or info on the matter would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>SHORT STORY FOR THOSE WITH ADD: Can't connect to a match when in a party with someone connected through the same internet. Both of us have NAT Open. Can play by ourselves perfectly fine. Please help.</p>

<p>One possibility would be that you don't have enough bandwidth to handle both connections to the lobby at the same time, and therefore can't find a connection at the same speed. But since this is a recent problem and you both can play fine without being in
 a lobby, I would tend to discount this. I would first try resetting your router, and see if that fixes the problem. If not, it may be a problem with your ISP that is slowing the connection speed. You may have to contact their Customer Support and find out
 more information.</p>

<p>Thanks for the replies. I should have mentioned that I tried just about everything. Resetting routers, modems, Xboxes, port forwarding, port triggering, you name it. I probably tried it. I have no idea what to do and I've wasted so much time on this, I'm
 really ticked off. These million dollar companies don't know how to make something work properly on its own. It's pathetic. Modern Warfare 3 is clearly a broken game and my fix to this issue is throwing my game in the trash. Because its only this game that
 has the issue.</p>

Click on: Download Windows 7 games for Windows 10<br />
<br />
<br />
Note: A Windows Update such as the Anniversary Update may cause the games to not function. If that happens, remove the zip file and extracted files, reboot and reinstall it. In case the download page somehow disappears from the Internet, I would advise saving
 a copy of the zip file to an external device such as a DVD. <br />

Thank you for the suggestion. I will need to wait for my son to follow through your suggested process. I look forward to the Windows 7 version.

    <title>Deleting Images Causes Freeze - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Deleting Images Causes Freeze</h2>
                    I just highlighted two jpg images in a folder, hit Delete and instantly got the hourglass. While in the freeze I can't do anything in the folder. I don't have any other programs associated with these images open, matter of fact didn't have any other programs
 open at all. I was able to minimize the folder, but now if I click the folder in Sys Tray I hear that 'bong' sound.<br />
<br />
The rest of my system (while outside of the folder) seems to be working fine. This has happened a few times over the last few months, but I've also deleted quite a few images in between these episodes with no problems.<br />
<br />
In Task Manager I see the folder. Should I just click 'end task' ? Will this mess up anything in the folder?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
OK, after 5 minutes it un froze, and I was able to click 'Delete'. Why is this randomly happening?<br />

            When right clicking in Windows Explorer (not INternet Explorer) causes problems, I think of misbehaving Explorer shell extensions - those things that help make up the right click menu in Explorer.<br />
<br />
See if those ideas from contributor Elizabeth23 yield more clues, there here are some ideas to help troubleshoot afflicted Explorer shell extensions (that may also cause Explorer.exe to crash):<br />
<br />
<br />
When Windows Explorer (not Internet Explorer) is misbehaving (especially when right clicking), start to suspect third party Explorer extension add-ons.&nbsp; You may also see Data Execution Prevention (DEP) errors.&nbsp; DEP errors are reported when XP feels threatened
 by a program and XP will shut down the threatening program.&nbsp; XP should never feel threatened by Windows Explorer (or Internet Explorer) unless some add-on is the cause.<br />
<br />
Those would be Explorer extensions that do not belong to Microsoft.&nbsp; That means extensions that you added.&nbsp; Explorer extensions are usually okay and installing some applications will install Explorer extensions for you, give you a choice and sometimes they
 can be added without your knowledge when you install new software.<br />
<br />
Explorer extensions are sometimes added as a new right click option you see on folders and files (like scan this file, open this file, play this song).<br />
<br />
If there is a particular thing you do when Exploring that you know will cause the problem, that will help zero in on the problem and help you know for sure when you have found and fixed it.&nbsp; If you can make it happen anytime you want, make an adjustment and
 then there is no message the next time you do whatever it is you do, you have found and fixed it.<br />
<br />
First you need a way to see what Explorer add-ons you have installed now and a way to disable them (not uninstall them) so you can figure out which one is causing the problem.&nbsp; You may have lots of non Microsoft extensions installed you don't even know about.<br />
<br />
Download ShellExView from here to see which Explorer extensions you have loaded:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/shexview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/shexview.html</a><br />
<br />
ShellExView doesn't install anything on your computer, it just runs and displays.<br />
<br />
After you launch ShellExView (double click shexview.exe) and acknowledge the security warning, adjust the column widths so you can see everything clearly.&nbsp; Under Options, choose to "Mark Non-Microsoft Extensions" and the non Microsoft extensions will be in
 light pink, but on some systems that is a hard color to see, so click View, Choose Columns and move up or move down the Microsoft column so it is closer to the top (Move Up) so you can see it on your screen without having to scroll left and right.<br />
<br />
Next, click the column header called Microsoft to sort the display (by clicking the Microsoft column header) so all the non Microsoft extensions are at the top and easy to see.&nbsp; They will say "No" since they are not Microsoft extensions.<br />
<br />
The non Microsoft extensions would be things you have added (non Microsoft) and are what you need to be suspecting.<br />
<br />
If you see extensions that do not have anything listed under Description, Product Name, Version, Company or have peculiar names that looks like they might be just random numbers and letters, you might want to look at those first.<br />
<br />
You can also Google the name of a suspicious add-on and see if there are any hits regarding Explorer crashes or DEP errors and what other people have done about it.<br />
<br />
You might Google something like:<br />
<br />
&lt;my-suspicious-add-on&gt;&nbsp; XP&nbsp; explorer&nbsp; crashing<br />
<br />
You have to fill in the name of your suspicious add on.<br />
<br />
See what kind of search results hits you get and look for solutions or situations that sound like yours.<br />
<br />
I am not a trial and error advocate, but I can't think of another way to do this...<br />
<br />
Right click and disable the non Microsoft extensions one at a time (or perhaps in little groups of 3-5) keeping a list so you can enable them again later if desired. The result of the change is immediate and no reboot is required.&nbsp; Test your failure condition.&nbsp;
 If Explorer starts to act normally, you will know that some extension you just disabled in that group of 3-5 is the culprit so you can start to enable them one at a time until explorer fails again.<br />
<br />
If you recognize any extensions that may have been added or downloaded recently, start with those first.<br />
<br />
Disabling an extension does not uninstall the extension - it is just disabled.&nbsp; You can always enable it again later, so keep track of things by writing them down.<br />
<br />
Disable them one at a time or in little groups (to make things go faster) until your right click does not generate an error, then reboot and test again.&nbsp; That last extension you disabled would be the suspicious one.<br />
<br />
You can also just disable all the non Microsoft extensions, reboot, test your failure condition and enable them one at a time until you find the one that generates the failure condition.<br />
<br />
If you have a lot of extensions, you could disable them is little groups, 3-5 at a time instead of 1 at a time until your system starts to behave.&nbsp; When it does behave, you will know that the problem is one of the extensions in that little group and you can
 enable those in the group one at a time until the problem comes back, then the problem will be with the last extension you enabled.<br />
<br />
The hope is that you will find the one extension that causes the problem and then you can figure out what to do about it - either uninstall it or see if you can get an update from the maker of the extension from their web page.<br />
<br />
I don't have your issue but I can when you disable/enable the extensions, the extension is immediately disabled, so disabling an extension does not seem to require a reboot but if you think you found the problem, I would reboot and retest anyway to really be
 sure the problem is gone.<br />
<br />
If you post up a list of your non Microsoft extensions, maybe someone will recognize it as a potential problem.<br />
<br />
If you find the offending extension that is the problem, please let us know what it is so I can add it to my list!<br />

            I drag the image onto desktop and R click, and it freezes. <br />
Haven't tried to delete in Safe mode.<br />
<br />
Ran the ShellView, and see quite alot of MSoft marked in pink, have no idea how to try and root out an extension.<br />

            That's about the pinkest I've seen :-)<br />
<br />
It may not be a shell extension, but it looks like you have some "groups" you might disable them in clumps, like all the Autocad, all the Corel, all the Dropbox, etc.&nbsp; Have you updated any of those things lately?&nbsp; If yes, start with those.<br />
<br />
Don't be afraid to disable them, since nothing gets uninstalled, they just get disabled so just disable a clump and test and see how things work, disable some more, test until you find the one(s) that when disabled, the problem goes away.<br />
<br />
Or you could select and disable 1-10, then 11-20, 21-30, etc. until you find the group that has the suspicious extension, then enable them one by one until the problem comes back.&nbsp; It is a process of elimination since there is quite a list of things that cause
 Explorer to crash and another quite a list that cause big delays and even some are older Microsoft versions.<br />
<br />
When you figure it out, just enable everything but that one(s) again.<br />
<br />
This may not be the problem at all, so there may be some other ideas too.<br />

so are one of those apps causing this then?<br />

this happens so randomly, except for this sudden rash of Hour glasses.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mine was an ext added by Superantispyware,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>to disable, (not delete) right click on item and choose disable, if you want to disable 10 at once, highlight one, hold the control key down and select the other nine and right click and choose disable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then test deleting with those disabled.</p>

<p>ALLRIGHT! I finally found a fix for this issue, but I recommend doing a backup and or getting advise from a Microsoft Agent. While doing it, my computer was suspended in a "Getting windows ready, don't turn off your computer" and I was stuck... I was really
 scared. <br />
<br />
It has to do with your Registry keys. I found my answer on this thread : <br />
https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/xbox-app-game-dvr-capture-save-location/2c259b81-b6c2-41f0-91d1-8161e418378b</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>"I see the issue now. Do you recall how you got in this state?</p>
<p>Also, could you sign into the Xbox app with your Microsoft Account. Go to settings --&gt; Game DVR tab, and scroll to the "Saving captures" section. What does it say in the blank below:</p>
<p>"Save game clips and screenshots in _________"</p>
<p>If you are comfortable editing the registry, there is a way to fix this. From start, type "regedit", click Yes on the UAC prompt. Go to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders.</p>
<p>Here you should see your currently assigned folders for Music, Desktop, Favorites, etc. Look for Captures. If you don't see captures, look for this string: "{EDC0FE71-98D8-4F4A-B920-C8DC133CB165}". The corresponding value for you should be "Z:"</p>
<p>To change it back to default, double click on that row, and in the "Value data" field, replace "Z:" with "%USERPROFILE%\Videos\Captures", without the quotes. Click OK, close regedit, and try recording a new video. It should save it in the Captures folder.
 Let me know if that worked for you, or we can try something else." (<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/5fe9b7fc-2b35-48b7-a19c-b0a29d797884" title="Rohan - Windows Camera Team [MSFT]">Rohan
 - Windows Camera Team [MSFT]</a>)<br />
</p>
<p>
For our problem, instead of "Z:" you should see the original location of your capture folder before it got to temp. Mine was a drive letter that didn't work anymore. So change the value to whatever folder you want your captures to now be or to the original
 location as specified in the answer I copy-pasted </p></div>

            I don't know if this will work, but you could try reactivating by Telephone:<br />
<br />
<br />
Activate Windows 7 manually:<br />
1. Click Start, and in the Search box type :&nbsp; slui.exe 4<br />
<br />
2. Press ENTER on your Keyboard<br />
<br />
3. Select your Country.<br />
4. Select the Phone Activation option, and hold on for a real person. <br />
<br />
If the above does not work or that option is not available to the RC, you might want to consider migrating to the Windows 7 Enterprise 90 day trial or final product:<br />
<br />
windows7 enterprise 90 day trial http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/cc442495.aspx&nbsp; Select IT Pro for your background to receive access to the download.
