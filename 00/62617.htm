            Hi  Derekrm, if that is a one-off BSOD, I would not be overly concerned, it may be that Windows was updating a drier in the background when that happened
<br />
<br />However, if you have had more than one BSOD, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .       
        </p>

            Hi.
<br />
<br />The BSOD is an error screen display which can occur within Windows 10 for a variety of reasons, such as when a critical process died or the boot device becomes inaccessible. Anything from software to hardware conflicts can create a BSOD. Unfortunately, the reasons for a BSOD can remain a mystery
<br />
<br />I would recommend you to check your SSD or Hard Disk HDD with chkdsk.
<br />1.- First, close all the programs and files that you have open.
<br />2.- Click with the right mouse button in the Windows Start menu and select Control Panel. Then choose the category System and security. On the next screen, look down Administrative Tools on the right and click on that option.
<br />3.- One of those tools is the Windows Memory Diagnostic. Double click on it to open it.
<br />4.- The diagnosis gives two options to choose from. See what each one does and click on the one  you prefer:
<br />
<br />     Restart now and check if there are problems. It is best to select in most cases. Make sure to close all programs as I have asked before. The PC will reboot on its own when choosing this option. Right after, the check also starts automatically.
<br />Then check the Hard Disk.
<br />1. Open an elevated Command Prompt (Press the Windows + X button at the same time, then choose Command Prompt (Admin))
<br />2. Type the following command, and replace the X with the drive letter you wish to scan: “CHKDSK X:
<br />3. Hit the enter key, Command Prompt will now start CHKDSK.
<br />
<br />Let us know if these steps help you to resolve the issue.

            To evaluate the BSOD please post logs for troubleshooting.<br />
<br />
Using administrative command prompt copy and paste this whole command.<br />
<br />
Make sure the default language is English so that the logs can be scanned and read.<br />
<br />
https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3813-language-add-remove-change-windows-10-a.html<br />
<br />
The command will automatically collect the computer files and place them on the desktop.<br />
<br />
Then use 7zip to organize the files and one drive or drop box to place share links into the thread for troubleshooting.<br />
<br />
https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Share-OneDrive-files-and-folders-9fcc2f7d-de0c-4cec-93b0-a82024800c07<br />
<br />
This command will automatically collect these files:&nbsp; msinfo32, mini dumps, drivers, hosts, install, uninstall, services, startup, event viewer files, etc.<br />
<br />
Open administrative command prompt and copy and paste the whole command:<br />
<br />
copy %SystemRoot%\minidump\*.dmp "%USERPROFILE%\Desktop\"&amp;dxdiag /t %Temp%\dxdiag.txt&amp;copy %Temp%\dxdiag.txt "%USERPROFILE%\Desktop\SFdebugFiles\"&amp;type %SystemRoot%\System32\drivers\etc\hosts &gt;&gt; "%USERPROFILE%\Desktop\hosts.txt"&amp;systeminfo &gt; "%USERPROFILE%\Desktop\systeminfo.txt"&amp;driverquery

There are two files for you to find manually:<br />
<br />
a) C:\Windows\MEMORY.DMP<br />
<br />
Use file explorer &gt; this PC &gt; local C: drive &gt; right upper corner search enter the above to find results.<br />
<br />
b) dxdiag:&nbsp; <br />
<br />
In the left lower corner search type:&nbsp; dxdiag &gt; When the DirectX Diagnostic Tool opens click on the next page button so that each tab is opened &gt; click on save all information &gt; save to desktop &gt; post one drive or drop box share link into the thread<br />

<p>Hi Maritza</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the advice. This seems to have identified the issue: there is a problem in my C:Drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is, I don't understand what it means.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the CHKDSK command and the scan identified the following:</p>
<p>Index entry ACCESS~2 in index $130 of file 2191A is incorrect.</p>
<p>Index entry AdView.xbf in index $130 of file 21925 is incorrect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way this can be resolved?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate any advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

    <title>Surface Book 2 Autocad issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lekcaj  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Book 2 Autocad issues</h2>
                    <p>There is a very specific issue i am having with my surface book 2 that i could really use help on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is the new 15" 512gb model with the 1060 nVidia card.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed the following software on it twice now, as i have had to restore it to factory settings when things go wrong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>i install:</p>
<p>the adobe creative cloud suite (photoshop, indesign, illustrator, acrobat, bridge)</p>
<p>sketchup 2018</p>
<p>and other miscellaneous program&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>when this software is installed everything works fine. i can detach and go into tablet mode and the software/hardware work perfectly as intended. there are no crashes to the software i am using.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As soon as i install autocad architecture 2018 and revit 2018, things go bad. this has happened after both restores now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>photoshop won't open when i am using the device as a tablet (gets caught on loading the menus) and seems to not open at times when the screen is attached to the base. it also does not allow me to zoom in and rotate the canvas by using my hands. i can still
 draw with the microsoft pencil on the screen but it seems to limit what can be done via touch.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>sketchup crashes unless i disable the intel graphics card under 'device manager' and just use the nVidia card. this would mean that i can only use it attached to the base.&nbsp; if both cards are enabled it seems to get confused as to what card to use and just
 shuts down.&nbsp;</p>
<p>again before autocad and revit were installed this behavior did not occur. i could open sketch and all of the adobe cc programs in either tablet mode or in laptop mode, and i could zoom in and out by pinching my fingers on the screen in all the programs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>my assumption is that as soon as autocad and revit are installed on the machine somethign happens to the graphic card drivers and the computer can no longer decide how to manage the graphics cards properly, so it either shuts down certain functions or it
 just crashes the system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>now i know how to use software fluently to get my kind of work done, but have never really gotten into the nuances of the inner workings of operating systems or hardware issues with graphics cards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>with the described above, does there seem to be a logical explanation or assumption someone can help me with that can help me solve this. i am an architect and need all of the software mentioned above.&nbsp;</p>
<p>i don't think it's an issue of returning the machine for a new one, as it works until i install autocad and revit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>if i can't get this to work i need to return the machine as it's quite expensive and needs to be able to run this type of software for me. any help or insight will be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You need to determine what is causing the problem, if it is really because of Autocad or other apps. We suggest you to perform a clean boot to isolate software conflicts. Please refer to this

<p>
i am on my 3rd clean install(restore) and it seems to be revit and autocad architecture.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
i'm not an IT person so i am going on a guess here. would it be possible for autocad or revit to change something with the machines drivers to cause these issues or could this be a hardware situation?</p>
<p>
i am begining to rule out the hardware issue, since on the clean restores things seem to work as they are intended to.</p>

    <title>Dell Dock does not run automatically at startup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tangalang  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dell Dock does not run automatically at startup</h2>
                    I previously set my dell dock to run automatically at start up. Now every time I turn on my computer, it shows me a message saying, "The Dell Dock has encountered a problem and needs to close. We are sorry for the inconvenience."<br />
<br />
There is an option to&nbsp; "Restart the Dell Dock" but the same message pops up again.<br />
<br />
When I do try to click the "Send Error Report" button, the response I get is always, "There was an error while submitting the error report. Please try again."<br />
<br />
Is there any way I can turn off the automatic start up so I don't encounter this problem again? Or do I have to uninstall the Dell Dock altogether? This has been happening for the past month, and it's getting quite annoying.

            I found out that if you reinstall the dell dock without actually uninstalling the old edition it actually fixes the problem and keeps your dock contents. only the personalized settings (e.g. color, effects, location) are lost :) Finally something that
 fixes easy.<br />

            Uninstalling the Dell Dock would perhaps be the best course of action. &nbsp;Type 'programs' into your Start menu and choose the
<em>Programs and Features</em>&nbsp;search result. &nbsp;Then find Dell Dock in the list and remove it.
<div><br />
<div>You can go to http://delldock.com to reinstall it if you choose (although I personally don't see why anyone wants double the number of toolbars on the screen).</div>

<p>The error code that you're getting likely occurs if a hardware or software is preventing your device from upgrading. As discussed on the link provided above, here are the factors that you need to consider when upgrading:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Restart your computer</li><li>Disable your antivirus software</li><li>Disable USB devices (e.g: smart card reader)</li><li>Disconnect external devices attached to the computer, except keyboard and mouse</li><li>Perform a <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">clean boot</a></strong> and try again</li><li>Switch to a local account if you're connected to a domain</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, you can also upgrade to Windows 10 using a bootable media. In line with this<span><span>,

    <title>Multitouch feature stops working - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Multitouch feature stops working</h2>
                    I have an ASUS Zenbook UX31A with preinstalled Windows 8.<br />
The mousepad multitouch function stops working after the computer comes back from a stand-by (sleep) mode.
<br />
The "regular" mouse feature stays functional. <br />
I have to restart the computer every time in order to make the multitouch work again.

            <p>&nbsp;Hi Daniel,</p>
<div>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>From your issue description I understand that mousepad multitouch function stopped working after the computer comes back from sleep mode.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Let’s start with a question.<br />
Have you made any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
Now let’s try some steps for resolving this issue like power troubleshooter and update mouse pad multitouch drivers.</div>
<div><br />
Which I have described in the following methods.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
Let’s run the power troubleshooter and check if that helps. <br />
a) Press ‘Windows + W’ key on the keyboard.<br />
b) In the search box, type ‘Troubleshooting’, and press enter.<br />
c) Click on ‘System and Security’ and click on Power. Click on Next to run the troubleshooter.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:&nbsp; </strong><font color="#000000"><font color="#333333">I suggest you change the setting in the device manager.</font></font></div>
<p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">Try the following steps and check.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">a. Open Device Manager by pressing Windows Key + X key and clicking Control Panel, click System and Security, and then, under System, click Device Manager.<br />
If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
b. In the list of hardware categories, find the device that you want to wake your computer, and then double-click the device name.<br />
c. Click the Power Management tab and then uncheck “Allow this device to wake the computer”.<br />
d. Click OK.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>Method 3:<br />
</strong>I would suggest you to update all the drivers installed on the computer.<br />
Follow the steps:<br />
a) Press Windows and x key and select Device Manager.<br />
b) Locate the mouse-pad drivers and right click on driver icon.<br />
c) Click on Update driver software.<br />
d) Click on Search automatically for the updated driver software.<br />
e) Follow the onscreen instructions to update the driver. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 4:</strong> Change the “Power plans” settings.<br />
A power plan is a collection of hardware and system settings (like display, sleep, etc.) that manages how your PC uses power. The power plans you can use depend on the kind of PC you have.<br />
Click on the below given link to know “How to create and delete a power plan”.<br />

            Hi Patricia,
<br />
<br />Right click your Taskbar and make sure 'Lock the Taskbar' is not ticked, if it is untick it
<br />
<br />Drag the top of the Taskbar down as far as it goes
<br />
<br />If you still need the Taskbar smaller, right click the Taskbar and choose 'Taskbar Settings
<br />
<br />On the Settings Page, turn on 'Use Small Taskbar Buttons'
<br />
<br />Close the Settings App
<br />
<br />When finished, right click the Taskbar and choose 'Lock the Taskbar'
<br />
<br />That's about it !

<p><strong>Recently, and I have no idea why, the task 'explorer.exe' becomes "not responding" at random times when I am using my Dell Inspiron 1750 running a 64-bit version of Windows 7 Home Premium. I have not been able to produce this problem consistently,
 but it does happen quite often. I am unable to see my taskbar, start menu, or desktop. I have to manually end the process through task manager and then run it again for explorer to work again and everything be okay. Then eventually it happens again. Please
 help me. Thanks.</strong></p>

TaskBar - Task Manager - take a look at Appplications - Processes - Services - this is a quick<br />

<br />
===========================================<br />
<br />
<strong>Consider this an absolute must - manually updating your drivers.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above<br />
is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html</span></a><br />
<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

<h2>            Skype for Business on-prem - Exchange Online Webmail integration</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>we're running a Skype for Business On-Premise environment. We now have some Exchange Online (Plan 2) mailboxes and want to have the integration to our Skype for Business on-premise so they can use chat and S4B planning within Webmail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype for Business is working fine and passing all tests from the "Remote Connectivity Analyzer".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was following the support article to set up the integration: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2614614/how-to-integrate-exchange-online-with-skype-for-business-online,-lync-server-2013,-or-a-lync-server-2013-hybrid-deployment</p>
<p>
</p><p>On-Prem and Exchange Online is connected via Azure AD Connect, so all user accounts are synchronized and authentication is happening via ADFS. No MFA is in place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I'm logging in to webmail of Exchange Online, I cannot login to S4B. I can click "Login to IM" but nothing happens. No traffic is arriving on my firewall to S4B, so it looks like Exchange Online is not trying at all to reach my on-prem Skype
 for Business environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas? Is there someting at the Exchange Online environment I need to enable?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!<br />
Norbert</p>

            Hi Norbert,<br />
<br />
As far as I know, we need to configure integration between on-premises Skype for Business Server and Outlook Web App in order to use instant messaging (IM) with the Outlook Web App interface. For the detailed steps, please refer to this article:<br />
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh533880.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh533880.aspx</a><br />
<br />
If the issue persists, I’d like to collect the following information for further troubleshooting:<br />
1. About your On-premises Skype for Business server, is it Skype for Business server 2015 or Lync server 2013?<br />
2. Regarding ‘Skype for Business is working fine and passing all tests from the "Remote Connectivity Analyzer"’, I’d like to collect the RCA test results via the private message below for further check.<br />
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessages/list">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessages/list</a><br />
3. Besides the ‘Login to IM’ feature in OWA, are other integration features like mentioned in the table in this article working fine?<br />
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj945633.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj945633.aspx</a><br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<p>Dear Sam,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you very much for your reply. I can also confirm I had set up the CsHostingProvider as described in the Technet article above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I came back to my test machine today, it was just working! I was just waiting for about a day, so maybe there were some caches which have been cleared during that time at the Exchange Online environment?</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I'm happy it's working now. Looks like the article contains everything, just add some patience too :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Norbert</p>

    <title>Third-party software installers hang under Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> reverend entity  say:</h3>
<h2>            Third-party software installers hang under Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have a Lenovo laptop which had Windows 8.1 installed and I have upgraded it to Windows 10.&nbsp; Ever since I did so, I have had problems with certain software installers - particularly firewalls/spyware scanners and Native Instruments software.&nbsp; When I try
 to run the installers, <em>if</em> I don't immediately get an incompatible installer message (usually just the firewalls), the InstallAware Wizard starts running and just hangs.&nbsp; No progress at all (I have left some of them running for hours with no results),
 and I finally have to kill the process with Task Manager.&nbsp; I got a firewall installer (Comodo) to run by renaming the installer, but I had to try it more than once to get it to finish, and when it did, it would not run properly after rebooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>TL;DR - upgraded from 8.1 to 10, now certain third-party installers hang when running.</p>

            As it turns out, the solution to my problem was somehow related to my firewall, or lack thereof.&nbsp; I was able to successfully install a more recent update of the firewall software, and this success led to the subsequent success installing the other software
 I was having problems with.

<h3> rodriric  say:</h3>
<h2>            My PIN doesn&#39;t work out of nowhere and cant set a new one</h2>
                    <p>My laptop is pretty new and it has worked fine until today. I tried to sign in using my fingerprint on Windows hello and it gave me an error and asked to restart to see if it helped but it didn't. I tried the PIN and it doesn't&nbsp;work, thankfully the&nbsp;password
 does work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I tried to add a pin in the sign in options and it asks me to put in my password which I did. But then it asks me to type my PIN which in theory doesnt&nbsp;exist because I am "adding" a PIN. So I put my old PIN and as soon as I type the last number the little
 window disappears&nbsp;and nothing happens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried updating and even restored the system but nothing has changed. I have been reading the other posts but none of the other answers have helped me. Please help.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using Windows Hello and adding a PIN are more secured than setting up a complex password since there is still a chance that someone can guess your password, but never your face, which is what Windows Hello is all about. It is a more personal way of logging
 in to your account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description, since you are using your old PIN, can you try to use a new one instead and check if the issue is the same? Also, is there any error message that we miss out while you were trying to sign in.</p>

<p>Well, you more than likely won't be able to play the games for Kinect. Unless you have a big room that gives you a lot of space to move forward, backward, and both sides. I have a desk setup similar to you and I just use my Kinect for Netflix. My room's
 not big enough for me to move side to side. However, &nbsp;you can always move your Xbox and Kinect around.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 does not create restore points - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> roncavin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 does not create restore points</h2>
                    <p>I often try new software and apps and I rely on System Restore to roll back after these trials, but Windows 10 seems to not only delete my restore points I make, but now the System Restore dialog is unresponsive and does not allow me to make any restore
 points, nor does Windows create any as it's supposed to.</p>
<p>I have tried third party software to create a restore point, but the next day the new point has disappeared.</p>
<p>Why does Windows 10 delete restore points, why does it fail to create new ones, and why does it remove restore points I make with third-party software?</p>
<p>Windows 10 is not that gosh-darned infallible, I want my restore points, an option that has existed as long as I have been using Windows computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Doesn't seem relevant, but: Windows 10 Pro, version 1803, Intel Quad core 2.66GHz CPU, OS on SSD, along with a few programs that must run from C drive; most other programs, apps and storage on secondary HDD</p>

            Hi Ron
<br />
<br />Since the Windows 10 model was introduced where Windows is now a 'service' rather than an operating system - according to Microsoft. the System Restore functionality is basically defunct.
<br />
<br />Most large Windows Updates will delete any previous restore points, because so many changes have been made to the operating system, to ensure system stability, those are removed to stop the possibility of old and new system files being mixed and causing a conflict . . .
<br />
<br />With regards to not being able to crate a restore point, what error(s) are you getting when you try to create a restore point?

<p>No error messages, the Restore dialog panel is unresponsive, I can neither create nor modify any restore points and the dialog shows no restore points exist.
</p>
<p>I did just now try something I found in another forum: to turn off the Restore function (at least that option works), reboot and turn it back on. This seemed to work as I've created a restore point and also the restore dialog pane also now shows a previously-created
 one.</p>
<p>So far so good, but I have yet to put this to the test by trying to access those restore points later.</p>

            System restore has always been a little unreliable imo. If you like to try out software regularly &amp; then roll back Windows have you considered imaging software?

<p>System Restore can't do that and it was not designed to do that.</p>

<p>1. When do you get these error messages?</p>

<p>Please try the following methods and check if it helps:</p>

            <p><span>Hi David,</span></p>
<p><span>1. When do you get these error messages? Everything seems to backup, then the Xp system image is created disk XpWDC80G(C:) ,&nbsp; then the system7 system image is created disk W7WDC500G(F: ) and then
 the error occurs. </span></p>
<p><span>2. Are you using any non-Microsoft application to backup? NO
<br />
I’m using Microsoft Security Essentials, does it need to be disabled?<br />
&nbsp; ? also Windows Defender is available which one should be used? </span></p>

            <p>Hi Sharath Srinvasa,</p>
<p>Should I disable Microsoft Secutiy Essentials?</p>
<p>I perform a clean boot and ran the backup and had the same results.</p>

            <p>Hi David,</p>
<p>Perform the following methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>Follow the steps as mentioned below:</p>
<p>1. First check for&nbsp;un-resolvable SIDs in the 'Administrators' group on the SCVMM source machine. If any exist, delete them.</p>
<p>2. Open
<b>regedit</b> (Registry Editor) and locate <b>'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList</b>' key.</p>
<p>3. Under the
<b>ProfileList </b>subkey, delete&nbsp;any subkey that is named <b>SID.bak</b>.
</p>
<p><b><i>Note:</i></b><i> SID is a placeholder for the security identifier (SID) of the user account that is experiencing the problem. The SID.bak subkey should contain
 a ProfileImagePath registry entry that points to the original profile folder of the user account that is experiencing the problem.</i></p>
<p><b>Important:
</b>This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up
 the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

            <p>have you ever been able to run a&nbsp; back up succesfully?&nbsp; If it has worked for you then you could try a system restore.&nbsp;

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I like Windows but the backup utility in Windows 7 has its flaws.&nbsp; Just a little corky, i guess.&nbsp; But you should just backup your data to your external drive by drag and drop folders.&nbsp; There are also third party backup utilities out there that are a little
 more reliable.</p>

            <p>You are going to need to back up your data on your external drive and wipe it clean. Then use the software from WD to format the drive.&nbsp; Can you complete a backup to dvd's without any issues?&nbsp;I would try to complete a backup to a different external drive

Unfortunately, the my DVD hardware will not record.<span>&nbsp; </span>The system software and other DVD tools say the DVD is functioning ok, but I don’t think it can detect all hardware failures.
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>No flash drives big enough to backup half a TB.</p>

                    I have an Alienware 17 R3 that cannot download from since Windows 10 1703. I have tried restoring computer to factory reset wiping my hard drive (fails). I have tried multiple times to run windows from a downloaded copy on a flashdrive from the windows
 media creation tool (fails). The computer came with Windows 10 and made its first few downloads and early on stopped downloading following releases and I have been bound by this awful situation since where my computer auto reboots an update at least once a
 week. It cannot successfully update and I have come to my wits end.&nbsp;

            Hi Will.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />Make sure all other drives and peripherals are unplugged.  Update the BIOS or UEFI firmware to latest, or reset to Defaults, making sure SATA controller is set to AHCI. 
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  If you're using another PC to do this then uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on first screen press Shift + F10 to open a Command Prompt, type the following commands followed by Enter key:
<br />DISKPART
<br />LIST DISK
<br />SEL DIS # (replace # with the disk # of the Windows disk from list in previous command)
<br />CLEAN
<br />EXIT
<br />
<br />Close Command Box, on second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen choose Unallocated Space, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />

    <title>I use my computer everyday alot. I hear CLICKING noises that are not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> learningcis  say:</h3>
<h2>            I use my computer everyday alot. I hear CLICKING noises that are not caused by me&#33;  Who, and where are the clicking noises coming from&#63;  Is there a ROOTKIT, someone in a romote location, accessing my internet service&#63;  </h2>
                    
<p>Is there a <strong>Rootkit</strong>, or someone in a romote location, accessing my internet service?&nbsp; I use my computer for many hours every day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This past year I went through a CRASH of my system in September due to my memory stick in my digital camera INFECTING my computer.&nbsp; I bought a new computer that's how bad it was.&nbsp; I am also a DUMMY about CIS although I am slowly learning.&nbsp; Since, I have
 downloaded QUANTITIES of VIRUS protection.&nbsp; Of course, I didn't know it was my memory stick from my digital camera that infected my computer, I only figured that out about a month ago.&nbsp; Therefore, you guessed it, even my brand new computer became infected
 soon enough.&nbsp; I recently did a RESTORE on it, which erased everything.</p>
<p><strong>My point is</strong>,&nbsp; I have had about 4 people from remote places access my computer to try to fix various problems with it on various occasions within the last year.&nbsp; These people were located in various places:&nbsp;&nbsp; Argentina, India, Phillippians.&nbsp;
 I found it interesting.&nbsp; Each time they took control of my computer from their remote location.&nbsp; When the session was over, they ended their access.</p>
<p><strong>Why do I hear clicking while I use my computer</strong>?&nbsp; Since I have written this, I have heard it about five times.&nbsp; What is it?&nbsp; Why does it give me the feeling someone is using my internet.&nbsp; Talk about paranoia,&nbsp; it makes me think they can get
 into my email, when I look at my bank account etc.&nbsp; Is there a possibility that this is actually happening or not?</p>
<p>My son does have a lap-top that he uses alot with the internet service that I use.&nbsp; His lap top uses the WI-FI.&nbsp; He uses the X-Box live wi-fi.&nbsp; These things are going on simultaneously while I use my internet connection.&nbsp; Would this be causing the clicking?&nbsp;
 I would like to know if there is a violation of privacy occuring and/or&nbsp; and "OUT OF BOUNDS" type of issue, where someone from a remote location is using my Comcast internet service and maybe even can see confidential stuff on my personal login.</p>
<p>Thank you, WG</p>

<p>I've used my mouse as you requested and it makes no noise whatsoever (it's a wireless laser mouse) - well it makes a clicking noise when I click with the right or left mouse button on some icon as it should but nothing at all unusual - is it the clicking
 sound made by the mouse when you click on an icon or hyperlink that you're talking about?&nbsp; And you say it isn't coming from the mouse but from somewhere inside the computer?</p>
<p>Anyone smart enough to get access to your system to be able to do the things you fear might be happening is smart enough to make sure the computer doesn't make a noise when it occurs to give away the fact that it is happening.&nbsp; Furthermore, the access would
 be through the network connection so let's do a test.&nbsp; Remove the connection from the system (I mean unplug the cable or the ethernet hookup or remove the wireless card or go into network connections and sharing and disable every single network you find there
 (don'tdelete them - just disable them) or better still, just remove the connection from the moden supplied by the ISP so there is NO WAY a connection could get through.&nbsp; Then see if the clicking continues.&nbsp; If it does, it doesn't have antyhing to do with your
 internet connection or some hacker getting&nbsp; into your accounts. If it does go away, it may be that&nbsp;some &nbsp;network device is&nbsp;causing the problem (or that you are being connected to a web site that generates the clicking noise but I seriously doubt it's a sign
 anyone has gained that kind of access to your system (though it could be malware as I previously mentioned).</p>
<p>I honestly don't have any idea what inside the computer could cause that noise that often and that consistently. It doesn't sound like a software problem to me.&nbsp; I still think you should try the suggestions I made in my earlier post (especially searching
 for malware and doing a clean boot).</p>
<p>If it has you this concerned and you've tried everything else that was recommended, I would take it into a reputable computer repair shop and have them check it out. If it occurs when they use the computer, they should be able to find the source even if
 they have to take the whole thing apart to do so.</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

</p><p>I've tried uninstalling the device, updating drivers for it, but no luck.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see the disk in Disk Management, but the drive is too small to initialize as GPT, and when I try to initialize it as MBR, it says that the device is not ready.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice?</p>

<p>Hi Themiho,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
</span><span>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to know that the Windows 10 fails to recognize the external drive. I will certainly help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Does the issue occur in a different USB port?</strong></p>
</span><span>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might occur if the drivers are corrupted or incompatible or due to hardware problems.</p>
<p>I suggest you to follow the troubleshooting methods listed below and check if it resolves the issue.</p>
</span><span>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Run the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 has a built-in troubleshooter to check and fix issues with devices and hardware. Here's how:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Open <strong>Control Panel </strong>by right click on <strong>
Start</strong> Button.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> In the search box, type <strong>troubleshooter</strong>, and then click
<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Click on the <strong>view all </strong>option on the left panel.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Run the <strong>Hardware and Devices </strong>troubleshooter.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Assign drive letter for the external drive</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to check whether drive letter has been assigned to external hard drive under Disk Management. Follow below steps:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Right click on <strong>Start </strong>and select<strong> Disk Management</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Right-click the external partition and then click <strong>
Change Drive Letter and Paths</strong>.<br />
<strong>3. </strong>Assign a drive letter, click <strong>Add</strong>, click the drive letter you want to use, and then click
<strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>4. </strong>Check if you are able to access the external drive now.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Be careful when making drive-letter assignments because many MS-DOS and Windows programs make references to a specific drive letter. For example, the path environment variable shows specific drive letters in conjunction with program
 names.</p>
<p><br />
Hope this helps. If the issue remains unresolved, please get back to us and we would be happy to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Has anyone gotten a viable answer to this question?&nbsp; I am having the same problem with a 2Tb Seagate Expansion Drive.&nbsp; It says "Device not migrated".&nbsp;<br />
<br />
When I try to run the troubleshooter, IT JUST SITS THERE LOOKING LIKE IT'S RUNNING, BUT NEVER PRODUCES ANY RESULTS.<br />
<br />
I've fiddled with the drive letter, but like others have said, it won't accept a new name nor drive letter for the drive, because it doesn't see the disk... but it does... but it doesn't.<br />
<br />
Isn't anyone from Microsoft out there who can help?&nbsp; This is UNACCEPTABLE.<br />
<br />
I am unable to get ANY external drives working... thumb drives, SD Cards, etc.&nbsp; But my mouse and keyboard work just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We need a REAL answer here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of these items work on my laptops which are MacBooks installed with Windows 10 on them... Oddly, the Mac drivers under bootcamp work a whole lot better than whatever crap Microsoft has written. Come on guys! Help us out here!</p>

<p>Okay.&nbsp; I THINK I can help.<br />
<br />
First I had/have the same problem with a band new 4t HDD and a dual docking station.&nbsp; It would read my other hard drives, but not this new one., doing exactly as you said and saying in the device manager it was "due to partial or ambiguous..." It was driving
 me NUTS.&nbsp; After reading your comment I realized MS is worthless and don't know how to help.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The real problem I think is it's not reading the volume. So go to:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; Win + X<br />
2.&nbsp; Computer Management<br />
3.&nbsp; Left Side, go to Disk Management<br />
(An explanation:&nbsp; When I played around with Disk Management originally it didn't show all the disks to the right of the tab.&nbsp; I'm sure it's my error, but this is how I found it.)<br />
4.&nbsp; You might see an un-named disk or Disk 3, 4, etc.&nbsp; Hit that disk and it will start the process of re-naming the volume, and a simple format.<br />
<br />
Eazy-Peazy, Mac &amp; Cheezy!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bottom line, re-name your drive volume.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At least this worked for me.</p>

<p>Thanks for trying to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already messed with disk volumes, mapped drive letters, etc. etc. etc.&nbsp; I've tried every single suggested fix I could find, and I am an IT Professional, so I know my way around a computer pretty well. None of them worked, and the only thing left to
 try is a complete reinstall of the OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a Microsoft Windows 10 problem specific to an upgrade install on a Lenovo desktop. Of that, I am sure. All the hardware is fine. The network is fine, and the external disks work perfectly on my other 3 computers, one HP with Win10, One Macbook running
 Win10 in bootcamp (drivers always more reliable when written by Apple, even for Microsoft products) and one Macbook running Win7 in bootcamp.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen the issue reported multiple times over specifically for Win10 Upgrades, and for Lenovo computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still using the computer, but have to remote in, if I want to transfer files to elsewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I purchased a refurbished HP and got that up and running, in the process of transferring all my files to that computer, so I can blow the whole of the Lenovo profile away and start clean.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Microsoft had any decency or respect, they would honor a clean install of Windows 10, in place of this upgrade install.&nbsp; It is unclear if I will be able to get authorization to reinstall Windows 10 on this computer, but I will try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Far as I'm concerned, Microsoft is 100% responsible for the problems with this computer. They've never played nice with IBM, and I have had massive and repeated driver issues (early on, updates of Win 10 used to take out the Wifi card, to the point that
 I had to use a third party tool to correct the driver, it was a big pain), and never worked quite right.&nbsp; The computer itself is fine. It's the crappy software that's a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft should be ashamed of itself.</p>

<p>Any solutions yet? I inherited a drive that already has important data (it's the archive drive for the design files for a magazine), so I can't just return or replace it. In case it matters, it's a Toshiba v63600-C. My Windows 10 is not an upgrade - it was
 the original OS on my PC, bought in 2016. I tried both a USB3.0 port and USB2.0 port. My symptoms match DecoJuanMarcos' screenshots except for differences in device names - in fact, before I found this thread I had marked up a screenshot almost exactly the
 same way he did!</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/026a233e-62df-4db2-9255-d978135ec0ac?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/026a233e-62df-4db2-9255-d978135ec0ac?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes instead of the semi-success/semi-failure, I get an actual error: "USB device not recognized: The last USB device you connected to this computer malfunctioned, and Windows does not recognize it." But when I disconnect and reconnect, I get the above
 results again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried MaxHunter71's suggestion, and although I do see the drive listed as Disk 1 and it claims to be "healthy", clicking on it does nothing, and right-clicking brings up a context menu with almost everything grayed out - the only available items on it
 are "Delete Volume" and "Help":</p>

<h2>            No audio sound after connecting TV to Computer.</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">For several years, I've been able to connect my PC to my TV using an HDMI cable and sharing the display. Sometimes I would have to select the default audio device, and sometimes Windows would seemingly detect
 it automatically. I have a Dell PC running Windows 7 Home Premium, 64 bit edition, and an LG HDTV.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">I moved and had to disconnect/reconnect everything. The connections are the same as previously - I have one HDMI port on the back of the PC, with a cable running to a switch. The switch has 3 inputs, one being
 used for the PC connection, one for a Roku, and the other one free. The switch is then connected via HDMI to the TV. Same HDMI input as before.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">I get video, but I can't get audio. In the Sound properties, I have two audio playback devices: Speakers and headphones. Both using Conexant HD audio. I've right-clicked and selected to show disconnected/disabled
 devices, but there are none. I've checked in Device Manager, and there are no hardware conflicts listed for the audio devices. I don't see HDMI listed anywhere in Device Manager, just the Conexant card under Sound and Audio Devices and HD Audio Controller
 under System Devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">I've scanned for new hardware, run an Intel driver update, restarted, unplugged the TV for 10 minutes and plugged back in, tried the HDMI connection directly to another input on the TV, played with making the
 TV the primary display. Nothing works. I'm thinking it must be something simple, as it was working beautifully up until I moved.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">If anyone can help, I would greatly appreciate it.</p>

<p>Thank you for your reply. My computer is a Dell Inspiron 620 desktop. My TV is an LG 47L W5300.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the Sound properties, I have two items listed under playback:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Speakers - Conexant HD Audio, Default Device</p>
<p>2. Headphones - Conexant HD Audio - Ready</p>
<p>
</p><p>Show disconnected and Show disabled devices are both checked, but nothing else appears.</p>
<p>There is nothing about HDMI output.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Device Manager, I have the following under Sound, Video and Game Controllers: Conexant HD Audio and Intel Display Audio. Both up to date and working properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I visited the Dell website and downloaded the latest Conexant audio drivers and Intel video drivers. There were drivers for other graphics cards in the recommended downloads (Creative Labs SoundBlaster X-FiExtreme, nVidia GTForce GT530, NVidia M207, AMD
 Caicos Radeon 6450, AMD Turks XT Radeon HD 6670), none of which were found on my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have followed the advice in Gokul's post, but it didn't work. Any additional advice would be appreciated.</p>

<p>This did not work either. I didn't have anything in Device Manager called High Definition Audio Device; I had High Definition Audio Controller. I uninstalled and reinstalled this, but it made no difference. I have also bypassed the switch and connected the
 HDMI cable directly to the TV. This also did not work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible this is a problem with the HDMI connection inside the computer box? I mean a physical problem. The video is displaying flawlessly on the TV; it's just the audio that isn't working.</p>

<h2>            PC hangs and freezes after Windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>Ok, so I upgraded from 8.1 Pro to windows 10 pro. Windows 10 is very unstable on my pc. It hangs and freezes and is generally unresponsive. Will not keep my imported favorites from IE. I uninstalled some drivers left over when I changed motherboards with
 the same result. I tried three times to install the upgrade with no luck on smooth operation. I did upgrade my laptop without a hitch. Works great. The laptop was Windows 7 64 bit. My pc is 32 bit. I like what I see on my laptop but would really appreciate
 some kind of fix or suggestions to make it work.</p>

<h2>            Skype Lite - Writting in landscape mode</h2>
                    <p>Hello there,</p>
<p>I used to use Skype and Skype Preview on my Android device. It was pretty laggy at certain times, thus I decided to give Skype Lite a go. I really like it, but there's one issue that bothers me. In Skype and Skype Preview, I could have the chat windows in
 landscape. But in Skype Lite, the app only stays in the landscape mode as long as I don't open a conversation. As soon as I do so, the app just switches to portrait mode, which is really annoying, since I use the physical QWERTY keyboard to type.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is, is there any way to use Skype Lite in the landscape mode?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hello Dave. I typed regedit, ran as administrator and saw that the Address Bar is checked. (Is that what you mean by 'turned on'?) Pasted as you said and here's a screen print (with my personal info blacked out. I hope!) Hoping this helps.</p>

            Hi Taffy, thanks for that, everything looks normal . . .
<br />
<br />Can you please open Windows File Explorer, in the left pane click Quick Access and then provide a screenshot of the resulting window . . .

            clicking on Quick Access bring up in the main body Frequent Folders (7) and Recent Files (14) and then&nbsp; long lists of the items. Is that what you want Dave? If it&nbsp; is, I'll have to black out a lot of the items!

            Hi Taffy, I understand, no need to post your personal data, I want to see if that Screenshots folder is in Quick Access in the right hand pane, that is all  . .

            Hi Taffy, thank you for that . . .
<br />
<br />If you right click Screenshots as indicated below, do you get, 'Unpin from Quick Access'?

<p>just let me have a look in a minute Dave. I now have a weird problem - my slideshow is now showing My screen print below - and it's no longer a slideshow so I'll have to go to settings and change it later. And what's even weirder was that I couldn't save
 it in the normal places as it wouldn't accept my file name. I had to save it in Music then move it!</p>

<p>I'll check your advice in a moment Dave because I've now a weird problem - my rolling slide show is now static and what I'm seeing at the moment is my screen print above. What's weirder is that it wouldn't let me save in as I normally do eg "screenprint
 5 for Dave 2019-01 10th". I couldn't take a screenprint - I had to use the snipping tool. Here's what I have:</p>
