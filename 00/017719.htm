<h2>            GigJam seriously not on Windows Phone&#63;</h2>
                    Yeah I'm just sitting here baffled that GigJam is STILL not a app on Windows Phone. Windows Phone...ya know.....the OS that Microsoft made. That one. The one that's seemingly overlooked by their development team. If Apple ever made an app that didn't go
 into iOS people would freak out. So here I am freaking out. I sit here and try to convince people to get Windows Phones if they ask and am I supposed to tell them when this kind of thing happens? I mean it's pathetic. I'd like to use this MICROSOFT APP with
 friends on iphones and I can't? I honestly don't understand the thinking here, can anyone explain this to me?

    <title>Office Word keeps crashing when I scroll. Help please&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michellemx5  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office Word keeps crashing when I scroll. Help please&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I am using the subscription version of Office&nbsp; 365 for Mac but have problems with Word crashing once I scroll past a few pages or try to work in teh document. This started when I started to include tables in the document and as the document became larger
 and with more formatting this has become worse to teh poit where I cant work with the file anymore.
</p>
<p>I have tried reinstalling Office, running disc repiar permissions on Mac but no difference. I have also tried creatig a new word doc and copying the material renaming it etc.</p>
<p>However when I open the file on a Windows PC this problem doesnt happen. Im trying to figure out if the problem is with Microsoft Word for Mac (incompatibility or something) or whether the issue is with the Word program itself&gt; alternatively could it be
 a RAM issue with my Mac Air being unable to cope with the amount of formatting and size of file 8MB. Even when I split the document I have the same problem and splitting it or removing teh tables into a separate document is not an option as I need to use headings
 that are numbered sequential etc. </p>
<p>Ive checked many of teh forums but still cant get to the bottom of the problem and Office support wasted 4 hrs leaving me with no resolution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Imgoing to change my laptop and dont know if I should change to a from Mac to Windows or buy a standalone Office application or would I still have the same issue. Pulling my hair out at this stage so appreciate any help.

<p>My code to create an OLAP cube was working with Excel 2010 32 bit on Win7 but not on Excel 2010 64 bit on the same maching.&nbsp; Our IT guy installed 32 instead of 64 so I reinstalled it. However, once I did that, my program gives this error.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Run-time error '3706'</p>
<p>Provider cannot be found. It may not be properly installed.</p>
<p>It is probably referring to this line.&nbsp; Any ideas? Thx</p>

    <title>Persistent Desktop Icon and Window Size&#47;Position Problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jwadle  say:</h3>
<h2>            Persistent Desktop Icon and Window Size&#47;Position Problems</h2>
                    <p>Currently running preview build 14986 and having two persistent problems that go back many releases (3-4 months):</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Desktop icons are re-positioned periodically as if the screen resolution had been changed. &nbsp;I am set at 2560x1440, but the icon repositioning looks like it thinks I am set to 1024x768, i.e. the icons are moved to the upper left of the screen corresponding
 to this lower resolution. &nbsp;The resolution of my on-board display adapter (Intel HD Graphics 530 with driver version 21.20.16.4552) does not show a change.<br />
<br />
In response to this issue, I have seen only two "solutions" on the forums: update the video driver or use an app to save and reposition Desktop icons.<br />
<br />
</li><li>App window size and position are not remembered and no default window size is enforced. &nbsp;Apps like Edge, Word, and Chrome open with very small windows in the upper left corner of the screen. &nbsp;Resizing and repositioning the window is not remembered the next
 time the app is launched.</li></ol>
<p>These are bugs in Windows 10 Preview that I have not seen addressed as such. &nbsp;Can anyone confirm that they are seeing these issues or offer a suggestion on a fix?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Agree with JoeNamco, it may stem from corrupt files but clean install of build 14986 may not fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently using clean install from build 14986 ISO. For this build I noticed some but not all Windows Store apps are not remembering size. (mssports, maps, xbox, feedback hub, mail, calendar, buildfeed including Windows Store). Third party apps like
 like chrome, itunes, vlc, speccy, arcobat reader and kindle are remembering window size. And occasionally some apps open as small window on left size of my screen. I am using latest Intel HD video adapter driver for my laptop.</p>

<p>Hover over View, make sure there is no check in front of Auto arrange icons.</p>
<p>Also pick size above that.</p>

            There are no Linux drivers for the Nokia USB cable. You may be able to use it as a modem using Bluetooth or infrared (IrDA), though.

But N90 connected with USB works with Linux<br />
<br />
Now, I could use N90 mobile configured as modem in my Fedora Linux PC using USB cable. I could successfully query the modem

<h2>            How do I get rid of the Mobile Email icon at the top&#63;</h2>
                    I just bought a new Samsung Omnia and after the first time I tried to open Mobile Email, it put an icon at the very top (see link for screenshot) and I'd like to get rid of it.&nbsp; At the bottom left now it always says "Notification" instead of "Phone", which
 is what I want.&nbsp; I wasn't even able to set up the Mobile Email for Windows Live Hotmail.&nbsp; After I put my username &amp; password in &amp; click Ok, it says "This action requires network coverage", even though I'm able to use a web browser.&nbsp; I even tried turning on
 the wifi.&nbsp; When I close Mobile Email, it dosen't show up in the Task Manager.<br />

            Could you click on the bottom left on the "Notification" and point out what happens..<br />
Normally you would be able to dismiss the notification or something like that.<br />
<br />
You could also try to click on the e-mail icon. and see what happens..<br />
<br />
If nothing happens a reboot of you phone could solve your problem.

    <title>Blocking spam messages in Outlook 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> twinkles21  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blocking spam messages in Outlook 2010</h2>
                    <p>Should be fairly straight forward. Right click, Junk&gt;Block sender.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These spam messages have 2 emails smooshed together in the sender line. For example: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***@mtc.cl&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. It won't let me block because it says it's not a valid email format.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. The secondary trash email on the end of it changes with every spam</p>
<p>3. I actually need to be able to receive messages from *** Email address is removed for privacy *** (obviously fake, just for the purposes of this post)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to do this with rules? Outlook wildcards maybe? Any help would be appreciated!</p>

<h2>            Questions regarding storage of Microsoft Forms</h2>
                    <p>I have a user that is planning to start using Microsoft Forms. However, he plans to create some forms and use them along the year. Then at the end of the year he would like to be able to access all&nbsp;the forms created in order to create some data charts.</p>
<p>So, we got two questions:</p>
<p>1. we&nbsp;need to know how to access the "<strong>old</strong>" files created in Microsoft Forms. Is there any specific location in SharePoint?</p>
<p>2. Consequently we need to also know<strong> how big is the storage space of it</strong>.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your post. About creating assignments that &nbsp;for specific students in the Team automatically, this is infeasible, we can’t create an assignment involved the students automatically. If you want to give extra credit to those who have a score below
 70 or assign a retest to those who scored below a certain score, you can create an assignment for these students manually.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the feature you want, we also would love to hear your comments and suggestions about any of teams. Send us your thoughts follow:

<h2>            Why can&#39;t I stay signed in to Bing Rewards using Safari on my iPhone</h2>
                    <p>Every time I go to Bing I see I am not signed in. To sign in I have to enter my password and then the last 4 of my phone number and then get a code via text. Why can I not stay signed in? Not using the app, going to Bing.com using Safari on iPhone 5S</p>

<h2>            Zune won&#39;t stay on without being plugged into AC charger</h2>
                    My Zune won't stay on unless it is plugged into an actual AC charger. If I plug it into the pc, it will flash the Zune logo screen, the bar will load, then it shuts down and repeats this over and over.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If I'm playing a song while plugged into the AC adapter, it will continue to play if I unplug it the current song will continue to play and I can adjust the volume, but as soon as I hit a button to pause, skip, or replay the song, it shuts down. When it
 is in this shut down state and unplugged, it will not come on at all.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've rebooted but haven't done a hard reset for fear that if I do, I'm stuck with a Zune with nothing on it (since it won't sync with the pc). At least now I can listen to the existing podcasts and music via the AC charger until I figure out the long term
 solution.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is a model 1089 version 3.30 (39) 30G Zune. If it's a battery issue, what are the options to replace it? If not, what are the options? I've loved having the Zune after being an iPod guy for the first 4 generations of iPods, so hopefully this is fixable.
 Thanks for any help!</div>

            Being that a 30 GB device it must be off-warranty and there is no service offered for off-warranty devices in service.zune.net. You can explore other repairing alternatives to try to save your device by changing the battery but if you're able to play music&nbsp;
 and adjust the volume for a while as long as you don't press the pause/play button then that would suggest it is not a battery issue.
<br />
You can get the battery and guides on how to change it from here; <a href="http://www.rapidrepair.com/shop/zune-1g-30gb-parts.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.rapidrepair.com/shop/zune-1g-30gb-parts.html</a> and you can also contact the rapidrepair center to see what services they offer. If none of the options mentioned work for you then I would suggest you get a replacement device from service.zune.net.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
Thank you for replying.</p>
<p><br />
Please don’t worry; I’ll help you.</p>
<p><br />
Follow the steps below and let me know the result:</p>
<p><br />
<strong><u>Before we could proceed with troubleshooting, let's check whether your connections are working fine:</u></strong></p>
<p><br />
a. Go to the start button.<br />
b. Click on Run and type cmd and hit enter<br />
c. Command line window will open. Type ipconfig /all. This will check your connections and make sure everything is working.</p>
<p><br />
<strong><u>Method 1: Network troubleshooter:</u></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Using-the-Network-troubleshooter-in-Windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Using-the-Network-troubleshooter-in-Windows-7</a><br />
<br />
<strong><u>Method 2: Bypass the router :</u></strong></p>
<p>1. Unplug the Ethernet cable running from your computer to the back of the router<br />
2. unplug in the Ethernet cable coming directly from the modem to the router and plug it into the back of your computer instead of the router.<br />
Now you have bypassed your router, and your internet is only hooked up to one computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Method 3: Start your computer in safe mode with networking to check if there are any conflicts.</u></strong><br />
<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Method 4: Run the fixit to reset Winsoc:</u></strong></p>

<p>Post back with the result. I’ll provide you more options if you are still facing the issue<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Upgrade Fails with Error Code C1900104</h2>
                    <p>I signed up for the Windows Insider Program and started an in-place upgrade. &nbsp;My current OS is Windows 7, all updates installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After about an hour of downloading, the installer started. &nbsp;Windows Media Center was identified as an issue. &nbsp;I clicked through and the installation appeared to start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two hours later it was still going and I went to bed and left it running overnight.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Eight hours later it was still going and I went to work and left it running.</p>

            <p>Hi Ed,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you aware that if you were to succeed in installing Windows Technical Preview over top an existing installation, that if you were to buy the product when it comes out, you could not install the release over top of Beta, you would need to wipe out the
 partition and do a Clean install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been mentioned before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a great reason why it is a good idea to partition the Hard Drive in the beginning, to allow for Beta Testing of New operating systems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if this is a Desktop Computer add a new Hard Drive and partition it, before you were to install Windows Technical Preview.</p>

<h2>            I&#39;m not happy with Windows 10 &#40;details inside&#41; - am I missing something&#63;</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">I'm not seeing any justification for me to upgrade to Windows 10 from Windows 8.1 (with a Start menu replacement). This is my personal opinion (yours might be different) and I realize that the product isn't GA yet - I just wanted to
 provide some feedback and air my thoughts to see if others agree.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Windows 10 continues the trend of stripping out desktop functionality to cater to tablet/phone users while placing an emphasis on sub-par services that provide MS long-term revenue streams (Xbox, Groove Music, Microsoft Store, Movies
 and TV). Let me qualify the following bullet points by stating that I've always been an early adopter that maintained an open mind for change - I didn't mind Vista and got used to Windows 8/8.1 rather quickly.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
</p><ul>
<li>
<p><span>Modern Applications</span>&nbsp;- The Windows store is a commercial failure and the majority of its offerings are terrible substitutes for classic third-party applications (ex. VLC Player, Chrome) or SaaS offerings (ex. Google Music or Netflix). Microsoft
 - accept the fact that you missed the boat on an app store, providing subscription services and building a viable mobile operating system. I STILL can't uninstall the majority of this bloatware - why Microsoft, why?</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Edge</span>&nbsp;- Improperly renders a good portion of my go-to websites and doesn't support extensions....back to Chrome.</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Start Menu</span>&nbsp;- I still don't see how this is an improvement over Windows 7 or Start8 for desktop users (without a touch screen). The tiles are still ugly, the 'Modern Apps' are still worthless compared to third party tools, the 'All Apps' sorting
 isn't customizable, the icons look poorly scaled...I could go on. How is this innovative?</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Dual Monitor Support</span>&nbsp;- I don't see any enhancements from 8.1 for dual monitor users - I do see one major drawback though: independent wallpapers. 8.1 allowed me to assign wallpapers independently to multiple monitors. I run one vertical monitor
 (for Google Music and reddit) so the wallpaper looks ridiculous when stretched to fit the 1080x1920 screen.</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Cortana</span>&nbsp;- The speech recognition is poor (with a Yeti Black microphone) and the majority of questions just pull up Bing searches in Edge. More importantly, we lack the ability to customize the search engine or browser that displays results!
 How is this - in ANY way - an improvement over Siri or Google Search? Voice commands aren't a net new feature - this SHOULD be better.</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Automatic Driver Updates</span>&nbsp;- Does ANYONE think this is a good idea? I'm all about keeping drivers up to date, but the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2015/07/25/windows-10-automatic-update-problems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">potentially
 disastrous negatives</a>&nbsp;vastly outweigh the positives. I've already been burned - my 2nd monitor is freaking out due to a current driver issue, when I revert to a previous versions it gets automatically updated.</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Multiple Desktops</span>&nbsp;- This is so far behind other solutions that it isn't even funny - why release this until you can compare to multiple desktop techniques from 10+ years ago. I will say that the new Task View is much better than previous iterations.</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>GUI Uniformity</span>&nbsp;- Right click on an icon in the task bar - now right click on a file/folder in Explorer. Some windows look like Windows 7, some look like Windows 10. Title bars are straight up white with oversized minimize/maximize/close buttons
 that look stretched. Why can't Microsoft build a unified UI framework to save their lives? Boy this is ugly...I love minimalistic and simple UIs, but MS can't seem to scale its own icons/text properly without making it a blurry, headache inducing mess.</p>
</li></ul>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Am I missing something? All this praise for Windows 10 is confusing - is MS backing most of the media coverage?</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">(For reference, I'm using a desktop with an i7/16GB RAM/SSD/GTX 970/23" 1080P monitor.)</p>

            <p>i agree with all your very well stated points, not to mention that everything "app" related, constantly breaks itself, which is a real problem now because "settings" and "start menu" is an "app" now too</p>
<p>
</p><p>the company is faltering, they are just NOT producing the quality of software they used to produce, they are ages behind playing the catch up game, nobody wants to use their services so now they are just trying to force them on people against their will</p>
<p>
</p><p>windows 10 has less features, options, user control and compatibility then windows 7, the UI is a total disaster mess, they cant even make the icons match eachother, its half "modern" and half "windows 7" and even part windows 95, its atrocious how many
 totally different styles of windows and settings they have going on all at once, and on top of it they took away the options to make it look somewhat better</p>
<p>
</p><p>but they don't care, its being released this way, they figure we are too dumb to notice how bad it is<br />

            <p>Thanks James, very well said.&nbsp; I have all the same complaints.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question to Microsoft: is it really that difficult to offer a UI for desktops and one for tablets/phones?&nbsp; Or at least offer greater customization?&nbsp; It is not rocket science.&nbsp; Windows 7 GUI was Awesome!&nbsp; Your Metro UI is horrible for desktop users.&nbsp;The
 GUI is eye candy.&nbsp;Not to mention its productivity and speed.&nbsp; Its like you gave us caviar with 7 now your giving us sauerkraut with the continued Metro UI.&nbsp;The only positive thing to say is the semi transparency in the start menu.&nbsp; Transparency was my favorite
 thing about 7&nbsp;which you have bastardized Windows 7 with 8.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>If your going to have a desktop OS....then have&nbsp;the GUI be&nbsp;desktop friendly.</p>
<p>It seems your goals are to make things more difficult and time consuming for desktop users...especially for power users; where things were a few clicks away, they are now 4 or 5 steps away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you really trying to drive people to the Linux OS or perhaps Apple?&nbsp; Keep up the good work because your doing a&nbsp;bang up job of it.</p>
<p />

            <p>Yea it seems like they are not focusing on a robust and efficient OS but instead on a bunch of fluf.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The UI is indeed a disaster. I counted at least 5 different context menu types with different sizes, different fonts, and&nbsp;different colors.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is absolutely no consistency in the settings (control panel). We have a bypolar systems with some features only found in the old control panel type settings while&nbsp;others only in the new settings interfaces while yet others that existed but now&nbsp;are
 no where to be found. They are actually removing features and devolving into a piece of low end&nbsp;consumer type OS. There seems to be no design spec they are following.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Touch areas and&nbsp;buttons are all different sizes, and&nbsp;visual queues of what is a&nbsp;clickable is non existent or at least&nbsp;non uniform.&nbsp;The settings layouts of the OS and/or some of the&nbsp;apps (i.e. Edge)&nbsp;have no sectional groupings so they blend together in a
 confusing way with huge comical fonts as if they where designed by a&nbsp;pre-schooler.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Transparencies are mostly gone. So we are back to the 90s. At least then we couldn't do it because of performance. Now it is an ugly artificial choice for the sake of change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No proper dual or multiple monitor support especially for differnt orientations and sizes. No multiple back grounds. No multiple task bars per monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No proper comprehensive file search options. And its still way too slow. Google can search the entire Internet in less than a second, with windows it takes hours if you want to search within contents of all files on a large drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Edge browser is full of bugs. No extensions.&nbsp;It can't event open popups properly and most of the settings options are gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is way better than 8 but its got a long way to go to dethrone Windows 7.</p>

            <p>My two cents is that Windows is just a conduit to run a browser, software and peripherals. My issue has always been with a new version that it might break something.&nbsp;That is the&nbsp;experience for me with Windows 10. My Brother mobile scanner is NOT supported,&nbsp;upon
 upgrade the Synaptics&nbsp; Clickpad does not work correctly if at all on my Stream 11 from HP and neither HP&nbsp;or Microsoft seem to have a credible fix. HP provides only a chip driver and a couple value added software upgrades. But refer drivers to Windows update
 to handle that?? Passing the buck are they? Anyway, the real question for anyone is why upgrade something that works for something that does not work for you. Even if its "free"? I asked myself this question finally after struggling hours on two PC's trying
 to get everything working. I finally decided Windows 10 is not worth "free". Not at this point anyway,&nbsp;maybe months from now things will improve and I may try upgrading. But not before being&nbsp;convinced it will go better. My other frustration is with these &nbsp;notebook's
 like the Stream 11 that has only a small 32 GB storage drive. I managed to upgrade the Stream 11 but it took adding a Flash drive of at least 8GB to correctly install the Windows 10 upgrade.</p>
<p>Of course probably not everyone who bought a Stream 11 has that sitting around. Of course plenty of upgraders probably had little problem upgrading to Windows 10 and are enjoying the free Windows upgrade.
</p>
<p>My only advice is first decide if you really need or want Windows 10, second determine if after the upgrade everything will work like before or better. Third, don't just upgrade now because your afraid you won't get Windows 10 free. You have a year to get
 it, and only 30 days to downgrade back to Windows ? if you do not like Windows 10.</p>
<p>I personally went back to Windows 8.1 on my Stream 11, and HP laptop and Windows 7 on my desktop PC. Not because Windows 10 is hideous or poorly designed. Its because it stop me from doing what I need to do with a PC.
</p>
<p>That to me is not progress in the least. </p>

            <p>You are not missing anything.&nbsp; The only people that I have seen truly support Windows 10 are the paid media minions and a few of the "Xbox gamer" crowd.&nbsp; (Yeah, I'll get flack for that one.)</p>
<p>Windows 10 is what happens when you get the computer people out of design and put in "Cloud and Mobile First!" folks.&nbsp; You get a one size fits nobody model.</p>
<p>But you have to remember.&nbsp; Microsoft knows more about what you want to do with your computer than you do!&nbsp; You must never forget this most important of credos.&nbsp; (yes, yes, tongue in cheek folks.)</p>
<p>Windows 10 was designed from the get-go to be a bland, low system requirements, mainly mobile OS.&nbsp; They have succeeded.&nbsp; I know of a Win Phone user that likes Windows 10.&nbsp; He cannot understand HOW it is EVER going to work/look on an actual computer.&nbsp; I showed
 him.&nbsp; He says: "It sure stinks in THAT format!".&nbsp; And I agreed with him.</p>
<p>I wish you best of luck.&nbsp; Microsoft has ignored MOST of the feedback from the "Insiders".&nbsp; Just look at the feedback app and the feedback that generated over 5000 "me toos'' and you will see that they did NOT resolve ANY of those.&nbsp; Just shows you how much
 they didn't listen/didn't care.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take care,</p>

            This is the most confusing consumer product I have ever bought and I've seemingly bought them all.&nbsp; I want to love Microsoft and hate Apple...but I can't.&nbsp; I frankly don't care how much things cost - be they high or low priced - ease of use is of paramount
 importance.&nbsp; I love the Surface Pro 3 I only wish I could say the same for the new OS....&nbsp; Maybe it's time to buy another MacBook and keep feeding the greediest company in the word.&nbsp; What a bummer.

            Based on my experience with WIndows 10 I'd sell the company stock if I owned any.&nbsp; I feel badly for Intel - linking their future to the "new and improved" OS is unfortunate.&nbsp; How can this new OS be the driver for PC sales??&nbsp; I don't see it.&nbsp; Nothing is
 intuitive.&nbsp; Best to sell my Intel.&nbsp;

            <p>Installed this on 7/31 and ready to uninstall if I can find out how.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Major issues: &nbsp;won't let me access my office outlook - says I need permission from the administrator who is me. &nbsp;Even when I changed from signing in by Microsoft to signing in local user, it didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Need permission to save pictures from the internet to my pictures folder (i.e., right click pic and save picture to . . .)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then 2 nights ago I was browsing the settings and all that stuff on the start menu and I can't remember what I did but now I can't use the start menu - have to use task manager to shut off computer. &nbsp;I recall doing something and the Q drive came up - backing
 up? &nbsp;I don't know. &nbsp;Now I can't change my sign on from the Microsoft to my original local user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cortana doesn't work but I found out I don't like it. &nbsp;How many places do I need to put my information, tasks, appointments? &nbsp;One Note, Cortana? &nbsp;I was happy and satisfied with Office Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I'm ready to uninstall and go back to 7.</p>

<h2>            Windows Update error 0x80070666, Definition Update for Windows Defender - KB2267602 &#40;Definition 1.223.2317.0&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Operating System: Windows 8.1 Single Language 64-bit (6.3, Build 9600) (9600.winblue_r4.141028-1500)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been encountering&nbsp;this recurring error (0x80070666)&nbsp;whenever I try to download my accumulated&nbsp;Definition update for&nbsp;Windows Defender through windows update after a clean install of my windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what I understand from the windows help and the community is that this error is a generic error and is most likely the result of conflicting software or having set an incorrect time and date for your region and should correct itself on its own. After
 multiple clean installs as of this month I have without fail encountered the same problem. I have also encountered this problem with an earlier installation build for windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way to remove this problem is to restart windows and recheck for updates. But the interesting thing is that in update history the update that actualy succedded is not the one that was failing. Definition Update for Windows Defender - KB2267602 (Definition
 1.223.2319.0) which succeeded&nbsp;is infact a newer update&nbsp;than KB2267602 (Definition 1.223.2317.0) which failed before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either there is something on my hard drive that conflicts with it or I encountered a bug with windows update. What does this error code mean in terms of my situation because I can't find anything specific.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: I also&nbsp;noticed that according to the windows update log&nbsp;the Definition Update for Windows Defender - KB2267602 (Definition 1.223.2319.0)&nbsp;was installed&nbsp;on 22/06/2016, but&nbsp;according to windows defender my virius definition version is
<span>1.223.2360.0 as of 22/06/2016. According to </span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/definitions/adl.aspx?wa=wsignin1.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/definitions/adl.aspx?wa=wsignin1.0</a> the

<p>Hi Nikhil,<br />
<br />
There are a number of reasons why you encountered an encryption error when encrypting an email. This mostly due to a certificate conflict or a corrupt certificates in Outlook. Let's check the Trust Center Settings in your Outlook by performing the following
 steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In Outlook, Click <strong>File</strong>.</li><li>Choose <strong>Options</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Trust Center</strong>, then click <strong>Trust Center Settings</strong>.</li><li>Go to <strong>Email Security</strong>. Check if the following options are unchecked:
<ul>
<li><span>Encrypt content and attachments for outgoing messages.</span></li><li><span>Add digital signatures to outgoing messages</span></li></ul>
</li><li>Go to <strong>Trusted Publisher</strong>, then delete the digital signatures that may appear in the list.</li><li>Relaunch Outlook.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Once done, please check if you can now encrypt and open the email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your reply.</p>

            Thank you providing us an update. Are you trying to send an email when you got this encryption error message? It seems that your Outlook is not using the certificate because it can't match the email address. We also need to make sure that your Office is
 updated. We recommend that you <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Install-Office-updates-2ab296f3-7f03-43a2-8e50-46de917611c5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">install the latest Office updates</a></strong> to check if that helps to
 prevent the encryption error.<br />
<br />
We look forward to your update.

<h2>            Nokia phone asking for a DTMF Number when I dial out</h2>
                    Hi, I have a Nokia phone XpressMusic 5800 and I just tried calling my voicemail I just set up with my service provider (as I changed my phone number and had to set it up again), and the phone calls and I hear the voice mail system message asking me for
 my password, but when I select 'dialer' to access the keypad on my phone and enter it, there is text in the window that says: "DTMF Number:" ?&nbsp; What is it asking or want me to do? My voicemail is not receiving the numbers I press and it is like it is not hearing
 or recognizing the commands? Anyone know what this is?&nbsp; I cannot find the answer in my phone's user manual or any reference to it that I have come across or anywhere on my phone.&nbsp; I think maybe I accidently turned something on while my phone was in my jacket,
 I'm not sure?&nbsp; If anyone can help me with this I would greatly appreciate it as I need to use my phone.&nbsp;

            Don't know whether your 5800XM started out life as a network branded device, but sounds as if it running old firmware. What result do you get inputting *#0000# upon dialler?

<h2>            Please help, Nokia c2-02 browser troubles</h2>
                    
<p>It's been 3 months since I've updated my nokia browser and since then the browser is not working</p>
<p>I have updated my phone using nokia suite 3 times</p>
<p>(today was the 3th time)</p>
<p>I've been searching online for a solution but all whatI've seen was to download the nokia browser but I haven't find one suitable to my phone (nokia c2-02) if there is please post me a direct link</p>
<p>The other link that I found post on the nokia forum were unsuitable for my phone</p>
<p>I have searched throught ovi store for days but I haven't find "The nokia browser - new and improved"</p>
<p>I have downloaded other browsers which I use<br />
but they don't support 0.facebook.com (which is a website that is given and provided free in my country )</p>
<p>The old nokia browser supported that website</p>
<p>Is there anyway that I may use to restore my old browser ?</p>
<p>If there isn't please give me a direct link to download a new browser (not from ovi store because as I mentioned earlier it does not support nokia c2-02)</p>
<p>And thank you very much</p>

<h2>            Problem while accessing Yahoo mail using Internet Explorer 8</h2>
                    Original Title: performance, safety and security in Internet Explorer<br />
<br />
I am using IE 8. When I go to my Yahoo email account, I cannot open or delete emails or any of my folders. Nor can I refresh my inbox. In fact none of my mouse clicks will work. The same account on same computer with same mouse works just fine using Firefox
 How do I fix this?
