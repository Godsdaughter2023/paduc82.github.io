<h2>            Can&#39;t Accept License Terms</h2>
                    I was trying to download Windows 10. It took two and a half hours to download, to be faced with the fact that I cannot accept the License terms. I have tried moving it around my screen, or making my screen smaller, but it always is out of where my mouse
 can go. I'm at a loss for what to do. Please help!&nbsp;

    <title>Wired 360 controller on Windows 7 PC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lordgodalming  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wired 360 controller on Windows 7 PC</h2>
                    
<p>I picked up a Wired (not wireless) Xbox 360 controller a couple months ago to use with Steam on my Windows 7 64-bit PC, and I have had a lot of trouble getting it to function. In fact, there was only one time when it worked properly, and then only for about
 20 minutes, after which it simply quit responding during gameplay. The correct green light remained on, but there was no feedback. I did not unplug or change change settings.</p>
<p>I have tried many methods, including the ones outlined in the Xbox forums and on the official support pages. I've tried all USB ports on my PC (one USB 3.0 and two USB 2.0). Usually the green lights all power on then switch off, and a message pops that the
 driver did not install correctly. Sometimes plugging it in also results in four flashing green lights. Sometimes the correct green light comes on, but the controller will not respond.</p>
<p>If anyone can help, I would really appreciate it. I loved using this controller for the 20 minutes that it worked that one time. Here are my specs:</p>
<p>Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit (SP1)<br />
Intel i7-3610QM<br />
8.00GB RAM<br />
GeForce GT 650M (1GB DDR5)</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi there &nbsp;- your best bet is to grab hold of a wireless gaming receiver, which can be bought pretty cheaply on the internet. Then you can check out the guide here on how to set it all up!:

    <title>Having problems with your Logitech Dual Action Gamepad - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gamer monkey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Having problems with your Logitech Dual Action Gamepad &#40;controller&#41; in Windows 8.1&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to Windows 8.1 and my Logitech profiler stopped being able to detect my Logitech Dual Action Gamepad (controller). The hardware was still detected and some information was passed through, but the Logitech Profiler is so useful that I had to get
 it up and going.</p>
<p>Knowing my own frustration - I thought I would pass the fix along to the Gaming Community. (Let's face it, the Logitech Dual Action Controller rocks and Logitech should never have discontinued it's production)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft compatibility list was unable to make the Logitech Profiler function correctly.</p>
<p>I, however, was able to find a fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) go to <a href="http://www.logitech.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.logitech.com</a><br />
2) Hover over "Support" and pull down<br />
3) Select "Support + Download"<br />
4) Select "Gaming"<br />
5) Scroll to the bottom and click on "Dual Action Gamepad"<br />
6) Click on Downloads<br />
7) Pick OS as "Windows 8"<br />
8) Pick 32-bit or 64-bit dependent upon your system (my system is 64-bit)<br />
9) Hit the "Download Software" and save it to the Desktop or you Download folder<br />
10) Open Control Panel<br />
11) Under "Programs", click uninstall programs.<br />
12) Look for "Logitech Gaming Software" (may have a slightly different name) and click uninstall<br />
13) NOTE :: this does not uninstall the Profiles in your Logitech folder. I do, however, suggest that you always use the profiler to export copies of any game profiles that you create as back-up or in case you want to share them with others.<br />
14) Go to the Download from Logitech - labeled "lgs510_x64" if you downloaded the 64-bit version - and run the file to install the profiler.<br />
15) Follow the set-up procedures and your Logitech Dual Action game pad should once again work as it did under Windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this&nbsp; point, the Logitech Profiler opened up with no problem (aka it was able to detect the controller). You should still have access to all your profiles.</p>
<p>In my case, it had even loaded up the profile and settings that I had used last.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, if you have been having problems getting keyboard/mouse games to accept the controller input, the fix is to
</p>
<p>1) Open the Profiler</p>
<p>2) Click on "Options"</p>
<p>3) Click on "Global Profiler Settings"</p>
<p>4) Click "Apply Persistent Profile"</p>
<p>5) Select the Game that you want to play. (You will have to change this as you change games aka Profiler configurations)</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, the computer sees the Logitech Controller input the same as it would the keyboard and mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>NOTE</strong> :: While you have the controller set to "Persistent Profile" the controller will generate input your computer based on those settings even when you are not playing a game.
</p>
<p>This means that if your computer starts acting squirrely make sure that your&nbsp;controller isn't turned sideways forcing a joystick out of neutral or whatnot.</p>
<p>I put my controller where it won't fall over or otherwise fiddled with.&nbsp; </p>
<p>You can all always turn the settings on and off if it is an issue or simply unplug the controller while you aren't gaming. I leave mine plugged in and have only knocked over my controller and caused an issue a time or two.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck and good gaming!</p>

<h2>            Kombat pass problem - need help</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I bought a new copy of mortal kombat days ago and unfortunately I did a big mistake. I was on my friend's xbox (logged in my account) and I activate the kombat pass on his xbox. I though the pass will be allowing me to play at home, on my xbox but even
 if I'm loggin with my account, I can't play online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way for me to delete the pass from my friend's xbox and reactivate it on my xbox ?</p>
<p>please, 80$ is expensive for a single game, and I don't wanna pay another 10$ because I wasn't knowing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Frank</p>

<p><span>Hi Sam Silver,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Are you logged in as Administrator?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I’d suggest you to open Backup and Restore using administrative privileges by right clicking on it and choosing
<strong>Run as administrator</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If that does not help, disable User Account control and check if the issue gets resolved.</span></p>
<p><span>To disable User Account Control follow the steps below: -</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<span><strong>Start</strong></span>, and then click <span><strong>Control Panel</strong></span>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In
<span><strong>Control Panel</strong></span>, click <span><strong>User Accounts</strong></span>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the
<span><strong>User Accounts</strong></span> window, click <span><strong>User Accounts</strong></span>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the
<span><strong>User Accounts</strong></span> tasks window, click <span><strong>Turn User Account Control on or off</strong></span>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If the
<span><strong>User Account Control</strong></span> dialog box appears, confirm that the action it displays is what you want, and then click
<span><strong>Yes</strong></span>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the
<span><strong>Security</strong></span> section of the <span><strong>Windows Solution Center</strong></span> page, click
<span><strong>Adjust UAC Settings</strong></span>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>On the
<span><strong>User Account Control Settings</strong></span> page:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>To disable UAC, move the slider to
<span><strong>Never notify</strong></span>, and then click <span><strong>OK</strong></span>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>To enable UAC or change levels of notification, move the slider to the appropriate notification option, and then click
<span><strong>OK</strong></span>.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Make sure you re-enable UAC post troubleshooting. For more information please visit the link below,</span></p>

 am frustrated with this problem! I'm in the US.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bought a surface laptop worth 1200USD in Dec 2017. That patch started appearing after 10-11 months of purchase. I didn't pay too much attention until now. Its been 1 year and 6months now. I called and complained, but they told me to pay 500USD to replace
 the device because I didn't file a complaint immediately. I regret not immediately calling, I assumed I'll be covered. That's my biggest fault. But asking for another 500USD is insane!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is frustrating because other options like Dell and HP offer better specs at the same price, and offer warranty too! Just because I really had a craze with Surface, I invested on their product and out-of-warranty cost is extremely high!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been looking around for options. My laptop otherwise works just fine, but has this screen issue and yeah, the flickering(scary) happens sometimes on video embedded webpages- youtube, netflix.</p>
<p>

 Surface needs to be replaced. Surface Devices that are beyond 1 year does not cover free replacement unless you have purchased Microsoft Complete Plan then you can definitely process an exchange for free through your

<p>Hi Karen!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the prompt response. I don't think I have the Microsoft complete plan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per your suggestion, can you help me find a store near me that can replace or upgrade my device on a discounted rate? Im asking this because you mentioned every stire had a different policy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, since this issue had happened while I was on warranty, do you think my case will be considered? I do realise that I should have immediately complained, but didn't anticipate this display issue will increase so fast.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

</p><p>Karen, Microsoft's exchange/return policy is identical across the United States. Please ensure that you are providing accurate information when educating customers on the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sruthi, I apologize for the misinformation from Karen. The core advice was correct - contact support or walk it into your local MS store - but the return and exchange policy is set at the corporate level to ensure a consistent customer
 experience. Nobody should have to try multiple stores hoping to get a different answer. I am not an expert on the Surface warranty language, but I suspect that your initial messaging was correct. My personal experience with various warranties all required
 that I file a claim within the warranty coverage period. With your Surface 6 months beyond that point, exploring replacement options sounds like the correct approach.</p>
<p>

<p>While trying to download the 940520 , in safe mode, it does not pass the validation process. Unfortunately, to fix that problem you can't be in safe mode. I tried the manual process for deleting the qmgr files but then the windows update program will not
 work.</p>

Its strange. This priblem is happening on two of my laptops, one which was turned off since April sitting at my inlaws. The only common link is I was using Windows Onecare to monitor both.
<br />
<br />
I tried the steps above but cannot get anything to download, probably because most of the services are stopped. I cannot open Windows update to check the last installed update. It just hangs up. I tried in&nbsp; normal and safe mode with networking.<br />

            <p>NONE of the above works for a number of reasons, but MOSTLY due to the fact that the validation tool which Microsoft provides,....that MUST run before the troubleshooting tool or fix tool to work,.....is outdated and old.</p>
<p>The visitor is then presented with an error....</p>
<p>Uhhhh were too stupid to give you the proper tool so go get the correct one and run it and get a validation code and put it in here, but don't ask us to give you the proper tool we would rather just keep providing you with the wrong one!</p>
<p>This is very frustrating since the majority of trojans and viruses I have seen on systems lately disable and destroy both BITS and almost all windows updates files and dll's.</p>
<p>For Microcoft to make it so difficult to fix creates a LOT of frustration and anger on the tech side out in the field.</p>
<p>Microsoft should remember that WE have direct contact with the customer and they make purchases based upon OUR recommendations.</p>
<p>For thing like Bits and Windows updates, just give us the troubleshooting tools as well as the fix tools and dll downloads without having to jump through so many hoops.</p>

    <title>Severe Surface Book instability after installing Anniversary Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> swissmobile  say:</h3>
<h2>            Severe Surface Book instability after installing Anniversary Update</h2>
                    The Anniversary Update looks like another disaster for the Surface Book. After installing it, the network got completely unstable after resuming from sleep, to the point where the machine was unusable until rebooted. Edge and Chrome kept freezing and Flash
 kept crashing etc. Instability across the board. Not sure if it's the network or something else going on. I ended up rolling back and now things are working again. I still have the random reboots when the machine is asleep. The latest firmware and driver updates
 only reduced them, but didn't completely fix them. Please Microsoft, get this damn thing fixed already and don't make it worse with OS updates like the Anniversary Update. I've been hanging in there as I like the concept of the Surface Book, but you are really
 making it difficult to stay with&nbsp; your products. This is by far one of your worst product execution.

            Have you run the system file checker followed by the DISM command (using a relevant windows 10 image saved to a flash drive) to fix any corrupt system files? I often find that this is necessary after windows updates to return my surface book to greater
 stability.

<p>
</p><p>Yes, I did. Seems like these issues are not isolated to the Surface devices. News reports are coming in of many folks having major stability issues after upgrading to the Anniversary Update. I'll give Microsoft some time to sort this out before I attempt
 another upgrade.&nbsp;</p>

            I have this issue as well. My Surface Book has become basically unusable w/ the same issues as you. Edge and Chrome continuously crashing, even explorer.exe fails 40% of the time and I have to manually kill the process and restart it. This happened to
 me on the Insider Preview of 14393 as well - it was so bad I had to wipe my Surface Book entirely. I had thought perhaps it was just a bad install, but when officially installing the Anniversary update, the results were the same. I hope a fix is out very soon
 or my SB is going to be thrown through a wall.

            <p>Apparently it isn't happening everywhere. I don't do the Insider Previews on my Surface Book as I also use it in my work. My Surface Book is stable and reliable and has been both before and after the Anniversary update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Chrome 64-bit as my browser and have looked at Edge to see what has improved. I'm not experiencing the crashes and instability you write about. I'm curious what could be different.</p>

            <p>Interesting. I'd not considered MS sourcing parts from different vendors. Did you have the same instabilities when you were at 14393.51?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm evidently quite lucky to get this machine then. Even when the Sleep issues were rampant I was otherwise stable and bypassed the Sleep issue by just shutting down every night.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, since the June 20th update, where Microsoft said they were addressing the Sleep issues, I've been using Sleep/Hibernate with no issues whatsoever. For me Sleep/Hibernate has now worked flawlessly without a single problem for a total of 54 continuous
 days. I consider the Sleep/Hibernate issue fixed on my Surface Book.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a touchpad user and have been totally mouse free since I got my Surface Book. The last issue I had was the sensitivity on the right side of the touchpad. I'm a touch-tapper for left mouse clicks. The Anniversary Update has now fixed the touchpad and
 it is now totally uniform in its touch-tapping response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Surface Book is now what it should have been when I got it last November. I've gone through all the issues that all the early adopters went through, but I'm quite happy now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm an avid photography hobbyist and using this color accurate 3000 x 2000 screen for photography using Adobe Lightroom/Photoshop CC and the Microsoft Pen for photo retouching is absolutely amazing! I could never go back to an ordinary PC again.</p>

            <p>No, I had a whole new set of instabilities. Also, had a new set of Bluetooth issues. I use the SB mostly connected to external peripherals. As I said, I've got the the Surface Dock through which the SB is hardwired to my network. I've got an external monitor
 connected to the Dock, which is an issue on it's own. Windows 10 and most apps just don't deal properly with different scaling levels. My external monitor doesn't have 4K resolution. I use the MS Designer Bluetooth keyboard and mouse, so I basically have a
 desktop setup. As I said, it's mostly stable now that I've rolled back, but with the Anniversary update I had random keyboard input from my Bluetooth keyboard, mouse suddenly not responding, network stack seemingly freezing up etc. A lot of these issues are
 now being reported by other users. I've always got the impression that the SB on its own w/o using the dock and Bluetooth peripherals seems to work a lot better, but that's not what I bought it for. This is supposed to be my workstation. I'm a software developer,
 so I do a little more than just editing photos with it, that might have something to do with it as well.</p>

            <p>I see where you're coming from. I got rid of my desktop setup and large monitors as in this stage of my life I want to be totally mobile and have everything with me at all times. I don't have the Surface Dock and from everything I've read, I don't want it
 either. I'm totally stand-alone with my Surface Book. And as you say, that could very well be why everything works for me the way it should!</p>
<p>

            Made some progress. I decided to reset and reinstall Windows, but I haven't reapplied the Anniversary update yet. However, this seems to have cured the unexpected reboots in sleep mode. I suppose having had such an early model, the various updates left
 my OS installation kinda borked. Perhaps this will cure my issues I had with the Anniversary update, but I'll wait until Microsoft pushes out another update before I give it another try. Definitely optimistic, though.&nbsp;

            <p>I had similar issues. I asked Microsoft Support what to do and they recommended doing a clean install of Windows 10 because a roll-back wasn't an option. It fixed the most severe issues, but I still have stability issues when coming out of sleep. FYI - the
 clean install was an image with the anniversary update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use my surface book a lot to take notes in OneNote using the pen. Not great when the thing crashing during a meeting and you're taking notes...</p>

            You don't need it. And Driver Reviver has nothing to do with Windows 10 and I very much doubt it was already installed on your new laptop when you bought it. More likely it came bundled with something you have downloaded and installed. &nbsp;Just uninstall
 it.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
You need to do all of those top down as it is often the total process that solves the issue. If no joy<br />
you can try a system restore if you think you have a point when it did work. If that does get it<br />
working again keep your eye on it and check it frequently as the same issue might return depending<br />
on what the cause actually was.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Do you have TWO Volume Keys&nbsp;under the DRIVE key on left? <br />
<br />
On my machine the 1st Volume on left side has Drive Type&nbsp;&nbsp; as&nbsp; 3&nbsp;&nbsp; Mine is also a DVD however your drive<br />
could be different.<br />
<br />
The 2nd Volume on left has Drive Type of 53f7 same as one of yours and you should not change this one.<br />
<br />
If you have two Volume Keys try setting the entry to 3 as mine is. And contact your System and Device<br />
maker for recommendations. If you only have one Volume Key then I would wait until you get a response<br />
from System and/or Device maker.<br />
<br />
Remember the drive could be bad or other hardware issues.<br />
<br />
Did you try the Hardware not Detected or Not Working link?<br />
<br />
Have you tried the System Restore?<br />
<br />
Happy Holidays!<br />

<p>
</p><p>My wired connection has been out of commission for months because it can't authenticate the network. &nbsp;I have ruled out ISP issues and have tried a gazillion fixes that have only worked temporarily for a short time and never survived a restart if they even
 worked. &nbsp;So far it seems that there is an issue with the automatic DNS negotiation. &nbsp;I've contacted Microsoft support multiple times and their fixes are temporary as well. I'm close to doing a full system reset but I don't want to have to reinstall all of
 my programs (I have around 500GB of files) and I'm desperate for a fix that could keep me from having to reinstall and I'm not even sure that the reinstall would fix it.</p>

            <p><span>Hi LDB3,
</span></p>
<p><span>I see that you want to know if HDMI input will get better video over VGA input. I will help you
 with this issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>HDMI Basics</span></b><span>:
 HDMI is a digital format, so there is no conversion process between a media device and a flat-panel display device. In addition to supplying high-definition video, it contains wiring that transmits uncompressed, multi-channel surround-sound audio.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>VGA Basics</span></b><span>:
 VGA is an analog format, so the conversion process can produce a small amount of reduction in image sharpness and color accuracy. However, this cable type does not transmit audio. If you want sound, you will need separate cables.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>VGA Quirks</span></b><span>:
 Many flat-panel televisions will not accept a VGA signal higher than 1366 x 768 pixels. This is sufficient for 720p HD, which is 1280 x 720 pixels, but not 1080p HD, which is 1920 x 1080 pixels.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Monitors and VGA</span></b><span>:
 LCD computer monitors will accept VGA signals at 1080p resolutions. (The "p" refers to "progressive," which means that the image is refreshed all at once for more fluid movement on screen.)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Cable Length</span></b><span>:
 HDMI encounters a "digital cliff" past about 30 feet, at which point the signal can degrade dramatically. VGA can go two to three times as far before you get image-degradation problems. However, you can obtain "extender" devices for both formats.</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know if you need further help with any windows issue. We will be glad to help.</span></p>

            Under what circumstances does this error come up?<br />
<br />
When you ran chkdsk (not dskchk), did you use the /F switch (i.e.,&nbsp; chkdsk /F)?&nbsp; If not, errors are only detected and not fixed.<br />
<br />
The files in the Prefetch folder are used to improve performance.&nbsp; Generally, you should leave this folder alone because Windows XP will periodically clean out older files.&nbsp; See
<a href="http://www.edbott.com/weblog/2005/06/one-more-time-do-not-clean-out-your-prefetch-folder/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.edbott.com/weblog/2005/06/one-more-time-do-not-clean-out-your-prefetch-folder/</a>&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
On the other hand, although manually emptying the Prefetch folder will cause a temporary decrease in performance, doing so may be warranted if there is a corrupt file, as in your case.&nbsp; See
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/915163/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/915163/en-us</a>
<br />
<br />
Thus, if running chkdsk /F (you'll have to answer Yes and then reboot) doesn't fix things up, go to C:\Windows\Prefetch and delete the offending file.&nbsp; If you can't delete it, post back and report the error message you receive.<br />

            <p>Windows 10 comes with a built in compression utility (zipping) you are looking for. Actually, its licensed from WinZip and has been in Windows since Millenium edition.

<h2>            Problems with Skype phone calls</h2>
                    <p>Dear Skype experts,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just upgraded my OS (High Sierra &nbsp;version 10.13.1) &nbsp;on my Mac Book PRO.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also downloaded Skype from its official website and update that as well.</p>
<p>Skype used to work fine on my Mac. I used many times for Skype video interviews and calls.</p>
<p>Now Skype seems to have degraded. Or maybe it is not updated to High Sierra level.</p>
<p>I checked my Skype account. There i plenty of money.</p>
<p>However, when I place a call in the same country (UK) I can here the voice of the person I have called but the&nbsp;</p>
<p>counter part canNOT here me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would greatly appreciate some help at sorting out this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance,</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>

<p><span>Hi,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Is this happening to all of your mobile contacts? What is the exact Skype version that you’re using?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Can you try to do a test call using

<p><span>I look forward to your response.

<h2>            Adobe Photoshop Elements 10 Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I have just upgraded from Windows 8 to 8.1 and now find that the Photo Downloader will not work when I connect my DSLR. In fact Elements just hangs as soon as the camera power is switched on</p>
<p>Has anyone had the same problem and found a solution please?</p>
