    <title>The rule of ProgramData in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            The rule of ProgramData in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>From the document https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Ff716245.aspx#feedback, we can see the ProgramData folder does not require elevated permissions. But in the Windows 10, I found that when I created folder and files with elevated permissions under
 this folder, other users can not update them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our case is : the product installer will install some files into the folder with admin permission, the stand user will update some files during&nbsp; running&nbsp; our program. The action is work well on Window7, 8, etc, but do not work well on Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So Anyone can tell me this is a defect or new rule on Windows 10? If this is new rule on Windows 10, any more new shared folder for program using?</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi 一珊桑,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no rule as such on the Program Data folder. In order to troubleshoot your issue, I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 1:</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>Run the&nbsp;Shared folders&nbsp;troubleshooter.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>a) Press the ‘<strong>Windows + W’</strong> key on the keyboard.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>b) Type <strong>Troubleshooter</strong> in the
<strong>Search</strong> box and then press <strong>Enter</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>c) Select <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>. Click on
<strong>View All </strong>and select <strong>Shared folders.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>d) Click <strong>Next</strong> and follow the on-screen instructions.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>If the issue still persists, try the next method.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>Try to run a System File Checker (SFC) scan to check for any file corruption. <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
SFC scan will scan for corrupt system files on the computer and repair them.</span>
</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong><em>Windows key + X</em></strong>, click <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.</span></li><li><span>In the Command Prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER:
<br />
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong></span></li></ol>
<span>
<p>If the issue still exists, try the next method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong></p>
<p>You may check the same issue with the new user account.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try these steps to create a new user account and check if it fixes the issue. Refer to the steps below to create a new User Account:</span>
</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Go to <strong>Settings</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Choose <strong>Accounts </strong>and then select Other User Accounts&nbsp;towards the left.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>Add an Account</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Enter a <strong>user name</strong> and hit Next.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>Finish</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Sign out from the current Account and Log into the new&nbsp;account.</span></li><li><span>Check if issue persists.</span></li></ol>

            <p>Hi Harkanwar</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your help. I did some check and testing on 2 OS of Windows 10 Enterprise version, but I think it's not Shared Folder or Account issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made an exe can easily reporduce the issue. The exe will create a folder under ProgramData and copy a txt file to it, such as C:\ProgramData\check\readme.txt.<br />
</p>
<p>1&gt; 1st time, use "Run as Administrator" to start the exe, &nbsp;found the folder was created and readme.txt copied.</p>
<p>2&gt; 2nd time, direct start the exe&nbsp;<strong>without </strong>"Run as Administrator", file access denied error was shown.<br />
</p>
<p>Same action steps on Windows 7, readme.txt will be overwritted at 2nd time. &nbsp;Compared folder properties dialog between Win7 and Win10, I can not find any different.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
        </p>

            <p>Thanks for that. It looks like the file type is properly associated. When you right click on the file and select "Open", does it launch Excel and open the file?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you also check whether the Excel is the default application for *.xlsx files:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Default Apps (from left pane) &gt; Choose Apps by file type</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scroll down to XLSX files and see whether they are associated with Excel.</p>

            I'm getting a very similar error. When I try to update to Windows 8.1 from Windows 8, I get the following, "Sorry, it looks like this PC can't run Windows 8.1. This might be because the Users or Program Files folder is being redirected to another partition."
 I currently have three different physical drives. Two are hard disks. One each for programs and data. Then a solid state (64gb) for Windows. I believe this is same reason I can't update built in Microsoft apps such as Music, Weather, Sports, Video, etc...
 If anyone has run into this error as well and found a fix, please let us know!!
<div><br />
<div>Thanks.</div>

            Mine says the preview cannot be installed, yet I already have the preview and was looking to download the full version on my HP g7 2111nr w/ 500gb SSDD, 8 gb DDRAM.&nbsp;
<div>Some how I knew this update was going to be another major headache. I had upgraded my Windows 7 to Win 8 pro w/ media center, and about the only way I can even install another OS is to format the hard drive, as there are now missing files in recovery even
 to take my system completely back to factory default. And I am not about to have to pay over 200 dollars again just to fix my system.</div>
<div>&nbsp;Oh and to add more fuel to the fire, my account has been suspended; not sure as to why, so I may end up logging off my computer and not be allowed back on it.</div>

            <p>Yep...downloaded 3.5GB then "couldn't update system reserved partition" so it all turns to custard...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why is his all so hard,&nbsp;since I note there is no easy fix being suggested by MS.&nbsp; The only&nbsp;fix I read says clean install Windows 8 as the 100MB partition was set up from when W7 installed, and this will then be set at the reqd 350MB for W8 ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I don't have half a day to waste re-installing programs and the updates, so what's the quick fix MS, for the average user, as I'm not a tech geek ?</p>

My system reserved is 350MB and I can't get it to install either. I've ready some people have success with 350, others 600, other 1GB. I did a fresh W8 install and I can't get to 8.1 now. Ridiculous. I also have SO many programs that I would need to reinstall
 that I cannot afford to spend a whole day reinstalling everything.

            I fixed this problem by increase the size of system reserved partition from 350MB to 400 MB. It seems like this was because there was not enough free space to backup something in the system reserved partition. However, I think this approach is risky and
 I hope there is a better solution.

<h2>            xbox中国区下载缓慢&#47;停止问题咨询 &#91;Xbox China download Slow&#47;Stop Problem consulting&#93;</h2>
                    <p>问题反馈：下载缓慢，平均在20-100Mb之间波动，时有下载/安装停止的问题，很不稳定。<span>大多数中国区xbox玩家都有严重的下载缓慢和安装停止的问题，非常影响正常使用，询问妥善的解决方案</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>网络环境：湖南电信300M下行带宽，20M上行带宽，IP地址为公网IP，路由器和光猫桥接，拨号在路由器上，端口映射正常运行，主机网络状态为nat open，丢包率0-20。隔壁主机可以满速下载不断连，PC蒸汽平台速度没有低于过200M。</p>
<p>
</p><p>其它情况：使用过多种不同的DNS组合，包括114.114.114.114；223.5.5.5；8.8.8.8；<span>168.126.63.1；4.2.2.2以及本地DNS。经过测试，<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 23, 1)">其中，4.2.2.2最稳定，不会经常出现速度归零或安装停止</span></span>，但是速度极慢，只有1-2Mb每秒。如果使用运营商默认DNS，速度最快，偶尔也有突破100M下载速度的时候，但是下载速度归零和安装停止现象较为频繁，下载时必须要人为看护，以防断连。其它的DNS，都有各种各样的问题，要么就是下载缓慢，要么就是频繁停止安装，要么干脆无法获取下载。另外，下载的速度和稳定程度似乎因不同的游戏而异，比如说最近新出的极限竞速：地平线4就很快，但是老游戏比如量子破碎，就显得比较缓慢。最糟糕的是xbox360向下兼容游戏，几乎全程只有1-2Mb每秒的速度，而且安装停止非常频繁。</p>
<p>
</p><p>尝试的解决方案：DNSmasq是一个不错的解决方案，但是需要路由器支持，并且需要最新的地址列表才能获得稳定的速度，现在民间的地址列表已经过于陈旧，大多数地址已经失效，无法使用。使用代理服务也是一个解决方案，但是同样需要路由器支持，而且并不稳定。</p>
<p>

<div><strong>Problem feedback: Slow download, average fluctuation between 20-100MB, when there is a download/install stop problem, very unstable.</strong></div>
<div><strong>Most Xbox players in China have a serious download slow and installation stop problem, which is very bad for normal use, asking for a proper solution Network environment: Hunan Telecom 300M downlink bandwidth, 20M uplink bandwidth, IP address for
 public IP, router and optical cat bridge, dial-up on the router, port mapping normal operation, the host network status of NAT open, packet loss rate of 0-20.</strong></div>
<div><strong>The next-door host can be full-speed download continuously connected, PC Steam platform speed is not less than 200M. Other cases: Several different DNS combinations have been used, including 114.114.114.114;223.5.5.5;8.8.8.8;168.126.63.1;4.2.2.2
 and local DNS. After testing, wherein, 4.2.2.2 most stable, will not often appear speed zero or installation stop, but the speed is very slow, only 1-2MB per second. If you use the carrier default DNS, the fastest, and occasionally have to break the 100M download
 speed, but download speed zero and installation stop phenomenon more frequent, download must be human care, to prevent disconnection. Other DNS, there are all kinds of problems, either the download is slow, or stop the installation frequently, or simply can't
 get the download. In addition, the speed and stability of the download seems to vary depending on the game, such as the recent new extreme racing: Horizon 4 is fast, but the old game such as quantum fragmentation, it seems relatively slow.</strong></div>
<div><strong>The worst part is xbox360 backwards-compatible game, almost all the way to 1-2MB per second, and the installation stops very often. Tried solution: DNSMASQ is a good solution, but requires router support, and requires the latest address list to
 get stable speed, now the private address list is too old, most of the address has been invalidated, unusable. Using the proxy service is also a solution, but it also requires router support and is not stable.]</strong></div>

<h2>            True &#34;Upgrade&#34; from Windows XP to Window 7</h2>
                    
<p>With all the programmers working at Microsoft and with the knowledge that Windows Vista had major problems, Why isn't there a valid upgrade from XP to 7 without all the pain and&nbsp;<span><span>aggravation.&nbsp;
 I mean just like going from 3.2 to 3.3 to Windows 5 to 5.5 to XP.&nbsp; So that we aren't required to reinstall our software.&nbsp; I have three computers; two are for business with with more programs and folders that will fill a page after clicking on Start/All Programs.&nbsp;
 For me to reinstall all of that software (and many are password/key protected where replacement keys are no longer available) on both compuers would be a major hardship.&nbsp; I am sure there are others with similar problems.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Microsoft....&nbsp; You've done so well for your customer base in the past.... How about keeping the quality of your&nbsp;base's service where it belongs....&nbsp; "On top!"</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The need to do a clean install doesn't cut it and will force me to delay any and all upgrades.</span></span></p>

<p>There are two many architecture complexities involved with doing an in place upgrade from a 9 year old OS to a modern version of Windows such as Windows 7.</p>
<p>Upgrading from Windows XP?<br />
<br />
Please read these instructions carefully and completely before you begin installing Windows 7: There are important steps that you need to follow to upgrade from your PC from Windows XP to Windows 7 in order to preserve your files and settings.<br />
<br />
Before you begin, you'll need to back up all your data to an external storage device, and you'll need all of the installation discs for programs you want to keep. Please make sure you have an external hard drive (see details below).<br />
<br />
More detailed instructions are available at windows.microsoft.com/upgrade-windows-xp. Here are the basic steps.<br />
<br />
1. Run Windows Upgrade Advisor (windows.microsoft.com/upgradeadvisor) to see if there are any known issues that might affect the installation and whether you should install the 32 or 64 bit version of Windows 7.<br />
<br />
2. Save your files and settings on an external hard drive using Windows Easy Transfer (windows.microsoft.com/windows-easy-transfer). If you don't have an external hard drive you won't be able to use Windows Easy Transfer. Alternatively, you can copy files you
 want to keep on a USB flash drive, CDs, or DVDs.<br />
<br />
3. You'll need to manually reinstall your programs, such as Microsoft Office, after you install Windows 7. Gather the installation discs for your programs and any associated product/license keys. You might be able to download some programs from the Internet.
 For example, Windows Live Messenger can be installed from download.live.com/messenger.<br />
<br />
4. Inset the Windows 7 DVD into your PC. When asked "Which type of installation do you want? click "Custom (advanced)."<br />
<br />
5. After Windows 7 is installed, use Windows Easy Transfer to restore your files and settings.<br />
<br />
If you're not comfortable installing Windows 7 yourself, check with a local retail store or PC services company to see if they offer upgrade services.</p>
<p>http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/13/winxp-to-win7/</p>
<p>If these are not options for you, you could consider investing in LapLink PC Mover which has been said to upgrade Windows XP installations to Windows 7.</p>
<p>VMWare also has a free solution, but it has some licensing restrictions.</p>
<p>The next option, which requires that you own a Windows Vista license that corresponds with your correspond edition of Windows Vista and Windows 7 you would like to upgrade to. What you could do is a marathon upgrade.</p>
<p>Windows XP Home to Windows Vista Home Basic or Premium (intermediate) &gt; then to Windows 7 Home Home Premium or Ultimate.</p>

    <title>How is it a 10 year old copy of 2K still has better play by play&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How is it a 10 year old copy of 2K still has better play by play&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>How is it possible that 2K football from the Dreamcast can have play by play that is still better than what Madden and EA can put out? While playing 2K the announcers call the play as it's happening in real time and they call what is "actually" happening
 on the screen. Yes there is some repeat in the color commentary but for the most part its refreshing, interesting and sometimes actually funny because it was ment to be funny, not funny bad, like EA announcers. We as a consumer have lost so much by EA taking
 over the NFL license. I leave the audio on during my game but the problem is that while playing Madden I just ignore it since it's just all so wrong. I liked Madden audio better when it was just John Madden screaming "Boom!" every couple of minutes, cause
 at least most times it fit. Just a shame EA has done this to a game like football. What's worse is the people who are looking forwards to Battlefield 3. EA will *** that up somehow.</p>

<p>I agree with you totally bigd7387. 2K5 was a great game. Have you checked how the cheerleaders look in Madden? They are horrible. You would think with the technology that they could at least look like a women. 2K5 cheerleaders are far better and that was
 back then. The quality is going downhill in Madden. To much time spent on the bells an whistle and not enough on the game play.</p>

<p>This is how it works. EA gives the madden studios probably about 60 hours of labor to complete each madden. All they have to do it recode the same commentary and animations and sprinkle a few here and there and they say it's $60 worth of entertainment. While
 it does have some entertainment value in it, I have never played a Madden game that I thought was worth full admission. All we can do is hope people will finally see what they are paying full price for, and just how much of that money they've spent on the
 same *** for the past 10 years. I just hope most people buy this game used at least.

<p>Dont care about play by play, or graphics, or presentation. All I want is gameplay and im tired of 3rd stirng 60 rated QBs lighting me up. I just want a game where ratings (other than speed) mean something.

<p>If you don't care about the presentation then play the NES. But for 60 bucks the presentation is not the only thing broken. The play by play would be a minor complaint if it wasn't for the fact that people who aren't on my team in real life show up during
 the coin flip, there also not on the roster. They are sitting on the bench during shots. Ok fine overlook that. Now the computer, after telling it not to in the options screen, keeps *** with my roster. I can't throw a pass without it falling short or going
 through a defender or being deflected and not caught in triple coverage. I can run for over 300 plus yards in the first half with 10 minute quarters and excelerated clock speed. The computer will randomly stick my punter in for my place kicker during regular
 season? It will use my Left Tackle for long snapper, even though the long snapper shows up in my roster and is selected to be used. I have to turn the names off because it gets depressing seeing Madden *** me the whole time. I normally never, never say crap
 about how bad a game is after I have bought it, I see it as my fault for doing it and move on. But I actually care about the NFL and I buy their products and go to the games. Is it really wrong to want to play a decent game of football? If anyone knows a way
 to make a company care about their product I would love to hear it. Because they don't need my 60 bucks and not buying a game is only hurting me because there are still to many people who are willing to just tollerate it. You don't care about the play by play
 or graphics or presentation but damn, the atmosphere is kinda what makes football, football. The gameplay is what makes football, football. If Madden had the gameplay, then I'm in but they don't. Me trading Madden 12 back isn't hurting anyone cause I've already
 made the mistake of giving EA my 60 bucks.</p>

<p>God 2k is gone get over it... I was one of those people who bought the 2k series over madden until it stopped and Guess what i got over it and like madden now... Oh and guess what 2k had a game like 2 years ago and it sucked called All pro football or something.
 Lets just say they get rid of the Exclusive right for the nfl do you honestly think 2k would actually put a good game out... Giving that they have the exclusive rights of baseball and those games suck compared to the show there "NFL" game can just be as bad(
 I would bet that it would if they ever made one but you all would be hailing it as the Sports GOTY )</p>

<p>The NBA 2K games are excellent but the MLB 2K games are garbage. Just because 2K makes great NBA games doesn't mean they will be able to make excellent NFL games. I loved NFL 2K5 and I want to see the exclusive deal end so we can have competition which will
 lead to better games but there is no guarantee that it will be excellent because of their NBA series or because they made a great game years ago.

<h3> albertobec  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disable Snipping Tool gesture</h2>
                    <p>This has been annoying me for years, hopefully someone can help. Snipping Tool launches whenever I edge swipe right on my touchpad. &nbsp;Currently I'm on 8.1 but this has been happening since 7 and on every laptop, both my Dell Latitude and Samsung Ativ Book
 had Synaptics touchpad whose gesture setting were ignored and currently on my Asus with Elantech touchpad also has settings and are being ignored. The problem isn't so much that I'm losing the Charm bar gesture, it's that I'll be doing something then, boom,
 Snipping Tool launches because I overshot the edge and now I have to close it. Changing what the gesture does nor disabling completely has ever worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PLEASE,PLEASE, PLEASE someone deliver me from my suffering. I've already lost collective days researching this.<br />

<p><span>Hi Guys,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To rename a contact on Skype for Windows 10 (Preview).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Sign in to Skype for Windows 10.</span></li><li><span>In your contact list, right-click the contact and select<strong> View Profile</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click on their name, type a new name for your contact and hit
<strong>Enter</strong>.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To remove a contact from your contact list:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Sign in to Skype for Windows 10.</span></li><li><span>In your contact list, find the contact you want to remove. Right-click the contact name and select<strong> Remove from Contacts</strong>.</span></li><li><span>The contact is removed from your contact list but will still appear in the<strong> Recent</strong> tab with a question mark. Right-click the contact name to see the options:
<strong>Add to Contacts</strong> or <strong>Block This Person</strong>.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, there’s no option to remove a specific contact on the local address book using Skype if it’s still not added on your contact list. I suggest you remove it on the address book and not on Skype or just
 add a contact manually on Skype. Also, if you are using the Address book. Skype will check your address book and automatically add people you know to your contact list. If it’s already added on your Skype then you can remove them or rename them on your contact
 list.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To check on the settings for the local address book: On
<strong>Skype for Windows 10</strong>: Select <strong>Settings</strong> (gear icon).&nbsp;Under
<strong>Contacts</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>This would be really helpful if it worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't, by the way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can right-click on entries in my local address book until the cows come home but it doesn't actually DO anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, how do I access my local address book? Where is it? Where does Skype get it from? What actual database is Skype interrogating to find these entries? In my case, they were carried over from a previous version of Skype. I'd entered them all in manually,
 so they haven't been synched from some other data source that I can access through any other application that I know of.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You've really turned what used to be a fairly user-friendly interface into a bloody nightmare. If that was your aim, well done. You've succeeded beyond all expectations.</p>

<p>This is idiotic beyond any wild expectations: we do not want to remove contacts from our device contact list nor from Skype address book, we do want to remove ghost contacts from Skype address book that no more figure into device contact list.</p>
<p>Just cut the crap out, will you?</p>

            Can I add my voice to the chorus of frustration. Skype displays a "local Address Book" containing out of date contacts and people I no longer have anything to do with. Right clicking provides no option to delete them. Settings provides no means to unlink
 this address book.&nbsp; These contacts are not in my Google, Outlook or Facebook or any other active account I can think of.&nbsp; The question we are all asking is quite simple - how to get rid of these annying out of date entries.&nbsp; Please?

<p>There may be some light at the end of the tunnel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was messing around in Skype the other day and I double-clicked on one of my local address book entries. Lo and behold! There is now an option to delete the entry!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to go and have a cup of tea and lie down for a couple of minutes to deal with my astonishment.</p>

<p>Hi, I have a similar problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Skype 'Local Address Book' is loaded with hundreds of contacts I don't want to see there. After some investigation, I realize they're from another and separate google account I use. However, I never linked this account to Skype and I've never used it
 for personal contacts on any device. Therefore, I don't know how Skype managed to connect to this google contact list and I want the connection and contacts removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do we disconnect contact lists with Google, etc. from Skype?? At some point I did I see an option to 'manage address books' but it never worked and now I can't find it. I think it was somewhere on the web version...</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, I'm using the Windows 10 app version 11.19.856.0.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help. Thanks</p>

<p>There is no gear or settings in Skype (Windows 10 pro, surface book, office 365) utterly hopeless now.&nbsp; Somewhere has a person on what it calls "local address book" but cannot find it, have deleted from all other contacts in outlook.</p>
<p>It appears that skype is really messing up linked contacts in windows phone as well.&nbsp; It keeps linking skype people with someone totally different (if you delink it still recommends the link of the skype contact from the totally different person).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is an embarrassing mess, people are showing up with the wrong names and can cause financially damaging results if sending to the wrong people by accident.</p>

            Hi Robyn.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />This is the easiest way:  <a href="https://www.techwalla.com/articles/how-to-add-music-to-a-photo-slideshow-in-windows-media-player" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.techwalla.com/articles/how-to-add-m...</a>
<br />
<br />However since Windows Movie Maker is no longer supported it might take freeware like this to try:  <a href="https://www.iskysoft.com/slideshow-maker/make-a-slideshow-with-music-on-windows-10.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.iskysoft.com/slideshow-maker/make-a...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use Powerpoint:  <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Play-music-for-the-duration-of-your-slide-show-b01ded6a-28c8-473a-971a-6dfa92cc9367" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Play-m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

 or calendar.&nbsp;This is defeating the purpose of a client management system! Also, when something comes up on reader, it won't let me save it!</p>

            <p>Hi Susan,</p>
<p>I've just moved to W8 and faced the same problem;&nbsp; I couldn't assign the same CATEGORIES I have in gmail to contacts/appointments in W8.&nbsp; If that's your issue, let me explain how I managed through.</p>
<p>
</p><p>CONTEXT</p>
<p>&nbsp; - W8 does not provide an icon in ribbon (or menu) area to assign categories (ie: previously created for TASKs).</p>
<p>&nbsp; - W8 allows you to customize ribbon area and add CATEGORIES menu, but then appears "disabled".</p>
<p>
</p><p>W8 still maintains the CATEGORY field in its data structure. This said, if you "FEED" the information W8 will handle it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>STEPS</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Create a list of the CATEGORIES needed.&nbsp; Name the first one like ".ASSING CATEGORY"&nbsp; and assign to it the "CTRL+F2" shortkey.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp;Create a new APPOINTMENT or CONTACT</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp;While editing it, press CTRL+F2.&nbsp; Your Appointment will now be categorized like ".ASSIGN CATEGORY".</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp; By double-clicking on the category, the CATEGORY list will be displayed and you'll be able to select one/more categories as wished.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5.&nbsp; When SAVE+CLOSE is applied, your Calendar gets "colorfully" updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it solves your problem.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Enjoy it.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>That means that the Wireless adapter cannot connect and obtain info from the Router.</p>
<p>Ask whoever can connect to the Router to connect to the Router's menus and make sure that the MAC filter is Not On, and that there is enough IPs in the DHCP Range.</p>
<p>If the above is OK and it does not connect, then temporarily disable the Router's security and try to connect when it is open.</p>
<p>If it does connect with No security then redo the security with new password.</p>
<p>Make sure that whatever security is used it is compatible with your Computer’s Wireless.</p>
<p><strong>Wireless in general.</strong></p>
<p>Most Laptops have a physical switch for the Wireless card. Read the computer's manual and make sure that the Wireless card is On.</p>
<p>Check the Device Manager for valid Wireless card entry.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_dm.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_dm.jpg</a></p>
<p>If there is No valid entry, delete any Bogus Entry, and re-install the Wireless card's Drivers.</p>
<p>Check the Network connections to make sure that you have a Wireless Network Connection Icon/Entry, and that the Properties of the Icon (right click on the Icon) are correctly configured with TCP/IPv4 protocol in the Network Connections Properties.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_connection_tcp.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_connection_tcp.jpg</a><br />
<br />
<strong>Make sure that if there is a vendor's Wireless Utility the utility is Not Running together with the Windows native Wireless utility.</strong></p>
<p>Make sure that No Firewall is preventing/blocking the Wireless components to get to the Network.</p>
<p>If everything above is OK and it is not connecting to the Wireless router. Log from any computer that is, or can be connected to Wireless Router with a Wire, disable the Wireless Security, make sure that the Wireless broadcast is On, and try to connect with
 No Wireless security.</p>
<p><strong>When working turn On the Wireless security.</strong></p>
<p>Note* People sometimes make mistakes in writing and retyping the security passphrase.</p>
<p>Alternative way is to copy it from the Router's menu, and then paste when asked by the Wireless card.</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>I really checked and configured every thing and it does Not work.</strong></p>
<p>Software Firewall application that is Not configured to allow local traffic (between the computer and the Router is a possible issue too.<br />
some 3rd party Software Firewalls keep blocking aspects of Local Traffic even it they are turned Off (disabled). If possible configure the Firewall correctly, or totally uninstall it to allow clean flow of local network traffic. If the 3rd party software is
 uninstalled or disables, make sure that Windows native Firewall is <strong>On </strong>

    <title>How do I stop Windows Messenger from starting automatically - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bobrichmondhill  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I stop Windows Messenger from starting automatically</h2>
                    I have <strong>never</strong> used Windows Messenger.&nbsp; I recently purchased / set up a refurbished system with XP Home - after about a month of using it, Messenger started popping up automatically whenever I start the machine, and/or when I open Outlook
 Express (and immediately demands a signon screen name <strong>(every time it starts, even though I gave it one time to satisfy it),</strong> so I have
<strong>two</strong> things to cancel).<br />
<br />
As I say, it started doing this by itself with no knowing action on my part, some weeks after setting up the machine. I had an older XP machine for 6+ years and never saw this happen.<br />
<br />
Two questions: 1) is it normal behaviour to demand a screen name <strong>EVERY</strong> time it starts? I would have thought it would save one associated with the login.<br />
<br />
2) How do I make it stop opening automatically? I don't necessarily want to permanently kill it - I may actually try to use it someday. I just want it to quietly lurk in the system tray as it has always done before.

            <p>Hello sheridan chaos,</p><p><br /></p><p>We see multiple Credit and deposit events for your MyVIP&nbsp;payback dating back to when you got your first star in November, and every month since.&nbsp;</p><p>You can see a complete history of your Credit and deposit events from the MyStatement on the MyRewards page. You can then use the dates listed for your deposits to see their deposit as currency from your commerce page at (<a href="https://commerce.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://commerce.microsoft.com/</a>), where they will be listed as a refund with a negative amount. Also, regarding payback for MyVIP eligible purchases this month, from the FAQ:</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>
<p><b>When will my MyVIP Rewards Credits be deposited into my Microsoft account?</b>
  </p>
<p>The total Rewards earned will be calculated at the end of each month. Typically you'll receive your MyVIP earnings in your account by the 15th of the following month, though this is subject to the program's current deposit <a href="https://rewards.xbox.com/terms-and-conditions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">terms</a>. Be sure to keep an eye on MyStatement on the <a href="https://rewards.xbox.com/myrewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">MyRewards</a> page to track your progress and watch your Rewards Credits total grow!

<h3> jaymarti  say:</h3>
<h2>            Monitor loses color</h2>
                    
<p>In the last couple of months I've been losing the color on my monitor. I can restore it by restoring the system to a point prior to the last automatic Windows update. The only siginificant addition to my system was Photoshop CS4, athough the loss of color
 is not associted with having used it. The only device I've been using consistently during that time is my HP G3010 scanner.<br />
Thank you all<br />

            Hi JayMarti,<br />
<br />
Did you try updating your display with the most recent drivers from your computer manufacturer?
<br />
<br />
If not, I would suggest you to manually update your driver.<br />
<br />
<strong>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly </strong><br />

</a><br />
<br />
I would also suggest you to contact your Computer Manufacturer.<br />
<br />
This should do it.<br />

<p>I have a good bit of software on my computer so I think it may have something to do with one of the installations.</p>
<p>All installations were done a good while before the problem revealed itself and there does not seem to be a way of tracing it down.</p>

<p>68 dollars extra for a 5inch cabinet, a comic book and digital content seems a little much, unless your a extreme streetfigher/ tekken fan, the cabinet would look good displayed on dvd/game shelf though.</p>

<p>Yoshinori Ono has said that SF x Tekken will follow the SSFIV: AE formula. Any updates or expansions will be available as DLC, and possibly a new retail release coupled with the new updates and expansions (i.e. Arcade Edition).</p>

<p>Also 4-6 months is an exaggeration. MvC3 to UMvC3 was the shortest at 9 months. SF4 to SSF4 was over a year. SSF4 to SSF4 AE was over a year. Its no different then EA, Activision, or Ubisoft releasing the same game every year.</p>

<p>Hi Kilroy,<br />
<br />
There sure is a quick and easy way to do this. <br />
<br />
Navigate to the Dashboard, and at the very top left you will see your Gamerpic. Select that, and then select "Add Guest", and that should do it! &nbsp;<br />
<br />

<p>I tried add guest, then the account has my name with a(1),and &nbsp;my picture.</p>
<p>But when starting a game then the guest account uses my score and overwrites it. Thats not what we are looking for!</p>

<p>I have the same question. &nbsp;On the Xbox 360 you could create accounts there were not tied to Xbox live. &nbsp;This allowed my guests to have their own avatars and play games with their own local profiles.
</p>
<p>How do you do this on the Xbox One? &nbsp;Think of friends of my children who do not have email or Xbox live accounts.</p>

<p>Seriously, I'm totally bewildered by this. &nbsp;For example, Wolfenstein won't let me start a new game without overwriting my current stuff. &nbsp;But there is no way to make another local account that I can find. &nbsp;How am I going to play 4-player games with my young
 niece and nephew? &nbsp;This is ridiculous!</p>

<p>Any updates to this? I have a friend that wants to come over and play Titanfall, but he's already stolen achievements and campaign play that I can't go back and repeat because I let him do it once thinking "What harm could he do?"</p>
<p>There needs to be a new system for this. What is that (1) and (2) and more? That's my gamertag. Why can't I create a generic account "Guest" and let him play it independent of my own account?</p>

 i'm an adult?!? what a joke..</p>
<p>This is such a huge step back from the 360 it isnt even funny..</p>
<p>I'm seriously considering selling my xbox one and moving on to ps4.. </p>

            This is all linked some services are not working correctly.&nbsp; All I can suggest is to unplug your router and do a full power cycle of your Xbox once the router has restarted, make sure UPNP is enabled on your router and you should see your NAT open.

<p>Your NAT type is your network address translation, or how well your xbox is using your network to connect to our services.

<h2>            Windows 10 Wifi not Connecting</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently moved into a house that utilizes AT&amp;T Uverse for WiFi. However, my laptop won't connect to it. It registers the connection, then prompts the network password. However, it then it simply goes to the dots moving laterally connection view, then simply
 closes the WiFi screen and says can't connect to network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that the WiFi works because there are several devices connected to it, including a different computer running Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the things I've tried:</p>
<p>Restarting router&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unplugging and replugging the router</p>
<p>Changing the Wireless Adapter Settings to Maximum Performance&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clearing the WINSOCK entries</p>
<p>Clearing the IPv</p>
<p>Clearing the IPv</p>
<div>
<p>All drivers are up to date</p>
<p>There are no outstanding updates</p>
<p>Ran the System File Checker Tool and it returned with nothing wrong</p>

</p><p>I was also directed to and looked at the following URLs, but nothing on either site helped.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue is caused due to driver and BISO outdated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We would suggest you to visit the computer manufacturer website and try to install any drivers for Windows 10 and also check for latest BIOS&nbsp; and update it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might also try to uninstall the current Wi-Fi driver, by uninstalling it using device manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To know more about uninstalling device using device manager, refer to the below link:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff553572%28v=vs.85%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff553572%28v=vs.85%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once&nbsp; the driver is uninstalled, reboot the computer, so Windows will load the box drivers and then check the status.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
