<p>Hi marktoole,<br />
<br />
<br />
There could be a number of factors as to why you are having issues playing .avi file in Windows 10. It could be caused by corrupted system file or an issue with the file itself.<br />
<br />
I would like to know more about your concern. Kindly answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you experiencing this issue only when playing the .avi files?<br />
</li><li>Have you tried playing another video file? If so, are you encountering the same issue?<br />
</li><li>Have you tried playing the .avi file on another video player application?<br />
</li><li>What is the exact error message that you are getting when playing the .avi file?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 sticks on boot with usb dongle plugged in.</h2>
                    <p>I have a friend's HP Omni 120-1133w that was upgraded from windows 7.&nbsp; I switched the disk partitioning from MBR to GPT because she was complaining about updates failing because it wasn't GPT.
<br />
<br />
After that, I wasn't able to boot up with the USB dongle for the keyboard and mouse plugged in. It comes right up once I remove it. Once it's booted, I can insert the dongle and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. When it doesn't, device manager shows
 the keyboard and mouse are find but many of the HID devices show a problem, Compliant consumer control, compliant system controller, and 5 compliant vendor-defined devices. I also can't update drivers because it says there are none and I can't uninstall the
 devices. It just sticks on uninstalling and doesn't let me do anything else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to use msconfig to safemode boot, I either get a missing winload.efi
<span style="color: rgba(20, 20, 20, 1)">Error code: 0xc0000225&nbsp;</span>with the option to press f8 or f9 which neither work or at one time it came up to a black screen.&nbsp; I was only able to get past the black screen by deleting the partition and
 restoring a backup I made before starting. Either with the error or the black screen, I had to run bootrec /rebuild.
<br />
<br />
After I restored the backup, it booting up fine with the USB dongle at least 20 times and I thought I had it fixed but when I was putting it away so she could come get it, I booted one more time and the problem was back. It hadn't run for several days from
 the time it worked till now. Now it consistently fails. It hasn't updated or anything because it's not connected to the internet.<br />
</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 printer driver HP laserjet 5m</h2>
                    I have a new Windows 7 home premium computer.&nbsp; I am trying to install an HP laserjet 5m network printer.&nbsp; After install printer and selecting the tcp/ip port there is no printer driver listed.&nbsp; The windows update button says it is searching, then comes
 back, "Windows was unable to get a list of devices from windows update.&nbsp; Please try again later."&nbsp; This has happened for several days now.&nbsp; Windows update runs fine and all updates have installed.&nbsp; I tried Windows Fix it.&nbsp; I installed the printer on a windows
 7 starter net book today with no problems.&nbsp; For some reason I do not seem to be able to get the additional drivers from windows update.&nbsp; I have tried generic drivers but the results are unacceptable.

            <p>Hi Henry,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Have you made any changes to your computer recently?</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; What happens when you try to boot your computer in normal mode?</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; When are you getting this error code?</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Do you receive any error message along with the error code?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The error code meaning depends on when you are getting the error code. I would suggest you to follow the steps and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: </strong>Perform a clean boot and then check if it helps.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure that you perform “step 7” in the link mentioned above to boot your computer normally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: </strong>Run System File Check (SFC) scans in safe mode and checks if it helps.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> System File Checker gives an administrator the ability to scan all protected files to verify their versions. If System File Checker discovers that a protected file has been overwritten, it retrieves the correct version of the file
 from the cache folder (%Systemroot%\System32\Dllcache) or the Windows installation source files, and then replaces the incorrect file. System File Checker also checks and repopulates the cache folder. You must be logged on as an administrator or as a member
 of the Administrators group to run System File Checker. If the cache folder becomes damaged or unusable, you can use the
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong>, the <strong>sfc /scanonce</strong>, or the <strong>
sfc /scanboot</strong> commands to repair its contents.</p>

<h2>            itunes</h2>
                    keep trying to install&nbsp; itunes , but every time i keep getting , a message that supposedly :<br />
<br />
the installation package could not be open please verify&nbsp; that the package exist and that you can access or contact the application vendor to verify that this is a valid windows installer.
<br />
<br />
I have tried the following things to get it installed:<br />
<br />
1.Uninstalled itunes and quicktime and redownloded it from the apple site (saving the file to my desktop)<br />
2. Installed the Windows intall clean-up and removed all things related to apple.<br />
3.Manually deleted all apple files.<br />
4.Windows system restore.<br />
5. Turned off the DEP.<br />
6.Turning off my virus scanner using MISCONFIG(this was an apple tech solution).<br />
7. emptied my Temp folder.<br />
8.Insalled older versions of itunes.<br />
9. Installed Quicktime by it's self.<br />
10. Tried to run the itunes setup exe in the Windoows compatibily mode for Windows XP (service Pack 2)<br />
<br />
I have run out of idea on how to get itunes on my computer. I have spent over an hour on the phone (long distance) with an apple tech and nothing works. I am totally fed up with all this i have spent hours and countless solutions and nothing works. I hope someone
 out there can help me. My next attempt to get itunes on my computer is going to be a reformat but i really would rather not do that. please help me out
<br />

            Hello shexshay,<br />
<br />
So, you are running Windows XP w/SP2, correct? Please double check to make sure you're not trying to install the 32-bit on a 64-bit OS (or the other way around too). Version 9.01 is the most current version of iTunes for Windows XP or Vista.<br />
<br />
If you're running Windows 7 Beta or RC, please note that a Win 7 compatible version of iTunes is not yet available, nor is installing iTunes under the Win 7 XP compatibility mode an officially acceptable method (to my knowledge at least).<br />
<br />
To ensure you have the most recent version of Apples iTunes, please visit this link:<br />
http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/<br />
<br />
You might also want to double check to make sure all of your hardware and device drivers are up to date too.<br />
<br />
Eric

<h2>            driver for Maxtor One Touch III</h2>
                    I am using a HP IQ528d touchsmart desktop computer running on a 64-bit processor. I tried to get my Maxtor One Touch III working but my computer could not detect it. Message is cannot find driver. I&nbsp;went into Maxtor website and download driver OTC_EMC_Vista_Update[1]
 but my computer still could not work. Is the problem due to the fact that the driver will only work on a 32-bit machine? If not, which is the right driver to use? Where to find it?

            Hi roger low,<br />
<br />
Thank you for using the Answers Forum.<br />
<br />
I have researched the issue and found that Maxtor One Touch III may not be compatible with 64-bit version of Vista.
<br />
If you have contacted the OEM and they can't provide you with a driver, it may not work.<br />
<br />
Let us know how this works out.

                    <p>Whilst performing a shutdown on my HP notebook I was presented with 2 options...</p>
<p>1. To update and Shutdown and 2. To update and Restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I selected option 2. The update took about 3 hours to complete often stopping at various points for long periods with no obvious update activity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was finally presented with the Login prompt screen, however after entering my password, it never completes the loading process and all I get is just a blank screen, not my usual desktop screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I only have a single account (Admin) set up on my notebook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I tried but can't login in Safe mode but can't do so either.<br />
I have also tried running a chkdsk, but no errors reported.</p>
<p>Also ran a system restore successfully but still cannot login.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How to I copy my files onto usb just in case there isn't an easy solution ?</p>
<p>(I tried going into a Command shell, but the usb drive isn't recognized)</p>

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Here are steps to recover from failed Updates or Version Update install which causes Windows to fail to start: 
<br />
<br />1) Try whichever method works here to get into Advanced Startup Options to run System Restore if this is a Windows Update, or Go Back to Old Version if this is a version update.  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>
<br />
<br />If you are able to access System Restore or Go Back and it fails, skip to step 3.
<br />
<br />2) If necessary create bootable installation media to access the repair options if  not accessible by any other method:   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Boot media by powering up the PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />You may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup to turn off Fast Boot if it won't allow the Boot Menu key to interrupt starting Windows:  <a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose UEFI version of media if offered, browse to second screen to Repair Your Computer link, then Advanced Troubleshoot options to run System Restore to a point before the problem began, or choose More Options to Go Back to Old Version if this was a version Update.
<br />
<br />If it rolls back then you can hide the Windows Updates and Version Upgrade responsible until they mature by installing and running immediately the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br /> 
<br />3) If this fails try a Startup Repair, or go back to Troubleshoot Options on the previous screen to Reset your PC which will save your files while reinstalling Windows. 
<br />
<br />4) If that fails you can use the booted media to do the Clean Install the latest version which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>  This link compiles the best possible install of Windows 10 that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given.  
<br /> 
<br />Once you're back in Windows 10, you can block the problem Windows or Version Update using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />At any time you can rescue your files (which should always be backed up if you value them at all) using the booted media and following this method:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

            Hi Maskitoe,
<br />
<br />Start PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down
<br />
<br />Do this twice
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc.
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . .
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing
<br />Then start the Reset       
        </p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            If the problem is after login disappear it may be that Windows is finishing the update (I too received a black screen but with a rectangle in the top left corner with various update progression - the longest was windows desktop update). Leave things for 10-20 minutes to see if the desktop appears, if not go to the next step.
<br />If you can log in via safe mode the solution is to turn off use sign-in info to auto finish setting up device after update or restart in Windows 10.
<br />For Windows 10 (Version 1709), select the Start  button, select Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Sign-in options, then make sure Use my sign in info to automatically finish setting up my device after an update or restart is turned off.
<br />For previous versions of Windows 10, select the Start  button, select Settings  &gt; Update &amp; security  &gt; Window Update  &gt; Advanced options, then select the check box next to Use my sign in info to automatically finish setting up my device after an update.
<br />Another potential solution is to remove any USB devices (wireless mouse, keyboard, external hard drive/s) &amp; wait to see if boot continues, if not then to restart with devices still disconnected (if possible).

<p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apologies for the late reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried a number of the options you suggested but a system restore wouldn't work.</p>
<p>In the end I had to create a bootable media and do a system repair.</p>
<p>I reinstalled all the Apps that were removed by the system repair. </p>
<p>My data was untouched which was great!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks very much for your suggestions.</p>

</p><blockquote>If the problem is after login disappear it may be that Windows is finishing the update (I too received a black screen but with a rectangle in the top left corner with various update progression - the longest
 was windows desktop update). Leave things for 10-20 minutes to see if the desktop appears, if not go to the next step.
<br />
If you can log in via safe mode the solution is to turn off use sign-in info to auto finish setting up device after update or restart in Windows 10.
<br />
For Windows 10 (Version 1709), select the Start button, select Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Sign-in options, then make sure Use my sign in info to automatically finish setting up my device after an update or restart is turned off.
<br />
For previous versions of Windows 10, select the Start button, select Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Window Update &gt; Advanced options, then select the check box next to Use my sign in info to automatically finish setting up my device after an update.
<br />
Another potential solution is to remove any USB devices (wireless mouse, keyboard, external hard drive/s) &amp; wait to see if boot continues, if not then to restart with devices still disconnected (if possible).

<br />
Start PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down
<br />
<br />
Do this twice <br />
<br />
On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc.
<br />
<br />
Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . <br />
<br />
Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair <br />
See if Windows startup can repair itself <br />
<br />
Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore <br />
Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to <br />
<br />
If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart
<br />
Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode <br />
Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup <br />
Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date <br />
Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally <br />
<br />
If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC <br />
Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing <br />
Then start the Reset </blockquote>

<p>None of the solutions below FIXES the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>They just let you access your computer by reverting back to your PRE-update state.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does that mean you can never update your Windows 10?&nbsp; Seems so!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried adding 3 other login methods including picture, PIN, and Facial Recognition.. all fail after the update.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried turning the login password OFF.. and that didn't work either!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I paid a fortune for this 32 gig, touchscreen laptop with 4 TB drives and two cameras.. with Windows 10 factory installed.. and I can't update the software?&nbsp; That is insane and unacceptable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As always, Microsoft doesn't acknowledge the problem, nor do they fix the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder how many businesses have clicked on "restart and update".. lost everything on their computer.. and gone out of business?</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Ethernet option missing &#40;Realtek PCIe GBE Family - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikrometric  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Ethernet option missing &#40;Realtek PCIe GBE Family Controller&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have an issue with my desktop pc after moving from a BT hub2 to a hub5 ready for fibre broadband.</p>
<p>I now do not get the ethernet or wi-fi option in the network screens.</p>
<p>Device Manager sees both ethernet adapter and wi-fi devices (BT/Broadcom dual-band wi-fi dongle), drivers have been updated, devices uninstalled, shutdown, restarted etc. Device Manager says they are working properly.</p>
<p>On installing the latest Realtek driver, 10.6.1001.2015, the installation program reports the device not found.</p>
<p>Seems to be a communication problem between Win10 and the network devices.</p>
<p>Other wireless devices, ie laptop and tablet, are working fine through the new hub. &nbsp;The Samsung laptop also connects using ethernet cable and has the same Realtek controller and runs Win10.</p>
<p>I have spent some time talking with BT and Microsoft techs to resolve this issue, without success.</p>
<p>Help please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mike</p>

            <p>Thanks for reply, Arul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which compatibility mode do I select. &nbsp;Tab displays Win 95 through Win 8. &nbsp;Have tried uninstalling and re-installing with 7 &amp; 8 modes, also with older Win 10 driver but still not recognising network controller. &nbsp;As before Device Manager shows device present
 and correct.</p>
<p>Prior to "upgrade" to Win 10, this machine was running Win 7. &nbsp;Not had a problem with connection since upgrade until Tues 17th Nov.</p>
<p>I see a lot of other threads with similar problems with this controller and Win 10. &nbsp;Of course I have not been able to install the latest Win 10 update due to no internet!</p>
<p>Where next?</p>
<p>

    <title>Unresponsive volume and start button - Surface Pro - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cw_sour  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unresponsive volume and start button - Surface Pro</h2>
                    <p>I've owned my Surface Pro for less than 48 hours and I've noticed twice that the hardware volume and start button are unresponsive for a short period of time after powering on.&nbsp; The first time was very brief or I didn't acknowledge that the issue was occurring.&nbsp;
 The second time was during my commute this morning.&nbsp; You can feel the vibration as you touch the start, yet nothing happens.&nbsp; I pressed start at least 30 times, yet you feel the vibration but nothing happens.&nbsp; I attempted to take a screen shot afterwards (Start
 + Vol Down) and nothing happened.&nbsp; Then I tried to see if the on-screen volume would display using the hardware volume controls and still nothing.&nbsp; After about two minutes, they started to work again.&nbsp; As I type this, pressing the power button to sleep and
 wake doesn't recreate the situation. I do remember seeing the Surface logo this morning, so it may be after a complete boot after sleeping.&nbsp; I haven't seen a similar situation like this posted on the web, so I guess it's either something no one has really
 noticed yet or I have a&nbsp;bootleg Surface Pro.&nbsp; This never happened when I had the Surface RT since December.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

                    So I was getting a black screen after the green log-in screen so I did a power cycle and now my Xbox is starting up in safe mode every time. I turn it off and turn it back on and it's still in safe mode. How do I get it to go back to the regular mode?

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Click on Start menu and click on Run. <br />
Inside the Run type <b>MSCONFIG </b>and press on Ok. <br />
Now you will get a <b>System Configuration</b> Window. <br />
Inside that one go to the Tab called <b>Start Up</b><br />
In the Start Up tab you can see a list of file loading when you start the computer.<br />
<br />
Over there you can see the above file <b>Rundll32,"C:\Document and Setting\user_name\Application Data\wlaplg.dll "</b> Like this.
<br />
<br />
<b>Un chech </b>that one and press on <b>Apply </b>and press on <b>Ok</b>. <br />
Now it will ask you to restart the computer. <br />
<br />
<br />
After a restart the issue will be fixed...........<br />

    <title>My Windows folder is 24GB in size, why&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rwb181  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Windows folder is 24GB in size, why&#63;</h2>
                    Hello,
<p>I am having some problems with one of my computers and I am looking for some help.</p>
<p>I have 2 computers that are almost identical, they are both Dell Dimension 2400’s running Windows XP Home Addition. The main difference between the 2 is that one has a 40GB hard drive w/ 1GB Ram while the other has a 80GB hard drive w/ 768MB Ram. For the
 most part, they both have the same programs installed on them and I don’t think the slight differences can account for the problem that I am having.</p>
<p>Here is the problem; In Windows Explorer, the size of the “WINDOWS” folder on one computer is 2.42GB yet; the size of the same “WINDOWS” folder on the other computer is 24.0GB (almost 10 times as big). Being that the one that is extremely oversized is on
 the computer that only has a 40GB hard drive, you can see that it does not leave very much room on the hard drive for anything else and I am sure that that is what is causing said computer to run extremely slow when asked to do anything.</p>
<p>I am not sure what is causing this but I have found some folders inside the “WINDOWS” folder on one computer that is not on the other. For starters, I had over 300 folders (yes, that was 300) with folder names that were “$NtUninstallKBXXXXXX$” where the
 “XXXXXX” is a six digit number (Ex. 951978). The folders had “Last Modified Dates” that extended all the way back to 2004 (around the time I bought the computer) up to the present time. I deleted all of them (saw no adverse affects) and freed up better than
 1GB of space but I now see that I am having new ones being created every time I connect to the Internet.</p>
<p>The other computer has no such folders like this and it is plain to see that there must be other unnecessary files or folders that account for the extra 20+GB of space being used up.</p>
<p>So, my question to you is how can I go about eliminating all unneeded files and folders in the oversized<span>&nbsp;
</span>“WINDOWS” folder so that I can free up more space without damaging any of the programs that are installed? And, what settings need to be changed so that this doesn’t continue in the future? Also, is it possible to put “WINDOWS” back to its original configuration
 when it wasn’t using up so much space?</p>
<p>I guess it all boils down to the main question of “What should I do to solve this problem?” Any help will be greatly appreciated and if you need any details not provided, please let me know and I will get them to you as soon as I can.</p>
<span>Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.</span>

<p>“$NtUninstallKBXXXXXX$” are uninstall files. You will not see any adverse effects until you decide to uninstall a program and receive the error message no uninstall file exits. Never just start deleting files or folders unless you are absolutely sure what
 you are deleting. This was a huge mistake. I hope you can recover them from the recycle bin. If not, you can try system restore. Unless they were windows files, however, it will not restore them. My suggestion to you is to download, update and choose a quick
 scan with Malwarebytes. At the conclusion of the scan a log file will be created. Copy and paste the log file in your reply.</p>

<p>Hi Joel,</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply. I am not too worried about not being able to uninstall anything on the computer because (over the years) I have already uninstalled and deleted all that I could to try and free up disk space. There isn't anything left on the computer
 that I don't want to keep.</p>
<p>Being that I have 2 computers, practically identical, bought (new) around the same time, running the same OS and other software, can you explain why 1 had over 300 “$NtUninstallKBXXXXXX$” folders and the other had zero? I figured if one could run without
 them, the other should too. So far, no problems.</p>
<p>I downloaded the program you suggested and ran a scan. The log file is below and what infections where found have been corrected. I honestly don't see how this will solve my problem, but I am willing to try anything. If one of the infections were causing
 the excessive file size of the Windows folder, how is removing it going to delete all those unneeded files? It might stop adding more but I don't see it getting rid of the ones it already created.</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for your help. I know I have a lot to learn in this field and I hope your response to this will allow me to get a little closer to that goal.</p>
<p>Ron</p>

<p>First, thanks for visiting my website. The website is not at all a part of MS Answers. the voting is done here on this site. I charge a fee on my site to do what I do here for free. The difference is the amount of time it takes to accomplish the task and,
 of course, on the site I do the work myself as opposed to giving instructions. Some are just not comfortable performing the necessary steps which is completely understandable. Time is also a factor for many since their computer is their livelihood they need
 it up and running fast with no time to wait a day or two for a reply on a forum such as this. I gotta say, however, the peeps who answer here are pretty efficient and very knowledgeable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As to your computer, click on the link below and download JDiskReport. Run it and locate the files/folders which are using the most space. These very well could be offline files. We will know more when you analyze the disk space.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jgoodies.com/freeware/jdiskreport/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.jgoodies.com/freeware/jdiskreport/index.html</a></p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Joel</p>
<p>Edit: Note that you can specify the Windows folder making it the only folder to be analyzed. You will then know for certain what is using all the space. The program is very informative for issues such as this. Also, I wanted to ask you if the computer has
 a recovery option and, if so, have you ever used it?</p>

<p>I have used the "System Restore" function in the past (quite a while since the last time). To be honest, I have had problems with this one computer since it first came out of the box. And none with the other.</p>
<p>After running the Disk Report, it appears that the Windows folder is 24.2GB (62.7% of total space) and 19.8GB of that are ".msp" files located in the "Installer" folder. Below is a list of the most recent ones added to the computer. By the times and dates,
 I can see that these files are being added to my computer whenever I am connected to the Internet (I have dial up). Any ideas on what to do or what is going on inside this machine? If you need anything else, just let me know</p>

<p>Hello rwb181,</p>
<p>Some googling shows that the .msp files can be either this:</p>
<p>"the Windows Installer patch is a self-contained package that contains information regarding the specific versions of the application to which the patch is applicable, as well as information on the differences between the versions"</p>
<p>Or this:</p>
<p>"MSP file is a <strong>Monochromatic (black and white) image file</strong> created by Microsoft Paint. The MSP format is apparently being replaced by the more versatile Microsoft Windows BMP format."</p>
<p>Since it would be wacky for your computer to generate Installer patches four times a day and patch files of a such a regular size, I would be inclined to think they are Paint files instead.&nbsp; Since the files are generated only when you are on the internet,
 my suspicius side thinks that maybe a rogue program on your computer is taking screen shots and storing them here.&nbsp; Your malwarebytes run did find some malware on the computer, after all.</p>
<p>If you right click one of the .msp files and open it with MS Paint, and it comes up looking like a Black and White screen shot, you would have confirmed my suspicions.</p>
<p>If that is the case, then backup and offload your data from the computer, and use the recovery discs to blow away the current installation of Windows and put down a fresh format and installation.</p>
<p>By the way the other files "ntuninstall" are uninstallation files for Windows Updates.</p>

            Good instructions given by Dan. I am inclined to agree with his suspicions. This is especially true in light of the dates these files were created. As you can see, most were recent. As to reformatting, it is certainly a viable option. Or, in the alternative.
 you could simply delete the most recent files dating back to April 16th, then attempt to look for updates to your installed applications. Mostly you will be concerned with windows updates.

            Hi Dan and Joel,
<p>I did a search on .msp files also and discounted the Paint one because it was referring to an older file format and because of the location that the files were being stored at (the Windows/Installer folder) on my computer.</p>
<p>To view the .msp files in Windows Explorer, I had to go into Tools/Folder Options and uncheck the box next to “Hide Protected operating system files (Recommended)”. Inside the Installer folder is 1 folder named “$PatchCache$” with another folder inside it
 named “Managed” that is faded out when viewed.</p>
<p>Then there are about 50 folders with names like “{6B3CA80E-6AC0-4725-BABF-9B0FEF880CB3}”. Inside them are, for the most part, executable (.exe) files, .mst files, or .ico (icon?) files. Most have only 1 .mst file or a small group of .exe files. The .mst
 files appear to be from companies that I have software from (Eastman Kodak for my Easy Share Software, Hewlett-Packard for my printer, stuff like that). I also see a lot of InstallShield from InstallShield Software Corp.</p>
<p>The only other folders in the Installer folder are 1 named “BWKDLogs” (empty), “MSN Messenger 7.5.0311” (1 .msi file), and “tsclientmsitrans” (.mst files,.vbs files, a .dll file, and a .bat file).</p>
<p>Inside the rest of the Installer folder is a long list of .msp files that have “Windows Installer Patch” located under their names along with a smattering of .mst and .msi files mixed in. As I mentioned in the previous post, the .msp files occupy almost
 20GB of space.</p>
<p>Is it possible that Windows is trying to do some sort of update or upgrade that just isn’t getting done? It seems to keep on downloading Windows Installer Patch files every chance it gets and I am (almost) willing to bet that after a given period of time,
 the “$NtUninstall$” folders will start to appear again.</p>
<p>I hope this insight into my Windows folder has helped the two of you. If not, please let me know what you do need. I am grateful for your help, it is starting to look like this extremely long aged problem I have had with this computer might be near an end.</p>
<p>Ron</p>
<p>P.S. I forgot to mention that I did try to open one of the files with Paint and got this message “Paint cannot read this file. This is not a valid bitmap file, or its format is not currently supported.”</p>

<p>Hello rwb181,</p>
<p>Nice sleuthing work on the .msp files :-)</p>
<p>But it's still wacky that this one installation of Windows wants to generate that many .msp files.&nbsp; Generating such big files must bog down the system somewhat.&nbsp; Is there any other unusual computer behavior that you can think of that could be associated
 with a wacked-out Windows installer?</p>
<p>Based on what I have seen while searching on this issue, I don't have a good feeling about uncovering the magic solution.&nbsp; In the end it's likely that a repair reinstallation of XP using your Dell OS Reinstallation disc (or possibly winnt32.exe within the
 Dell \i386 folder if it is still on your HDD) will be the solution.&nbsp; A repair preserves your programs and data (but back up anyway!!) and replaces the existing Windows with a&nbsp;fresh installation of Windows, which will need to be updated of course.</p>
<p>Before you do that, wait till joelj1964 posts, he may have a better idea :-)</p>

<p>Hi again,</p>
<p>Here is some more information that might be helpful;</p>
<p>As far as the dates, I only listed the most recent. I should have mentioned that there are a total of 1,434 files in the Installer folder and that the vast majority (by a long shot) of them are exactly 18,760 KB in size (identical?) and that the dates on
 them go back as far as 12/02/07.</p>
<p>It would appear that something happened back then and this computer is still trying to finish it. I honestly can't remember what it could have been.</p>
<p>I am starting to think that the problem is in the Windows XP installation or, possibly, in the service pack updates that took my computer from 1 to 2 and then 3.</p>
<p>Hope this helped, let me know what you think I should do or what other diagnostics I can perform to isolate this problem.</p>
<p>Ron</p>
<p>Edit: Hi Dan,</p>
<p>Just read your latest post. Wacked out behavior? Come to mention it, yes.</p>
<p>The computer is always slow to react, sometimes, very slow. Another that is probably more helpful, if I go into the Control Panel and into Add or Remove Programs, I can't Add/Remove any Windows components. When I click on the option, I get this message "Setup
 Library ocgen.dll could not be loaded, or function OcEntry could not be found. The specific error code is 0x7e".</p>
<p>I forgot all about that problem, it has been a long while since I made the attempt.</p>
<p>Me thinks we are getting closer.</p>

<p>Sorry about breaking this up.</p>
<p>The only other problem I can think of is with my HP printer/scanner. I haven't used it for a long time but when I did, I would have problems getting the scanner part to initialize. Somehow a device driver was lost (I am sure it was my doing) and it keeps
 asking for it but, I can't provide it because I have lost the installation disk and could never find a copy of the driver it is asking for on the Internet. If I repeatedly click on the "Cancel" button, it eventually gives up asking and initializes the scanner
 anyway.</p>
<p>I am starting to think that it is a good thing that I am not too close to either one of you, I would probably get a good whack in the arm and be called "You Idiot".</p>

    <title>Slow internet speed after Windows 10 reinstal. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> janburgr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Slow internet speed after Windows 10 reinstal.</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I made a clean install on my new SSD. After install my internet speed is much slower than before (from 70 to 18Mb/s), but upload and ping is still same. No matter if Iam on ethernet or Wi-Fi still same speed. It seems like the speed of download is
 somehow locket at 17-19Mb/s which is like 30% of my network. All other devices on my network have normal internet speed. I have newest drivers and I also tryed to use some olders but with no result. Iam at 100% sure that it is software error and that that
 my hardware is working fine. I tryed a lot of basic tutorials but nothink hepled me. My PC: i7 7th gen; GTX 1050Ti; 8Gb RAM; SSD + SSHD. + I dont have any viruses, I also tryed to disable antivirus and firewall, but nothink made that speed higher.</p>
<p>Thank you for any help.</p>

<br />
<br />If that does not work and you have a desktop computer...
<br />
<br />Power down 
<br />Unplug it
<br />Open the system unit
<br />
<br />Remove the CMOS CR-2032 chip
<br />Plug it in, start the machine, wait 10 seconds
<br />
<br />Power down, unplug it, reinstall the CMOS CR-2032 chip
<br />Plug it in again, power up
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the command prompt, type: 
<br />
<br />netsh int ip reset
<br />
<br />Hit Enter 
<br />Exit the prompt then restart
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down
<br />Click Network adapters
<br />Click Run the Troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart to see if the problem is resolved.
<br />
<br />If that does not work
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Network Adapters 
<br />Select the Network card listed,
<br />Select “Update Driver”
<br />This should give you a choice of drivers - select the oldest one 
<br />Wait a few minutes while it installs the old driver
<br />
<br />or
<br />
<br />press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Network adapters
<br />
<br />Right click your adapter
<br />Click Uninstall
<br />
<br />
<br />Exit Device Manager, restart. Windows 10 should detect the network adapter then reinstall it. Check if you can connect and browse.
<br />
<br />also try:
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; Status
<br />
<br />

            Windows 10 will reinstall the driver, you are not deleting it. 
<br />
<br />You can also click Update driver and see if that works.

<p>Ok, I tryed everything (I only didnt remove that chip, because I have a laptop), but I fixed that I have at ethernet from 20mbps 60mbps and that is my normal speed, but Iam at 90% on wifi and wifi is still stucked at 20mbps. That connection is stable =&gt;
 nothink is being downloaded at background etc.... That means that I have some bad settings in Windows that is liminiting my speed at some %. I calculated it with real numbers and Iam getting 30% of my network speed.</p>
<p>Thank you for helping me.</p>

Hi , </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I installed Win DBG&nbsp; and NotMyFault,&nbsp; clicked the option to crash the PC, but it crashes and if I run Windows 8.1 again ,&nbsp; it crashes with BSOD.</p>
<p>Why??</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>EDIT 1 - When I select the option to crash the PC , it crashes with error DRIVER_IRQA_NOT_... and restarts.</p>
<p>Then , Automatic Repair launches for Windows 8.1 and says that it needs to restart.</p>
<p>After that , it crashes again with error 0xc000021a.</p>

 advise if you have any answers. I am at a dead end. I have a remote technical source in Cox Communications. When I call them and start to tell them the problem they stop me cold and tell me it is all a Windows 10 problem and the problem of the manufacturer.
 Getting a hold of someone at Microsoft is even a bigger problem. What a merry go round.&nbsp;</p>

            &nbsp;The first troubleshooting option you can try is Microsoft's own Windows 10 Troubleshooter for Windows Update. In the Windows 10 Creators Update, you can find it in Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot, click Windows Update then click Run
 the troubleshooter.&nbsp;<br />
If you are running Windows 10 Anniversary Update or an earlier version of Windows, click Start, type: troubleshooting, hit Enter then launch the Windows Update troubleshooter.&nbsp;<br />
You can run the troubleshooter a couple times to see if it helps.&nbsp;<br />
<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you’ve recently installed Windows 10 and you’ve wanted to transfer a user profile that contains all of your files, it can be done manually by using a storage media device to copy it from there and paste it to a new Windows 10 user profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, <span><strong>Microsoft </strong>has partnered with <strong>Laplink</strong>
</span>and you can use the <strong>PCmover Express</strong> tool for transferring files, folder, settings and user profiles from the
<em>old version of your Windows</em> to the <em>new Windows 10 PC</em>. Click this
<strong><a href="http://pcmoverfree.azurewebsites.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> for further
<em>information </em>and its <em>fee</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We’re just here if you need further help.</p>
