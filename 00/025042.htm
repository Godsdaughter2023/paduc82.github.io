<h2>            turn off &#34;previous appointment&#34; tab at left&#47;right in Outlook Calendar group&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've recently discovered Outlook 2013/2016's ability to create groups of Calendars, to show the content of two or more Calendars in one combined display. That's great.</p>
<p>However, Outlook 2013 and 2016 overlay a "Previous Appointment" vertical tab on the left, and "Next Appointment" vertical tab on the right, on any Calendar display where some calendar does not have any appointment on the displayed date, but does have appointments
 on other dates.</p>
<p>This is totally unnecessary, and, worse, the "Previous Appointment" tab obscures the first few characters at the left edge of any appointments which happen to be in time slots displayed where that tab appeares (And possibly the right edge if any text is
 as long as to reach the right edge of the Outlook Calendar window).</p>
<p>Screen shot:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/754db305-b21f-466d-aece-537d2d723c58" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/754db305-b21f-466d-aece-537d2d723c58" /></a></p>
<p>How can I completely disable these "Previous Appointment" and "Next Appointment" vertical tabs at the left and right edges of Outlook 2013/2016 Calendar Group displays?</p>
<p>thank you.</p>

<h2>            &#34;Update Field&#34; is greyed-out in Word 2007 document</h2>
                    We have a Word 2007 document on our sharepoint server. This document uses mail merge to incorporate data from another document. The document works fine when accessed from most PCs but when it's accessed from one of our Windows Server 2008 terminal servers
 the "Update field" option is greyed out in the right-click menu. This problem has only occurred recently, and I can't figure out what's changed nor how to re-enable the Update field function. Any help will be greatly appreciated.

Can you update fields by selecting them and pressing F9?

<p>No I can't, on the server in question. This is how we used to update the document. It was only when&nbsp;F9 stopped working that I discovered that the "Update field" option is greyed out in the right-click menu&nbsp;On the other terminal server and on stand-alone
 PCs it works fine. The problem seems therefore to relate to the combination of Office 2007 and Server 2008 on this particular machine. What I don't understand is why it stopped working when it used to work fine. I'm hoping that there's some "hidden" (i.e.
 not immediately apparent) setting that will switch on the "update field" option.</p>

    <title>using offset function for dynamic axis in Excel 2010 data not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> excelhelp_905  say:</h3>
<h2>            using offset function for dynamic axis in Excel 2010 data not completely updating</h2>
                    <p>I have an excel spreadsheet (2010)&nbsp;where I am using the offset function so the axis and data in the graph automatically update every time additional data is entered.&nbsp; I have used this function in excel 2003 in the past and it has worked perfectly. Problem
 this time in 2010 is&nbsp;the axis does not update to include the whole series of data. For example I have a data series which spans from September 1986 through July 19, 2013.&nbsp; In the graph however when I hover over the line&nbsp;it seems that the data which the line
 charts shows only goes through June 2013.&nbsp; I've checked the format axis box and everything is set to auto or automatically and I can't figure out why the entire ranges does not update.&nbsp; I created the spreadsheet in excel 2010 but when I open it in excel 2003
 everything shows correctly.&nbsp; I'm trying to get this resolved so I can retire excel 2003.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>my data ranges from row 5 to row 6048&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where my range in the offset is&nbsp; from row 5 to row 60000</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;my formula is&nbsp;&nbsp; x axis&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = offset(sheet1!$a$5,0,0,counta(sheet1!$a$5:$a$60000),1)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; y axis&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = offset(sheet1!$b$5,0,0,counta(sheet1!$b$5:$b$60000),1)</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead of using the OFFSET() function, convert the range into a Table.&nbsp; So assuming your headings are in cell A5, select A5:B[last row till where data is] and press Ctrl+T (Ensure that "My Table has headers box is checked").&nbsp; Create your chart now.&nbsp; When
 you add data by rows, the chart will auto update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

 and right tab, etc.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I can get to a setup dialogue through FORMAT TEXT (TAB) &gt; Paragraph (drop down) &gt; Tabs... (button).&nbsp; And I can even Set, Clear, etc. all the things that dialogue box allows.&nbsp; However, the tabs do not show up on the ruler, so I am still working in COMPLETE
 DARKNESS with respect to tabs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, in MSWord there is a graphical tool that comes with the ruler where the desired tabs (formatting tabs again) can be positioned with a simple drag and drop procedure.&nbsp; I used this feature for years in older versions of Outlook.&nbsp; Is it another
 of the casualties of MS programmers' never-ending quest to render all the good stuff inaccessible in new version of the program?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What sense does it make to make yearly revisions to a program that makes the program LESS USEFUL than previous versions?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>An example of Form over Substance at the least.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At worst, the programming code equivalent of the Peter Principle.&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Hi Dennis,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Outlook 2013, we were not able to reproduce the problem on our end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On our end, the tab options are similar in both Word 2013 and Outlook 2013 new email. The only difference in Outlook 2013, is that you have to enable the ruler in the Quick Access Toolbar or customize the Ribbon.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tabs once set under Format Text in Outlook are shown graphically that can be dragged and dropped as well. As this is not working on your end, let us change the Windows Theme and see if the same problem reoccurs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more information on the same, refer to the following link.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows7/Change-the-theme-to-improve-performance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows7/Change-the-theme-to-improve-performance</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>In case if that does not help, you may create a new Profile in Outlook and see if that works. Refer to the following article ‘How to create and configure an email profile in Outlook’.</p>
<p><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/create-an-outlook-profile-HA102749460.aspx?CTT=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/create-an-outlook-profile-HA102749460.aspx?CTT=1</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If new profile works, you may reconfigure the account settings and data file settings. To open the old data file in Outlook go to File, Open and then Open Outlook Data File. Once you have the old data file open, change the default data file by going to File,
 Info, Account settings, Account settings and then Data Files tab. Click to select the Data file and then click on Set as Default. Close and re-open Outlook for changes to take place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope the above information helps. If you need further assistance, you may reply and I’ll be happy to assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            no unlink option in Microsoft OneDrive settings</h2>
                    I'm trying to unlink an account from an old email address, which was replaced with a new email address.&nbsp; Following the instructions, I right clicked on the OneDrive icon and was taken to settings.&nbsp; The directions say to select unlink however there is no
 option in the dialog box to unlink. See the attached picture for the options available.&nbsp; How do I unlink one account so that I can&nbsp;link my account that has the new email address?&nbsp; &nbsp;

<h2>            Microsoft Academics Student edition</h2>
                    
<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm the system administrator for the religious order I'm in.&nbsp; I'm serving students from around the world, coming to the United States to study.&nbsp; I'm teaching those students about ethical software usage, by first getting rid of unlicensed software on their
 computers, then by trying to get them the Microsoft Office Students Academic edition for $80.&nbsp; The problem is that most of the students do not have credit cards and I just found out that I cannot purchase more than one copy per billing address.&nbsp; This is a
 big problem for me because I know of no other way to pay for it except with my credit card for those students.&nbsp; They each have their own ".edu" email addresses and have been approved to buy.</p>
<p>Is there anyone at Microsoft I can speak to regarding this?&nbsp; I called in but the operators weren't very helpful, both at Digitalrivers and Microsoft.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks!</p>

The 2 suppliers you mention are the only vendors that offer this specific deal. Their financial arrangements are sound and are there for good reasons. I sympathise but there is nothing that can be done. Policies are policies.</p>
<p>The students are geeting an excellent deal price wise with this offer and need to be paid for products.</p>
<p>The restriction is NOT billing address, it one copy per .edu address. Call the Microsoft Store at 1-877-my-ms-store, ask to speak with a supervisor and tell them that I told you to call. Please repost the outcome.</p>

<p>Hi Ron,</p>
<p>You are giving me some hope.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Yes, each student has their own unique "edu" address provided by the school that they are attending.</p>
<p>When the order was rejected, I called the number that was provided by one of the links on the failed order page.&nbsp; I spoke with a Digitalrivers sales operator and she told me that only one copy can be sold per billing address; she was pretty adamant on this
 and told me about their contract with Microsoft, she also mentioned that her supervisor would say the same thing.&nbsp; She gave me the number for the Microsoft Store; the operator pretty much told me the same thing and referred me back to Digitalrivers.</p>
<p>This is the link I ordered from.&nbsp; I'm unable to find the Microsoft Office 2010 Academics (or Office 2011 Academics for Mac) at the Microsoft store.</p>
<p>http://www.microsoft.com/student/office/en-us/default.aspx</p>
<p>I will call them tomorrow; and will request to speak with a supervisor.&nbsp; I would not mind calling in per student to help them get the software as they all have valid edu addresses.</p>
<p>Thanks again!</p>

The MAC version of Office is available only at the Microsoft Store for&nbsp; $99. Don't ask, demand to speak with a supervisor. Explain the situation in detail like you did in the first post. You will have to have a valid .edu email address for each order, 1 at
 a time, and will have to verify that each one works by receiving a code to read back to the supervisor. Let me know what happens. How many students are we talking about?<br />

<p>Will do as you asked tomorrow.&nbsp; We have around 30 students studying here in the several theological colleges surrounding the University in Chicago.&nbsp; Each student is actually with me when I order for them, and they have their account information handy so&nbsp;
 we should not have validation problems.</p>
<p>Thanks again, I will let you know what happens tomorrow.&nbsp; With so many students, and I'm also a full time student going through term papers and finals next week, I probably won't start on the bulk of the orders until after the 13th when I take my last exam.</p>

<p>Hi Ron,</p>
<p>I called in to the Microsoft Store today and spoke with a sales representative. I asked to speak with a supervisor name Ron but she said there is no one by that name; but asked if she can help.&nbsp; I told her everything I wrote on the post above.&nbsp; She said
 to send her the approval emails from the academic deals and she will speak with her supervisor.&nbsp; I sent two.&nbsp; She replied back saying that since the approval is through DigitalRivers, she cannot help, I have to go through them.&nbsp; For those who wants to get
 the MAC academic version, that person will have to call in individually and get verified.</p>
<p>And that is where things stand right now.&nbsp; Regarding the MAC editions, I guessed it can be done (although I wonder if I have to spend 5 minutes explaining to each operators about what I'm trying to do with each order) but I'm not sure what to do about the
 PC edition.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

 the MAC academic version, that person will have to call in individually and get verified.</p>
<p>And that is where things stand right now.&nbsp; Regarding the MAC editions, I guessed it can be done (although I wonder if I have to spend 5 minutes explaining to each operators about what I'm trying to do with each order) but I'm not sure what to do about the
 PC edition.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Ben</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

She is wrong. I will get back to you later. Did anyone give you a reference number?<br />

    <title>Link that takes me to a blank page - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Link that takes me to a blank page</h2>
                    I want to delete my account that I have on myspace but I forgot my password to it. So on myspace I clicked on the "Forgot Password" and it sent an email to my gmail account. So once I opened it i had a link that said "Create New Password". I clicked it
 but it took me to a blank page and I don't know why. It doesn't matter how many times I click it always takes me to a blank page. All I want to know is if there is setting on my internet explorer that can stop me from getting to where this link is supposed
 to take me?

    <title>I cannot believe that the issue of Long Text Fields containing more - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jamrez  say:</h3>
<h2>            I cannot believe that the issue of Long Text Fields containing more than 255 Characters has not been resolved to date.</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;I am using Office 2016 and in Access I am using the Import Wizard and saving the Import. However whenever I run the saved import it truncated the text.</p>
<p>I have changed the field to Plain text</p>
<p>I have changed the&nbsp; field to Rich Text</p>
<p>I have selected Compresion</p>
<p>I have set append.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing that has worked is a physical Copy and paste.</p>
<p>I need this to run every night so having to copy and paste it is not acceptable.</p>
<p>Is there anyway that I can get data from a CSV or Exel file into an Access database without it truncating the content of the field and without having to do it manually?????</p>

<p>HI Dirk - I'm having a similar problem. I have a long text field in a table then in a form. I can copy and paste text into the text box on the form and it accepts it - until I move to another place on the form and it truncates to 255 characters. I've also
 tried the rich text, plain text fixes to no avail. Any suggestions?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>It is by design.</p>
<p>Long text is not just short text but then longer, it is a completely different data type and works by different rules. For example you cannot put an index on such field either. Why? Because the field could potentially be 2 GB long, and doing all that searching
 or indexing would slow Access down to a crawl. So only use long text what it was intended for: storage of lots of text without too many features.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I don't think I understand exactly what you are doing.&nbsp; When you say you "move to another place on the form", do you just mean that you tab or click out of the text box where you pasted the text?&nbsp; And then the text box (where you pasted the text) truncates
 the text to 255 characters?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, most likely either the text box or the table field has a format applied to it.&nbsp; Check the Format property of the&nbsp;text box and the field to see if there's anything in there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that's not what you mean, please describe in more detail exactly what you are doing and what is happening.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The text box is bound directly to the long text field, right?&nbsp; Its ControlSource property is set to the name of the field?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Incidentally, it's not really right to piggyback your own question on someone else's.&nbsp; Your situation isn't the same, even though they're both related to long text fields, so you ought to have opened a new question thread for it.)</p>

<p>Of course! We never do anything by hand around here.</p>
<p>Take Tom’s advice; this is by design. </p>
<p>Therefore, if you are going to import “long” text, you will need to use some VBA to intercept the import and divide the long field(s) to suit.</p>

</p><p>I am using Access 2013, not 2016, so some bug could have been introduced in 2016 to explain the fact that I can't reproduce your problem.&nbsp; If changing the field's TextFormat property to Plain Text and back to Rich Text fixed it, that is suggestive of a bug,
 but if so, it's hard to say where the bug lies.&nbsp; If you'd like to send me a copy of the database where the issue was showing itself, I'd be interested in checking it out to see if it happens on my system.</p>

            I first encountered this behaviour as far back as Access 95 when importing dBASE data into Access.&nbsp; The solution I discovered then was to not add the bound control to the form by dragging from the field list, but to add a text box to the form from the
 toolbox, and set its ControlSource property to the name of the field in question.&nbsp; The EnterKeyBehavior of the control was also set to 'New line in field' to reflect the default for a memo (now long text) field.<br />
<br />
We are now more than 20 years on of course, so whether the same would be true in the current version of Access I can't say.<br />

    <title>Problems maintaining right-justification with right-aligned tabs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> atomic kid  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems maintaining right-justification with right-aligned tabs</h2>
                    <p>I'm creating a menu for a restaurant and we've decided to right-justify all of the menu items. I want to be able to hit "tab" at the end of each line of copy and bump that row of right-justified text to the left by a predictable amount, e.g. ".25". Then
 I can type the price for that item and go to the next line.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I would want to end up with is nicely right aligned rows of menu items and then all the prices right justified to the edge of the page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The result I'm getting when trying to setup my tabs (and I've read multiple tutorials on this), is that I get right aligned prices and it shoves the menu item to the left side of the page. This is strange consider the copy is&nbsp;<em>still
</em>right-justified. However, this is how most people want their tabs to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've considered making a two cell table, to effectively fake the alignment I'm looking for. This basically gives me two right "edges" to right-justify the copy to. What is annoying about this solution is that you have to make sure you get your line spacing
 correct in each cell or the prices don't stay matched with the item.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts? Thanks!</p>

            <p>First of all, do <em>not</em> use Right Justification [i.e., Paragraph Alignment] for this purpose... That's what's causing your problem. Use of anything other than the default Left Justification causes tab settings to behave differently than what you expect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To get the effect you're describing requires 2* tab stops: One at the spot where you want the items to align, one at the spot where you want the prices to align. The important consideration is that you need to press the tab key at the beginning of each line
 before entering the item, then press tab again to enter the price. Press return to go to the next paragraph (i.e., line). The result will be as shown here:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e427cea6-cc5d-47dd-9890-0113dde8a4ad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e427cea6-cc5d-47dd-9890-0113dde8a4ad" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This example uses a right-aligned tab stop @ 2.5" &amp; a Decimal tab stop with a Line Leader at 6". Adjust their position to suit yourself. Note that unless the prices are strictly in whole dollars I strongly recommend using a Decimal tab rather than a right
 tab. Otherwise the $s &amp; the 'column' of decimal points will have an obvious, unprofessional snaking effect rather than being sharply aligned vertically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>*If you really want to do it right, IMO it's better to use <em>3</em> tab stops - a Center-aligned tab for the $ which provides a much better visual impact. That same example with a right tab @1.75", a center tab @ 5.75" &amp; a decimal tab @ 6" would look more
 like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9b0be4f2-c2dc-47f0-962e-6ee452fa59fd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9b0be4f2-c2dc-47f0-962e-6ee452fa59fd" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>*I suggest avoiding a right tab for the prices... As mentioned above it can cause the appearance of a snaking column of decimal points due to the fact that not all numbers are the same width.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, my personal opinion is that a Table for this purpose is considerably more fiddly to deal with, especially if you want to maintain uniform alignment of the price column.</p>

Every time I open office 2016 for mac, such as word. The app will crash in 5 minutes. When I re-open it, ask for a activation key. After I successfully log in, it will crash again and ask for activation. The OS is 10.10.5. Also, I have a windows 10 as Boot
 camp on my Mac. On Windows 10, I have office 365 too. Use another office account to activate. It works well. I have tried to install office again.</p>

<h2>            Font display issues in Office 2013</h2>
                    <p>Win7/Upgraded Office 2010 to 2013.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few fonts do not render correctly in Office 2013. I use Trade Gothic on my computer and it worked fine with Office 2010. As soon as I upgraded to Office 2013 it stopped rendering. I also know mail sent from others also appear scrambled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas on how to fix it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I did the upgrade, Office 2010 was retained. It continues to work correctly.</p>

            <p>check with vendor if the font 'trade Gothic' is compatible with Office 2013 version.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps you can remove and re-install the fonts and check.</p>

<h2>            Visio 2007 Size &#38; Position Window Issue</h2>
                    <p>I hope someone knows the answer. &nbsp; Google Search didn't turn up anything.</p>

</p><p>I somehow unanchored the Size &amp; Position Window from the left side of the Page Display Pane and can't figure out how to get it back to its default behavior.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right Click on the Title bar only shows three options - Dock Window, Autofit, &amp; Close.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also unable to drag the window to a different location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a Registry setting which controls the behavior of the Size &amp; Position Window that I can edit to restore the default behavior?</p>

<h2>            Displaying a metric and a percentage on 2 bars next to each other in Excel</h2>
                    <p>I am working on an Excel <a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2fd049f5-45f8-46aa-8ce9-424055b0045b?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2fd049f5-45f8-46aa-8ce9-424055b0045b?upload=true" /></a>graph that represents a department's total work output and how much time is spent on each work stream. I am currently displaying several
 metrics (numbers) and the percentage of effort that each of those numbers represents together on a bar graph. (see screenshot). Specifically the number bar represents Tasks or "Actions" that were completed. Each number is a different work stream. The percentage
 bar or "Effort Ratio" represents how much of the overall work effort went to each of those Actions. I have other formulas that calculate the Effort Ratio based on how many hours it takes to complete an action. So if 10 actions take 1 hour each, that uses a
 much higher percentage of the available staff time than 20 actions that take 2 minutes each.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way I could get the Effort Ratio and Action bars to display on the same scale was to first calculate the Effort Ratio as a number related to the Actions. At the top of the screenshot you see the graph and at the bottom you see the data that it is
 mapping in the Weighting section. The only way I could get the percentage to display on the graph was to put the percentage in a separate grid (see the work Effort % area in the screenshot) and click on each data point and specifically point it to the correct
 cell. The graph lets you do this by clicking on the data point and then typing = into the formula bar and then clicking on the cell you want to display....in this example it is B64. Excel automatically adds the absolute reference ($) and will not accept a
 reference that is not absolute.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, with all that said.....the problem I have is that this is a rolling 12 month report so each month I need to add the new month, remove the oldest month and shift the graph reference so that it shows the new 12 month period. As soon as I do that, Excel
 changes my % references so that each one is showing the wrong percentage. Even though the reference is absolute, Excel continues to change it. When I shift the cells for the graph right, the % data point references shift to the left.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am interested in anybody that can help me figure out how to avoid the weird % data point shift or any suggestions to set up the graph completely differently to avoid this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Hi RaffiJamgotchian1504,</p>
<p>To narrow down the root cause of the issue, I’d like to confirm some information:</p>
<p>1. Did you turn on Out of office on both Outlook client and OWA (Outlook Web App) (<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.office365.com/owa/</a>)?</p>
<p>2. Did you set up any inbox rules in the Outlook client?</p>
<p>3. To detect whether the issue is related to the Outlook client or the Office 365 account, would you mind temporarily turning off the Outlook client, mobile device client (e.g. Outlook for iOS/Android, OWA for iOS/Android, built-in app, etc.) and only leaving
 the OWA open to see if the issue persists?</p>
<p>4. Did this issue occur every time all other senders (senders inside or outside your organization) send an email to you when you're OOF?</p>
<p>5. Did this issue happen only to you in your organization?</p>
<p>Thanks for your continued efforts and time.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Mouran</p>
        </p>

<p>1. It doesn't matter where I turn it on from: OWA, Powershell, Outlook, or a 3rd party application</p>
<p>2. There are inbox rules but none on the out of office. The inbox rules are all folder movement stuff (i.e if a message comes from this person, put in that folder</p>
<p>3. Done, I changed the out of office with OWA, I sent an email to my account and got response one, I sent another and got response 2. This is while Outlook client (mac) was closed and so was Outlook mobile app on my iphone- I actually changed my password
 with OWA to do this so the mobile client couldn't connect.</p>
<p>4. not sure about inside the organization as we only have two mailboxes that are actively used by people. all external</p>
<p>5. i'm the main user in the organization. I'll have to test with another account to see if the same thing happens.</p>

</p><p>Was using 10.10.4 .. now 10.10.5 .. on my main computer. &nbsp;I have a test computer with the 10.11 beta .. the problem no longer exists there either.</p>

<h2>            Will phones which don&#39;t support Creators Update get other future updates&#63;</h2>
                    I have a lumia 830 and unfortunately it doesn't support the Creators Update (Redstone 2) which also means it won't support Redstone 3. Will these unsupported devices get any feature updates in the future? And why did Microsoft leave most Lumia phones unsupported
 for these important updates....there are only 6 supported Lumia devices which will get the update and most of them are not really popular ones.

<p>Don't know why some phones were left out . My 830 has no problems on the CU.</p>
<p>These phones will not get any feature updates. </p>
<p>As far as you can go is 14393.1198 from the update advisor path.</p>
<p>If you want to go to the CU from there you have to go to the Insider preview path as an unsupported device.</p>
<p>Join the insider program, fast ring, update as far as&nbsp;you can go on that ring, then go to the production ring.</p>
