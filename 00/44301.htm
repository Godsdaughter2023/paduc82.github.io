            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I don't see any reason it will.  It's just games which plenty of people play on the same PC's they work or do homework on.  Have you had problems with other PC's you've installed it on?  What kinds?  
<br />
<br />Be sure System Restore is turned on and restore point set so you can roll back before you installed it at any time.  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />You can even store a system image externally so if Windows ever becomes irreparable you can go back in 20 minutes to where it was when Image was made:<a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-re...</a>  
<br />
<br />Other back up tips so you never lose anything no matter what happens:
<br />
<br />Your files should always be backed up because the hard drive can die at any time.  Some suggestions to help ease into this habit:
<br />
<br />You can drag 5gb for free into OneDrive app to store in the cloud where they are safe from fire and theft.  
<br />
<br />Google Drive has a new Backup that allows you to choose User folders (Documents, Pictures, etc.) to sync up to 15g for free to their cloud.  <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en-GB_ALL/drive/download/backup-and-sync/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.google.com/intl/en-GB_ALL/drive/dow...</a>
<br />
<br />Or you can drag or copy them to another hard drive, USB external or flash drive.  
<br />Here's how to drag, copy or move large groups of files:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-many-ways-to-copy-move-or-delete-multiple-files.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-man...</a>
<br />
<br />A better file backup to external disk is free Macrium which is the choice of the experts:
<br /><a href="http://knowledgebase.macrium.com/display/KNOW/Backing+up+files+and+folders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://knowledgebase.macrium.com/display/KNOW/B...</a>
<br />
<br />Besides your files you should back up a System Image to use in place of reinstall in 20 minutes. The best free alternative is Macrium:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-ref...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

When I try to purchase it with the money on my account, there are problems and I have to try it later. I'm already waiting a week for this problem to be solved but the discounts on the store are running out and I want to make use of it.&nbsp;Can someone help me?</p>

            <p>I have the same problem,&nbsp;<br /></p>
<p>"Hello.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When trying to purchase add-ons, specifically 2000 Zen points for Star Trek Online, my screen dims for a few moments and comes back with "Try again later, We couldn't connect to the Store."</p>
<p>I've tried to do this on:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Internet Explorer for Xbox 360
</p>
<p>Microsoft Edge for Xbox One</p>
<p>Microsoft Edge for Windows 10</p>
<p>Internet Explorer 11 for Windows 10</p>
<p>Chrome for OS&nbsp;X 10.10</p>
<p>Chrome for Windows 10
</p>
<p>Safari for OS&nbsp;X 10.10</p>
<p>Chrome for Android 6.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nothing works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the website I get a grey box with nothing in, and it just sits there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have (though I'm not sure I see the relevance), removed myself from the Dev builds of the dashboard&nbsp;(waiting for that to take effect), reset the console to factory settings (keeping games), I&nbsp;have power cycled by holding power for 5-10 seconds, and I've even resorted to unplugging the console overnight, but to no luck.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've had this problem all week, I wasn't even able to reedem a code on the xbox or the website, until a member of support gave me a link and it worked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone know if this is a problem or if they know of a solution to this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks. "</p><p><br /></p><p>If Microsoft or anyone knows why this is please can you let us know!&nbsp;</p>

    <title>DLC on multiple accounts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> krynn007  say:</h3>
<h2>            DLC on multiple accounts</h2>
                    
<p>Wondering if anyone can help me with this</p>
<p>My wife recently got a gold account for herself, because she enjoys playing L4D</p>
<p>On my account I have all the DLC, but she cannot access it on her account.</p>
<p>She was talking about getting MSP to get the DLC, but I don't see why she should. Seeing as how I aleady paid for it, and it is on the same xbox as her account. She is able to play the DLC so long as she is playing co op with me, but by herself she cannot
 access it with her own account</p>
<p>I figured there must be a way that she should be able to use it. I really don't see the need to have to purchase it again</p>

<p>Ok, I thought you were right Zombie, so I tested it with my other gold account. I CANNOT play any DLC games with my other gold account. My licensing is current. I thought my son used to play my games on my old Xbox fine, but maybe it changed or I am thinking
 wrong. I even have the Family Gold... still get a big sign that says "Can't Play Game". This is a big disappointment. I doubt I'll buy anymore full games on DLC, knowing only I can play them. It's not even like I can take my game disc over to a friends house
 and play. Seems if anyone is at my console, they should be able to play, even if a friend brought his GT over on a thumb drive. They can play any game I have on disc.</p>

<p>DLC is licensed to two things. The account used to buy it and the console it was first download on. Typically DLC can be shared between accounts but there are of course a few exceptions, most notably Avatar items.<br />
<br />
The console license lets any account on the console use the DLC, online or offline.<br />
<br />
With the account license that lets you use the DLC on any console as long as you are connected to Live. This can also be used to temporarily allow others to access the DLC but as noted above, the purchasing account must also be signed into Live.<br />
<br />
The license transfer can now be done solely on the console. Sign in with the purchasing account, press the guide button on your controller and press right until you reach the Settings Blade. Here pick the Account Management option.<br />
<br />
You'll be taken to a new screen and on the first panel here the last option will be License Transfer, so pick that. Now in a couple of button presses the console license will be transferred to the new console, however this is not the end of the process.<br />
<br />
The license must be refreshed and that means setting the content to be downloaded again. If the DLC is already on your hard drive then all that ill be grabbed from Live is the new license file, so it will be an incredibly quick process.<br />
<br />
Now simply repeat the above for any other accounts that have DLC you want to belong to the new console. Remember though that the license transfer can only be done once every four months.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What he said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;To add on, as long as the owner gamertag signed in, all gamertags on the same console can shared purchased content (Eg XBLA and DLCs).</p>

<p>When you buy stuff, anyone can use it on the exact console it was purchased on. &nbsp;If you change consoles, you need to license transfer. &nbsp;If you want to play it on another console, the GT that purchased the content must be signed in on that console (can be
 as controller 2 even) for it to work.</p>
<p>I have 2 consoles and 4 gold accounts for my family. &nbsp;So my wife's xbox I make sure if she wants to buy DLC she buys it on the main XBOX. &nbsp;That way she'll be able to play on both, and I do the same for my stuff. &nbsp;The trick comes when we both want the same
 thing which is rare lol</p>
<p>good luck</p>

<p>I believe your right about the transfer thing. Thank you. Thanks Vote as well for pointing out it can be done on the console. That is handy.</p>
<p>Just wanted to add, to a couple of comments. No, my profile is not signed it, and unless it is the game only, it doesn't need to be. My wife is able to access other DLC on the console without my account being signed in, I believe it is just as others suggested
 and that is a license transfer.</p>

<p><span>(Usually it's discouraged to bring back year-old threads, but it's a directly relevant question and it's not like we need another DLC DRM thread around.)<br />
<br />
Your brother buys DLC with his account on his console. To use that DLC on your console via his license, his account must be signed in to Xbox Live the entire time. Sign him out (or lose the network/Xbox Live), and you lose access to the content.<br />
<br />
On his console, you can use the DLC without him even being signed in, because the first console the content is downloaded on gets the console license, which can be used offline.</span></p>

But there is only one option for 'Email Address'. Work Email Address and Other Email Address are not available to map to. When you add a contact from scratch you have the option to to include these other email address fields.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to import contacts with multiple email address fields - or am I forced to do this by hand?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help on this.</p>

            Hi <span>GodBlessAmerica22,<br />
<br />
There is no other way to add the "other" email address field when exporting the contacts. I suggest that you add it manually.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

    <title>Fallout 4 stuck on loading standby screen on Xbox One - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Fallout 4 stuck on loading standby screen on Xbox One</h2>
                    
<p>I've had no issues with my Fallout 4 before. &nbsp;All of a sudden, my game won't start or play. &nbsp;It can never get past the initial loading screen where it says "Please Standby." &nbsp;Then the screen goes black while a small loading icon appears on the bottom right
 corner. &nbsp;Nothing happens and I get booted out to the Xbox one home screen.</p>
<p>I've tried EVERYTHING. &nbsp;I did a power cycle on my xbox one. &nbsp;I uninstalled and reinstalled the game. &nbsp;Still nothing. &nbsp;I then assumed the disc had been scratched so I uninstalled the game and bought a new Fallout 4 which I downloaded. &nbsp;Still the problem is
 the same. &nbsp;Are there any solutions to this? &nbsp;Is there any way to get a refund for buying the new version?</p>

<p>In a case like this, I'm only thinking of two possible things that could prevent Fallout 4 from loading:</p>
<ol>
<li>Corrupted game cache? </li><li>Dying hard drive inside Xbox One. </li></ol>
<p>When playing a game, the game automatically sets aside some "reserved space" (or cache) in the Xbox so some things could efficiently load faster while playing. Sometimes, the cache can randomly get corrupted and it could prevent the game from loading properly.</p>
<ul>
<li>From the main menu, go to "My Games &amp; Apps" </li><li>Find "Fallout 4" in your library of games. </li><li>Go to "Manage Game" </li><li>On the left side, go down to "Saved Data". </li><li>Delete the item that says "Reserved Space". It might be up to 2GB in size (at least for me). This is just the temporary game cache. (The item with your gamertag is your game saves)
</li><li>Attempt to run Fallout 4 now. </li></ul>
<p>If Fallout 4 still doesn't work after deleting the cache, then this <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<em>might</em></span> indicate a problem with the hard drive.</p>
<p>Let's just see what happens when you delete the cache first. Post back with results!</p>

<p>Thanks for the response Internet Expert. &nbsp;I have been chatting with some support staff as well.</p>
<p>I did indeed try to delete the reserved space. &nbsp;It didn't work.</p>
<p>When chatting with support, they suggested 2 things. &nbsp;That my hard copy disc is scratched/defective and that's why that wasn't working. &nbsp;I disagree with them since, as mentioned, I also downloaded a version of the game which is stuck with the same problem
 on the same screen.</p>
<p>Second, they could see that my downloaded version didn't sync up with my xbox account. &nbsp;They could see I purchased the download, but for whatever reason it wouldn't sync with my account which was causing issues. &nbsp;However, I followed their instructions and
 deleted my xbox gamertag account from the xbox, power cycled the xbox off, then restarted and resigned in with my profile. &nbsp;That didn't work.</p>
<p>While support is refunding my downloaded game purchase, their next suggestion is to repurchase the fallout 4 game on a different console such as a PC in order to get it to sync better with my profile. &nbsp;I'm refusing to do this as I don't want to spend any
 more money on this and it seems ridiculous to be forced to purchase an xbox one game on my PC and then work with transferring it over.</p>
<p>I think you may be right about an issue with my hard drive, although I should note every other game I have seems to be working properly.

<p>On launch of Fallout 4 on the Xbox one, via any method. The "please stand by"screen pops up momentarily, followed by a black screen with a pulsing green icon in the lower right-hand corner. Game attempts to load A few minutes, pulsing stops on the icon and
 the game crashes to the dashboard. </p>
<p>I have attempted the following troubleshooting.</p>
<p>- cleared the reserve System memory space.</p>
<p>-deleted all save files from system and cloud storage.</p>
<p>- uninstalled the game file.</p>
<p>-uninstalled all DLC files.</p>
<p>-performed a complete shutdown restart the system.</p>
<p>-confirmed Xbox one system (preview build) OS is up to date.</p>
<p>- reinstalled game from multiple new game discs.</p>
<p>-disconnected system from network.</p>
<p>- attempted to launch game without any updates or patches, no success.</p>
<p>- reconnected network.</p>
<p>-installed all updates and patches.</p>
<p>- same symptoms and results, game attempts to load and crashed after a few minutes on black screen with green icon.</p>
<p>*mods were never used on my system</p>
<p>*Last successful gameplay was in late March early April 2016 after the release of the Automotron DLC. Latest attempt to play game August 29 and 30th &amp; 31st 2016, after installing updates, all available season pass DLC. Hoped to visit Nuka World. All other
 games and and functionality of original Xbox one Console are working normally. Xbox live Gold membership current.</p>
<p>On standard Xbox One support forums, early access and Bethesda's site. I have found instances of users experiencing the same issue on non-preview builds with both physical and digital copies, with no resolution from either support team. This issue seems
 to coincide with the timeframe of the August update and for preview program members, earlier. Vault-tec DLC release/update may also coincide with start of similar issues.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any help.</p>
<p>Please contact me with any related questions or answers.</p>

<p>I have the exact same issue and have taken all the same steps you list in your post. XBox is refusing to take responsibility for the problem, insisting it is a problem with my own game. They insist that I have too many saves. Well, that has caused me to
 lost all my old saves so that I cannot go back to an earlier save when I want to work on certain achievements or for other reasons. &nbsp;The only DLC I have is the Wasteland Workshop. I do have some mods loaded, but not so many as many players have and I don't
 believe that is the problem. In fact, I have attempted to load it without any mods and had the same problem.

<p>pistlpacknmama, </p>
<p>Here are some possible solutions provided by Bethesda support. Maybe they will help you, as they didn't work for me. I'll let you know when I get the issue resolved.
</p>
<p>Restart the Game App</p>
<p>To restart the game:</p>
<p>Press the Xbox button on your controller to return to the Home screen.</p>
<p>Press the Menu button on your controller and close the game.</p>
<p>Restart the game from the Home screen.</p>
<p>Try Deleting the Game Cache</p>
<p>Unlike Xbox 360, the Xbox One does not have a menu option to clear cache on the console. Instead, follow these steps to clear cache on an Xbox One:</p>
<p>Press and hold the power button on the front of the console until it powers down completely.</p>
<p>Unplug the power cable from the back of the console so that the power brick in not connected to the console.</p>
<p>Press the power button on the console three or four times. This will ensure that any remaining power in the battery is drained, clearing the cache on the console.</p>
<p>Plug the power cable back into the console.</p>
<p>Wait for the light on the power brick to change from white to orange.</p>
<p>Turn on the console using the power button.</p>
<p>Try Powercycling.</p>
<p>To power cycle your Xbox One:</p>
<p>Press and hold the Xbox button on the front of the console for 10 seconds.</p>
<p>Unplug the console's power cable and wait for 10 seconds.</p>
<p>Plug the power cable back in and turn the console back on by pressing the Xbox button again.</p>
<p>Try Reinstalling the Game/DLC</p>
<p>To uninstall* a game on your Xbox One, follow the steps found here: <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/system/free-up-hard-drive-space" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../free-up-hard-drive-space</a>.</p>
<p>*Do not delete your save files, but only the game itself. Once complete, you can reinstall the game from your library or the game disc.</p>

            <p>Has anyone managed to resolve this issue? I play Fallout 4 a lot and also use my Xbox daily,&nbsp;the passed couple of days it has been taking a while to load. Last night however, it started with the 'Standby' screen but was followed by a black screen. It would not do anything past this point. I have also had an issue with the YouTube app, it loads with the YouTube screen, but then continues to a black screen with the loading icon in the right hand corner but does nothing past this. I have tried deleting and reinstalling, turn Xbox on and off but it does not resolve the issue. All other apps seem to be fine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When I had Windows XP on my computer Microsoft Train Sim worked fine but now that I have windows 10 it will not run.</p>
<p>I am thinking of dividing up my hard drive and installing the old XP on one of the segments which I still have the discs for and then try reinstalling MSTS.</p>
<p>How complicated is that to do.</p>

<p>Hi Willy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's possible to divide your hard drive with Windows XP and Windows 10 to install Microsoft Train Simulator. To do that, you need to have an installation media for Windows XP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To start installing Windows XP, you need to clear the operating system of your computer first. Once its cleared, you can now install Windows XP and save it on your C drive. Next, you need to reinstall Windows 10 using your D drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance regarding your concern.</p>

<p>I still can not get my MSTS to run with windows 10.</p>
<p>See my previous posts.</p>
<p>I am sure that one problem is compatibility as it&nbsp; worked with&nbsp; XP.</p>
<p>The other main problem is that I can not run the program because it keeps telling me e to "run as Administrator " but ever time I right click on to run it that way it still will not load up the program.</p>
<p>It was installed with Stream4me as advised by the people at Trainsim.</p>
<p>I have also been told that this sim will run well on windows 10.</p>
<p>I have open rails installed on my computer as well as they tell me that MSTS will work on that program even if you do not install MSTS which does not make a lot of sense to me.</p>
<p>I am just about to give up on this application but every once in a while I try again.</p>
<p>It makes me think I am flogging a dead horse.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time </p>

<p>Not much help, I'm afraid, but you may be relieved to know you're not alone! I recently updated my computer to a new one and I'm having exactly the same problem. If anyone out there can come up with a simple and straightforward solution, I'd love to hear
 it as I've invested a considerable amount of money in add-on routes which now just languish on a shelf! By the way, I also have the same problem with Train Store.</p>

                    <p>Hello and thank you for any help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a computer that I bought from cyberpowerpc.com and have had it for a year, just over. I do not have good connection to the internet (live in the far North East of the US where internet access is hit and miss) so use a mobile '5 spot' from Verizon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recenty, have had two BSODs. One was when doing a scan with Avira, the other last night when doing a disk defrag.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the information I got and copied out. Sorry about the Os, I guess they might be 0s instead. Not a techie at all!!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><b>Method 1</b></p>
<p><b>Step 1:</b> I would suggest you to boot into safe mode and check if issue persists:</p>

<p><b>Step 2:</b> If issue does not persist in safe mode then place the computer in clean boot and check which third party application is driver
 is causing the issue:</p>

<h2>            Why mail has so many ads</h2>
                    <p><strong>The mail that came with win 10 is so hard to look at and not good.&nbsp; So, I use the one I've always used. (yahoo&nbsp;mail). &nbsp; It now has ads on the right side vertically and one across the top of the mail area making the viewing space substantially smaller
 plus there's even a small one on the left side of the mail too!&nbsp;&nbsp; That's ridiculous!&nbsp;&nbsp;
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The issue seems to be that when typing a new mail ...&nbsp; typing stops and you have to wait til an ad changes... and typing never catches up so then you have to go back and retype it all.&nbsp;&nbsp; How annoying Windows 10!!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>How do I fix this?</strong></p>

<h3> sensor guy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft PS&#47;2 Keyboard</h2>
                    I've been using a Microsoft PS/2 keyboard with Windows XP.&nbsp; I recently purchased a new computer running Windows 7 64-bit. I also purchased an adapter to convert my PS/2 keyboard cable to USB. Upon plugging the cable's USB port into the computer, it is
 not recognized (although one time it was). I read on the adapter's seller's web page that you are supposed to plug the adapter into the computer first, and after the cable is recognized, then attach the keyboard. This hasn't worked for me. Any suggestions?

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>If your devices are connected to PS/2 ports on the computer, verify that you have the following configurations:</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>·<span> </span></span></span><span><span>Verify that the USB plug for the keyboard is connected to the purple USB-to-PS/2 adapter and that this adapter is plugged in the keyboard PS/2 port on the computer. The keyboard PS/2 port on the computer
 may also be purple. If you are not sure which PS/2 port is the keyboard PS/2 port, see the documentation that was included with the computer.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong><span>Warning:</span></strong><span> If you have to change a PS/2 connection, shut off the computer, make the changes, and then restart the computer. Do not plug a PS/2 device into the PS/2 port while the computer is running.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>If you have to change your configuration, shut down the computer, make the changes, and then restart the computer. If your mouse or keyboard has both USB and PS/2 connections, try using the other connection.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>If the issue still persists, you may perform the steps provided. </span>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 1: <br />
<br />
</strong>You may check if the PS/2 keyboard is getting detected on a different Windows 7 computer.
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 2: <br />
<br />
</strong>You may run the Hardware troubleshooter and see if it helps. </span></span></p>

<p>Can you read his post, he has a classic PS/2 Keyboard which he wants to use with a new (legacy free) computer with no PS/2 Ports</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SG</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you confirm that you have used this configuration before and that it has actually stopped working, not that it has never worked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using the mouse can you go to the Device Manager and check the listed hardware, is there any unknown device. If so uninstall the device including if the dialogue show it uninstall the drivers. Remove the USB connector from the computer, is there any change?
 Wait 30 seconds and then plug the USB adapter with the keyboard still attached in to the computer, preferably in a different port block. Does the computer go through any form of hardware detection within a few seconds of plugging in?</p>

<h2>            Notifications Greyed Out Problem - Notifications don&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>This was a question on this site last year.&nbsp; Why is it still a problem?&nbsp; Why does Microsoft set these defaults and then not make it possible for the owner to change them?&nbsp; Unless you are techie enough to feels safe editing registry files?&nbsp; Why should a home
 user be required to "program" the computer to enable an option that should be freely accessible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to make my notifications changeable.&nbsp; Without changing registry files.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Windows 10 Home v.1803</p>

            Hi Diane.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br /> If you want to report this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback. They will not even see it here. This is a tech forums staffed mostly by volunteers trying to help others with your problems.
<br />
<br />If you want to post back a Share link from your Feedback here others who see this thread can vote it up and add to it. If you are an Insider I can also vote it up with my MVP badge and track the issue for you.
<br />
<br />Which Notifications are not working for you?  Can we see a screenshot following these steps to take one and then post it up using the Attach Image button in the reply box?  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/open-snipping-tool-and-take-a-screenshot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/o...</a>
<br />
<br />If you go to Settings &gt; System &gt; Notifications are you able to scrolll down to allow whichever Apps you want to provide notifications?  
<br />
<br />Also in Windows 10 Mail Settings (gear icon at bottom of Inbox) can you set Notfication preferences for each of your Mail Accounts, or all of them at once?
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<br />
<br />My name is Sarah Kong and I am an independent adviser that is here to try and help you with your issue.
<br />
<br />Sorry you are having these issues.
<br />Can you elaborate which notifications are grayed out, maybe provide a screenshot.
<br />Also make sure you are an administrator
<br />To do this go to start - settings -accounts - your info.
<br />Are you listed as an administrator?

<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />I noticed you are still on Windows 10 1803. I recommend you try upgrading to the newer Windows 10 1809 to see if it resolves this problem.
<br />

<br />
<br />One of the easiest ways to upgrade is using the Update Assistant

<p>My screen shot is below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will follow up with the feedback hub - I've not used the community before because I've had access to the work helpdesk - and admin rights on my computer so haven't been blocked in this way before - I have always been able to turn off notifications.&nbsp; I
 do have admin rights on this one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I particularly want to turn off sounds - all sounds - but when I try to click on the icons or the On button (for the greyed out ones) nothing works.&nbsp; The un-greyed out few in the upper section can be turned on and off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't use the Windows mail ....</p>
<p>Thanks for the note re the snipping tool - I have previously defaulted to PrtSc :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Aaaaand .... I have just tried the Sounds panel and found the old way of turning off all computer sounds, in the Sound Control Panel, linked at the right - second clip below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my current issue is fixed, but I still don't have any way to access my (supposed) options.</p>
<p>

<p>I believe the individual apps are greyed out because the master switch at the top to Get Notifications from Apps and other Senders is disabled. One or more of the settings we cannot see above that may make the individual Apps/Senders available to set.
<br />
<br />
If not I would create a new Local Admin test account to see if this happens there, too:&nbsp;

http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a-new-local-user-account-in-windows-10/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If not then move your files over, test all programs run correctly, then when ready delete the old account. You can then link your MS account to the new one:

There are chronic problems with User account corruption we see daily here in Windows 10.

            Hello Diane,
<br />
<br />My name is Patricia and I am an Independent Advisor. I am here to help you today.
<br />
<br />As 1803 is obsolete, first install 1809 and it will probably solve your issue.
<br />Hello
<br />
<br />Uninstall temporary but completely any third antivirus. 
<br />Clean your drive using cleanmgr command in admin mode. 
<br />
<br />Install Windows 10 version 1809 by downloading it from this page

<p><span><span>Hi Larrydak,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers!</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>When does this happen (when the computer is idle for sometime or you are working on it)?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Does this happen when you are doing anything in particular or it happens randomly?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may check in Event Viewer to check if any application is causing the issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To open Event Viewer
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click on the
<strong>Start</strong> button, </span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click on
<strong>Control Panel</strong>, </span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Go to
<strong>System and Security</strong>, </span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Select
<strong>Administrative Tools</strong>, and then double-clicking <strong>Event Viewer</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may also try putting the computer in clean boot and check if any of the background programs is causing this issue. To help
 troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows Vista by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The steps to be performed in clean boot are given below:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Log on to the computer by using an account that has administrator rights</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER to start the System Configuration Utility.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. On the General tab, click Selective Startup, and then click to clear the Load startup items check box. (The Use Original Boot.ini
 check box is unavailable.)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. On the Services tab, click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box, and then click Disable all</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Following this step lets Microsoft services
 continue to run. These services include Networking, Plug and Play, Event Logging, Error Reporting, and other services. If you disable these services, you may permanently delete all restore points. Do not do this if you want to use the System Restore utility
 together with existing restore points</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Once you boot to the desktop check if the issue persists, follow the steps given in the article and figure out which of the program
 is causing the issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For further information on clean boot please follow the below given link:</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Click start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this information is helpful.

                    My mail wouldnt open a "doc" attachment. So experimenting,&nbsp;&nbsp;in the list of programs to open it with I selected Windows Photo Viewer and forgot to unclick the always open files with this. Cant figure out how to go back and undo this. Photoviewer is trying
 to open everything - and of course cant.

    <title>Windows 7 Home Premium refuses to connect to NAS - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peteratdd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Home Premium refuses to connect to NAS </h2>
                    It seems many are having this issue - Windows 7 doesn't want to connect to NAS devices.<br />
<br />
The NAS can be viewed in Explorer but when double clicked the user name and password are repeatedly asked for - yet I know them to be correct.<br />
<br />
A quick Google reveals many out there with the same issue - but nothing 'official' from Microsoft - so far at least.
<br />
<br />
The solution depends on which version of Windows 7 you have - since the issue is to do with password encryption I think.<br />
<br />
In my case I followed some net advice and added a new key to the registry under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE&gt;SYSTEM&gt;CurrentControlSet&gt;Control&gt;LSA and in the right hand box created a new key called LMCompatibilityLevel with a value of 1 (from 0).
<br />
<br />
Immediately on reboot the NAS device connected (but without the required password).<br />
<br />
Now, call me odd but I don't expect to have to do such things to get connected to commonplace devices. I'm sure messing about with the registry is great fun but surely I could reasonably have expected Microsoft to have spotted this issue.
<br />
<br />
Would someone from Microsoft like to comment and advise what to do to get this to work properly (as indeed it does on another partition where Vista still resides!)?<br />
<br />
Anybody got any ideas how to get the password to work?

            If you've searched, you would find that while there have been issues connecting to NAS devices, it is because the NAS devices aren't compatible with Vista/Win7 and usually need a firmware update. This is up to the NAS device mftr. to provide, not Microsoft.
 NAS devices run some flavor of embedded Linux, often with an older version of Samba. Vista did have problems connecting to Unix/Linux computers and devices and Vista did require the LAN Manager authentication to be changed to work with Samba. Win7, however,
 does not. My Win7 box has no problems connecting to my OS X and Linux machines. Of course the same username/password needs to exist on the Win7 box and the other computers and devices. If you can access your NAS's configuration utility (usually done remotely
 by entering the NAS IP address in a browser from a network computer), you should check the users and their passwords to make sure they match those on the Win7 box.<br />
<br />
Otherwise contact the NAS device mftr. to see if they support Win7 and for any patches, workarounds, etc.

    <title>Windows 7 Update disables HID compliant mouse - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> williamhamel1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Update disables HID compliant mouse</h2>
                    The latest March Update Rollups have disabled the HID compliant mouse on our Lenovo ThinkCentre M71e PCs.&nbsp; KB4088875 and KB4088878 appear to be the culprits.&nbsp; The mouse is disabled on all USB ports.&nbsp; Updating the drivers, disabling and re-enabling the
 USB connections and trying different makes and models of mouse do not resolve the issue.&nbsp; The only resolution we've found thus far is to remove and decline these two updates.&nbsp; Has anyone else experienced this issue?&nbsp; Is there a patch from Microsoft forthcoming?&nbsp;
 Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.<br />

<p>I am thinking of upgrading to windows 7 the official version. However, before I do, I would like to know that if i can downgrade to windows vista once I upgrade to Windows 7. I am not sure that you will have the option to downgrade to windows vista. Currently
 I have Windows Vista Home Premium. I also have the recovery disk. Can I install windows Vista from a recovery disk? I seen this article where they made a cd of the recovery parition and installed windows vista. The article link is following:

            There is no downgrade as such; it&nbsp;has to be&nbsp;a clean instal to go back to Vista.<br />
<br />
<strong>You can reinstall Vista from the Recovery disk/s you made, or with the ones from the Computer manufacturer.</strong><br />
<br />
And if there was/is a Recovery partition on youtr Hard Drive, you make Recovery disks fro it.

<p>I go to movie theaters in hopes of viewing something saturated with cinematic artistry fit for the refined palate. The story behind the characters of Mortal Kombat is, even by the horrendously low standards by which contemporary literature is judged (and
 most definitely the standards of previous generations), complete garbage that is better used for kindling than reading or viewing. However, the game itself is quite entertaining, and I have been playing them since the very original.</p>
<p>In sum, I go to movie theaters to see movies; I don't play story mode on Mortal Kombat 9 for the story -- I do it so that I can unlock/complete various elements. &nbsp;

<p>Yeah, but then if you dont see the whole story than your going to be confused about what other people are talking about with the story. So you cant skip the cut scenes, deal with it or go cry to your mommy about how the bad people at NRS forced you to watch
 something you dont or didnt want to see. Dont want to see the cut scenes dont play story mode, simple as that. Your not forced to play story mode just like your not forced to buy the DLC. There are other modes to play if you dont want to watch the cut scenes.</p>

<p>I myself was interested in the story, its just annoying when you have took a break from the game to come back and have to watch the last one again, because some are a few mins long. But its not a big deal since you can skip after the first play through.</p>
<p>And about pausing in cutscenes (though i dont think anybody else has mentioned it) my home can get abit chaotic so an option to pause would be nice becaus i sometimes miss out parts of a scene or the sound gets drowned out. Then theres stuff like getting
 a phone call, somebody at the door etc.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am by no means done playing the game. I can play it for months or year and take my time. I'm in no hurry. I already experienced Story mode so it isn't like I haven't played it and am talking like I know something.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you think you need to play it everyday to get "more" out of it then that's fine. I didn't buy it for online multiplayer. In fact I haven't played one match online yet. But I have played story mode and ladder. Which Ladder to me is old School MK. That
 is good for me. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's funny how you think you have any point to your post with what you say. Yet you have none because I HAVE played the game and completed the Story Mode. This topic WAS about Story Mode. Not Multiplayer. So my post does have merit. I am talking about something
 "I" did or experienced. Not like I was talking about something I didn't even play.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh also what is the point of your post? Did &nbsp;you help the OP? Did you have a point to make? Is it that I don't play the game every day? What exactly IS your point? Or did you just feel the need to say something cause you think you are all that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No seriously. Care to explain that?</p>
<p>Sorry I don't play the game every day and that I have many many more games to play then just one.

            I think most people who skip cutscenes are just impatient, or are in a hurry to finish it so they can trade the game in for something else. That's ok, no one's perfect, but don't live in denial. :)

    <title>Can&#39;t leave insider program - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cl300  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t leave insider program</h2>
                    <p>My Acer notebook came with fully licensed Windows 8. I joined the insider program before the release of Windows 10 to preview it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>During the previews I had problems, my PC wouldn't boot at one stage and I reset the system which wiped all my drivers and Acer software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I am stuck with Windows 10 Home Insider Preview build th2_release 10532 core.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish to leave the insider program and continue with the release version of Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>Settings&gt;Windows Update&gt;Advanced Options says "We need to restart your PC before you can start getting Insider Builds" but I have repeatedly restarted my PC (both from the Power menu and clicking the "Restart now" button, and this never changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not have a "Leave Insider Program" or similar.</p>

            A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>

<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be to Go back to the previous Build, if it was an upgrade to 1809 - 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Go back to the previous Build
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help. I would be happy to work with you to take you though this problem.

<p>Can you reach safe mode?</p>
<p>There’s several potential solutions -</p>
<p>One to upgrade or roll back the graphics driver.</p>
<p>Two to disable fast startup.</p>
<p>Three to turn off ‘use my sign in info to autmatically sign in after a restart or upgrade’.</p>
<p>If you can’t reach safe mode due to the same problem then use the USB installation media to try &amp; boot to safe mode or to reach repair options.</p>

            Hi Usama
<br />
<br />Unplug your PC and remove the battery 
<br />
<br />Press and hold the Power button for 30 seconds 
<br />
<br />Plug your PC back in and replace the Battery 
<br />
<br />Start your PC and see if it boots into Windows 
<br />
<br />
<br />If not, let's see if we can get into the Windows Recovery Environment: 
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to

<h3> fer623  say:</h3>
<h2>            My trackpad thinks there&#39;s two finger on it all the time</h2>
                    I have a Toshiba Satellite L40-A, which i got 6 days ago. Now my trackpad senses there is an extra finger on there. so if I move the pointer around it'll randomly click things along the way or create a "selection" square/ select text. or sometimes it'll
 think that I'm trying to use the zoom gesture, which leads me to believe that the "extra finger" is stationary. I've tried to update and roll back the driver then update it again and it didn't work. This happened the day after I bought a mouse for it, so I
 don't know if this has anything to do with it. Please, I would appreciate the advice and help, thank you.

<p>
</p><p>Thank&nbsp;you&nbsp;for posting&nbsp;your&nbsp;reply and updating on the requested&nbsp;information.&nbsp;We apologize for the delay in response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to check if the issue persists in a Clean Boot&nbsp;state. <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows
 7, or Windows Vista. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.</span></p>

            <p>This is one of <em>many </em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">disk based</span> games being blocked from loading by a malware (AKA - DRM Blocking)
</p>
<p>developed by MS&nbsp; for Win10, which has also been 'quietly' installed into people's Win7/8/8.1 via Windows updates.</p>
<p>I believe you will find a file titled&nbsp; - <em>secdrv.sys</em> - on the games disk. Any game with this file will be blocked by Windows.</p>
<p>I have more details, and the options for circumventing DRM Blocking,&nbsp; in my rant&nbsp;
