<h2>            Is anyone else frustrated and disappointed with Microsoft Office for Mac Support&#63;</h2>
                    I have purchased MANY versions of Office for my Mac computers, my MacBook Air, my MacBook Pro and now a new iMac and new iPad. &nbsp;I cannot understand how Microsoft support service can be THIS BAD. &nbsp;I just purchased the new iMac and had all of my files migrated
 from my MacBook Pro...the only thing not working...you guessed it...Microsoft Office!
<div><br />
<div>I spent 55 minutes on line getting to technical support, only to discover I wasn't in the correct cue for Mac support...another 40 minutes and now Mac Support says they cannot deal with a reinstallation of the product PURCHASED ON LINE (remember, there
 are no cd disk drives on macs or iPads these days). &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now I am on hold for the THIRD TIME...it's 90 minutes and counting and I still haven't spoken with anyone in India (I believe) who can assist. &nbsp;All I want to do is trade my existing Office for Mac to the 365 on line subscription so I NEVER HAVE TO CALL
 TECH SUPPORT AGAIN. &nbsp;Why do other software companies make their tech support MUCH EASIER for customers who HAVE PAID for their products.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>I am now on line with Sales Support...guess what...despite having the October 2013 installation date and the product id on all of the applications, they are telling me I only show a TRAIL version...pretty amazing since I PAID FOR THE FULL VERSION AND HAVE
 BEEN RUNNING IT ON MY MAC BOOK AIR SINCE OCTOBER.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>We are closing in on TWO HOURS and just now the sales support person is asking about a transfer to the 365 product...does any one know if that will work on all three Mac products or am I asking for even more problems?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'd appreciate hearing from others...is this really how Microsoft handles their customers?</div>
                </div>

            <i>You think Microsoft is bad? You haven't dealt with Adobe. It’s a Fact All software companies (except Apple so far) have gone to shipping support to foreign Countries. They teach them enough English words to get by and have them read scripts. The "Bean
 Counters" in the company do this to save money. But instead, all its doing is driving a way customers causing the company to lose even more money. the the Officers and BOD wring their hands and can't figure out why even with the lower prices they are losing
 customers. I have no objection to foreigners doing Support&nbsp; But they must actually trained in the use of the software, not just read scripts. And know how to speak whatever language they are assigned to fluently. And Must have Diction Training so that they
 have no detectable accent so we know what they are saying. I've experience Foreign support And I've asked them to repeat what they are saying because I couldn't understand. So I just gave up and figured it for myself.
</i><br />
<br />
Your problem is caused by your transferring Office from old machine to new machine using Apple's Migration Assistant.<br />
<br />
You can use Migration Assistant to transfer your Files. <br />
<br />
You need install new. And use use the License key from your DVD.<br />
<br />
To properly install do the following: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2398768" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2398768</a><br />

            Thanks for responding Phillip but as you might know new Macs and iPads don't use DVDs...
<div><br />
<div>I have to say, even Adobe is better than this....MUCH BETTER. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Since they went to the Creative Cloud it's rare that I ever have issues with their applications and their customer service response times are pretty good.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am even more concerned with using Microsoft's 365 since they don't seem to have their act together for PREPAID customers. &nbsp;Any suggestions on how to contact management at Microsoft to file an official complaint?</div>

            Diane is Correct about iPad. I didn't pickup on part of your commentary in which you said Mac's
<b><u>and iPads</u></b> don't have DVD Drives. <br />
<br />
There will not be office version for iPad unless two things happen<br />
<ol>
<li>Surface Tablets gain enough Market share that it wouldn't make any difference whether there was an iPad version.</li><li>Surface Bombs and Microsoft withdraws it from the Market.</li></ol>
<p>According to ZDnet, cNet, and Computerworld news feeds, Microsoft already has the Office365 in the can for iPad. But are refusing to release it Until Surface sales have gone up enough where releasing the iPad version won't matter.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Curious thing though it is available for the iPhone. But even that is not the same as what you'd get on Mac It's the cut-down, bare-bones, web version.

            <p>I finally took the plunge and went over to Mac, was assured that Office for Mac was working great. &nbsp;What a mistake. &nbsp;The support is absolutely appalling. &nbsp;They are not helpful and you can't understand them anyway. &nbsp;I finally gave up on my sync'ing problems
 and subscribed to Office 365, but migrating data over was another nightmare. &nbsp;The one good thing is that that support is in India, and so there is a tad better communication.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I am finally doing more work in the Office for Mac suite, I am so disappointed at the little things we took for granted that are no longer available. &nbsp;Such as attaching documents to a calendar item in Outlook. &nbsp;And losing the pencil and eraser in Excel.
 &nbsp;And i'm sure I'll find more as time goes on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am tempted to bag it, and just put Windows on this beautiful but unfriendly Macbook Pro. &nbsp;Would love to hear comments from others about the differences and the workarounds in Office for Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS And you just mention the words Microsoft Office in the Apple store and they think you are the devil incarnate. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Expecting Office for Mac to be the same as the Windows version is a bad assumption. Outlook in particular pales in comparison.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At least with O365 you can install a version of Office on a virtual machine without having to pay again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry you got bad advice before making the plunge.</p>

<h2>            Control appearance of Outlook 2016 Folder pane &#38; To-do bar</h2>
                    <p><span>My Folder pane looks like this for most folders,</span></p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6687c944-f618-4d5a-b368-e4999411a108" /></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp; </span></span><span>and this is what I want it to look like
</span></span><span><span>- my folder Shortcuts are all visible and arranged how it suits me to have them.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>However, if I select the Calendar Shortcut, the Folder pane changes its appearance to this</span></span></p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1dac213d-6370-48f4-bd28-a533e9c29ffa" /></p>

</span></span><span>I have to scroll down to see them.</span><span><span>&nbsp; </span>
</span><span>I cannot find a way to suppress display of the Date picker in the Folder pane.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>On a similar note, I cannot use the To-do Bar on the right-hand side to display multiple months, I cannot use it to pick the dates to display in the main window and I cannot suppress display of forthcoming appointments in the To-do Bar.</span><span><span>&nbsp;

            <p>1) It is not possible to change that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Not possible either. You can show more months in the Navigation Pane but that would mean more scrolling for you.</p>

    <title>Win 10 and WHS v1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mrbigbo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 10 and WHS v1</h2>
                    <p>Just wondering if anyone else is using WHS v1.</p>
<p>I have no intention of changing my&nbsp;WHS (unless support is completely withdrawn) so am very interested in how Windows 10 will integrate with WHS v1, I have been using it with Win 7 and 8.1 with no problems at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far Win 10 has been problem free until the latest build. I have found that the icons for WHS and LightsOut keep disappearing from the notification area. I am still investigating what is going on but it happens on every restart and sometimes on wake from
 sleep. </p>
<p>
</p><p>WHS console is easily sorted by restarting from the start screen. LightsOut is a little more tricky, a reinstall works but it then wants a restart at which point the icon dissapears again. running the lightsoutclientservice.exe will fix it as well. I am
 almost sure that it is just the icon that is the problem as (and I am still testing this) my backups are still being done. But I have lost the LightsOut functionality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Strangely I am getting&nbsp;a similar&nbsp;issue with Bing Desktop, not sure if these issues are related but I don't like coincidences so just a thought.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will report via the feedback app once I get my head around what is going on. I have tried reinstalling everything as well as starting from scratch with a new WIn10 install.
</p>
<p>Nothing urgent about this as I am using a spare laptop to do my evaluation of win 10 so have nothing to lose, but would be interested to hear from others on their experiences.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>David</p>

            <p><span>SIGH; I dropped WHS some time ago; after&nbsp;having shelled&nbsp;out way too much for a FAILED cause:</span></p>
<p><span>$800: Original HP Home media x86 server /w 500 GB hard drive, /w NOS (workgroup mode ONLY)</span></p>
<p><span>$150:&nbsp;2 GB RAM upgrade/ swap (REALLY 512 MG for a server, let's get real)</span></p>
<p><span>$320: Three, two TB hard drives</span></p>
<p><span>$50: Upgrade DVD media (really upgrade /w no media over the Internet, GET REAL &gt; NOT!!)</span></p>
<p><span>$450:&nbsp;&nbsp;Hardware upgrade to x64 after learning x64 requirement for the upgrade release. ARRGGH!!</span></p>
<p><span>$1,770&nbsp;&nbsp; For a FAILED concept; hook like &amp; sinker.&nbsp; The original&nbsp;HP Media Home Media Server (/w the sweet hot swap RAID setup) was awesome, but it got turned into far more of a require min, setup than I would have ever ventured into to begin with.&nbsp;
 The WHS project&nbsp;/ concept was slated to be designed for the Windows Home Server folks, not a corporate environment.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Rich</p>
<p>Sorry you had so many problems and at huge expense. I built my own server the most expensive parts being the 4 x 2Tb drives, the worst problem I had was a motherboard failure due to a storm one night (now protected). It was not simple at the beginning, so
 not a end user solution but once up and running very nearly problem free. I have had more problems installing NAS drives for friends with auto backup!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had another failure of the client software on Win 10 but cannot yet find the reason.</p>
<p>Will report when I do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume no one else is using WHS v1?</p>
<p>

            <p>For everything WHS is &amp; has beeen able to do the expense is cheap, if not nearly free in all honesty.&nbsp; I LOVE WHS, although the latest expense to take it to Windows Server Essentials for the next released version of WHS is more than&nbsp;we have to spend for
 it usefulliness.&nbsp; On the other hand if&nbsp;we had not fallen in Love, &amp; our desire for&nbsp; the next best thing in the World in receiving our daughter&nbsp;we most likely wouldn't be bothered&nbsp;to spend an additional $1k+ for the upgraded server release.<br />
Maybe some day down the road&nbsp;we will have it, but for the time being spending time with our daugher, &amp; her&nbsp;education comes before anything else.</p>

            <p>I have found a solution, so to close this post, when using the Start Screen these programs do not start, I switched to using the Start Menu all works just fine.
</p>
<p>Bing Desktop and Synaptics enhanced features also suffered from the same fault both now cured.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully the Start Screen issue will be resolved as I do not want the Start Menu.</p>

            Yes, there are still some of us with V1's.&nbsp; I concur with <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/37b94f94-1f76-44fc-9013-fbe7b368b551" title="richmaynard-jr">
 computer systems that will simply do what&nbsp;I&nbsp;bought them&nbsp;to do without having to spend lots of time and effort with required upgrades, patches, fixes, and such.&nbsp;&nbsp;My V1&nbsp;has been quietly and effectively backing up our computers, storing our pictures, videos and
 music, and doing it without complaint.&nbsp; Could never get the streaming video, photo sharing, and other bells and whistles working well, but they have all been replaced with better services anyway.&nbsp; I do keep an eye on disk health (have replaced&nbsp;and upsized
 a few over the years)&nbsp;and keep the AV current, but other than that it just hums along and adds a nice soft blue glow to our master bedroom closet.&nbsp; It has NEVER lost any data (that I've noticed at least) and I have used it on several occasions to do a bare-metal
 restore for a crashed drive in a PC (one recovery is worth the price of the server!).&nbsp; It was nice when there were more developers for the add-ins. A nod to Kentdome and Alex Kuretz especially for some of the handiest and capable of the lot.&nbsp; I added a hardened
 external drive for backing up the critical information and PC backup sets&nbsp;(fireproof, waterproof, etc.).&nbsp; It's disappointing when a company can't just leave a winning solution be.&nbsp; OK, I'll quit lamenting, but it will be like losing a faithful friend when
 it finally gets too old to be maintained.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm on Win 10 Tech Preview with WHS v1 as well! </p>
<p>
</p><p>All was working OK for a while, but suddenly I got the "passwords don't match" message, and I think it's because MSFT really wants me to use a connected MSFT account (vs. local Windows account), which is creating a problem for syncing accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried moving my account to a local Windows account, but soooo many services (like the store, OneDrive, and even modern apps like Office preview apps) seemed to demand I use the linked MSFT account).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone figured out a way around this? </p>

<p>
</p><p>On one of my Windows 8 PC's when I accessed a folder on the server the first time&nbsp;it gave me the option to enter my credentials ie my user name on WHS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My wifes tablet does not give me that option so I went to credentials manager, clicked on&nbsp;windows credentials, add a windows credential.
</p>
<p>Use your server nam</p>
<p>Enter your user name as "clientpcname\whs username" and the whs users password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that helps</p>

<h3> tomscot2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is Microsoft going to fix this or do I have to another solution to sync my calendar and contacts</h2>
                    <p>About a year ago I signed up for Office 365 Home version. &nbsp;the main reason was so I could reliably keep mine and my wife's email, calendar and contacts in sync with our respective Outlook 2016 and Outlook for Android.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to create an Outlook.com account using the email address (pobox.com) I have used for 19 years. &nbsp;I did not have to create an outlook.com email address. &nbsp;I was able to connect my pobox.com IMAP and SMTP accounts to this account. I was then able
 to connect my Outlook 2016 via Exchange Active Sync (EAS) and everything started working exactly the way I wanted. &nbsp;I just needed one account in my Outlook 2016 profile with my pobox.com email as my username to login and then send and recieive email and sync
 the calendar, contacts and tasks with my phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then two weeks ago my Outlook 2016 lost syncing ability. It still connected to the EAS account but it could not sync. &nbsp;I quickly discovered that "transition" to the Microsoft Exchange based Outlook.com had taken place. &nbsp;From then I have spend 20-30 hours
 trying to figure how to make it work as smoothly as it worked before. &nbsp;Apparently, that is not possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I have discovered is the following:</p>
<p>1. I had to create an outlook.com email address in order to login from Outllook 2016 or Outlook for Android.</p>
<p>Even though my From address is my pobox.com email, and primary alias is my pobox.com email, any email sent from my outlook.com account has the outlook.com email address on behalf my pobox.com email.</p>
<p>2. I had to add back my old IMAP and SMTP account to access my pobox.com email. &nbsp;However, even though I have set the account as my default sending and receiving when forward or reply the outlook.com email address is the default from account.</p>
<p>3. In Outlook for Android, all Contacts or Calendar items orignially created with my pobox.com login cannot be edited or deleted.</p>
<p>4. Finally, the email address created: *** Email address is removed for privacy *** now shows up something like *** Email address is removed for privacy *** when I send from Outlook 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>THIS IS A BLEEPING NIGHTMARE. &nbsp;NOT TO MENTION THAT MY WIFE IS YELLING AT ME ALL DAY LONG BECAUSE THE SAME THING IS HAPPENING TO HER.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is &nbsp;anyone at Microsoft working fixing this or do I need to find another solution?</p>
<p />

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Since the calendars and contacts are not syncing in your Outlook 2016, we would suggest you to
<strong>create a new user profile and set it up as default. </strong>When you create a new profile, you can still configure your account using Exchange Active Sync. In this case, it will re sync all your emails, calendar and contacts on your Outlook. Let’s
 see if this will serve as a workaround to the issue we’re having. You can refer to setup email in Outlook 2016 through this

            <p>This is a joke, right? Microsoft screws up Outlook.com, and computer users are expected to create entirely new user accounts on their machines, with all the hassle that entails, in order to see if that helps fix the giant mess Microsoft created by pushing
 an "upgrade" that didn't upgrade anything, but only unleashed thousands of problems?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook has been a nightmare on my windows phone ever since this upgrade, and not a single suggested solution has helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is exactly why everyone is ditching Microsoft products, and Microsoft's mobile is on death's door. I have been an early adopter and fan of MSFT products for years, but the constant screw ups on major issues like this have finally pushed me far enough,
 and I will be buying zero Microsoft devices from here on out.</p>

<h2>            E61 - synchronize a non-standard contact folder&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am routinely synchronizing my contacts between Outlook and my phone using Mail4Exchange. In our company, a synchronization has now been set up whereby all the consultants get all the company's contacts in their Outlook contact folder. For reasons of a)
 security and b) ease of use, I find it quite - interesting to have about 500 contacts on my phone, contacts of people who probably would not be very amused to find their data is being carried around on phones.</p>
<p>The short end is, I would like to make a separate folder with only my own contacts and synchronize only that with my phone so I don't have to search a lot whenever I want to find one of my contacts - can I somehow set up Mail for Exchange to do that?</p>
<p>Thanks a lot!</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>more precisely: I am synching my Exchange contacts via Mail4Exchange. At the office, I have those in Outlook.</p>
<p>On my mobile I can create several groups with contacts, so I can create one group which has only private contacts and that will be like a second adress book.</p>
<p>That might be a solution: I know that Outlook contacts will be synched into my main adress book, but whenever I add a private contact myself, I can add it to that group.</p>

            OK, that works quite nicely.<br />
Only it really slows down my mobile. Can I somehow make it store the contacts on the SD card instead of in the phone memory?<br />
Thanks a lot!

                    <p>I have a OneNote page at work with links to other pages in that same OneNote. </p>

<p>The link starting with <strong>onenote </strong>was originally only created and valid for starting
<strong>OneNote 201x&nbsp;</strong>(or, later, for starting <strong>OneNote</strong>), depending on the file type association in Windows. Now it works even in
<strong>OneNote Online</strong>. </p>
<p>So it's now compatible with a classic Hyperlink, starting with <strong>https</strong>, which is created by using OneNote Online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you look into the clipboard after copying a link in OneNote (2016)&nbsp;you'll see that you got
<strong>two </strong>links:&nbsp;a https-link <strong>and </strong>a onenote link. That's some history. In older OneNote versions (e.g. 2010) they had the opposite order. This order is relevant because the first link is used when pasted into OneNote. So your
<strong>onenote</strong> links come from an older OneNote version, at least an older OneNote 2016.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>770 WiFi connectivity issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> relen  say:</h3>
<h2>            770 WiFi connectivity issue</h2>
                    I just acquired a Nokia 770 Internet Tablet and it is a wonderful device, except in one area that is rather important: the WiFi capability only functions within a few metres of the access point - in fact I need to have all four bars in the display showing
 (green) or I can't access anything! <br />
<br />
Searching the Net I find that this is apparently quite a common problem, and according to one review it may be due to a hardware fault. I have tried all manner of different settings on my Belkin access point, to no avail; I can see several WiFi networks in
 the area but I can't connect to other open ones either. There are other users who have reported good operation with the Belkin access point and as a result I doubt this is merely a problem of interoperability between these two specific devices.
<br />
<br />
Any observations on this problem would be gratefully received. Is there an advance replacement procedure to swap the unit (I am in the UK), and if so who do I talk to? I have had variable luck in the past contacting Nokia support - I tend to be sent round in
 a circle. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any advice.<br />

            Hi relen,<br />
<br />
maybe you could check following setting in your 770:<br />
Connection setup: Advanced settings/Other.<br />
Is WLAN transmission power configured to 100 mW?<br />
<br />
Did you try your 770 with other access points/public hot spots? Does it work better with them?<br />
<br />

            Hi Relen!<br />
<br />
Do you know what version of software you have on your 770? You can find out by going to control panel - device - about product.<br />
<br />
You may want to update the software on your tablet, the latest version is available on
<a href="http://europe.nokia.com/nokia/0,,79636,00.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">770 software downloads</a>. This version was released at the end of December, so you may want to think about updating if you continue to have problems.<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

            Thanks for the comments... dealing with both of them in the one reply.<br />
<br />
There are a few open access points nearby which show up with two bars on the display, but I can't get into them. I have not yet had the opportunity to try to connect to a public access point, but will be doing so as soon as I can.<br />
<br />
The unit is running the latest system software as indicated on the web site (3.2005.51-13).<br />
<br />
Looking at comments elsewhere on the Net, this is apparently a known problem, but not purely a matter of distance from the access point. It's being suggested that the 770 is at a disadvantage where there is a lot of WiFi activity. I'm afraid I was rather assuming
 that the performance would be similar to my other WiFi devices, which work anywhere in the house or garden.
<br />
<br />
I've tried a number of different channels, keeping clear of channels in use by other networks I can see with NetStumbler, to no avail. Until I find a better solution I'm temporarily moving the access point into the living room!<br />
<br />
Any further suggestions welcome...<br />
<br />

            do you happen to be trying this in a built up area? i live in a city centre flat, if i do a scan with netstumbler i see a lot of open networks and ap's - but i cannot connect to any of them.<br />
<br />
the reason for this is that many businesess use fake ap's to stop war driving. if i check netstunble i get like 84 open networks and some closed ones.<br />
<br />
maybe you are trying to get on to the fake ap's?

            There are five or six other networks showing up in the 770's connections panel. I live on the edge of a village, and the other nets are owned by my relatively near neighbours, all but one of whom I know. At least two of the open ones are definitely open
 - I can get in with any of our laptops. Can't get in with the 770 though.<br />

            ok, in that case do you know if they limit the amount of ip's available for dhcp? or if they are not using this, do they limit the time at which a non-trusted ip can connect?<br />
<br />
also, do they use any mac address filtering? for instance on my router i can let in only trusted mac addresses or ban some from other manufacturers.

            I doubt it in both cases (MAC filtering and IP pool limitations), as I didn't connect (successfully) to their networks with a laptop until after I'd failed with the 770. I actually use MAC filtering, so it's something I account for.<br />
<br />
Incidentally, in my case, the 770 behaves totally normally within a few feet of the access point. Further away it claims to have connected ("W" in globe is solid) but in fact hasn't - DHCP fails to get a valid address (it gets a default 169... and it should
 get a 176...) while even given a fixed address it also doesn't talk to anything ("network error on [URL]" - boy, that's helpful!); further away still, eg in the next room, and it doesn't even say it's connected ("W" in globe flashing until it gives up).<br />
<br />
Apart from the fact that it can see a few local WiFi networks as well as mine, the unit behaves as if its antenna has fallen off!<br />

            Since upgrading to version 51-13 I can no longer get DHCP from any open WiFi networks I try. And I have tried lots of different ones just to see if any would provide me DHCP (about 50 to 100). I used to be able to to connect and get DHCP, but this now
 only work from the networks that I restored from my backup (which are all WEP or WPA).

            I returned my N770 to Communicaid in Huntingdon, who promptly lost it (whenever I deal with them, especially with their front-end telephone staff, I get this feeling that they are not really set up to deal with members of the public).<br />
<br />
After about three months and some chasing, they sent me a new unit. The new one works brilliantly and I can get into most WiFi nodes with no issues, although the latest firmware update appears to have slightly degraded the WiFi performance.<br />

<h2>            Excel for Mac crashing when running macro to import csv file</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">I'm really pulling out my hair on this one. The following VBA code works fine on Excel for Mac 2011 and some versions of 2016, but not the latest build (15.35). I've tried removing parts that update pivot tables with no success.
 I also initially thought that running .Calculate on individual ranges was causing things to crash (hence the If Mac .Calculate), but I don't think that's it either.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Also, I've already verified that Excel for Mac does NOT like&nbsp;.Refresh BackgroundQuery:=False, which is why the On Error Resume Next is right above it. Without it .Refresh BackgroundQuery:=False, data doesn't load at all, without
 the On Error Resume Next right above it, Excel For Mac throws a VBA error.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Anyway, is there something in here that I'm overlooking? To be clear, there is no error displayed, just a crash.</p>

            <p>It's really hard for us to know how you acquired your license in the first place because you didn't state that information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use Apple's Migration Assistant (Applications &gt; Utilities) to restore your installation from a backup image. Or you can use Time Machine to restore from your Time Machine backup if you copy all the Office files (including preference files in both
 Library folders) from the same point in time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or you can find someone who has Office 2008 and isn't using it any more and ask them to give or sell it to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or maybe you're still student, faculty, or staff and could install something newer:</p>

<h2>            Crashing when deleting messages... 2700c</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I'm new on this forum. I'm Rafal, and I'm from Poland, I'm eighteen. Good evening :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From few days I have enormous problem with my phone - Nokia 2700 classic. In my inbox is 7000 messages, in Outbox 8000. Together 15000... from a few days I have a problem with the turning on phone. if the phone runs correctly, I try to delete some messages.
 when I try to delete messages (singly or over a dozen), the phone crash - black screen, the keybord doesen't work - I must remove battery and put again to the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I upgraded firmware from 7.75 to 9.95 with NSU. No results. ;(</p>
<p>I tried any codes like #*7370# - no results...</p>
<p>Even Nokia Communication Centre can't delete any sms...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe I could format phone memory? Just HOW?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help! &nbsp;:(</p>

<p>Just had same issue, had 785 messages to delete.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like others the screen went blank and I thought it had crashed, but if you press a button and wait a while you will see the screen come back on and it is very slowly deleting them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On mine it was taking 10 seconds per messages to delete them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every 100 or so I clicked waited for the screen to appear and then cancelled the operation and then started again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Took an hour or so but eventually deleted them all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just tested again and it deleted messages instantly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looks like I need to keep on top of things and delete them more often. I usually do it every 200 or so messages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've had other nokias that actually crash (as in lock up and require a battery out restart) when they receive a message and they have reached max memory, then its a real pain as every time the network tries to deliver the message it crashes the phone and
 its not obvious at first that its because its full.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<p>I don't get the screen afterwards...</p>
<p>I removed the battery and put it on and switched it on and after a few minutes of switching on the cell goes blank.</p>
<p>I have to switch it off and on for about 20 times before i can use it...</p>

    <title>Unicode symbols display as red - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ivy_s  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unicode symbols display as red</h2>
                    <p>When I use IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) diacritics in Word 2016, they display as red. Example below.&nbsp;I recognize that this is because of file encoding types. However, none of the encoding types appear to support these characters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that when exporting to pdf, the diacritics also show up red in the pdf. I might be able to edit the colour of the diacritics in Acrobat, but I would prefer to do it in Word. Is there a way in Word to change the red unicode characters to default/black?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any advice!</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2007 Programmatic Security and windows 7</h2>
                    
<p><span>I am investigating changing settings in our Programmatic Security settings.&nbsp; When I make a change to our Group Policy settings:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>In windows 7 the options in the OL user interface does not change and the options are&nbsp;grayed out, when looking in Outlook &gt; Tools &gt; Trust Center &gt; Programmatic Access.</span></li><li><span>In windows XP the option is changed and the user is able to make changes, it is not grayed out.&nbsp;</span></li></ul>
<span>
<span>
<p><span>Also&nbsp;changes made in Outlook 2007 client is not reflected in the registry. (</span><span>HKCU\software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Outlook\Security\ObjectModelGuard)</span></p>
<p>This cannot be by design so how would I ensure the settings are the way we want them "Always warn me about suspicious activity".&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also why does win7&nbsp;gray out the options and winXP does not?&nbsp; How do I make both of them so the users cannot change the settings?</p>
<p>&nbsp;Thank you</p>

<h2>            Helvetica French Accents</h2>
                    Ever since i updated the Mac OS X a week ago, I have had trouble typing in French accents (é, è, î, à, etc. )&nbsp; in Microsoft Word with my desired font.&nbsp; No matter what font I use, all of the French accents show up in Helvetica.&nbsp; I have tried highlighting
 the letter with the accent, and changing it to a different font, and it won't work.&nbsp; I have tried retyping the entire word, and the font changes to Helvetica as soon as I type in the accent. I have tried changing the different styles so that the default will
 be some font other than Helvetica - but the letter with the accent remains Helvetica.&nbsp; I have tried disabling the Helvetica font family from the Font book, and that didn't work either.&nbsp; Any help on this would be GREATLY appreciated.

<p>Hi Phil SG,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are System Requirements when you install Skype for business on Mac:</p>
<p>1. Skype for Business Server 2015 or Lync Server 2013</p>
<p>2. OSX 10.11 (El Capitan) or OSX 10.12 (Sierra)</p>
<p>3. Outlook Mac build 15.27 (161010) required for Outlook integration</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, we install Skype for business on High Sierra OS which version is 10.13.2 successfully.</p>
<p>So please click the Apple icon at the top menu &gt; choose About this Mac, then check if you OSX version meets the requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, please follow the steps in this site to install Skype for business again:</p>

    <title>We Need the ability to edit or create custom sweep rules - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            We Need the ability to edit or create custom sweep rules</h2>
                    WHEN are we going to get the ability to edit or create custom sweep rules? It's frustrating that we cannot sweep based on domain name and have to create a sweep rule for every email address under a given domain name. For example, I want to delete all email
 older than 30 days from "somecharity.org", but Microsoft Outlook forces me to create a separate sweep rule for *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, etc. Outlook will only accept a full email address when creating a sweep rule and
 will not allow editing of existing sweep rules. I've submitted this request to Outlook feedback multiple times over the last year.

            <p>Hi steppinwolf,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We understand that you wish to have a feature wherein you can schedule a cleanup for messages that came from a specific domain. In this case, we would like to inform you that, that feature is yet to be available
 in Outlook.com. What you can do is either set a scheduled cleanup for specific email address, or create an email rule for the whole domain. When you create an email rule for a domain to automatically move to a specifc folder, then you will lose the option
 to set a timeframe as to when those emails will be deleted. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, there is a workaround for this. You may create an email rule and move the folders in your Junk folder (all emails in the Junk folder will be deleted automatically after 10 days).</p>
<p>To create an email rule, please follow the simple steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Sign in to your Microsoft account.</span><span>
</span></li><li>
<span>Navigate to your Inbox page.</span><span>
</span></li><li>
<span>Click the cogwheel icon on the upper right corner of the page, then select
<b><font>More mail settings...</font></b></span><span>

<h2>            Problem with opening the Excel spreadsheets</h2>
                    I can not create an Excel 2007 file(xlsx) that will open without excel telling me that there is unreadable content in the workbook and that it needs to be repaired.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If I say yes to repair, the file is opened with another dialog with the message<br />
<br />
Removed Records: Cell information from /xl/worksheets/sheet1.xml part&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The contents from the log file &nbsp;are as follows<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes" ?&gt;<br />
- &lt;recoveryLog xmlns="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/spreadsheetml/2006/main"&gt;<br />
&nbsp; &lt;logFileName&gt;error062080_01.xml&lt;/logFileName&gt;<br />
&nbsp; &lt;summary&gt;Errors were detected in file 'E:\IMReports\MyTest.xlsx'&lt;/summary&gt;<br />
- &lt;removedRecords summary="Following is a list of removed records:"&gt;<br />
&nbsp; &lt;removedRecord&gt;Removed Records: Cell information from /xl/worksheets/sheet1.xml part&lt;/removedRecord&gt;<br />
&nbsp; &lt;/removedRecords&gt;<br />
- &nbsp;&lt;/recoveryLog&gt;<br />
Please help me as to how I can narrow down the problem. With this log, I am not sure what cell is in error. Thanks in advance.<br />

            How large are the spread sheets that will not open?&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Do you have time machine backups where you can retrieve a version before the - won't open?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Also, in utilities menu, console - check the logs for any error messages<br />
<br />
Or try use EXCEL Repair Kit. A Microsoft Excel repair tool for corrupted Excel spreadsheets. Program open, read and save data from damaged Excel files. Info:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.excel.repair/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.excel.repair/</a>
