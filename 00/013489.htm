<h2>            Upgrade Issues</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft offered to upgrade my Office 2013 to Office 2016.&nbsp; I did so and it has been a nightmare ever since.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Computer is not very slow</p>
<p>2. Excel freezes up and must be shut down with loss of data</p>
<p>3. One Note lost most of the files stored in it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I uninstall 2016 and re-install 2013?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>For years I has a Microsoft hater because of all the bugs and freeze-ups associated with their programs, but the last 5 years have been pretty good...until now!</p>

<p>1. &nbsp;I run a Lenovo T450S with a dual drive and it has been fast, really fast. &nbsp;I have 32 meg of ram and with a SSD it has been great. When I upgraded Office from 13 to 16 the processing has slowed considerably with both Outlook and Excel. &nbsp;Unfortunately
 this does not happen all the time.</p>
<p>2. With outlook it stalls for up to 15 seconds with a "not responding" response but eventually completes the action.</p>
<p>3. With Excel the program simply stops and locks up everything. &nbsp;No error code. &nbsp;I am able to access the task manager and it shows no cpu or hard drive activity. &nbsp;The only way out is to "end task"</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;The same thing that happens with Excel happens with Publisher.</p>
<p>5. I check for updates and the only issue that occurs is "&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2437b59b-2f82-4be2-b9c4-52257ed01224" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2437b59b-2f82-4be2-b9c4-52257ed01224" /></a></p>
<p>6. &nbsp;I received a message when I logged into my Office 365 that said my Office 365 subscription could be upgraded from 2013 to 2016 and asked if I wanted to do it and I said yes. &nbsp; This occurred about 10 days ago.</p>

<p>You have a 365 subscription which should have auto updated to 365/2016 a looong time ago.</p>
<p>In Programs &amp; Features repair your Office installation.</p>
<p>You need to fix the update problems with your HP printer</p>

<p>Yes, the "free upgrade" is "feature" the Office 365 subscription. The upgrade is built in to the cost of the subscription.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am surprised that you are only seeing the upgrade now. You should have seen it more than a year and a half ago.&nbsp; That suggests your update error is quite severe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please go into File menu &gt; Account command and report the version and build numbers displayed there.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have any specific suggestions for that error code, but I have found this note:</p>

</p><p>I don't know if you can still do a "retrograde upgrade".&nbsp; It was an option when 2016 first came out, but I think I read that the option is no longer offered.&nbsp; You'll just have to try.&nbsp; Here is a tip on how it could be done:</p>
<div>
<strong><span>How do I use the Office 365/2016 offline installer? Downgrade to Office 2013 - Down Grade - Back out</span></strong><span>
<strong>/ 64-bit Installer</strong></span>
<p>NOTE: downgrade to 2013 may no longer be an option (I haven’t tested it recently)</p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<p><strong>"Important note for Office 365 subscriptions:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After February 28, 2017, you won't be able to download and install Office 2013 as part of your Office 365 subscription; and since September 22, 2016, the same applies to Office for Mac 2011."</p>
<p>&lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>FYI: from their origins the Office applications were designed to be “user friendly”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Part of that is you can uninstall it (through the control panel) and re-install it without losing customizations you have done. This was done to allow doing a re-install as a simple, “brute force”, trouble shooting technique.

<h2>            conditional formatting why does the cell turn red when blank</h2>
                    <p>hi, i have a structured cf system in place in the form of a traffic light system. if there are numbers in the cell it will change. however when the cell turns blank the cell colours red. i have tried everything. thre is a formula in the cell even when the
 cell is blank as it is populated based on other cells.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I am guessing it turns red because it is using a value of "0" for your blank cell, and you have it set to turn red for, eg. values less than 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could add another cf rule which is to format with 'no color' fill, for Cell Value equal to 0.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps</p>

                    I am sure you got many many complaints before you MADE everyone go to Outlook, but you just ignored them....I know myself I have sent you quite a few. &nbsp;The look is terrible...the way it works is almost non-existent, and as for trying to send pictures or
 videos...just forget about it!!!! &nbsp;I see so many other people on here that are very unhappy with this program. &nbsp;I am seriously thinking about going to Gmail or something other than Outlook. &nbsp;My Hotmail account never gave me any trouble until you interferred.

            I agree 100%. &nbsp;I have been using hotmail since it first became available. &nbsp;I have NEVER had issues. &nbsp;Why do you forcibly change it to something else that is not user friendly? &nbsp;You can't attach documents. &nbsp;Where is the forward button? &nbsp;I shouldn't have
 to do an internet search to figure out how to send an email. &nbsp;Please fix it, or bring back the old hotmail. &nbsp;I don't want to change my hotmail.com account as I have had it for years, but I am going to if this doesn't change soon &nbsp;- &nbsp;this new interface is not
 working out for me.

            Yes the new messenger really stinks...You have no way of deleting your messages...and I have tried every so called 'trick' out there that I Googled. &nbsp;Sometimes it takes so long to go from inbox to deleted, that I have mistakenly deleted my inbox instead.
 &nbsp;And although there is a post out there saying how to retrieve your deletes...forget it because it doesn't work...there is no way to retrieve them. &nbsp;GRRRRRRRR is all I can say. &nbsp;As someone else on here said "if it wasn't so difficult to change my email address,
 I would have done it long ago". &nbsp;I have had my hotmail address for what seems forever and do not want to change...sure wish outlook would change. &nbsp;The thing that bothers me the most is that I have complained and complained, as much as everyone else, but NOTHING<span>
</span>HAS CHANGED!!!
<div>Plus, they keep saying they are 'looking into' everything, but it seems that is just a statement and not a fact.</div>

            I don't know about everyone else, but sometimes Outlook lags greatly, and it is not my computer or my WiFi.&nbsp; It takes forever to get from one email to the next, and it is very aggravating.&nbsp; It sure doesn't get any better.&nbsp; And the idea that you can retrieve
 a mistakenly deleted email??&nbsp; What a joke!!

<h3> frustratedagain---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 710 wont turn on</h2>
                    
<p>I've had my phone about a month.&nbsp; I noticed right from the beginning that is didn't last through a slow day and would have to be recharged.&nbsp; I assumed this was because it was an android phone and I was coming from a basic flip phone.&nbsp; Last night it died
 (which has happened before) and I plugged it in.&nbsp; It started vibrating every 10 seconds or so and would flash a shot of a battery in the red.&nbsp; But after charging for awhile I tried to turn it on and would either get a slightly grey lit screen, the red empty
 battery, or just a vibration.&nbsp; I let it charge through the night and now it just vibrates.&nbsp; I've changed out the battery with another matching phone and it works on theirs, so I'm back to thinking its the unit itself.&nbsp; I've done the hard reset holding down
 the power, volume and camera button.&nbsp; I've tried with and without the sim card.</p>

If this fails id suggest taking it to a nokia care center<br />

            Word 2010 documents are .docx files by default. I suspect that you are experiencing a problem caused by the current round of updates, which seems to have destroyed the file associations for Office apps. To correct the problem, right-click on one of these
 files and choose <strong>Open With</strong>, then <strong>Choose Default Program</strong>. Select "Microsoft Client Virtualization Handler." This should correct the problem.

<h2>            6070&#58; Some message function miss.</h2>
                    I've just bought Nokia 6070. I'm disapointed because I couldn't find some of useful function of message which is appeared in my old 3120. Please tell me how to find these function if it exist:<br />
1.Delete all report at the same time. I lost a lot of time to delete reports. As usual, I open the report and it has a function "Delete all report" but in 6070, I can't find this menu.<br />
2. Delete message automatically when the inbox is full. When the inbox is full, I have to delete them manually. It's very disavantage.<br />
Thank you very much.

<h2>            Inserted .png picture appears tiny</h2>
                    When I try to insert our logo, the images show up in the document incredibly small. I have the logo in various sizes, all .PNG format, but they all appear in maybe 10% of their actual size. When I right click the picture and select format picture, size
 settings, it shows that the size is 100%, and I even if I change it manually to 100% and click OK, it still appears tiny.<br />

<h2>            Create A Two Part Table Of Contents, Add An Index And A Glossary Word 2016</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, sorry if these are really simple questions, I'm starting my Dissertation and it's all a bit daunting. I'm using Word 2016 part of my Office 365 subscription to build this document. I do have some experience of Office software but I've never
 had to work with Table of Contents, Index, Glossary before. Please could someone help me out?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been given document format guidelines covering fonts, line spacing, paragraph styles but I'm struggling with "Referencing."</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Can I create a TOC at the same time that I setup the document formatting/layout or do you add the Contents page after you have written all the text?</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>I followed a HOW-TO video and tried to create a practice Contents Page doing the following: clicked Layout &gt; Breaks &gt; Page. This added a new page where I wanted the TOC. But then the video told me to "hit return 5x to get to middle of page. Click Layout
 &gt; Breaks, select Section Breaks &gt; Next Page...</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I did that and it added a second blank page. Is this correct? My document now has 2 sections, a Title Page, a printing information page (where copyright page in book is put.) The New Contents Page and then a blank page??? It looks wrong. I can't add anything
 to it either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have I done it wrong? Is there anything I can do with it, delete it? It's because of the section break I think.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be really grateful if anyone could help me out with this please. I'm truly stuck. Haven't even attempted numbering yet! Not allowed page numbers on Chapter pages. New Chapters need their own pages. The title being a quarter way down the page and
 not in header.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll need to learn how to stop and start page numbering too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for help you may be able to give I really appreciate it!</p>

            <pre>OK no problem. It is nice to have an easy question every now and then.
Table of Contents are actually quite easy.  Yes the can be created as you create the document.  You said something about a "2-part" TOC?  Describe that more.
Word documents can be formatted in 2 ways.  You can "manually" apply formatting like bold, italics, underlines, font size, indenting etc.  But the preferred  MS way is "styles".  You define a style, then apply it when needed.   Word comes with a bunch of predefined styles you can start with, or modify as you need.  For example you can use that guideline to define some style. 
The predefined styles include 9 levels "Heading" styles. When you use these heading styles, they are automatically used to generate a TOC when you tell Word that you need one.
These Heading styles are work along with 2 other featuers that allow you to re-organize your document and jump around (navigate) in your document. You can turn on a feature called the "Navigation Pane (formerly Document Map)" that displays headings on the right side of the window.  You can also switch into "Outline View" where only headings are displayed as an automatically generated Outline.  Both in the outline view and Navigation pane you can drag the headings to reorganize the document. Non-heading text under the heading is moved with the heading.
The index can be generated as you go, or you can create a list, called a concordance, of words you want to index and use that list to generate the index for you. 
I'm going to give you a bunch of links to articles that will go into more detail about these features (why "re-invent the wheel")
OK, time to stop, these links will keep you busy for a while
Good luck.
*****************************
Bonus Tip!  BACKUPS!
Here is an unasked for bonus tip that you will be hugely greatful for using, or extremely unhappy for not using.
SAVE FREQUENTLY and MAKE FREQUENT BACKUPS.
Ask anyone who has worked on a time sensitive document, like a thesis.  Word has built in technology to recognize when you have done a lot of work without saving.  It will "decide" to crash 10 seconds before you remembered to do a manual save/backup, losing several hours of work!
That technology also knows when deadlines are approaching, and it will cause your document to become "corrupt" right when you don't have time to recreate it.
Save your file frequently. Don't trust the built in autosave features. They fail when most needed.
Use Save As, or Copy/Paste in File explorer to create separate copies of the file. That way if something hapens to the current file, you can fall back to a recent separate backup file.
Personally, I like to add a date/time or "version" number to the end of the file name, ie:
long descriptive file name 2018 01 01.docx
long descriptive file name 2018 01 02.docx
long descriptive file name 2018 01 03a.docx
long descriptive file name 2018 01 03b.docx
long descriptive file name 2018 01 03c.docx (it is a productive day, nearing deadline)
At the very least do it daily. If you get really productive/busy, do it more often.
Keeps lots of backups until you are finished. You never know when corruption is going to "sneak in" 
Although, in theory using OneDrive is good for automated saving for most people, a few people have been reporting problems with it. So, if you are not "collaborating" with someone else in the same file, save to the local drive, then copy / upload the saved file to OneDrive.

@The Basics of Word Styles and Templates: What, Where, How and Why
This collection of 4 short articles provides a quick overview into using Styles and Templates in Word 2016 (and earlier). (There are other similar articles for older versions, which are still relevant.) 
The first article reviews the various formatting options in Word. 
The second tells and SHOWS you where to find all of these features. 
The third is a brief introduction in how to use these tools and features 
The end of the last one covers many of the best reasons for using styles.
Word Styles from the beginning https://office-watch.com/2015/word-styles-from-the-beginning/ 
I know talking about styles in Word makes eyes glaze over but they are a really useful part of Word (plus Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook).
In this article we’ll explain the different types of styles including at least one that sneaked in without many people noticing.   From just one type in the early days of Word, there’s five different style types in Word 2007, Word 2010 and Word 2013.
Word: where are all the Style controls? https://office-watch.com/2016/word-where-are-all-the-style-controls/ 
Microsoft Word, since 2007, has developed a confusing mish-mash of lists, galleries and dialog boxes to view, select and manage styles.  This Office-Watch.com article will try to make sense of it all. It’s a guided tour to the various Style setup, configuration and management options spread around Word.
Intro to Using styles in Microsoft Word  https://michellespaul.wordpress.com/2016/03/23/using-styles-in-microsoft-word/ 
Phew, using styles is a complicated affair. This tiny guide will hopefully put you in the situation where you can confidently share your work with lots of people without the formatting going wrong and it doesn’t matter where you are in your creative process, there are options to suit everyone.

Changing Styles http://wordribbon.tips.net/T010389_Changing_Styles.html 
Styles are a great boon to making your documents look better and making them easier to update. You can change the formatting associated with a specific style, but how you do it depends on the version of Word you are using.
Table of Contents tricks in Word  http://new.office-watch.com/2016/table-of-contents-tricks-in-word/ 
There are many different ways to make a Table of Contents from a Word document.  The standard ways, taught in most classes, force you to format your document in a way that suits Word.  We’ll show you how to get a Table of Contents (TOC) from a document formatted the way you want.
Assigning a Shortcut Key to Styles http://wordribbon.tips.net/T005948_Assigning_a_Shortcut_Key_to_Styles.html
Shortcut keys are a great way to apply styles to text in a document. You can easily create a shortcut key assignment for any style you desire.
How styles in Microsoft Word cascade A Word style can be based on another style. A style inherits the format of its parent. This gives you powerful control over the format of your document. Created August 2002. Last updated July 2008. 	Shauna Kelly

Complex Documents in Microsoft Word Charles Kenyon http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/complex_documents.htm 
Complex documents in a legal environment are plentiful, and generally these documents are to be filed or sent to clients on a time sensitive basis. That's why knowing the ins and outs of the tools that Word has to offer in the quick creation of Tables of Contents, Tables of Authorities, Indices, cross-references (and more) is essential in the timely completion of these documents.

Glossary
create a glossary in Microsoft Word - 
http://www.shaunakelly.com/word/layout/glossary.html 
Word has no built-in mechanism to create glossaries. This article describes several methods for creating a glossary using Word’s built-in features. Version  Word 2000 2002 2003 2007 2010  Created November 2004. Last updated 3 August 2010.
Create an index and update an index https://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word-help/create-an-index-and-update-an-index-HP001226499.aspx
An index lists the terms and topics that are discussed in a document, along with the pages that they appear on. To create an index, you mark the index entries by providing the name of the main entry and the cross-reference in your document, and then you build the index.
Creating an Index Entry for a Range of Pages  https://wordribbon.tips.net/T007015_Creating_an_Index_Entry_for_a_Range_of_Pages.html 
Putting together an index for your documents can be challenging, but Word provides some great tools to make the task easier. If you want to create index entries that span a range of pages, you need to do it using bookmarks, as described in this tip.
generate an index in word? http://word.mvps.org/faqs/formatting/Createindex.htm
The Microsoft Word Help suggests that you can automatically generate an index.  Sorry, but you can't (the "result" looks like an index, but the reader can't use it).  You can automatically mark index entries: however, the amount of work required to edit the result into a useable index is usually double the effort required to manually mark the index entries one-by-one.
Instead of automatically generating something that is not useable, the reader would far prefer you to express the document electronically and provide a free text search. A free text search serves the reader's needs far better than a badly-constructed index, and the search engines available these days are smart enough to look for what the reader “wanted” rather than what he or she “asked for”.

<p>Hi Rohn007,<br />
<br />
Thank you very much indeed for your help, I really appreciate all this information and your tips. You’ve honestly made my day!!!<br />
<br />
Looking forward to spending tomorrow going through these links, videos and how-tos. Must admit I've been saving exclusively to OneDrive for a few months now, but since reading your tip I’ve made copies with the date on my Hard Drive and USB Drive.<br />
<br />
<strong>2 Part TOC:</strong></p>
<p><br />
Sorry I didn’t explain that very well, I meant to ask is it possible to create Parts/Sections in the text that will appear in the Table of Contents?<br />
The printed version should have a Section/Part Title Page...<br />
</p>
<p><em><strong>“CULTURAL PRACTICES” (Section 1 title)</strong></em><br />
</p>
<p><em><strong>“MEDICAL ETHICS” (Section 2 title)</strong></em><br />
</p>
<p>And so on...<br />
<br />
For example the contents page might look something like this:<br />
Introduction (numbered i-x)<br />
Maps ect...<br />
<em><strong>Cultural Practices (Section 1 Title)</strong></em><br />
Then all the related Chapters listed underneath like:<br />
Voodoo<br />
Shamanism<br />
Abrahamic<br />
Agnosticism<br />
<br />
<em><strong>Medical Ethics</strong></em><br />
Then all the related Chapters like:<br />
Alternative Treatment Approach<br />
Respect<br />
Boundaries<br />
And so on and on<br />
Finishing off with all the Appendices content:<br />
Glossary<br />
Endnotes<br />
Index<br />
</p>
<p>Does that make any sense? I’m not actually writing about these, I'm still at Title creation stage!<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your time and help, I was really daunted by the prospect of writing 25’000 words whilst formatting it all. Armed with everything you’ve pointed me too there’s light at the end of the tunnel!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>May I add you as a credit in my final Dissertation?<br />

All the very best<br />

            Glad to see you have decided to make extra backup copies. That 3 way strategy you came up with is actually the best. 3 copies, on separate physical devices, and one is stored off site (OneDrive)   Hope you never need it.
<br />
<br />Yes, If I understand what you are describing, the "2 part TOC" is no problem. The idea is built right in to the whole TOC concept.
<br />
<br />So the general idea you want to follow is 
<br />Sections will be Heading 1
<br />Major headings in section will be Heading 2
<br />sub heading will be Heading 3 etc
<br />
<br />You can define what ever font, size spacing you need on the headings.
<br />You can also change the default  definitions of the TOC styles to display the TOC as you need it. 
<br />
<br />The process I found worked for me was to build the outline as I did my research. I included short point form thoughts and references (not in final bilbliographic correct format, just links and book names.
<br />
<br />Back then my word processor didn't have the outline feature I told you about so I had to do my cutting, and pasting with dot-matix printouts,  scissors and scotch tape.  Then I would go bck and re-org my electronic copy.  You'll have it much easier using the Outline feature.
<br />
<br />If you want to  credit me that would be nice. But the material I passed on was actually written by other people. I just passed on "collected" and collective knowledge.
<br />
<br />One more idea: in my personal documents I've adopted (OK stolen) the idea of using colors in my headings. That makes it even easier to identify the heading level. I fully understand it won't be acceptable in the final copy, but it sure helps with development.  My documents look like a rainbow. Here is an example

<br />
<br />Good luck

<p>Hi Rohn007,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So sorry it's taken me so long to reply, I was away with work and I had my devices stolen! Thank God for insurance!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks that's brilliant, exactly what I want to do with the TOC. I only just got back home this evening and setup everything again. So I'm going to stay and work through those links you kindly shared tomorrow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outline feature looks perfect I didn't know Word could do that! It'll help with keeping track of everything in the document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Blimey I remember Dot Matrix printers and that long roll of odd paper and that noise... I never had to cut and paste with it though. Sounds like a nightmare job. How things have changed!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really like your (stolen) colour coding idea too I'm definitely going to give this a go too...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll definitely credit you. Once I've done it I'll add it to my OneDrive and find a way to share it with you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for all your help. I really do appreciate it!!</p>

<h3> rickibarnes  say:</h3>
<h2>            Google Analytics opt out browser add on not working for IE10 on Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>Every time I try to install the GA opt-out browser add on, I get this error: "Error 1603: A fatal error occurred during installation."</p>
<p><br />
I've looked at the Microsoft documentation and it says for Windows 7&nbsp;it is one of a couple of things:</p>
<ul>
<li>The folder I'm trying to install to is encrypted</li><li>The drive I'm trying to install to is accessed as a substitute drive</li></ul>
<p>I don't know how to find out which drive and folder the installer is trying to install to, so I can check which (if either) of these is true.</p>
<p><br />
Any suggestions or advice would be welcome. I'm not even sure if this is an issue with the GA installer, or with Windows.</p>

<h2>            Lumia 610 wont turn on just flashes window button</h2>
                    My Lumia 610 turned itself of suddenly. I couldn't get it to turn back on. Tried some of the trouble shooting I saw on line- taking the battery out while charging. Nothing. Bought a new battery. Still nothing, except the windows button sometimes when I
 try to turn it on flashes. It did this as well before I put the new battery in. Any ideas what my phone is trying to tell me by flashing the windows button??

<h2>            Selecting the Calendar tab crashes Outlook 2016</h2>
                    Though I can successfully use the Mail, Tasks, and People views&nbsp;within Outlook 2016, if I select the Calendar view, it only works if I right-click and specify to open the Calendar in a new window.&nbsp; If however I just click on the Calendar view (to convert
 the active window from Mail to Calendar), Outlook becomes unresponsive.&nbsp;&nbsp;The application crashed completely.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm using a Windows 10 desktop.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any ideas for help?

            nope... the delay can range about 2 to 10 seconds depending how big is the contact database you've on the phone.<br />
the worst is it messed up my contact &amp; made the number appear in more than one contact, hence, it doesn't show... same issue if that contact's facebook listed their phone number &amp; i save the same number on that contact.<br />
gonna clean up my phonebook so that it'd show the contact sooner.<br />
i do miss the huge phone contact photo on the screen when my friend calls me on my N8.

            i have almost 1200 contacts with about 80% of them with pictures. i have no issues with time delay on showing pictures.<br />
<br />
while the symbian devices were slower, the maemo/meego devices are fine.<br />
<br />
if you do have the same number attached to more than 1 contact, it will not show a contact name for incoming calls, missed calls, or sms/mms as it does not know which one to use.<br />
<br />
if you just delete one of the contacts with the number or merge them, then it will immediately correct itself.<br />
<br />
the lag in showing a contact upon an inbound call is going to be somewhere in the packages being confused or interupted, usually caused by bad coding on some other product that has been installed.<br />
<br />
I am however, on the pr1.1 and do not remember having an issue on pr1.0. so if you are on pr1.0, it is feasable that maybe it was an issue, but never came up for the 4 weeks we had it.<br />
<br />
i would look at what applications were installed before it happened and try to ween them out.<br />
<br />
the great part about maemo/meego is that if you are having conflict issues like that, usually, simply uninstalling that bad application is all it takes to revert correctly.<br />

            if one in recent-call calls me, contact will show immediately but another wont show<br />
<br />
sometimes I answer the phone and still need more 10sec for a phone to correct and show contact<br />
<br />
my contacts are around 200<br />
80% are merged with facebook contacts<br />
<br />
and I have turned off another facebook contacts<br />
<br />
This problem have started for so long<br />
maybe since I bought it

            The only option you have to see if it can be fixed its to flash your device, or at least to revolutionary it.<br />
<br />
You could create a backup and then connect in mass storage mode and copy the.backup folder and any other data you want before you reformat.<br />
<br />
Then, before you restore it, sync your contacts and see if you have have the same issue. If not, then try to restore from a backup. If it happens again after the restore, then it its something you installed.<br />

            This is what I've noticed, too. I don't have any apps installed, and it's been like this from the beginning. It's fine if the caller is in the recent calls list, but it takes 2-3 seconds if he'she is not. I have about 200 contacts; I don't use FB.

<p>If your numbering was of the format 1.1), 1.2), you could use the following type of field construction to suppress the )</p>
<p>{ = { REF _REf######### \r \h } \# 0.0;0.0 }</p>

In the comments section you are asked to sign in to make a comment. I do this and I am apparently signed in because I get no error message and in the top right corner my sign in name appears and I can view my personal setttings etc. However, the comments section
 still says I need to sign in to post a comment and no "post" button appears next to comment box.<br />
<br />
I have used this sign in name to successfully post a comment in the approx 2 months ago.<br />
<br />
I am asking here because I can't find any contact email at http://blogs.office.com/<br />

<h2>            Paste Functionality only allowing one sentence&#47;line at a time in Word Forms</h2>
                    I developed a new Word Form (Word 2010) using the developer functionality, allowing for multiple lines for each text box.&nbsp; However, when my managers are utilizing the form they are trying to cut and paste a large amount of text into the text box. It is
 only pasting over the first sentence/line.&nbsp; So, they are having to copy each line and then paste it over which obviously won't work for performance evaluations they are doing.&nbsp; If it helps I believe most of the complaints have come for those who are cutting
 and pasting from an old evaluation Word form done in Office 2003 and was later modified in Word 2010 (these forms were retired).&nbsp;

            <p>On my PC, I have no trouble pasting multiple lines or multiple paragraphs into a plain text content control set for "allow carriage returns". So it isn't a limitation or bug in Word 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would focus on two possibilities.</p>
<ul>
<li>What kind of text in the old documents are they copying from? Is it paragraphs of regular text and/or bullet lists, the contents of protected form fields, text within tables, or other special circumstances? (Although I've tried all of those, and they just
 work...)</li><li>Is there an add-in -- common to all the PCs that have the problem -- that may be interfering? Try restarting Word while holding down the Ctrl key; when it asks whether to start in Safe Mode, answer Yes, and then try copying and pasting the same kind of
 text. Safe Mode prevents the loading of any add-ins, as well as the Normal.dotm template and any special settings in the registry. If the problem stops then, try disabling the add-ins one at a time to see whether you can isolate one that's causing the problem.</li></ul>

<h2>            Glide Video Messager</h2>
                    I have the Microsoft Lumia cell phone and I would like to add the GLIDE VIDEO CHAT to my phone, but it doesn't seem to work, as a matter of fact it doesn't work for any of my video messager like Facebook. Has anyone else had this issue and if so, how did
 you fix it?

<p>if it is the one I've found, it seems like an obvious fake app - the screenshots are from an android phone!</p>
