<h2>            Can&#39;t install windows media center on Win 8.1 Pro</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I just purchased WMC on my Win 8.1 Pro however when the installation runs I get an error saying 'Something went wrong. Close this wizard and try again.' Needless to say that does nothing. I tried doing a clean boot but that doesn't solve this issue. Would
 any of you have any ideas on how to solve this problem?</div>

            <p><span>Hi ChrisP,</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>I have come across similar issue wherein, disabling antivirus fixed the issue.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>If you are using any third-party antivirus software, you may disable it and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>You may refer to the antivirus maker website to check for the options to disable antivirus.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>If this does not help, you may consider uninstalling antivirus and check if you can install Media center.</span></p>
<p><b><span><br />
</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Note:
</span></b><span>If you uninstall antivirus, install it after installing the Windows Media Center.<span>&nbsp;

            Just to make sure you are running Pro, open the Run box and type <b>winver</b>. Make sure it doesn't say Pro with Media Center. If you had media center before (and if) you upgraded to 8.1 pro, you should already have it. Win 8.1 doesn't place tiles on
 the start screen automatically. As you know, only Pro users can add MC.

            Thanks for your replies guys. I tried all of the above and still no go. SFC actually detected all the files to be working correctly (100% integrity) and it's definitely win 8.1 pro I'm running. Any more ideas, I'm all ears.

<p>My xbox360 is receiving this error code. I have gone through all of the trouble shooting steps. All of my games that once played and my dvd's that once played will now no longer play. Am I basically screwed?</p>

<p>Hey Flossy, sorry to hear about the disc-read issue. I can't say I've seen a six-digit error code come up on the console before--is there any other text you could provide to us? Also, if you could include or link us to a screenshot, that would be ideal.

<p>Its one of the new anti piracy codes. I had 03-80-00, the tech support rep I talked to found that out for me. &nbsp;Is it a new game cause mine was with Skyrim. &nbsp;Supposedly the new anti piracy firmware and the on disc anti piracy codes clash. &nbsp;I was told to wait
 for Microsoft to fix it in a patch or update. &nbsp;But havent &nbsp;heard if and when this will be happening.</p>

<p>I have a feeling never...</p>
<p>Is it something I can reverse if it was just with the game? Because now I can't play any game old or new. If I recall, it was only newish, like Modern Warfare 2 I think. So not that new. I don't buy to many new games, so I had been mainly playing old sports,
 hockey, nfl, mlb games, and Halo 3, all older games. Don't know if any of that information helps. If it was caused by just one game, it seems like the others would still work or that there'd be a way to reverse it. It's for sure not pirated, I've bought most
 of my games at an official movie/gaming store in my town</p>

<p>Up until two weeks ago the only time i would get &nbsp;the 03-57-00 error is when playing ffxiii and removing the hard drive would fix it right up for me.</p>
<p>Now almost all my games do it; removing the hard drive does squat and &nbsp;the only thing that has changed is i updated my x-box.</p>
<p>is there any way to un-update the xbox?</p>

<p>pulling out the hard drive only works sometimes.</p>

<h2>            How can you determine where gifted points went</h2>
                    
<p>Over the course of the last week I have seen two E-Mail's indicating ponts have been purchased and charged to my charge card.&nbsp; I can see the purchase transactions/details in the "accounts" section, and then it shows the points where gifted.&nbsp; I can not yet
 find information who the points where gifted to and then of course the next question I will have is how can I determine what the gifted points where used for (assuming it is all being done in the family account).</p>

<p>Well for one thing you cannot gift points </p>
<p>Question is then if you are a family account why not look at the activity center this includes ma points purchases under putchase history and child account purchased pr allowances or ask whichever family had access to your console .

<p>If you read my post again you will see i clearly stated the points had NOT been gifted to a family member. Obviously i checked my billing which is how i found about the gifted points. I haven't bought the points and i certainly haven't gifted anyone. I have
 phoned support and they are investigating because they do not know where the points were gifted to either as it was not someone in the family plan and they don't have access to download. Therefore I have been hacked.

<p>I'm also a victim of this mess. Apparently my account was compromised almost identical to what happened to Hazza. It appears they had access to my MS live/billing/xbox account. I don't even own an Xbox or Xbox 360 so I can't even verify anything happening
 on my account. MS finds the need to link credit card info from Zune to Xbox and vice versa and why I've now closed my Zune account. My xbox account has been inactive for years and when I saw the charges I thought MS made an error and automatically renewed
 and 7 year old Live account with my credit card.</p>
<p>What the abuser did was access my account, activate a Live account (mine had been closed for years, I don't play console games or own an xbox any longer). He/she then proceeded to upgrade the account to a family gold plan. Must have added themselves to my
 family and then proceeded to buy -&gt; gift points to themselves.</p>
<p>Here are the transactions:</p>

<p>Hopefully you can help me out, i've already contacted and asked for a replacement card from my credit card company linked to the account.</p>

<p>For both your account being compromised and your request for a refund, you would need to call phone support (<a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/contact-us</a>). Ask to start an Unauthorized Access Investigation.
 This will freeze the account for up to 30 days (more in some cases) while they investigate.

<h2>            Start Downloaded Games from the hard drive on X360 freeze the system</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a problem that started a few days ago. I was already with xbox support for a few hours, but it resolved the issue for a short time, and now the problem is back. I have done many tests and tries and hope that maybe Microsoft has a solution for this
 based on other experiences of Xbox 360 users.</p>
<p>The issue is as following:</p>
<p>If I sign in to Xbox live and try to start any downloaded arcade, installed main game or any other downloaded content that is located on my hard drive than I get a black screen on start of the game, and the game does not start. I can still press the Xbox
 button on my controller and get the menu, but if I press the Y button to go back to the dashboard, the whole system freezes. I also noticed that the tiles on the dashboard in game's section, that usual show game recommendations based on what I play, only show
 the loading cycle instate of recommendations. This makes me think that there is some issue to authenticate me or my profile.</p>
<p>I was with support and we did many things, such as a reset where we removed all cables (I only have HDMI, power and Ethernet connected). So we removed all waited 2 minutes and plug it back in and tried again but no success. Then I was told that it could
 be the profile is corrupted. Therefore, we deleted the profile without deleting the content and re-downloaded the profile, but this did not resolve the issue either. I then followed the freeze wizard on xbox.com and tried all options there like e.g. removing
 the hard drive and then putting it back in. But no success.</p>
<p>It did work after re-downloading the profile but only until the next restart. I noticed that I did see the game recommendation tiles after I did all the troubleshooting steps, so I am sure this is connected with my issue, but a day later the same issue is
 there.</p>
<p>What is interesting is that if I sign in to my profile and have my Ethernet and WIFI disconnected, and I go to the games they work fine, but as soon I sign in to live they do not work anymore and give me the freeze on load. So it must have something to do
 with the profile and the connection to live. There is one additional information I have, which is that this is a USA Xbox that I took with to my work assignment in Malaysia, South-East Asia. However, I am here for four years and never had any issue like this.
 Furthermore, I can tell that the system knows my region since lots of content I cannot purchase or download because of my region. I got used to this, but I cannot imagine that this has something to do to start the content I have officially purchased and installed
 on my hard drive. In the last two years, I have bought most of the content on xbox marketplace so 90% of my current stuff is downloaded material that is located on the hard-drive, and none of it works.</p>
<p>All this actually started after having an incident in <em>World Series of Poker</em><span>: Full House Pro.</span> I was playing some two hours and in the middle of an on-line game the whole box froze. This is usually not uncommon with this game since it
 is notorious for freezing in all kinds of situations. However, after restarting the box, the poker did not load and gave me this freezing black screen. I did first not realize that it happens on all downloaded content since I thought that maybe the crash corrupted
 the specific poker game. So I searched the net for info and found that many people report freezing incidents. So I deleted the
<em>World Series of Poker</em><span>: Full House Pro</span> game and re-downloaded it twice since I thought maybe the game had an issue, and this was one of the recommendations online. I even copied my saved game and downloaded items for the poker on a USB
 and started fresh but still did not load. Then after I was fed-up with the poker, I tried another game and noticed that all games in my game library did not start any more.</p>
<p>So now I am not very happy since nothing works. For the last two years, I did not buy any CD but bought everything on the market place on demand, and now I cannot play anything. Apart from the games, I am confidence that there is an issue with the actual
 operating system, maybe from the last update because I see that many tiles in the dashboard never load and have this loading cycle for ever. I even kept the box on 24 hours to see if any of them load delayed, but they never completed loading.</p>
<p>I wonder if there is something like a check disk utility or a way to re-download the OS to see if this fixes my issue. Or maybe someone has some things I did not try yet. All seems to work fine otherwise; I am able to play CD based games and can see all
 dashboard content except some tiles that never load. And as I mentioned if I do not sign-in to the Internet all seems fine as well.</p>
<p>Sorry for the long write-up but I wanted to give as much details as I could to see if this can be resolved. I hope someone can assist me.</p>
<p>Best wishes,</p>
<p>Thomanji</p>

<p>Actually you are right about the "I also noticed that the tiles on the dashboard in game's section, that usual show game recommendations based on what I play, only show the loading cycle instate of recommendations.", sometimes (shutdown &amp; on again) I don't
 get this I would be able to start game.</p>
<p>I guess its the game recommendations got stuck/bugged.</p>

<p>Thanks guys, I see now that this issue was reported, for some reason it did not come up on my extensive research into this issue. So I see now other people have the same issue and all entry are dates after the last Microsoft Update. So I do think it is an
 issue with the OS Live update. Probably a bug in the license synchronisation or DRM issue with the profile. I see that some guy suggested a factory reset, I hope this is not the solution since I got 190GB worth of purchased stuff on this XBox and it would
 be horrible to re-download it all.</p>

<p>I found that if I plug out my Ethernet cable and start the box, then sign in to my profile without having internet I can start the game. if I then plug-in my cable after I loaded the game and sign-in to live the game will work fine and if I go to the desktop
 from the game then I noticed the recommendations are loading and I can play another game. However if I restart normal the issue is back. So for not I start without internet and sign-in after loading the first game. I am not sure if this works with WIFI. I
 hope MS is resolving this soon.</p>

<p>Hi all,<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Just want to make sure all troubleshooting steps have been tried here to ensure we are all on the same page. Let's be sure to try all these steps:<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><strong>1).</strong>&nbsp;Restart your console.</p>
<p><strong>2).</strong>&nbsp;Clear cache 3 times:&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/system/clear-system-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../clear-system-cache</a></p>
<p><strong>3).</strong>&nbsp;Remove and then redownload your profile:&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/manage-gamertag-and-profile/delete-xbox-live-profile-from-xbox-360-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../delete-xbox-live-profile-from-xbox-360-console</a></p>
<p><strong>4).</strong>&nbsp;Launch a downloaded or installed game from the hard drive.</p>
<p><strong>5).</strong>&nbsp;Restart console no matter the result of the previous steps and try relaunching another game that is downloaded or installed to the hard drive.</p>
<p><strong>6).</strong>&nbsp;Try a different profile that is Xbox Live enabled. (Could be a gold or a silver profile, just not a "local only" profile)</p>
<p><strong>7).</strong>&nbsp;Try removing the hard drive:&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/accessories/add-remove-hard-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../add-remove-hard-drive</a>&nbsp;and next install a game to a USB drive and then
 launch the game to see if the results differ with a new storage device.</p>
<p><strong>8).</strong>&nbsp;Remove and then reinstall the latest system update by going to (Settings&gt; System&gt; Storage&gt; Highlight but do not select your hard drive&gt; Press LB, RB, X, LB, RB, X &gt; Then follow on-screen prompts)</p>
<p><strong>9).</strong>&nbsp;Test one more time after the system update has completely reinstalled.</p>
<p><strong>10).</strong>&nbsp;Test your account and a game on a different console if you have one available to you to test with.</p>
<p>__________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>If these steps are not able to help, please provide the following info in your response post:<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><strong>1).</strong>&nbsp;What Dashboard OS version is your console on? (Settings&gt; System&gt; Console Settings&gt; System Info)</p>
<p><strong>2).</strong>&nbsp;What model Xbox 360 console do you have? (Ex: Original Xbox 360 Model console, Xbox 360 S model console, Xbox 360 E model console, etc.)</p>
<p><strong>3).</strong>&nbsp;On what date did this behavior start happening?</p>
<p><strong>4).</strong>&nbsp;Is this only happening with downloaded or installed games on the hard drive or does this happen with disc based games as well?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5).</strong>&nbsp;Does this happen on all Xbox Live enabled accounts on this console?</p>
<p><strong>6).</strong>&nbsp;What model hard drive are you using? (Ex: Internal 4GB hard drive on a S model console, 320GB removable hard drive for Xbox S &amp; E model console, etc.)</p>
<p><strong>7).</strong>&nbsp;Are the recommendation sections on the dashboard not populated with content and instead filled with a continuous spinning circle?</p>
<p><strong>8).</strong>&nbsp;Does the workaround of turning off auto sign-in, launching the game first, and then signing in after the game has launched work 100% of the time?</p>
<p><strong>9).</strong>&nbsp;Does the same behavior occur on a different console if you were able to test with your profile?</p>
<p><strong>10).</strong>&nbsp;Does the same behavior occur while both online and in offline mode?</p>
<p><strong>11).</strong>&nbsp;When you get to step 5 in the troubleshooting flow, does the console then loop back into the same behavior?</p>
<p><strong>12).</strong>&nbsp;When you get to step 9 in the troubleshooting flow, does the console loop back into the same behavior?</p>
<p><strong>13).</strong>&nbsp;If you do still receive a black screen after all the troubleshooting steps, does the console freeze if you then press the guide button?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Please respond below with your findings and we can take further steps from there if needed. Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Mister Rush,</p>
<p>Thank you for attending to this issue, I appreciate your willingness to help.</p>
<p>So I have spend my Sunday to do troubleshooting for Microsoft ;-)</p>
<p>So here we go.</p>
<p>Part1:</p>
<p>1. Restarted Console</p>
<p>2. Cleared Cache 3 times in a row</p>
<p>3. Removed Profile (profile only)</p>
<p>4. Launched downloaded game and same issue, black screen (I pres guide button for few seconds to switch off console)</p>
<p>5. Start console after switching it on in step No. 4, Try to launch again same issue (could already see it would not success because of endless loading recommendation tiles)</p>
<p>6. Created a second profile and signed up to silver account. Tried to start game and I get the same issue with the second profile as well.</p>
<p>7. Switched off console, Removed hard drive waited 2 minutes and started console. Use USB and move a Arcade came to the USB, than try to start this game and get same issue.</p>
<p>8. Followed steps and console downloaded update again and than automatically restarted.</p>
<p>9. Same issue after console restarted.</p>
<p>10. Sorry, I do have 3 Xboxes but all 3 either have overheating issue or ring of death. Also they are not Slim so the hard-drive is not compatible. But your welcome to send me one and I test ;-)</p>
<p>Part2:</p>
<p>1. 2.0.16756.0</p>
<p>2. Xbox 360 S</p>
<p>3. After May 13, 2014</p>
<p>4. All games, CD, Downloaded, Installed, USB</p>
<p>5. Yes, have 2 accounts, a gold and a silver and it happens with both.</p>
<p>6. 250GB - Xbox360S</p>
<p>7. YES</p>
<p>8. Yes, it does for me.</p>
<p>9. see No. 10 Part1</p>
<p>10. No, Only when on-line. I have WIFI and Ethernet options. So I "forgot" the WIFI and use Ethernet. So if I start the console without Internet (Ethernet unplugged) all games work fine. Before I did the sepes in Part 1, on some games E.G. Borderlands 2,
 if I started them and than plugged-in the cable, connected to live and than clicked the guide button and go to the dashboard it showed the recommendations tiles and I am able to start other games. However, as soon I restarted the xbox it was back to the same
 bug. Now after the step 8 on Part 1 this does not happen any more, even if I end a game and go to the dashboard it does not load the recommendation tiles. So after playing anything I need to restart without Internet load the game and than plug in the cable
 and connect.</p>
<p>11. Yes it does</p>
<p>12. Yes it does</p>
<p>13. Yes if I start a game and get the black screen I can still press the guide button. However if I press Y it asks my "Do you really want to go to dashboard Yes/No - If I press yes the whole console freezes. It is also a extreme freeze because if I press
 the off button it takes 3 seconds for the console to actually switch off.</p>
<p>I hope this is sufficient info to troubleshot this issue. Please let me know if you need me to do some more tests. I did everything I could think off and researched for hours on the net but nothing resolved the issue. As you can see on the date it first
 started to happen, it was a few days after the last XBox live update.</p>
<p>Best wishes,</p>
<p>Thom</p>

<p>Hi all, thanks for all the info you have provided thus far. We just need an answer to a few more questions as this is being looked in to. The questions are:<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>When was the last time you experienced this black screen issue?</p>
<p><em>(example: 7-2-2-14 at 3:45PM EST)</em><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Does the workaround listed below still temporarily resolve the issue and when was the last time you were able to successfully use this method?</p>
<p><em>(example: Yes, Last used it on 7-1-2014 at 8:39AM PST)</em><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Workaround method steps:</p>
<p><strong>1).</strong>&nbsp;Turn off auto sign-in</p>
<p><strong>2).</strong>&nbsp;Power on console and launch the game</p>
<p><strong>3).</strong>&nbsp;Sign in once inside the game menu screen</p>

            <p>I also have a dell xps 8500 special edition. the anniversary update killed my pc add to reinstall the anniversary update with Microsoft support. I still cannot send file to d drive. and waiting for fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>first thing to do before you update go to dell check for any update for your system. the intel srt that control the raid set up make sure this is updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>since the anniversary update as issue with more complex&nbsp;&nbsp;system that have ssd and hdd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>they also removed some codec plugin for web cam that cause error when you try to use software for web cam that use those codec. this seams to be fix now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>can you tell me what version of windows you have by going in to system setting about. the issue you describe seams to be the same as the November 2015 windows update issue. 1511.</p>
<p>
</p><p>to fix this issue the only way was to download the windows 10 media make a usb install key&nbsp;and install it from there.</p>
<p>

            <p>I have had the same problem NUMEROUS times my computer would attempt downloading the anniversary update and after 8 hours it was still spinning its CIRCLE.... each time I &nbsp;would have to go back by hitting CTRL ALT DEL &nbsp;until the computer would give me back
 WIN 10.... this went on for about 6 times over a period of time.... Im mad because #1 Microsoft gives NO WAY TO DECLINE THE DOWNLOAD, and #2 now my computer does not BOOT at all....</p>
<p>I will have to buy a new computer but am afraid to buy one unless it already has the anniversary update installed first</p>

 Protocol: 'POP3', Port: 110, Secure(SSL): No, Socket Error: 11001, Error Number: 0x800CCC0D".</b></i> &nbsp;I have a Dell Optiplex GX110 desktop computer with an Intel Pentium III processor (996 MHz, 256 MB of RAM). &nbsp;I already know I have to increase the amount
 of RAM, but I don't believe that is part of my problem. &nbsp; &nbsp;I am connected to a Verizon local area network (Internet, cable TV and phone package). I run Microsoft Windows XP Professional version 2002 (5.1.2600) with service pack 3. &nbsp;I frequently check to be
 sure my system is set to automatically receive all updates for Windows XP plus any updates from Microsoft. &nbsp;QUESTION: &nbsp;Was there a Microsoft release in September 2011 that had something to do with POP3 servers? &nbsp;Evidently it did not automatically install in
 my computer. &nbsp;I even checked my system twice to make sure that Microsoft was on my list of safe sites. &nbsp;Please help me. &nbsp;I really want to use Outlook Express 6 as my default email. &nbsp;
</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>

</p><ol>
<li><span>Right click on the
<strong><span>setup file</span></strong> of the software and select
<strong><span>“Properties”.</span></strong></span></li><li><span>Select <strong>
<span>“Compatibility”</span></strong> Tab.</span></li><li><span>Place a check mark next to<strong><span>“Run this program in Compatibility mode”</span></strong> and select operating system from the drop down list.</span></li><li><span>Let the&nbsp;software install and then check the<strong><span>functionality</span></strong>.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. Keep us posted on the status for further assistance.</p>

            THanks for the reply&nbsp;&nbsp; I ran the setup.exe in compatibility mode for all earlier versions of windows and the software still won't install.&nbsp; It says that GBU521_FW_ V12.0.0.9980 is an incompatible program. So what's next.&nbsp; Thanks

            Sorry for not responding for so long, but I just got around doing the clean boot and the software still wouldn't install.&nbsp; I downloaded a new driver for the adapter from Dell.&nbsp; Still wouldn't install.&nbsp; Ran the compatibility program again.&nbsp; All versions
 of windows called it an incompatible program.&nbsp; I know it works because It was working before I had to reinstall Windows 10.&nbsp; I was checking around the internet about what&nbsp;files I need to run Bluetooth and they suggested that BthMtpEnum.sys and bth.inf may
 be missing&nbsp; so I checked my Windows System 32 directory and Windows inf directory and both these files where missing could this be my problem and how do&nbsp;I install these files?&nbsp; Thanks again.

<h2>            Windows 10 - activation assistant appearing even though Window 10 is activated</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>I am running Windows 10 and have for months. I had a system crash on Friday. Since then every morning when I start up, the activation assistant appears asking me to activate Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is on the system page it say it is activated and I used a script to get my activation key. So it seems that I am activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run SFC /scannow and there are errors that can't be fixed. I have also run DISM which also finds errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IDEAS?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What if I re-activate using my existing activation key?</p>
<p>2. Tomorrow morning, I will restart in safe mode and see if I get the activation assistant again. If not, then it is some type of hardware conflict</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Neil</p>

Its not like there wouldn't be any demand&nbsp;but all we&nbsp;see is TFU1&amp;2 and likely no 3 :(, they were fun titles&nbsp;but some better (longer lasting) S-W fare would not be a bad thing for the console or Mr Lucas's wallet.</p>

<p>We need decent Star Wars games on the Xbox 360, games like KOTOR3, Jedi Knight 3 and not rubbish like the Force Unleashed or that pathetic looking Kinect Star Wars game. &nbsp;I read that they started to work on KOTOR3 then they scrapped it. &nbsp;Seriously they need

<p>I agree, we need another KOTOR. &nbsp;I never understand when in a time of austerity and developers are reluctant to drop money or gamble on a new franchise. What could be more of a money maker than a GOOD starwars game? I don't have a PC that could run Old Republic
 and I'm too into relaxing on the sofa with 42"tv console gaming now to go back.</p>
<p>Surely &nbsp;it must be a worthwhile and profitable &nbsp;venture, why doesn't it happen? Do I just completely missunderstand how game developers work?</p>

<p>DC Universe on PC can be used with a USB Xbox controller and it plays well IMO. I don't think a controller is that much of an issue.</p>

            This does solve my issues BUT this is not the answer as the classic version of Skype is about to be discontinued and the new version is buggered.<br />
<br />
The new version has the following issues for me:<br />
1. History messages are gone<br />
2. When I type a message nothing happens and I've confirmed with 3 other users that they don't get my message.<br />
3. When I type a message it does not show in the feed window at all<br />
<br />
Whats going on?

<p>
</p><p>From where can we get the old version of skype. Right now Microsoft is not allowing to download the old version also. Is it obsolete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please bring this back until MS fixes lots of Win10 and Skype compatibility issues.</p>

    <title>ISSUES WITH APPS&#47;WINDOWS STORE &#8211; Uninstalling Apps, App - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jmt65  say:</h3>
<h2>            ISSUES WITH APPS&#47;WINDOWS STORE &#8211; Uninstalling Apps, App Updates Freezing, etc</h2>
                    <p>There are several threads about these issues, so I decided to start a new one and combine them into one and a possible solution to this issue, until it is fixed properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>People have been complaining about these issues for three years, and Microsoft, in their wisdom, has decided to blow their customers off (just like Apple), so it's up to us to help each other out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was getting a bit annoyed that apps that I uninstalled were still listed in my account as mine in the Windows Store. I was also having issues with updates freezing. The thing that I noticed is that these updates were for apps
 that I had uninstalled, but Microsoft has decided that in "our best interest" these apps that we don't want will be removed from our computers, but still 'assigned' to us in the app store. So we are still getting updates for these and since they aren't on
 our computers anymore, the updates don't know where to go, so they just hang there.</p>
<p>I also think that none of these apps are really checked before being allowed on the store and that many have virus' or worse. We have to remember that our anti-virus programs may not detect issues with these until it's too late
 or even not at all. And that could also cause an issue with attempting to update, especially if any of these untested/unchecked apps end up messing with the registry, etc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple of days ago this caused a huge issue with my computer. The updates for apps that I had uninstalled froze my computer. I couldn't shut it down, couldn't update, couldn't do anything, so I had to hard shut it down. Then all
 hell broke loose with my computer. It took me almost 30 minutes to get back on. Still having issues. I decided to go to System Restore and I went back over a week on the restore point, to a place I positive to be good. My computer was so jacked up by this
 garbage, that it took System Restore nearly 90 minutes to complete. </p>
<p>
</p><p>When everything was fixed and I was able to get back on, I noticed that the System Restore also affected the apps.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Apps that I installed and kept were no more, there was just a blank thumbnail on my screen.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Apps that I had installed to test out that week and uninstalled were gone.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Games that I had played the Daily Challenges on were blanked out for those days, like I had never played them.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>There were only 3 updates on my list all for apps that I did have installed, when before there were 12 updates, 9 were for one's that I had uninstalled. The 3 that were left, updated cleanly and quickly.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>My recommendation at this time, until Microsoft gets off their backsides and fixes these issues (obviously do not hold your breath), is to create a restore point every time:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Before you look for new apps</p>
</li><li>
<p>After a clean update of your apps</p>
</li></ol>
<p>This will at least give you a restore point that you know is good, to revert to, if there is an issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this is total garbage that we have to do something like this, and that Microsoft should recognize and accept that there are issues and fix them, but obviously they have no intention of caring about any of this.
</p>
<p>It only takes moments to create a restore point. It took me nearly two hours the other day to fix my computer and if what I did didn't fix it, I was going to have to reload the operating system, which would have wiped out everything.
 And my computer isn't even two months old.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Supposedly all these issues will be fixed with Windows 10, but every thing that I've read, I have no intention of downgrading to Windows 10... I mean upgrading to Windows 10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks Microsoft for caring so much about your customers that you are unwilling to hear our complaints and fix these issues.

<p>Error 0x80040705, source: dotNet in Windows Live Essential Setup. </p>
<p>I am getting the same error code, but with Windows 7, if I click on the WLM icon BEFORE the desktop icons are refreshed, I get the message 'WLM cannot open' or similar. If I then wait until after the refresh, WLM starts normally. Weird or what!</p>

<p><span>That's a completely different error from the one in your original post. Were you not seeing error 0x80040705 before? Or did that just come along for the ride from the old thread you posted in, which has since been deleted?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The error you're seeing is usually returned after an unsuccessful attempt to start the program. It means that the Windows Live ID Sign-in Assistant service isn't running. This service authenticates the user to the live.com servers, and is
 required in most circumstances. <br />
<br />
A repair of the installation will often correct this. Type <strong>wlarp</strong> into the start search box and press
<em>Enter</em>. Choose the repair option, and when it's finished reboot the computer. See whether Windows Live Mail will now launch properly. If it doesn't, follow these instructions:&nbsp;on versions of Windows 7 other than
<em>Home</em>, with all Windows Live programs closed, </span></p>
<ol>
<li>Press the Windows key, type <strong>services.msc</strong> and press <em>Enter</em>.</li><li>Locate the wlidsvc.exe service and double-click on it to open its properties sheet.<br />
&nbsp;Set <em>Startup </em>to <em>Automatic (Delayed start). </em>This will prevent the service from trying to start before Windows is completely loaded.<em><br />
</em>Ensure that the <em>Service status </em>is <em>Started</em>. If it isn't, click
<em>Start</em>.</li><li>Close the properties sheet and the <em>Services </em>snap-in.</li><li>Launch&nbsp;Windows Live Mail.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ol>

    <title>Cannot boot my windows 10 computer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nathan brannon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot boot my windows 10 computer</h2>
                    <p>A while ago I tried doing a system reset on my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About 3/4 the way through the reset my laptop crashed and gave me a "Memory_Managment" error.</p>
<p>This is no longer my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am able to load my computer onto the "Choose an option" screen that gives me the options to "Continue, Use a device, Troubleshoot, etc."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am unable to get Windows recovery media to work through my USB.. it will get to about 76% and then will give me the error code&nbsp;0x8007025D</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am unable to "reset this PC" as when I try to "remove everything" it gave me the error &nbsp;"Unable to reset your PC. A required drive partition is missing"</p>
<p>This is a new error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Attempting to "Continue" will just loop me back to the "Choose an option" menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>trying to "Use another operating system" does not work either, since all of them, loop back to "Choose an option"</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I open up "Troubleshoot" and go to "Advanced options" I get 6 more options</p>
<p>
</p><p>System restore will not work, since the original refresh I tried to do on my PC, deleted all my restore points.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"System image recovery" also does not work. It gives me the error "Windows cannot find a&nbsp; system image on this computer."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Startup repair just loops back to "Choose an option"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Command prompt does open, but it opens in an "X;\" drive, one I didn't&nbsp;even know I had.</p>
<p>
</p><p>UEFI Firmware settings, I honestly don't know what this is.. but it seems to do nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Going back to a previous build" does pretty much nothing as well, it also just loops back to "Choose an option"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really need help with this problem as I am no longer able to use my PC. if anyone could help me with this, that would be amazing,</p>
<p>thank you</p>
<p>

            <p><span>Hi Tod,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your concern here at the Microsoft Community forum. Let me assist you with your concern.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>With Microsoft Paint, the software included with Windows operating systems, transparency is already the default.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may refer this steps and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Open "<strong>Paint</strong>." Click the "<strong>Paint</strong>" button in the top left corner of the work area.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Click "<strong>Open</strong>." Browse to the picture to add transparency into, and double-click its file name. The picture opens in the Paint work area.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Click the "<strong>Select</strong>" button on the ribbon. If adding a rectangular- or square-shaped transparent area, click "<strong>Rectangular Selection</strong>." Otherwise, click "<strong>Free-Form Selection</strong>."</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Drag the cursor to fit the area to remove and make transparent. Dotted blue lines surround the area.
</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Press the "<strong>Delete</strong>" key on the keyboard. Although the area is now transparent, it shows as white on the screen.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Click the "<strong>Paint</strong>" button. Click "<strong>Save As</strong>." Give the picture a new name, and select
<strong>"GIF"</strong> from the <strong>"Format</strong>" menu, the only file format that allows transparency. Click the "<strong>Save</strong>" button.</p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Because of Paint's limited capacity, the software cannot render transparency on screen. Even though Paint's default is to have a transparent background, it looks white -- like the Paint canvas --
 on the screen. So, blank Paint canvases already start out transparent. Adding transparency in Paint is simply a process of removing parts of an existing picture.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Paint doesn’t have the capability to make an entire photograph or picture transparent, nor can it create transparency percentages (such as 50 percent opacity).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Using Paint</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/using-paint#1TC=windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/using-paint#1TC=windows-8</span></a><span>
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps. If you need further assistance with Windows, let us know and will be glad to help.

            <p>This <strong>does not</strong> create a transparency, it will remove the selected area and replace it with the currently Background Color - white by default. &nbsp;If your web page uses solid white as a background color it will have the appearance of having transparency,
 but in effect it is <strong>blending in</strong>. &nbsp;<br />
If you have a solid color other than white as your page background color then you can use the same steps after changing the Background Color in Paint to match. &nbsp;If that is what you have then this answer is more than sufficient.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your pages have a polychromatic or image background then images with white (or other single color) regions substituting as transparent will stand out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since <strong>this is not creating a transparency</strong>, but rather editing the image, save the image in a format of your choice that will retain the quality of the image. (It does not have to be GIF since this format most often reduces the quality of
 the image if it was originally something better, such as anything 24-bit.)</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ok, I was able to copy the Spider from an XP machine and play it on a Windows 7 Ultimate 32bit machine.&nbsp; Other than the graphics I didn't really see a difference in the two versions.&nbsp; But if you want to try it you will need to just copy the&nbsp; 3 spider files
 from your XP machine to the Windows 7 machine.&nbsp; These files are Spider.exe, Spider.chm, and Spider.hlp.&nbsp; They should be located in C:\Windows\System32.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.

    <title>My Keyboard Is Being Weird on the Surface Book 2 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bot360  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Keyboard Is Being Weird on the Surface Book 2</h2>
                    I've had my Surface Book 2 for 4 months~ now and every so often, after a single detach, the green "Attached" and "Ready to Detach" sighs will pop up by themselves a few times. Sometimes my keyboard stops working while it is attached and only the screen
 works like it's in Tablet mode. However, I cannot detach it as it is presumed to not be attached so the light blinks green. This now happens randomly and is annoying as my keyboard will stop working and I will have to wait approx. 5 - 20 minutes for it to
 stop so I can detach once again and reattach it only to hope it will work. I've tried cleaning dust off the connectors, I've tried updates and nothing is working. This is starting to really annoy me and it has no fix for me as of now. Any fix would be appreciated.&nbsp;

            This did not work. Whenever I even move my Surface it still decides to Detach and Reattach making it almost impossible to move around and take anywhere.

<p>Hi Bot360,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response. In this case,&nbsp;this issue might be caused by corrupted driver.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To resolve this concern, we suggest that you download the latest Firmware and Driver for your Surface Device on this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023482/surface-download-drivers-and-firmware-for-surface" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a>.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you continue having this issue, we suggest to reset the Surface device back to factory settings using a USB recovery drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Important</strong> Creating a recovery drive will erase anything that is already stored on your USB drive. Make sure to transfer any important data from your USB drive to another storage device before
 using it to create a Surface USB recovery drive. &nbsp;</span></span></p>
<div style="text-align: justify"><span><span><strong>Note:
</strong>Make sure you have access to the product keys and installation files for any desktop apps, such as Microsoft Office, that you plan to reinstall after the reset.

    <title>There is a problem with the driver for Standard SATA AHCI Controller - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            There is a problem with the driver for Standard SATA AHCI Controller</h2>
                    <p>I have been having problems with my Dell XPS 13 9343 for a while, with a few reoccurring problems:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) It regularly crashes, </p>
<p>2) Often when I turn it back on after standby, the screen dimensions will change to random dimensions
</p>
<p>3) When I tried to update windows 8 to windows 10 it wouldn't update. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run anti-malware software, and that doesn't seem to be the problem. I just ran Troubleshooting on Hardware and Devise, and it came up with the message "There is a problem with the driver for Standard SATA AHCI Controller. The driver needs to be reinstalled."
 But when clicked to apply the fix, it said "Troubleshooting was unable to automatically fix the issues found, Stand&nbsp;Standard SATA AHCI Controller has a driver problem".</p>
<p>I don't know if this is the reason I'm having issues with my laptop, but I'd really appreciate some advice on how to fix these problems.</p>
<p>
