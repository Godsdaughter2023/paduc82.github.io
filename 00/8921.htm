<h2>            iPad Word says I do not have permission to access files on my OneDrive</h2>
                    I use Word 2016 to save to and retrieve documents from OneDrive on my laptop without problem.&nbsp; On my iPad OneDrive displays my files and pdf file open properly in other apps.&nbsp; However, when I try to open Word or Excel files either by clicking in OneDrive
 or from the app, either the app repeatedly asks me to sign in or informs me that I do not have permission to access the file.&nbsp; The apps and OneDrive are part of the same account.&nbsp; I have removed and reinstalled OneDrive, Word and Excel from my iPad with no
 change.

<p>Hi Hevar,<br />
<br />
To help check this issue from our backend, I’d like to collect the tenant information, credit card information and the entire notification email to report to our relevant team<br />
<br />
Besides, could you make sure if you have changed the credit card information or have two credit cards? If you have two credit cards, would you mind removing the old credit card which is not used now?<br />
To protect your privacy, I have sent a private message to collect the tenant information credit card information and the entire notification email. You can access it via the link below:<br />

Regards,<br />

<h2>            How can I display my &#34;multiple items&#34;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I want to select multiple items in my pivot table, but for printing and viewing, I would like to know what is selected.</p>
<p>Is there a way to display that information in an adjacent cell (outside of the pivot table)?&nbsp; For instance, when I select ME, NH and CT from my STATES field, I thought something like</p>
<p>=GETPIVOTDATA("STATES",$A$1) might work in cell D1, but I get the #REF! error.</p>

<p>A simple set of data would be this</p>
<ul>
<li>State&nbsp;&nbsp; Policies </li><li>CT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 </li><li>MA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 </li><li>ME&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4 </li><li>NH&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8 </li><li>NY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16 </li><li>RI&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 32 </li><li>VT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 64 </li></ul>
<p>In my Pivot Table, I want to sum the number of policies for CT, ME and NH.&nbsp; So I use "State" as a filter.&nbsp; Adjacent to the "State"&nbsp;entry is a drop-down, where I select "Choose multiple items" and check the 3 states.&nbsp; The entry for "State" shows as "(Multiple
 Items)".&nbsp; When I print this page, I get the number (13), but no one can tell which states were selected.&nbsp; Is there a way to get the multiple items out of a filter and into a cell so that a print would display what has been selected?</p>
<p>If my Pivot Table starts in A1, then A1 would contain "State", B1 would contain "(Multiple Items)".&nbsp; Can I make D1 display "CT, ME, NH" or even "CTMENH".</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>there is no direct way to link a cell with the footer.</p>
<p>But you can use an event macro like:</p>
<p>Private Sub Worksheet_Change(ByVal Target As Range)<br />
&nbsp; If Target.Address(0, 0) = "A1" Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveSheet.PageSetup.RightFooter = Me.Range("A1").Value<br />
&nbsp; End If<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>Right click the sheet tab, choose view code, copy &amp; paste the code.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Frank,</p>
<p>Your approach does not work if A1 is not the only changed cell of the worksheet change, for example if you array-enter into A1:A2</p>
<p>'This does not work</p>
<p>I suggest to test the intersection:</p>
Private Sub Worksheet_Change(ByVal Target As Range)<br />
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With Application<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .EnableEvents = False<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Not .Intersect(Target, [A1]) Is Nothing Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveSheet.PageSetup.RightFooter = [A1]<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .EnableEvents = True<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With<br />
End Sub</p>

<p>The code you posted does not work if the value in cell A1 of sheet 1 was changed while the sheets were grouped with Sheet2 (or some other sheet) as the active sheet. This works by changing the footer when print (or printpreview) is selected.</p>
<p>Private Sub Workbook_BeforePrint(Cancel As Boolean)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim wks As Worksheet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Each wks In ActiveWindow.SelectedSheets<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If wks.CodeName = "Sheet1" Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wks.PageSetup.RightFooter = wks.Range("A1").Value<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next wks<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
End Sub</p>
<p>The above code needs to be placed in ThisWorkbook. Right click the XL icon next to File in the upper left corner of the screen and select view code. paste the above code. Note that it uses the sheets's code name and not it's tab name. To the OP. If you want
 help with the code name thing or are a bit lost just ask.</p>

<h2>            &#91;BUILD 18898&#93; Night Light Issues</h2>
                    <p>Hi, i joined the windows insider program just a week ago (<strong>F A S T</strong> ring) , but i soon regretted that choice as It's full of bugs and instabilities.</p>
<p>My biggest complaint is the night light (blue light filter): it doesn't work at all. I also tried to install f.lux, another blue light filter app, but it doesn't work either. What i did is update the driver for my gpu (vega 3) and reinstall it. Neither of
 these solved the prooblem. Any clues?</p>

<p>Welcome to use Insider previews. All kind of bugs are expected when using beta versions of next Windows versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This night light bug is known issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Quote from insider blog:</p>
<p><span>We’re investigating reports that on certain devices, if fast startup is enabled, night light doesn’t turn on until after a restart. (Note: The problem will occur on a “cold” reboot or power off / power on. To work around if night light doesn’t turn
 on, use Start &gt; Power &gt; Restart.)</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>If you installed that preview less than 10 days ago you should be able to go back to previously installed version of Windows. See Settings / Update / Recovery is there "Go back to the previous version of Windows 10" button active.</span></p>

<h2>            &#38;quot&#59;Download failed&#38;quot&#59; problem in Ovi Player</h2>
                    
<p>I can't download anything from the Music Store. I always get download failed error message after every single song. Any solutions for this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My device: X6</p>
<p>OS: Win 7 Professional x64 (no WMP or IE)</p>
<p>Default music player: Foobar2000 v1.0</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will not install WMP to my system and will not use Ovi Player as default player.</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I have also the same problem "download failed" ...<br />
I am using Win 7 prof 64Bit, Comes with music, X6, NO Windows Media Player, NO IE..<br />
I got an answer from support telling me to install again after deleting cache, cookies and the database.... This did not help!</p>
<p>Is anyone there using Win 7 who is able to download from Nokia Musik store?</p>
<p>What is the trick?</p>
<p>All hints are appreciated :-)</p>

<p>It was necessary to install Windows Media Player (WMP), which I already stated in my previous post. DRM doesn't work without it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is that I didn't have WMP installed at all because I don't like it. Now I was forced to do it.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not convinced that installing WMP is the solution to this problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below is are some details;</p>
<p>Mobile Device : Nokia X6</p>
<p>Ovi Player : v2.1.10304</p>
<p>WMP : v11</p>
<p>OS : Windows XP SP2</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As shown in the screen attached, I've managed to download albums partially. I've retried many times and still retrying but downloads still are failing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am able to play successful downloaded files from WMP &amp; OviPlayer so licencing is not an issue as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My Questions;</p>
<p>1. If WMP was the issue that how come some files are successfully downloaded and some are not?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also note that after several attempts I've also reinstalled WMP however result remains the same</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your feedback is much appreciated, thanks in advance.</p>

<p>hey..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>same thing here..</p>
<p>are you from Malaysia?</p>
<p>just noted this happened since around Monday</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>guessing the cause is Streamyx (ISP) blocking certain ports that Ovi player uses to download</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>figured this is the case since</p>
<p>1) i'm able to download through my mobile (X6) using the same ISP (through wifi)</p>
<p>2) able to download through mobile using mobile ISP</p>
<p>3) able to download with the same pc that has the download failed problem using the mobile ISP (used my phone as the modem through ovi suite)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>havent figured out any way to solve this..</p>
<p>would be glad if someone came up with an actual solution...</p>
<p>I do have WMP and IE...</p>
<p>plus downloads worked fine a couple of weeks ago</p>

<p>I am facing the same problem - downlod fails everytime!!!. This seems to be related to recent change - Nokia Music -&gt; Ovi Music.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Location: India.</p>
<p>OS:&nbsp;Windows Vista Home Premium</p>
<p>Ovi Player: version&nbsp;2.1.10304.00.</p>
<p>Windows Media Player:&nbsp;version 11 (Not sure what does this have to do with WMP).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The topic is marked "Solved", and the resolution indicated is installation of WMP. Other persons having WMP installed still face this problem. I'm new to this forum. Could someone who still faces the issue change the topic to 'Unsolved'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions/help would be appreciated!</p>

<p>@_him , I would suggest you to remove all Nokia software from your PC , delete related files, folders from Program Files. restart then Install in following order.</p>
<p>1) WMP 11</p>
<p>2) Nokia OVI Suite 2.1.1 or PC Suite 7.1 - Ensure that phone connects and you can work.</p>
<p>3) OVI Player 2.1 - Try setting up Folder location , country corectly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then give a try again. let me know how it goes. If it helps you can "Kudo" me. :)</p>

            <p>Here are three mini-projects that hopefully will help you:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">PLAN A</span>:</p>
<p>This method works on an 'Uninstall &amp; Reinstall' on the same computer. I don't know if it will work for computers #2 &amp; 3 for a 3-License pack, but may be worth trying to move these files to the new machines from the existing machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Look In-</p>
<p><em>/MacintoshHD/Library/LaunchDaemons/</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For com.microsoft.office.licensing.helper.plist</p>
<p>and </p>
<p>/MacintoshHD/Library/PriveledgedHelperTools </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For com.microsoft.office.licensing.helper</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>/MacintoshHD/Library/Preferences/com.microsoft.office.licensing.plist</p>
<p>
</p><p>(If your root directory is called something different, change MacintoshHD to what ever yours is called.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Save these files to a drive somewhere, perhaps your desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Install Office 2011. When you get to the part to enter your license, enter anything at all in the Key boxes. (Save the phone number that pops up for "Plan C", below)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let the installer close. Keep Office programs closed. </p>
<p>Restart the computer.</p>
<br />
<p>Now, put the saved files back where they came from, in the place of any that were created when the program was installed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use Disk Utility.App to do a Permissions Repair</p>
Restart the machine
<p>
</p><p>I had to recently re-install Office 2011 &amp; did not have the product key at my current location.
</p>
<p>I saved these files before I deleted all things Microsoft during an uninstall.
</p>
<p>When I re-installed Office 2011, I put these files back &amp; did not have to enter my product key.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">PLAN B</span>:</p>
<p>If it is too late to save those files, do you have a Time Machine or other backup to get these files from?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">PLAN C</span>:</p>
<p>I do not know if this will work on Office 2011, but it worked on Office 2004 once for a friend. His key was missing. Upon reinstalling Office 2004, I entered nonsense in the box where you enter the product key. A telephone number popped up. I called the
 number and told the agent the situation. After giving her the name &amp; e-mail address that was on file with them, she verified ownership &amp; activated the program. If you are in the US, the telephone number was 1-866-825-4797</p>
<p>

<h2>            Need help with Windows 10 corrupting disks</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I need some help with continuous disk corruption by Windows 10 Preview - each time I switch to my&nbsp;ordinary system (Vista32) it indicates that&nbsp;the chdsk check is needed and then it finds problems on the all disks that have been used during my activity
 on Win10 Preview. It is mainly some attributes corruption (which chdsk from Vista deletes - but this is many thousand files - so it takes long. Once it however detected error in ownership on W10P disk&nbsp;and changed it all to Vista's, which resulted in Win10
 Preview being non-usable). All suggestions much welcomed.</p>
<p>Win10Pr - Crucial SSD</p>
<p>Vista32 - Kingston SSD</p>
<p>Dell Inspiron 530 (no AHCI available in BIOS)</p>

<p>Memory problems are not so simple.&nbsp; A simple memory test can pass while a comprehensive memory test can fail because there are many factors that can cause it to fail.&nbsp; If the CPU caches are enabled the CPU can write a value and then read it right back from
 its cache and see the same&nbsp; value but when&nbsp; that value eventually makes it back to the memory it could have dropped some bits.&nbsp; It is best to run memory tests&nbsp; with the&nbsp; CPU caches turned off.&nbsp; That causes the CPU to actually write all the way to memory and
 read those value back from memory.&nbsp; Some memory will not fail unless certain patterns of reference occur so there are many types of memory tests that use different algorithms to try to detect memory failure.&nbsp; It&nbsp; could be that Windows 10 uses more memory than
 WIndows 8.1 did or references&nbsp;the memory differently and could experience memory problems that do not appear in Windows 8.1.&nbsp; I do not see hardly any posts about file system problems so the first thing to eliminate is a memory issue by&nbsp;running a thorough memory&nbsp;
 diagnostic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The windows memory&nbsp; diagnostic is found in Control Panel/Administrative tools.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can choose to restart&nbsp;&nbsp;immediately or schedule the&nbsp; test and restart at a time of your choosing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When&nbsp; rebooting, the&nbsp;memory test&nbsp; will start.&nbsp; Press F1 to set options.</p>
<p>Choose Extended and tab to set Cache off.&nbsp; Then press F10&nbsp;&nbsp;to apply and start running the tests.</p>
<p>You can also do the extended test again with Cache turned on to see if any problems occur in the CPU caches.</p>

            <p>I do note that both of you are having the same problems and seem to have the same SSD configuration.</p>
<p>Old windows on a Kingston SSD and Windows 10 on a Crucial SSD.&nbsp; Do both of you only need to run chkdsk on the Crucial SSD's?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, would both of you post the model numbers of your Crucial SSD's?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Another thing to try is to turn off Windows write caching.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to device manager and double click on your SSD disk drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>See if you have a Policies&nbsp; folder and&nbsp; if so, uncheck the "Enable write caching".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then just wait and see if you still have problems.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a problem like this when I switched from Win 8\8.1 to Win 7 Pro...</p>
<p>I do this by reloading images onto my SSD... I don't use any type of dual boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what I can find, it has something to do with the Disk Optimization running on one OS, and messing up the other... This only happened whaen switching from Win 8 to Win 7, and not the other way...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I disabled the auto optimization and haven't had any more issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've not noticed this on Win 10, but knowing of the possibility of the problem, I disabled the auto optimization immediately upon installation...</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW... I'm also using SSD's. I had been using a OCZ vertex 4, and I am now using a Crucial MX100.</p>
<p>The problem happened with both, as well as the three other HDDs that are installed.</p>

<p>Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Administrative Tools\Defragment and Optimize Drives.</p>

            <p>Same problem on a PC with MBR mode (old BIOS)</p>
<p>PC with 1 disk running Vista 32</p>
<p>
</p><p>Adding a blank disk to install Win10TP</p>
<p>I don't use multiboot, to avoid issues, swapping boot disk in Bios</p>
<p>BUT...</p>
<p>I installed Win10TP whithout disconnecting the Vista disk , and Win10TP CREATES multiboot !</p>
<p>(maybe i missed something)</p>
<p>Swapping boot disk in Bios is not efficient</p>
<p>I think the problem is related to system partitions and Bootmgr/BCD</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't know if it's the same with UEFI</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, installing WinTP10 on a drive, and having another blank disk connected, WinTP10 will use space for system partitions on this disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Conclusion: leave only the WinTP10 installation disk connected at installation.</p>

</p><p>Skype for Business uses a different application and some features may not work.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, to isolate the issue, could you provide us the <strong>specific Skype version</strong> you have installed on your device?

</p><p>To check the Skype version, please refer to this FAQ: <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34757/what-version-of-skype-am-i-using-on-mobile-or-tablet?q=skype+version" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
What version of Skype am I using on mobile or tablet?</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly try <strong>uninstalling </strong>and <strong>reinstalling </strong>the Skype application and see if there'd be changes.

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know of the results. </p>

<p>Hi Joseph,</p>
<p>I'm using 8.28.0.41 version of Skype, which I believe is the latest.</p>
<p>I already tried uninstalling and re-downloading Skype, did not help unfortunately...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I just realized that I'm able to send&nbsp;<span>emoticons when typing them manually, for example I can type (smile) and it will send a smiley face. However, I'm still unable to open up the&nbsp;</span><span>emoticons
 menu for some reason.</span></p>

            Please try these options one by one and check after each option. 
<br />
<br />1. Try repairing your office installation (Quick repair is good enough). Try repairing your Office installation. First try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Many third party applications also cause the problem like Tuneup Utilities, Abby Finereader, Kaspersky &amp; other Anti Viruses  etc. If you want to know if some program is conflicting -
<br />
<br />Boot your computer in Clean boot mode and then start the application. If it works successfully, then some program is conflicting with this. 
<br />Refer to the section - How to determine what is causing the problem after you do a clean boot. 
<br />Don't forget to do - Reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting.
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135...</a>
<br />
<br />3. Sometimes, this is caused due to application not being able to access the default printer. Close all office applications and change your default printer through Start &gt; Devices and Printers to another printer. It may be some physical one or One Note or XPS or PDF or anything else. If this is the problem, then you will need to update your printer driver for default printer. 
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help. If above didn't work, I will supply more troubleshooting steps to solve this problem.

<p>I have another very irritating problem. About half the times I print from Word, the program quits (printing sometimes even as it quits). Since auto recovery works intermittently, I have to go back and reconstruct the 5-8 docs I have open. Very inconvenient
 and has occasioned some very expressive language on my part. </p>

    <title>Outlook Sync problems with WP8 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ek selvaraj  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook Sync problems with WP8</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I purchased an HTC 8x Windows Phone and wanted to sync with my Outlook 2010 on Windows 7. Followed the instructions to sync using live ID and Hotmail Connector. I was able to sync my phone with only the calendar and contacts from my outlook but not the tasks.
 Also, the calendar sync requires you to create a hotmail calendar which gets shown in the outlook but this doesnt show up as the default in the to-do bar of the Outlook. Due to this all new appointments I receive go to the outlook's calendar and not the new
 hotmail calendar. I tried all suggestions from the net to set the data file of the hotmail account as default but it doesnt allow me to do that saying the data file is unavailable. I even tried to setup hotmail thru POP3 in my outlook but although this helped
 me to set the hotmail calendar as default doesnt sync with the hotmail live account thus failing the basic syncing with my phone. Any help would be apprecaited.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>EK</p>

            You can still set the Hotmail data file as the default even though it's "unavailable". That error message is a red herring. The data files menu you're looking at shows the locations of the Outlook .pst files. Hotmail uses an ".ost", rather than a .pst,
 so Outlook "correctly" reports the Hotmail account's .pst file is unavailable, since it doesn't exist. Select the account anyway and make it the default.
<div><br />
<div>As to Tasks, I'm afraid you're stuck; the Outlook Connector doesn't support Tasks, so Outlook Tasks won't sync to Live/Hotmail or vice versa. This is fixed in Outlook 2013, which syncs to Hotmail natively without the need for the Outlook Connector, so
 Tasks will sync.&nbsp;</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Setting the hotmail account as default doesnt set its calendar as outlook's default. It requires to set the hotmail account's data file as default. Now when&nbsp;I do that I get the following error. On OK it doesnt do anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>---------------------------<br />
Mail Delivery Location<br />
---------------------------<br />
The selected Outlook data file (.pst) format cannot be used. Outlook data files (.pst) must use the same format as offline Outlook data files (.ost). Select a matching Outlook data file (.pst) or turn off cache mode in the Account Settings.<br />

OK&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />

Hmm, I've never seen that error message before. &nbsp;What version of Outlook are you using? &nbsp;(I think 2K3 and up are supported by the Connector, but I'm only using 2007 and 2010 (and I couldn't find a cache setting on either.) &nbsp;You might want to delete the Hotmail
 account and recreate it in case the data file is damaged in some way.

            <p>That's not an issue.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've got well over a dozen accounts in Outlook 2010 and my Live accounts (three of them) all sync&nbsp;fine with my devices (via Live), although only one (my wife's)&nbsp;can be&nbsp;set as the default.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm stumped.&nbsp; My only troubleshooting suggestion at this point (to determine if this is an Outlook problem or a Live/Hotmail problem) would be to&nbsp;create a new Live/Hotmail account, add that account to&nbsp;Outlook on the PC, toss in a few test contacts,&nbsp;and try
 to make that account the default data file&nbsp;to see if your error message rears its ugly head again (indicating the problem is with Outlook) or it it works (telling us the original&nbsp;Hotmail account is the issue.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only thing I can't duplicate for you&nbsp;on my PC&nbsp;is the Exchange account. I don't have one, (just Hotmail/Live accounts) so perhaps Exchange doesn't play nicely with the Outlook Connector (Live/Hotmail acts as a&nbsp;sort of faux-Exchange account in Outlook
 when added by the Connector and might not get along with real Exchange)&nbsp;and&nbsp;might be&nbsp;what's causing the issue.&nbsp; Is the Exchange account your current default data file?</p>

<h2>            Does the navigation pane no longer work after restricted editing is turned on&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I created a form that I would like others not to be able to change, so I added some text forms controls and some date picker controls. Then I turned on restricted editing with "Filling in forms" as the restriction. Now the form can be filled out, but the
 navigation pane and table of contents only send me to the nearest form control.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way for the user to still use the navigation pane headers, even though it's a document with the "Filling in forms" restriction?</p>

            <p>No, Word is performing "as designed". When forms protection is turned on, the cursor/selection point cannot be placed anywhere in the document except within a form field. That's true whether you're using the mouse, the arrow keys, the navigation pane, TOC
 or other hyperlinks, the GoTo dialog, or any other means of moving the cursor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your document doesn't have to be shared with users of Word 2003 or earlier, or Word for Mac, then replace all the form fields with content controls. To provide protection against editing of the static text, select the "No changes (read only)" form of
 restriction, and then select each content control and check the "Everyone" box in the restriction pane. Alternatively, if you don't need to place a password on the protection, just select the whole document and click Developer &gt; Group &gt; Group. In either case,
 the TOC and navigation pane will operate normally.</p>

<p><span>I purchased Microsoft Office 2007 in 2006.&nbsp; I have installed it on multiple computers, all of which were run by Microsoft Windows.&nbsp; Unfortunately computers that are used regularly, do not last very long and I have had to purchase
 six computers in the last eight years.&nbsp; I am now trying to install Microsoft Office 2007 onto my sixth computer and I am receiving an activation error due to the number of times the product has been installed.&nbsp;

<p><span>I understand that the product key keeps the product from being pirated, or given away to friends and family.&nbsp; That part makes complete sense.&nbsp; What does not make sense, is that if the first five computers that the product has
 been installed on, no longer work, and are no longer being used by the owner of said key, you cannot deactivate those computers from the product key, so I can install the product on a new computer that actually works?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The “Answer Desk” is telling me that this is a “warranty” issue when in fact it is not.&nbsp; They would like me to spend $100 on a 30 day warranty extension that will somehow cover an additional activation.&nbsp; This is robbery.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I do not need this product to work on more than 5 computers.&nbsp; At the moment, I only have two computers.&nbsp; I spent the $100+, eight years ago and the product still works, so why are you forcing me to buy a new one?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This is extremely frustrating. I have an apple Ipad that requires activation in order to sync information. It also allows five device activations.&nbsp; However Apple understands that computers do not last forever and so they allow
 you to deactivate old computers that you are no longer using.&nbsp; &nbsp;This allows you to continue to use the product that you purchased and keeps you from being forced to buy a new one.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I am being held hostage, and it is not right.&nbsp; I would like for you to allow me to use the product that I paid for by deactivating the old computers, or send me a new product key.&nbsp; It is unreasonable to expect me to pay additional
 money to use a product that I have already paid for.&nbsp; It is already bad enough I have had to purchase six computers in eight years due to various hardware and software issues that Microsoft products played a large part in.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This entire experience is forcing me to look seriously at getting away from Microsoft products completely.&nbsp; This really feels like the final straw, and I am finally understand why so many people are turning to Apple products
 and getting away from Microsoft.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please make this right.&nbsp; I am not asking for anything more than to use the product I have paid for and not be held hostage to buy a new one.</span></p>

<div>What do you mean by 'coming back'? You cannot entirely eliminate English US - all the English dictionaries contain common elements. What you can(and should) do is uncheck the 'detect language automatically' option from the Word
 language dialog as it is unreliable - and ensure that the text at the cursor is formatted with the correct proofing language. Then the only thing likely to cause the language to change is to paste formatted material that has a different language parameter
 applied - particularly from web sources of which most English language pages are formatted in US English.</div>

<p>What I mean by 'coming back' is that when someone emails me using US English, and I reply, I would like the spell checker to check with Canadian English but it always checks using US English. &nbsp;I have&nbsp;unchecked the 'detect language automatically'.</p>
<p>Any more suggestions?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Ray</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS--why does the spell checker incorrectly flag "advise" and "advice?" &nbsp;It seems to think that "advise" is a noun and it thinks that "advice" is a verb.</p>

<p>My Outlook even reverts to US English when I add to my own messages by forwarding them. &nbsp;The spell checker uses US English even though I have set the default to Canadian English and all parts of the message where written while the language was set to Canadian
 English. &nbsp;AARGGHH! &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS--the Google Chrome spell checker just underlined "AARGGHH!" and tried to use the US English dictionary to check the spelling. &nbsp;Just another small example of how the U.S. has a world-wide reputation of arrogance.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't think this poster is off line but it's too bad we can't get ''World English''...the american spelling is a form of slang that is used in the U.S. only...their population is only 4.4% of the world so I think the poster is frustrated at the majority
 trying to be dictated too from the tiny american minority...I don't believe any ill thought was intended...<br />

            <p>I am becoming so tired of Not in any site I ever view demonstrate that Canada is an accepted country Listing for location, Language or setting. Google, This site, and most other's do not recognize our Great partner of The United states just above you. And
 you don't have the decency in Keeping our distinct language as accepted. When did we get removed in the world wide decision by Microsoft, and any other United States website as non existent. I have written our Government and many times to the Browser Developers
 to put us back into the list of country setting or I would delete them from my system and now you are getting the same informative statement. Change this setting back to include Canada as a setting and show Our Flag or I will take that as an act of War, and
 treat all as Enemies of our country. Who In our Government said to you Hey Microsoft. Don't list us anymore we don't want to be recognised anymore as a country. Our Government wants us to become a dictated state anyway so we might as well get that out of the
 way!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The audacity of Some Peoples children. I would assure you that at no time would you ever convince any Canadian that you can or should have ever removed our flag or name of our country from anything unless you want your butt kicked back to where you came
 from and we will stop doing business with you nor will we go to work for your companies to create new programs which you say are American when you got almost every one of your smartest people from right here In Canada as was done with NASA when the asked Diefenbaker
 to stop the Avro Aero Program for your Space program. You People have some nerve. You will end up with people who visit our country never being able to get correct information or treatment respective of who they are just because you don't treat us as anything.
 Change your Settings SIR:!!!!!</p>

            <p>In no Place in the world does ENGLISH REPRESENT AMERICAN AS the language's originator. English comes from England and they came To Canada and the US. Not just America. And you Bastardized your language by becoming uneducated and allowing your people to go
 through school without actually learning much. It is demonstrated on many Q&amp;A's on most web pages that Americaise is in fact a language which came from English but is no longer English. The above word of Your languages doesn't really exist by the way in case
 you think it does.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So why do you think that this bastardization of English Language should be forced on a Country with stronger ties to ENGLAND than to your country who's uneducated people can't even figure out who we are and that we were the ones sent in &nbsp;FIRST in the war's,
 we taught your special forces how to fight with our Black watch troops sent to teach you in Nam, and that we were always there before you. You just come in later and claim that you were the ones who won the war when you were always late!</p>
<p>
</p><p>We fought you and burned your white house so that it got its name because we burnt it and you had to whitewash it and that is why your Government whitewashes you in almost everything that take place in the world. You never see what others see about you,
 or what they think about you. That is because we are more kind and democratic than you are. We try and show that we are lenient and loving people and all we get back is stupidity. Either fix what has been a disgrace to our partnership or just go away. We really
 don't need you as much as you need us. We have water, oil, food trees and minerals. we make our homes safer than you do and protected from all weather. We understand that the only places allowed in your country for trailer parks are areas which are directly
 in the line of tornado alley. That is hat you do to your people. But don't ever disrespect us. We save your **** every day.</p>

            <p>Wow! You really do have a chip on your shoulder. I don't know why you brought my post from this ancient thread into this matter. I am not American. I have never even been to America. I like my fellow contributors do not work for nor speak for Microsoft.
 This is a public peer group forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I don't think there is any Microsoft application that does not allow it to use Canadian English (or a whole range of alternative English versions). And for that matter Google Chrome, which was mentioned earlier in the thread can also be configured
 for Canadian English (or Canadian French).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Web pages, however, use the spelling choices of whoever created them. No doubt web pages created in Canada will feature Canadian spellings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I live in a country where the national language is Greek, but I am English by birth and my web site has UK English spelling. I won't be changing it to Canadian English, or (US English).</p>

            I believe I had asked why our countries language settings, our flag and our contrives name had been removed from the settings bar for webpages. If that bother's you Sir. Imagine how going to a page and signing on and trying to make use of My countries
 language, and residence can't be found and when you do use them the rest of the system doesn't work. I don't remember a language called American sir. I remember only English and it wasn't from the US but from England and not the US. So if I seem perturbed
 So be it. I will continue to be perturbed until our countries settings have been reinstated in all pages from the US.

<p>
</p><p>I had checked the Region and Timezones on both pc's before posting, but checked them again. &nbsp;Both are showing the correct information (see attached image). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whilst in this area, I re-selected the same information as shown below, but received an error message and Outlook wouldn't let me save the re-selected information. &nbsp;A copy of the error message is also attached (with what appeared to be person info deleted).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you or anyone else help with this?</p>

<p>Hi Lyron,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried the above and it does not work, I clicked the first email box, went to the last email and held shift key and clicked the box and nothing happens, it does not select all the other emails, any suggestions? Can you not do this from your end?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>Michael</p>
