            I can't find any information on that file however that does not mean it is malware.
<br />
<br />Find its location on your computer - does the location tell you anything about its identity? Right Click the file - Properties - Details tab - any information there?
<br />

<br />
<br />Scan using Malwarebytes:

            Hi Felix, are you running a Dell?
<br />
<br />If so it is associated with Dell Control Vault. If yor do not have or use a Fingerprint Scanner, you can uninstall Dell Control Vault from Control Panel - Programs and Features
<br />
<br />If you do use it, go to the Support page on the Dell website and update it if it is causing errors . . .

<h2>            CPU spikes to 100&#37;. Mostly watching video and You Tube</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Windows Updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently suffered severe PC slow downs a few days after a format and fresh install, CPU spikes to 100%. Mostly watching video and You Tube, but also just broswering the internet. No maleware, spyware or virus present. Went through various things to solve
 the problem with no success.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I done a format and fresh install. At this point the only difference from the previous install I have not updated the PC through windows update and the problem has gone away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously for security some updates are needed, but there are about 130 updates to install. Is there a way of identifying which update was causing the problem without installing one update at a time. What updates are more important.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
Did you make any changes on the computer prior to the issue?
<div><br />
<strong>Method 1:<br />
</strong>You may perform a clean boot and check if the issue occur.<br />
How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows XP: <br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353</a><br />
Note: After clean boot troubleshooting step, follow the “Steps to configure Windows to use a Normal startup state” in the provided link to return your computer to Normal startup mode.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 2:<br />
</strong>You may also run a Microsoft safety scanner to make sure computer is free from virus infection:<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a><br />

 File History, System Image, Backup and Restore in Windows 10 are partially broken and they are not being actively maintained or developed. Microsoft is planning to remove them in a future release. You are seeing the effects of this. You should switch to a third party solution such as Macrium Reflect (Free).
Learn more: https://www.groovypost.com/howto/create-windows-10-system-image-best-free-alternatives/
Details:
Let’s start off with Macrium Reflect (Free) (https://www.macrium.com/reflectfree). Macrium provides a small click to run the installer, but I chose the offline installer, which required finding the download agent (http://updates.macrium.com/reflect/v5.0/reflectdl.exe); this downloads the full installer at around 800 MBs. Included are a collection of preinstallation environment tools based on Microsoft’s Windows Image deployment solutions.
Setup was quick and easy but needed a restart to complete changes made to the system.
The Macrium Reflect interface is a bit more jam-packed than what you would normally find in Windows 10. But this a powerful alternative offering a range of options for creating and managing backups. Macrium integrates heavily with Windows—examples include support for attaching and browsing backups; boot image backups in Hyper-V; generating PowerShell scripts to automate backups; creating batch files and of course, scheduling backups. You can also find handy options such as cloning and standard file and folder backup.
For these instructions, we are going to focus on image backups. Similar to the System Image backup (https://www.groovypost.com/howto/create-windows-10-system-image-backup/) feature in Windows 10 and previous versions, this lets you create a replica of your current installation state. You can be granular with your backups by choosing only the partitions you want to save as part of your image.
To create your first image, click the menu Create an image of the partition(s) required to backup and restore Windows.
Under Destination, click the Browse button, then point to your external drive where you want to store the backup, create a new folder, select it then click OK. Click Next to Continue.
 
This phase of the wizard lets you create a Backup plan if you want. It’s optional, but lets you choose different methods of backups which include full, incremental and differential. For now, I am going to choose a schedule just to make things simple. I recommend you review the retention rules to save on disk space. Users can retain a number of backups using any method; this can quickly eat up disk space over time, so I will reduce the amount for each to about two. Click Next to Continue.
What are Incremental and Differential Backups and which should you choose?
A full backup gives you one backup file that restores your entire system up to that point. Full backups are a comprehensive way to go, but they take a long time to create and if you have multiple backup images, you end up duplicating a lot of the same data. Incremental and differential backups are two ways to address this inefficiency.
Incremental Backup – This maintains a regular backup in addition to changes that have been made since the last full or incremental backup. Incremental backups are often preferred because they use less disk space; not to mention, they are faster, too. So, if you created new Word documents since your last backup, those are added to the backup.
So, let’s say Backup A is a full backup you made on Monday. On Wednesday, you can make an incremental Backup B which only includes the new data since Backup A. On Friday, you can make Backup C, which only includes the new data since Backup B. In this way, you are storing no duplicate data. The downside is that if you want to restore your image, you have to use all three backup files: Backup A, Backup B, and Backup C.
Differential Backup – This creates a backup of the differences made since the last full backup. So, if you made changes to a few Microsoft Word documents, those changes are applied to the backup. A disadvantage is that differential backups use more space, since you need to maintain a full backup in addition to changes since you created your last backup.
How is that different than an incremental backup? Let’s say you make a full Backup A on Monday. On Wednesday, Backup B contains the differences since Backup A was made. On Friday, Backup C contains the differences since Backup A.  In this way, if you want to do a restoration, you just need two files: the last full backup and the last differential backup. This means you only ever need two files, compared to the incremental backup method. The downside is that, as you can imagine, your differential backup image file gets bigger and bigger as the time since your last full backup increases. And after awhile, you end up with a quite a bit of duplicated data across your various differential backups.
So, which should you use? Either one is fine. It all depends on how much storage space and time you have. Incremental backups are faster and take less space during the backup phase. Differential backups take more time and space during the backup phase but are easier during the restoration phase.
Review the image summary to ensure you chose the right options. If you maintain a dual boot configuration, make sure each partition is checked as part of your backup. Click Finish to begin the backup.
Click OK to start the backup immediately.
As with all image backups, it will take some time, so, sit back and relax as your image is saved. Click Close after your image is created.
Restoring Your Macrium Image
There are multiple ways to restore a backup. You can start the restore process from within a running installation of Windows 10 with Macrium already installed. But in most cases, restoring an image would take place after booting into a recovery environment similar to System Image in Windows 10.
Create Rescue Media
One important task you should complete after creating your image is to create rescue media, which will facilitate restoration of the image. This is perfect for scenarios where your computer won’t boot or you installed a new empty hard disk. Click the Other Tasks menu then click Create Rescue Media.
This will start the create bootable rescue media wizard. Remember, as we mentioned earlier, Macrium downloads a full installer at around 800 MBs. This is where the preinstallation environment tools based on Microsoft’s Windows Image deployment solutions are used. Macrium adds its own recovery tools to facilitate restoration of the image when you boot from it. Click Next.
You can add drivers in advance for hardware that might not be supported by the restored image. Click the Update Driver button to do so then point to the source. This can minimize the chances of Windows 10 not booting on new hardware; especially if you are changing motherboards.
Depending on the architecture of your Windows 10 image, you can choose either a 32 or 64-bit (https://www.groovypost.com/howto/windows-10-edition-architecture-build-your-install/) recovery image. For this particular case, I am restoring a 64 bit Windows 10 installation, so I will choose that. Click Next to begin the creation.
Bootable media can be prepared using a blank DVD or USB drive or you can create a bootable ISO image instead. Choose your desired method, then click Finish.
Restore Image – Macrium Reflect
Configure your computer to boot from the installation media (https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setup-guide-boot-from-cd-dvd-usb-drive-sd-card/) on the target computer. Attach your external drive where the image is stored, then power it on.
Under the Restore tab in Macrium, click the menu, Browse for an image or backup file to restore.
Browse to the image file, select it then click Open.
Click Select a disk to restore to… then click the selected image that appears. Click Next to begin the restoration.
After the image is successfully restored, click File &gt; Exit to reboot.
That’s pretty much all that’s involved in preparing a system image of your Windows 10 installation using Macrium Reflect. Macrium feels a little complex and overwhelming at first, but once you familiarize yourself with it, you should feel comfortable using it in no time.

            Hi,
<br />sure you can use an external drive for backup. This is even more preferable than internal drive, it you'll store the external drive disconnected - if someone happens with a computer backup will be intact.

<br />
The short answer is you can't install OE on a Windows 7 (any version) machine. You can download and install Windows Live Mail or Thunderbird (both free) or spend a few $$$$ and use Outlook 2007.<br />

<h2>            User Account Control blocks an app</h2>
                    <p>I have tried every suggestion that I have seen on this bug and still cannot get around it! I downloaded some genealogy software called Legacy 8, but Windows won't let me run the Setup file. I get a pop up that says:</p>
<p>User Account Control</p>
<p>This app has been blocked for your protection.</p>
<p>An administrator has blocked you from running this app. For more information, contact the administrator.</p>

<p>
</p><p>But when I click on the file properties, there is no option to unblock as in the instructions I've seen here and on other sites. I even tried a tech chat with Microsoft, but the tech was clueless! I could tell by her questions that she didn't understand
 my problem. If I can't get any help here, I guess I'll just have to take it to Office Depot or somewhere.</p>

<p>Louis,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your&nbsp;worry about losing properties such as Ratings if you transfer to another computer is misplaced.&nbsp; As far as setting properties is concerned, you can think of File explorer and WMP itself as both being valid means of setting file properties.&nbsp; If you copy
 the file to another computer having altered its properties in either&nbsp;File explorer or WMP, those properties will unaltered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for your main problem, the only time I have had the response "<em>You'll need to provide administrator permission&nbsp; ...</em>" was when I was trying to change a property {I think it was album name, the others changed without any issues} immediately after
 playing a track - WMP does not fully release tracks afterwards until another one is played or WMP is closed.&nbsp; I don't know if that is the situation here.</p>

            Thanks you are right. I had to switch music programs from windows media player to Musicbee.&nbsp; Windows Media Player went bonkers when I got to around 180,000 songs.&nbsp; I was trying to update some ratings quickly after listening to the song and was getting
 error messages.&nbsp; When I gave it more time the problem went away.&nbsp; Again Thanks.

            <p>Hello Chana,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern in Microsoft Community and welcome to the Windows 10 Family.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand the frustration when things don't go they are supposed to. Let me assist you to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>SYS file errors are typically caused by faulty hardware or corrupt device driver files. The file, storahci.sys, has description
<strong>MS AHCI Storport Miniport Driver</strong>. In most cases, you will experience storahci.sys blue screen errors after you’ve installed new hardware or software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So this error can be a result of&nbsp;incorrectly configured, old, or corrupted device drivers. As well it can be due to corruption in Windows registry from a recent software change.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>As an initial recommendation,&nbsp;I suggest you to d</span><span><span>eploy Startup Repair&nbsp;which automates common diagnostic and repair tasks of even unbootable Windows installations. If the computer fails over into Windows RE because
 of a detected boot failure, Startup Repair launches automatically. If however, Automatic repair fails over Windows RE too, Startup Repair can also be launched as a manual recovery tool from a Windows RE CD/DVD.</span></span></p>

            <p>Hello Chana,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for writing to us with the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second half of the question just says that after researching over internet you have discovered that the&nbsp;data was moved from C: to D:. Neither it says that you can login to desktop as you have mentioned "After restarting I get redirected to a troubleshooting
 menu".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to provide us more information as to what are the troubleshooting steps you have&nbsp;performed and the results which you have observed. Also, let us know the facts which helped you to lead to the conclusion that the data was moved over to D:.</p>

<h2>            How to really resolve error 0x80070005 Microsoft Store&#63;</h2>
                    <div>Well I just found out about this error that not only affects me by preventing downloading certain Microsoft Store games such as Metro Exodus, Broforce, Mutant Year Zero. It also affects the storage of other games like ARK or State of Decay 2, it does not
 let me go from the home screen because it does not have access to the administrator files. My user is Administrator.<br />
</div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div>I already uninstalled the June update KB4503293 and after restarting I was able to install the games. But restart again and the problem returned.</div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div>So I went back to update and I uninstalled it again but it did not work again.</div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div>I need to really fix it without having to reinstall Windows.</div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div>This mistake is discouraging me a lot to think about not renewing the Game Pass.</div>

<h2>            Can&#39;t control bluetooth device on computer</h2>
                    Hi, I have a windows 7 laptop. I have a Nakamichi wireless speaker. The laptop bluetooth found it and installed it. But there is no option for me to open it to connect. I double click the downloaded speaker device and even right click and selected "control"
 but nothing happens. How do I fix this? Thank you.

            <p>Hi James,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do understand that you are unable to connect Bluetooth speakers with Windows 7 and I will be happy to answer&nbsp;your query. Let me ask you;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Were you able to use the same speakers in the past?</li><li>If yes, do you remember making any specific change in the computer prior to the issue?</li></ul>
<p>The most common reason for this not getting connected could be that the Bluetooth speakers are not selected as default speakers.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7 is basically different from its predecessors. Try the steps below and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the speaker icon on the taskbar,&nbsp;you need to click right button. </p>
<p>There can see the option&nbsp;“playback devices” that&nbsp;will show you a list of devices connected to the computer. Those are Laptop speakers, Laptop headphones and Bluetooth hands-free audio. The first 2&nbsp;may be&nbsp;marked as default. You need to unmark them and set
 the Bluetooth as default one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also refer to: <strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/change-bluetooth-device-settings#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Change settings for a Bluetooth enabled device</a></strong></p>

</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

    <title>Scanning and Repairing Drive Stuck&#59; Hard Drive Corrupted&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Scanning and Repairing Drive Stuck&#59; Hard Drive Corrupted&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an ASUS laptop (purchased about 3 years ago) and recently upgraded to Windows 10. &nbsp;Everything has been fine until just the other day when I proceeded to log into my computer after it was in sleep mode. &nbsp;I entered my password as normal, but the computer
 froze. &nbsp;I had to do a hard shutdown and then turn it back on. &nbsp;Ever since then, the computer has been taking much longer to startup than it used to (around 10 minutes for everything to completely load and be usable). &nbsp;Not only is this a problem, but now my
 computer will not go longer than a half hour or so without freezing. &nbsp;The freezing usually occurs when I am trying to close out of a program or open another program. &nbsp;This freezing makes everything inoperable. &nbsp;I cannot press CTL+Alt+Delete, and my only solution
 is a hard shutdown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just today I noticed that every time I try to start my computer, I am getting the ChkDsk coming up and wanting to scan my hard drive. &nbsp;I did this once, and it appeared to get stuck at 7%. So I did a hard shutdown and rebooted the computer by skipping that
 step (I am given 10 seconds to skip that step by pressing any key within the given time frame). After this, I got an error notification through the Windows Notification Centrr that my hard drive had an error, and that I should restart the computer and scan
 the hard drive to fix the error. So I did that again and still stuck at 7% after about an hour.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen many posts about the scanning and repairing drive getting stuck, but they all seem to provide different answers. Some say to just wait, others say to reboot with a USB or CD. I don't think I have either of those, and I would actually like to
 have my hard drive scanned and repaired if something is wrong with it. But I don't know why it's stuck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for your help. This may be a unique situation, but it sounds like my hard drive has been corrupted. &nbsp;The only thing I did out of the ordinary since this happened was delete temporary internet files and cookies, but I don't see how this
 would have any affect on the hard drive.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description your computer freezes while&nbsp;closing programs. You are also getting&nbsp;chkdsk popup after restarting the computer. The issue could be if there is some system file corruption or some start up items/application is restricting it or
 causing the issue. So, I would suggest you to try the steps provided below and see if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Let’s boot the computer in Safe Mode and check if issue reappears. Safe mode is a diagnostic mode that starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started. The words
<strong><span>Safe Mode</span></strong> appear in the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode you’re using. You may refer to the article mentioned below to boot the computer in safe mode.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">a.</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> When you hit the power button in Windows 8.1 (through Charms Bar), hold down the
<em><strong><span>Shift</span></strong></em> key when clicking the <em><strong><span>Restart</span></strong></em> button.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">b.</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> The next screen will present you with three options. Click

<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">c.</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> Next, hit
<em><strong><span>Advanced</span></strong></em> options followed by <em><strong><span>Windows</span></strong></em>
<em><strong><span>Startup</span></strong></em><strong><em><span>Settings</span></em></strong> from the next screen.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">d.</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> Your PC will now be rebooted to enable the advanced parameters, which include Safe Mode as well. Once it restarts, you’ll get nine options whereby the following commands apply:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>F4 for Safe Mode </span></li><li><span>F5 for Safe Mode with Networking </span></li><li><span>F6 for Safe Mode with Command Prompt </span></li></ul>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3</strong></p>
<p><span><span>The error message which you are getting might be due to some errors in your drive, so I would suggest you to perform CHKDSK and see if it helps.</span></span></p>
<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp; </span>

<strong>Run as administrator</strong>. </span></span></li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Press<strong> </strong><strong>OK</strong></span> the <strong>
UAC </strong>prompt if shown. That will open an elevated command prompt. (It will show Administrator in the caption.)
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Then enter the <strong>chkdsk</strong> command<br />
<strong>chkdsk c: /f</strong> (or other drive letter if applicable) <br />
<br />
Confirm to run on next startup and reboot.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Computer can’t run a disk check while actively using Windows, but you can schedule it to start automatically the next time your computer is turned on.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When the disk check is finished, your computer will automatically reboot. The disk check will fix any problems it encounters in your hard drive.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span>Important: While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost</span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this would help. <span>If issue still persists post </span>back with current status of your computer and result of the proposed suggestion, we will be happy to assist you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Thank you for your response. &nbsp;Unfortunately it seems my computer is in a worse state today than yesterday. &nbsp; I left the computer to scan and repair the drive C overnight last night. It was stuck at 7% the entire time but the wheel was still spinning so I
 assumed it was actually doing something. This morning I saw that the process had finished (I guess), as the light on my power button was blinking. I pressed the power button once to turn the computer on but nothing happened. It showed a black screen and nothing
 else. So I did a hard shutdown and then tried to turn the computer on again. &nbsp;I then had the computer scan and repair the drive again and it also got stuck at 7% for several hours. &nbsp; The same result happened when this was finished. The light on my power button
 with blinking so I pressed the power button to turn the computer on again and saw a black screen so I did a hard shutdown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what happens when I turn on the computer after a hard shutdown. I first see a screen with the ASUS logo and a message at the bottom that says "preparing automatic repair" and then "diagnosing your PC." &nbsp;I then get a blue screen that says " automatic
 repair: your PC did not start correctly." I can then choose to either restart the PC or choose Advanced options. &nbsp;Restarting the PC takes me through the same process. &nbsp;Advanced options gives me a screen which says Continue and Exit to Windows 10 (which I tried
 but am automatically taken to the scan and repair which I can no longer bypass), Troubleshoot, or Turn off the PC. &nbsp;Choosing Troubleshoot gives me the option to either Reset the PC or Advanced Optoons such as System Restore, System Image Recovery, Startup
 Repair, Command Prompt, UEFI Firmware Settings, or Startup Settings. &nbsp;From Startup Settings there was an option to Restart the computer in Safe Mode, but I am automatically taken to the scan and repair drive C, which stops at 7%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;At this point, no matter what I choose, I can no longer seem to logon to windows completely without seeing the scanning and repairing drive message. Yesterday I was given the choice to skip that process and still log on. Today I cannot get past that step;
 it will not let me. &nbsp;Does this mean that my hard drive is now completely destroyed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;At this point, I canoptions options&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I followed your instructions, but after trying to repair the Startup, I get a blue screen that says, "Startup Repair: Startup Repair couldn't repair your PC." I then have the option to select advanced options or shut down the PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also get a line of text which reads: Log file: C:\WINDOWS\System32\Logfiles\Srt\SrtTrail.txt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens even with the USB boot option. &nbsp;Instead of selecting &nbsp;"Repair Your Computer" from the windows setup dialog box, what were to happen if I say "Install Now?" Would that install windows and erase my computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your continued help!</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Not without using a 3rd party application to secure your files.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Like WinNT, Win2K, and WinXP before it, Vista's file security paradigm doesn't rely on, or allow, the crude and cumbersome method of password protection for individual applications, files, or folders. Instead, it uses the superior method of explicitly
 assigning file/folder permissions to individual users and/or groups.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Can I protect files or folders with a password?<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Can-I-protect-files-or-folders-with-a-password" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Can-I-protect-files-or-folders-with-a-password</span></a><br />
<br />
Try FreeHideFolders which both hides the folder and requires a password for access so 1st someone has<br />
to know it exists and its location and&nbsp;name&nbsp;and then they have to know the password.<strong>HINT</strong> - write<br />
down the password and keep in several places including at home.<br />

            <p>It's not about deserving or about being an Insider--the reason I needed your build number was because different Insider builds have had different issues with Miracast, issues which aren't present in the public builds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From your build number it sounds like you're using the public TH2 build, which doesn't have any issues with Miracast as far as I know--unfortunately, that means it's a hardware issue, not a software problem.&nbsp; I myself don't know what hardware is required
 to make Miracast work, I only know that my gaming laptop and Surface tablets have it, and my regular laptops don't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing I do know is that to make your system Miracast-capable, you'll need to get a Miracast-capable transmitter.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I don't know which ones to recommend.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else out there done product research on this?&nbsp; I've got the wireless video
<em>receiver</em> that Microsoft made for the Surface, but I've never really looked into the transmission side.</p>

<p>I've explained it once that your PC doesn't include the hardware necessary for Miracast to work.&nbsp; Now I'll explain it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Your PC lacks the necessary hardware to utilize Miracast.&nbsp; </strong>Therefore it doesn't support that function, period, end of story.&nbsp; Whether your
<em>phone</em> supports it is irrelevant, since we're talking about your PC.</p>

<h3> johnnyb119  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Aero stops working after wake-up from Sleep. </h2>
                    I'm working with Windows 7 Home Premium on an HP Pavilion- 8GB memory, AMD Phenom II X 4 940 Quad Core Processor, and Nvidia Geforce 9800 GT video card. Each time I put the computer to sleep, upon wakeup all off the Aero Functions no longer work. I have
 tried the "Wizard" but it states "No problems can be found." When I restart the computer all Aero functions work again.
<br />

Any help is appreciated!

<p><strong><span><span>If the issue still persists and you are not able to use even the other aero features then you
 will have to check for updated drivers for your computer.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>As Aero feature stops working after it wakes up from sleep I would suggest you to update display card
 drivers.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>A. Update your display adaptor drivers. If you all ready have the latest drivers, uninstall and reinstall
 them, as drivers can quite easily become corrupted.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>B. Here are the steps to uninstall the Display card drivers from Device Manager:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>1. Open Device Manager by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking System and Maintenance,
 and then clicking Device Manager.‌</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>2. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide
 confirmation.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>3. On the Device Manager window, look for the display adaptor drivers and let us know if you see any
 yellow exclamation mark in front of the Device.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>4. Right click on the Device and select Uninstall.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>5. Re-install the latest Display card drivers from the Manufacturer’s website.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>6. Access the link below to know about how to get into Device Manager:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/help/2d8d5582-c5bc-4395-945f-5c6a273c5afa1033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span>http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/help/2d8d5582-c5bc-4395-945f-5c6a273c5afa1033.mspx</span></span></span></a></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 3:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>I would suggest you to check if all other aero features are working on your computer. Refer to the
 below mentioned links to check for the aero features -</span></span></strong></p>

            Hi Vijay. I tried all three suggestions and the problem still persists. The Clean Boot and reinstalling the display drivers had no effect. When I ran the trouble shooting wizard it said it "Couldn't identify the problem."
<br />

Do you have any other suggestions?<br />

            Hello Johnnyb119,<br />
<br />
What drivers did you use to update? <br />
<br />
Try using Windows default, Nvidia or HP's<br />
<br />
This is certainly a issue with the Hardware/Driver performing the sleep function.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.

    <title>Windows 7 update causing network connection problems - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 update causing network connection problems</h2>
                    PROBLEM SOLVED (see below)<br />
<br />
It all started 2 days ago, without any program or voluntary change made on the computer (Windows hidden updates excluded). All of a sudden my laptop would take between 45minutes and 1 hour (!) to fully boot, because it is hanging over the network connections.
 While it is doing that, many programs wouldn't start, including a lot of internal Windows software like Device Manager and so on. Once the computer is finally connected, everything works fine and quick as usual, although some times one between the wireless
 connection and the LAN would not be available. After trying many things, I realized that Windows did two critical updates. Astonishingly, the only cure for my computer is now to restore Windows to a point prior to the updates. Problem solved? No, because if
 I don't prevent Windows from automatically updating the problem comes back full power. Otherwise the machine is working well again without updates (average full booting time is 20s). Does Microsoft plan to solve this bug?<br />
<br />
Little update:<br />
I did not solve the problem, but it represented itself several times. No worries (or yes?), the restore does still prevent it. But the settings that prevent Windows to perform automatic updates are kind of bad, as Windows DOES UPDATE also if I set it as to
 "download automatically but ask me to install". So I had already twice the computer stalling again on network connections, and later (after the hour to resume) found out that although widows update history doesn't show any Windows update installed the same
 day, the system restore has a new restore point dated right after the system restore, so that the next time I would switch on the computer I'll have to wait my good hour for using it. I don't like to criticize Windows, but this kind of pissed me off. Now the
 settings are on "ask me to download and to install", and the update it has been installed anyway (I don't get it, why bothering asking what I want if then it all happens differently?).<br />
I am forced to switch to hibernation instead of switching off the machine, as like this I will save 2 or 3 hours of my working day.<br />
<br />
For the records, the updates that are apparently waiting to be installed on my PC are:<br />
Important<br />
Service Pack 2 for Microsoft Office 2010 (KB2687455) 32-bit Edition<br />
Optional<br />
Intel - Other hardware - Intel(R) Management Engine Interface<br />
Update for Windows 7 for x64-based Systems (KB2574819)<br />
Update for Windows 7 for x64-based Systems (KB2592687)<br />
Update for Windows 7 for x64-based Systems (KB2709981)<br />
<br />
The important one should be the one that gets installed, but in the system restore point list it says "Windows update - Critical Update"
<br />
<br />
Few more technical details<br />
<br />
My laptop:<br />
Samsung NP900X3C<br />
Intel Core i7-3517U CPU@1.90GHz-2.40GHz<br />
RAM 4.00GB, SSD 256GB<br />
Windows 7 Professional SP1 64-bit<br />
<br />
Tried but failed procedures:<br />
- Change the network (home or at work is the same, wireless or cable LAN too)<br />
- Change the IP address for LAN<br />
- Update drivers for network card (Realtek PCIe GBE Family Controller)<br />
- Disable possible disturbing Startup services (there were no new services)<br />
- Boot in Safe mode with networking (also like this there is the very same problem)<br />
- Scan for viruses (Microsoft Essential could not find any threat)<br />
- Scan for malware (Malwarebytes anti-malware software detects 18 threats, but after their removal Windows would not boot at all. On top without removing them my computer is running and happy now without the updates)<br />
<br />
- Restore to a point prior the updates and then allow the Windows critical updates to be installed ("Pasteur" prove of cause-effect)<br />
&nbsp;Look which services are running on Startup to find the one on which Windows is hanging (doesn't work since the computer is stalling and the services list cannot be accessed)<br />
- Clean up the registry (Eusing Free Registry Cleaner detects some errors, but this does not solve the problem)<br />
- Check up in task manager if there is a program taking all the computing power (no programs running, and if I play too much with task manager it would freeze. By the way the CPU usage is at 0-5% and the memory usage is around 600MB)<br />
- Update all the possible drivers available at Samsung website<br />
- Stop the antivirus (Microsoft Essentials does not actually manage to start the Real-Time protection before the networks are on. And without the updates there is absolutely no problem with it)<br />
<br />
PROBLEM SOLVED!<br />
<br />
Here how it did work for me, although I'm not sure all these steps are required (and I don't have time to investigate):<br />
1. Restore the computer to a point just after the problem occurred (I couldn't go earlier)<br />
2. Uninstall Cisco Anywhere Connect<br />
3. Hide the optional updates (KB2574819, KB2592687, KB2709981 and the Intel driver update)<br />
4. Install the Office 2010 SP2 update<br />
5. Reboot the computer (wait the usual 45min-1hour)<br />
6. Install the Microsoft Security Essential last update from MSE (159.663.0) directly from MSE (not from Microsoft Update, again no idea if this does help)<br />
6. Reboot the computer again... done! Reboot in 20 seconds<br />
7. Now reinstall Cisco Anywhere Connect (I need it for work)<br />
8. Check rebooting... 20 seconds!<br />

Unfortunately PA Bear is no longer monitoring this thread, because I would have liked to write him two lines on his/her astonishingly provocative behavior (what for?). However I don't like to make people losing their time, so I will just ignore this.<br />
<br />
Thanks anyone for helping out with this problem, and I hope this helps others too.<br />

<h2>            cannot open files in public folder on PC &#35;2 from PC &#35;1 in home private network Windows 10 Pro after December updates</h2>
                    <p>"Permission needed to access this file" or "this folder", or similar, appears when opening network/users/public/documents/file x from one of these 2 computers on the other and vice versa. The following status exists on each PC:</p>
<ul>
<li>both computers are on same named workgroup; homegroup with same password on each PC; wired directly to the router.</li><li>homegroup is configured to share everything on each computer with the homegroup</li><li>system properties on each computer show the computer is on a business network; when I change to home network and reboot per instructions, the settings automatically change back to business</li><li>Advanced Sharing on each computer shows private network, network discovery on, file &amp; printer sharing on, password-protected sharing turned off</li><li>computer management|system tools|shared folders|shares|Documents\c:\Users\Public\Documents is shown as a default share</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>So how can I share files in public folders on my network the way I used to (worked flawlessly on Windows 7 Pro with same setup)?</p>

            <p>Thanks for your efforts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is my experience with your recommendations:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1 - troubleshooting wizard.&nbsp; Error message:&nbsp; "your user account doesn't have permission to access [folder to be shared on my wife's computer labeled "public" and shared with "everyone" via Network &amp; Sharing/Advanced protocol]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2 - Network and sharing/Advanced, all network, public folder sharing.&nbsp; As in my original query, this was the 1st thing I did; 1 other computer on home network has only read access; my wife's computer has no access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method&nbsp;3 - Computer Management Shares/action/share: there are no options to assign a user from another computer; only users on my own computer (where sharing is not an issue).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should remind you that all computers on the network have joined the home network and show the same password when asked to display it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the process of trying all of the above, I noted some possibly relevant irregularities that are new; that is, they were not present 2 months ago even though sharing problem was the same at that time.&nbsp; I wonder if these may be hindering my current efforts
 to share.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My network consists of a broadband modem that feeds a router whose default network name I will report as A. When that router was 1st installed, I changed the network name to B.&nbsp; My computer was plugged into this router via Ethernet cable; the other computers
 on the network connected to B&nbsp;wirelessly.&nbsp; Network names on all the computers were B. Everything worked normally except sharing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last month, I repurposed the above router, attempting to use it as a wireless&nbsp;point,&nbsp;and bought a new router, whose default network name was C. My computer showed the new network name as C.&nbsp; The two other computers did not change their names; the access
 point was never successful. Therefore I returned the new router and returned the original one to service.&nbsp; original router has returned to its default network name A. I bought a wireless range extender and successfully installed&nbsp;it on network A.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking at the router's browser page, the network name is A, and all computers and printers are shown with their IP addresses, etc; everything works well on this network...except file sharing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer, still wired to the router, still shows the network name as C when looking at the LAN connection on Network and Sharing&nbsp;.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My wife's computer, now wired by Ethernet to the original router, still shows the network name from its original setting of B-5g (it had been on a 5 g wireless connection previously) even though it is now wired to the LAN.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop, now&nbsp;uses the 5g wireless connection and retains the name B-5g; it got this by selecting the wireless connection of that name.&nbsp; However, it cannot share files with my wife's computer either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't see any facility in Windows 10 to change the name of the network on my computer from C back to A; properties of the LAN refers to the computer's Ethernet port, not to the network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, does the network name active on all my computers need to be consistent in order to share files?&nbsp; If so, how do I change the name on my computer?&nbsp; If not, please try again to advise me how to share&nbsp;"public" files on my home network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have&nbsp;a similar problem, not resolved with interventions proposed by Isha Soni from Microsoft on January 5, 2016 and earlier. 3 PC's on my home network run Windows 10 Pro; 1 PC runs Windows 10 Home Premium.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My goal is to be able to share all public documents on each computer on my home network with all other PC's on the network as though they were on the same PC and to copy/paste files and their contents freely from one PC to any other.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>All folder contents on all PC's can be seen on each computer in the network, but no files&nbsp;can be opened other than on the native computer</em></strong><em>.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I have libraries labeled <strong>public</strong> on all my home computers, in which there are "<strong>public documents"
</strong>which are all files identified as "<strong>shared</strong>".&nbsp; These show up in File Explorer windows on each computer as though they belong to a "user" on the other computers named "public" (although I never specified that&nbsp;such should happen).&nbsp;</li><li>Permission level for all such public document folders&nbsp;is <strong>read/write</strong>.
</li><li>Error messages vary slightly, are not numbered errors, but typically are "<strong>your user account doesn't have permission to access.
</strong>However, no dialog boxes exist for entering credentials for the PC I'm trying to access.</li><li>Home Network settings are consistent on all PC's; all PC's are logged into the same home network and show the other PC's as media servers on their respective File Explorer windows.&nbsp;
</li><li>On<strong> Advanced Sharing, Public folder&nbsp;sharing is turned&nbsp;ON for all users on all PC's on the private network (there is no public or guest network in my house). Network discovery is set&nbsp;ON for all PC's; also, Password-Protected Sharing&nbsp;is turned
</strong><strong>OFF.</strong></li><li><strong>System Properties show "business network"; changing to "home network" and saving and rebooting doesn't keep the change (still identifies as business network).</strong></li><li>Everything has been rebooted multiple times after making all changes.</li><li>All computers on network have normal use of internet and of all networked&nbsp;printers.</li></ul>

            Hi BFK68 <br />
<br />
The Windows operating system is not one big application it is made up of thousands of smaller applications, too vast to list . . .
<br />
<br />
wermgr.exe is a legit file it is Windows Error Reporting Manager <br />
<br />
Basically you accept all Windows applications that came pre-installed on your PC, after that, it is your decision what you install or do not install on your PC . . .

                    <p>&lt;Original title - live mail not sending&gt;</p>
<p>Windows Live Mail:<br />
Receiving but not sending emails. Error code:<br />
<br />
An unknown error has occurred.<br />
<br />
Subject 'test'<br />
Server Error: 550<br />
Server Response: 550 if you believe this block is in error.<br />
Server:<br />
Windows Live Mail Error ID: 0x800CCC69<br />
Protocol: SMTP<br />
Port: 1025<br />
Secure(SSL): No<br />
<br />
I have tried resetting the connection, changing the outgoing port, settings, but nothing seems to work. I can send email from my webmail, so it's not a server problem.
<br />
<br />
HELP! </p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are possible causes why your encountered this error code:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1.Incorrect POP settings (usually the SSL option for SMTP) – check with provider if it is required or not</span></p>
<p><span>2.Firewall blocking ports (usually port 25) – could be 3rd party since Windows Firewall generally allows this port through, unless specifically told not to do so.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>As an initial step to rectify this issue, please try to <strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/mail-add-email-account-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">reconfigure your account</a></strong> and see if this will resolve your issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thanks!</span></p>

            Erm windows 7's firewall doesn't add Windows Live Mail.
<div><br />
<div>If it's emails with attachments that are not sending...
<div><br />
<div>Just add 'Windows Live Mail' to the windows firewall allowed software list.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Worked for me.</div>
