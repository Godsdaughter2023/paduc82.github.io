            <p>Hi DR.MOHANDOSS,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your interest in Surface!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Surface with Windows RT you will be able to browse the internet. Please be aware that Flash is limited, for more details check out this
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/jj193557(v=vs.85).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a>.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will be able to connect printer and print PDF files. Take a look at our <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/winrt/CompatCenter/Home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
compatibility center</a> to see what's compatible with Windows RT. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also if you are looking into installing desktop/3rd party applications, please be aware that you will not be able to do this. Surface with Windows RT will only run apps from Windows Store. However you will have this option on Surface with Windows 8 Pro.
 For more info on both devices, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Surface/surface-with-windows-rt/help-me-choose" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
click here</a>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>

<h2>            What version of .Net Framework Can I upgrade to&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am running Win 10/64 Version 1703&nbsp; Build 15063.540 &nbsp;</p>
<p>Programs and Features indicates I am running .Net Framework version 1.1 &nbsp;</p>
<p>From reading in Microsoft, it appears that they are no longer doing auto updates for .Net Framework. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It looks like the current version is 4.7.something.&nbsp; I can't tell if I can go directly to a higher version (4.5 or 4.6 or 4.7) directly, or if I might have to install lesser versions first, or even if I just plain can't upgrade.&nbsp; It is very confusing. Please
 help!&nbsp; Thank you! &nbsp;</p>

<h3> ques tion  say:</h3>
<h2>            Open Word twice&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 10 on a 10" tablet.&nbsp; I want to have two Word (Word 2013) documents open side by side so to drag from one to the other in both ways.&nbsp; That used to be possible by minimizing the first document**&nbsp; and then open Word again by holding SHIFT down
 while clicking on the Word Icon. That does not work.&nbsp; Then I try to use "open side by side" on the task bar.&nbsp; A right click in the task bar brings up a menu but the "open side by side" or Show windows stacked" is not an option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>** Resizing&nbsp; the first document does not work; the document only blinks when I click on the overlapping squares icon .&nbsp; The cursor does not change into a twin-headed arrow used to resize the panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either having Word open twice or showing two documents side by side will work.&nbsp; This is 2 a.m. and I have a deadline, Now I have to use ALT+Tab back and forth, and it is very time consuming.</p>

            <p>I do not know why the Shift-method should not work. You could use this alternative to achieve the same effect:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use Windows Explorer to naviage to the folder <em>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office 14</em>.</li><li>Use the right mouse button to drag the file <em>Winword.exe</em> to the desktop.</li><li>Let go and select "Create Shortcut".</li><li>Rename the shortcut to <em>Word2</em>.</li></ol>
<p>To get the side by side effect, do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Double-click the first .doc file to open it.</li><li>Double-click <em>Word2</em>.</li></ol>

<p>Hi Jacobb!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much for keeping us updated. Since the game that you have is on a disc and you've tried other troubleshooting steps, you may wish to try something a bit different that should help you out. Sometimes there can be an issue when installing a game
 from a disc while the console is online as the game will attempt to update the game at the same time as installing it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>First you'll want to uninstall Star Wars Battlefront 2 from your console again.</p>
<ol>
<li>
Press the <strong>
Xbox</strong> button <span>
</span>to open the guide, then select <strong>
My games &amp; apps</strong> and then <strong>
See all</strong>. </li><li>
Select <strong>
Games</strong>. </li><li>
Highlight the game you want to uninstall, press the <strong>
Menu</strong> button,
 and then select <strong>
Manage game</strong>. </li><li>
Select <strong>
Manage all</strong>, select <strong>
Uninstall all</strong>, and then select <strong>
Uninstall</strong>. </li></ol>
<p>Next you need to place your console into Offline Mode.</p>
<ol>
<li>
Press the <strong>Xbox</strong> button <span>
</span>&nbsp;to open the guide. </li><li>
Select <strong>System</strong> &gt; <strong>Settings</strong>. </li><li>
Choose <strong>Network</strong>. </li><li>
Select <strong>Network settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Go offline</strong>. </li></ol>
<p>Once in Offline Mode, insert the disc into your console and allow it to complete installing. As an extra precaution, prior to doing this, you may wish to sign out of your profile to ensure the console is fully offline. Once the installation completes, put

<p>I have been having same problem since Sunday 11/25/2018. I downloaded the game from xbox store not from disk and after trying the power down method I still cannot play a online game. I have not tried uninstalling the game then reinstalling the game yet in
 hope that this problem can be fixed with a patch or hot patch. My nephew has same problem as I do. We both live in different parts of Ohio in case that matters.</p>

 policy anyway. He even has in his motto that he will disconnect you. He is a pest to the xbox community and needs to be banned. This is unacceptable. Microsoft, you should be doing more to stop this nonsense.

<h2>            Xbox Live Gold Subscription 36 Month Limit to Sign Up For Xbox Ultimate Game Pass Promotion</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I'm trying to extend my Xbox LIve Gold subscription to the full 36 months which is at July of 2021 right now and I'm trying to extend it to July 2022. When I put the key in with a 12 month key it says that I cannot because that would put me over the 36
 month limit. I found out through live support that my account ends on July 28th so because of the extra 24 days I'm past the 36 months. Is there any way to amend this to add my 12 month code or still get the Ultimate Game Pass Promotion when adding the code
 later in the month?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Hawkster,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums. Unfortunately, there is no way to redeem the code if it goes over the 36 months. You will have to wait and redeem when the year can be added. As far as the promotion, not sure when it ends. It has been out for over a month
 already it is possible it may be out at the end of the month.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brad</p>

            Hi Quentin, <br />
<br />
We got your concern. We would like to know if you want to change the password or you want to add a password to your existing admin account? Because if you will change a password, you can change password any time. But it's not possible to add another password
 to an existing admin account. If you want, you can create another account and set it as an admin, so you can have two admin account on your device.
<br />
<br />
We'll be waiting for your response. <br />

<h2>            ATI AMD Radeon HD 6370M random in-game freezes caused by atikmpag.sys error</h2>
                    Hello i seriously need your help to find out what is going on with my notebook, i've purchased it on last christmas and i could use it for like 3 months, the HDD had some troubles and had to send it to the asus techsupport that fixed it for me, i had it
 back on last monday, and rite 3-4 days ago found out a trouble while playing LeagueOfLegends (but i discovered that this happens with any kind of game..) . The problem is the current: i sometimes experience some in-game freezes , the monitor stuck for like
 10 seconds (it can become black or just stop the game in the last frame he captured) then after, i've like a "blink" and i'm able to play again, while on windows i see the current error: "The driver has stopped working and has been recovered successfully".
 Now, if that was the only problem, i could may close an eye on it, cause it happens not really that frequently, like 1-2 an hour (if its not a bad time that could occur more than 5 time in 10 mins), but sometimes i also see some video bad effects, like wrong
 textures, black areas of the map, that keep staying till im playing on the same match. I found out that "atikmpag.sys" error cause i had a BSOD (fortunally) but just once time in like a week. Another problem i've experience like twice, is the totally freeze
 of the system (by having video card disfunctions on the whole screen) and than the saving shutdown.<br />
I've tried all...uninstall drivers , updating, getting older drivers, uninstall then cleaning with driver sweeper on safe mode i seriously i dont know what else i can do. The only problem i noticed is like i cannot use the latest AMD driver (the 11.9) because
 after the installation is terminated in the installation registry i catch an APP SDK Runtime - Installation Error.<br />
Well...i said my whole story, hope i dont have to send my notebook back again to the techsupport cause i would like to keep it, hope you guys can give out the best to help me... Thanks.<br />

<h2>            KB2779768 Failing</h2>
                    &nbsp;I have tried everything (inlcuding disable all drivers etc using MSCONFIG ) but new update KB2779768 keeps on failing at 15%
<br />
<br />
Any answers and "FIX" would be&nbsp; greatly appreciated- these failing updates are "so frustrating" and wasting hours of time.<br />
<br />
There must be a way MS can apply updates on locked, corrupted or wrong version files - better than the existing system.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />
<br />
BTW - We only say the bad here - but Windows&nbsp; 8 ROCKS and is best yet - congrats to MS &nbsp; &nbsp;

<p><b><span>Important Note:</span></b><span> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security
 threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software
 is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>

            Hello Abdul R, <br />
<br />
Thank you for your reply. <br />
<br />
I spent over an hour and went through every method and step you outlined "in order" with no success.&nbsp; The KB2779768 update failed every time at 15% whether on shutdown or start up.
<br />
<br />
1. Yes, my other updates have installed and in fact several were installed recently.&nbsp; However I have had other updates fail before and have gone through this too many times to count, so I am familiar with the process.
<br />
<br />
2.BTW - I am also having a very strange experience with the using the Windows Update Troubleshooter as it seems to "wipe out" (delete) my entire UPDATE HISTORY. It did this again yesterday when I followed your steps, so I now have "no update history" when I
 use "view update history" except the failures of this update. All else is now gone. Another bug I suspect lies somewhere.&nbsp; The good news is that when I select&nbsp; "installed updates" they are still there.
<br />
<br />
3. My system is stable - and SFC /scannow and chkdsk, show no integrity problems.&nbsp; I did have to install Windows 8 twice as the first migration from Windows 7 Pro was horrible and unstable. A clean install took days to rebuild but was successful.
<br />
<br />
4. My antivirus is "AVAST free". No firewall at present except Windows 8 FW.<br />
<br />
5. Yes, every single driver checked and double-checked&nbsp; - all update. System is fairly new i7 Gateway with 8 Gig ram. No exotics and no dual boot Linux etc or unusual or elaborate start-up&nbsp; options.<br />
<br />
6. The trouble-shooting steps I took before contacting MS and you were essentially the SAME. As example I went through manual DL and install of KB 2779768&nbsp; at
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35875" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35875</a>.&nbsp; The other three small updates listed there all installed - just not&nbsp; KB2779768 which fails "everytime".<br />
<br />
Any ideas for next step? <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance. PS note it may take up to 24 hours for me to reply. <br />
<br />

            Hi James,<br />
<br />
I had a problem installing this update as well. The reason was that my antivirus software was preventing the installation indicating there was virus in the software. Went to my virus suppliers website which indicated that sometimes it will give a false positive.
 The solution for me was to temporariliy disable the antivirus software and install the mod successfully. Obviously without knowing your ciircumstances you should be confident about turning your antivirus off temporarily.
<br />
<br />
Please also note since installation I do have a small problem (which I have raised a question for) and that is after startup I go to the desktop and desktop.ini is opened in notepad, I can close it with no further issues but it is annoying to have this happen
 everytime I boot up. I think this is a corrupted file due to the several aborted attempts before finding a solution.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />

            Hello Steve and Abdul and MS support crew,<br />
<br />
STILL NO SUCCESS - CONSTANT Failure to apply update KB2779768 at 15%&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Well Steve you made me think about my antivirus app (Avast) and given your experience, I again tried n today to get this KB2779768&nbsp; update applied.
<br />
<br />
In this case I even went so far as to:<br />
<br />
1. Completely UNINSTALL my anti-virus, and reboot to a NO antivirus<br />
2. Again turn off ALL unneeded drivers via CLEAN boot technique using MSCONFIG and reboot<br />
<br />
<b>So now, I am in a rebooted Windows 8 Pro machine with NO antivirus installed and also a CLEAN boot with only MS basic system files running.</b><br />
<br />
I then tried to install the previously downloaded KB2779768 update from my hard drive (previously tried this three times and it always gets the same result of failure as via the normal&nbsp; Windows Update method) and here is what happened !<br />
<br />
AGAIN the exact same problem - It will NOT install and fails exactly at the same point of 15%.<br />
<br />
It is safe to say after wasting several hours in vain that it is NOT driver conflict or the anti-virus.
<br />
<br />
Again the problem in my view is likely some LOCKED files in MS 8. <br />
<br />
Could this be&nbsp; directory or file ownership issue?&nbsp; <br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
OFF TOPIC follows.................................<br />
<br />
BTW - I am also frustrated - with MS 8 new and aggressively locked down system files, (changes are obvious from Windows 7 Pro) and wonder if this is a SECURITY SETTING problem or issue. For instance even though I am an Administrator - every time I move, change,
 or delete a file I am constantly asked for ADMINISTRATOR authority at prompts.&nbsp;&nbsp; This occurs even with NORMAL programs and files that have little or nothing to do with MS 8.
<br />
<br />
FYIW - I turned off UAC (user account control) a while back to "never notify" but this has had no impact.
<br />
When I look at security settings there have been a few instances where I have to take ownership - even to move files in 3rd party programs - ex Itunes that have been installed as by the same Admin - so why is MS 8 locked down making it frustrating to answer
 repeated prompts when you are already an administrator? <br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Summary KB2779768 is frustrating and hours are being wasted trying to get a simple update (one that is listed as important) applied.<br />
<br />
Any help, assistance or ideas to get this update applied is appreciated. <br />
<br />
Can't believe I am the only one or just a few with this problem given that SFC /scannow shows NO integrity issues.<br />
<br />

            Hi all, I don't know if this will help. I'm not sure exactly what it was that solved my issue. But, I will give you a rundown, maybe somebody can explain what happened better than I.
<div><br />
<div>I spend the better part of a day troubleshoot the problem.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I manged to find an&nbsp;article&nbsp;that suggested that I repair windows update. Control Panel&gt;All Items&gt;Troubleshooting... Search Windows Update. I actually tried&nbsp;this&nbsp;a couple of times trying to install the update with restarting before and after the troubleshooter,
 installing the update from WU and from the download... etc. Each time it said that it repaired WU. And each time it "Failed to Configure".</div>
<div><br />
<div>The last time I tried it said it found 2 errors and repaired them both. Unlike the previous attempts where it only found 1.</div>
<div><br />
<div>After the last repair and restart, Action Center notified me that I needed to activate, but, it wouldn't let me use my&nbsp;licence.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Called&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;licencing. The had me run "msdt". gave me a code, which brought up the activation troubleshooter. After running the troubleshooter licencing was all better. &nbsp; But, an unexpected&nbsp;benefit... The troubleshooter apparently fixed the update
 problem. Ran windows update installed with no "failure to configure" Yay!</div>
<div><br />
<div>I know it's not much, but perhaps it's a lead. Linked to&nbsp;licencing? Maybe?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope it Helps.</div>

That is the same error that I got trying to active windows. The error said that the key could only be used for an upgrade, not a fresh installation and the&nbsp;activation&nbsp;failed. If you hit Windows+Pause/Break, it will bring up the system info. Licencing should
 be at the bottom. If it doesn't say "windows is activated", It sounds like the&nbsp;same&nbsp;problem I had. You will have to call&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;activation and get a code to fix it (<span>Windows activation: (888) 571-2048).</span>

<div>Well that's great... &nbsp;I spent about 4 hours with Microsoft live support in a few support interactions over the last month or so resolving an issue with my activation key not working. &nbsp;They ended up giving me a completely new key and it looks like the problem
 is still not completely fixed. &nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Device Driver Issue - Audio stuttering and Video freezing - Windows 10 1709 Insider Build 17063</h2>
                    <p>I have recently upgraded to Insider Build 17063. However, I am facing a queer and frustrating problem of random audio stuttering along with video freezing, which after some time (approx 5 mins) terminates Window and restarts, if not manually restarted. A
 point to note in this regard is that the taskbar icon of Windows Defender Security Centre is always showing with an exclamation mark (within triangles) but the device manager reports everything as OK. Need guidance on how to resolve this issue. Screenshots
 are given as under &nbsp;</p>

            I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Window Defender should be checked in it's Security Center at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Defender &gt; Open Security Center.   
<br />
<br />To troubleshoot Video and Audio:  
<br />
<br />Check for a newer Display and Audio drivers on the PC or adapter Support Downloads webpage.  While there check if there are other newer drivers to Update.  You can take your time until they are all updated.  
<br />
<br />There is a known issue of incorrect drivers being pushed by Windows Update which requires rolling back the driver.  Right click Start to open Device Manager, choose Display device, then Driver tab, then Roll back.  
<br />
<br />If there is no Roll Back or that doesn't help choose Update Driver on device Driver tab, then Browse Computer, then Let Me Pick to see a list of all previously installed Display drivers, work backwards trying each to find one that works.  
<br />
<br />If necessary you can also go to Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update to look for the driver under Installed Updates and Uninstall it from link there.   Then you can hide the driver so it isn't pushed again using the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />If none of those work try to System Restore to a point before the problem began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>.  Make sure System Restore is always enabled for C with plenty of disk space apportioned (5-10%) in its Configuration settings.
<br />
<br />But remember that Insider Builds are unstable by nature so report this in Feedback Hub to help improve the build, and if necessary Go back to a Stable version in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery or by leaving the Insider Program at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Insider.
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Not able to remember password for in-built Administrator account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anurag gajarla  say:</h3>
<h2>            Not able to remember password for in-built Administrator account</h2>
                    <p>I have downloaded the Windows 10 without any issues. But while creating a Microsoft account I accidentally registered using a wrong gmail Id which actually doesn't exist. So I was not able to verify that Microsoft account.</p>
<p>So I had to create another local account which was Guest account and from there I again created another Microsoft account(with actual gmail id) and I was able to remove the old Microsoft account which I created earlier(one which does not verify). After doing
 that I lost the Administrator account and my current local account has only Guest account rights.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I tried to retrieve the administrator account by creating an account with name "Administrator" from the Safe Mode of Windows 10. This account is referred to as in-built Administrator account when saw in Command prompt(using cmd: net user &lt;username&gt;).
 But I accidentally added a password to that account. <strong>I am not able to recollect that password. And also all my remaining accounts which I created earlier are not at all visible.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>So how can I retrieve my "Administrator" password? How can I retrieve my earlier accounts ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me out in resolving this issue.</p>

            <p>Hi Jessen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the quick reply.</p>
<p>But what I trying address in post is that my admin account which&nbsp;I&nbsp;created as Microsoft account has disappeared from Logon window. So try to regain that admin account I restarted the system in "Safe mode with command prompt" and ran following cmd:</p>
<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;net user Administrator / Active: yes</p>
<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;net user Administrator &lt;password&gt;</p>
<p>This has enabled Windows built-in Administrator account which is entirely different from the Admin account which I created as Microsoft account. My previous Microsoft account(which was supposed to be admin) has vanished.</p>
<p>I guess I ran the second command accidentally and have given some &lt;password&gt; which I don't remember. So I am not able to login to the system using this Administrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I again try to login from Safe mode, same &lt;password&gt; is being asked. I can't go through any accounts now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me out. Is there a possibility of using any third-party tool to break through above &lt;password&gt; or reset the same?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As explained in my previous post, I lost the password for the built-in Administrator account. Can the Windows forum help in me in solving the issue? Because I do not have any access to the Admin account or any other users on the system. Please do suggest
 some resolution otherwise I would not be left with any choice other than formatting the system and getting back to Windows 7. I even tried to do system recovery from Windows Troubleshooting Advanced options but I could do that because I do not have password
 for the above mentioned Built-in Administrator account.</p>
<p>

<h3> spiderbird  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using PSTools - How to wake a suspended computer locally&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using a batch file in Windows 7 to put a laptop into suspend locally via PSTools. &nbsp;The .bat file uses the single line of execution code:</p>
<p>psshutdown.exe -d -t 0 -accepteula</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, this works great! &nbsp;The problem is that I can't get the laptop to wake up the next morning via a different batch file (because it's in suspend mode).</p>
<p>I've tried code like 'echo hello' in a said batch file to wake it up in the morning, but no can do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I stuck with having to so a 'Wake on Lan' from another computer, or is there some tool within the PSTools toolset that will allow me to wake up a computer locally at a designated time in the morning (via Task Scheduler).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any replies, and feel free to ask questions if I can help clarify anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Laptop: &nbsp;Lenovo Thinkpad T420s</p>

<p>
</p><p>Suspend as in 'Sleep Mode'. &nbsp;Not hibernate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I'm familiar with remote computer Wake on LAN and magic packet options. &nbsp;What I'm trying to do is wake the computer up *locally*.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fortunately after a bit of searching, I found one I'm trying out. &nbsp;It's free for personal use, and seems to fit the bill quite nicely (i.e. wake/sleep at a particular schedule).</p>

    <title>Windows Media Player Refuses to Sync with any devices - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> charles rachor  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Media Player Refuses to Sync with any devices</h2>
                    <p>I'm running Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit and WMP 12. Everything's up-to-date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have a Verizon Galaxy S3 and Sansa Clip Zip that until recently, have been syncing just fine in WMP; creating playlists, and dragging and dropping them within WMP and syncing my music hasn't been a problem.</p>
<p>Only recently, for no apparent reason whenever I plug either of them into my computer, WMP now gives me the message, "Your device is using an outdated driver that is no longer supported by Windows Media Player." I haven't changed anything on my computer,
 literally it's like it decided to malfunction on it own. I "uninstalled" WMP, then re-enabled it, while restarting my computer in between, and I even re-downloaded the drivers for the S3 and Zip. Still no luck. It won't even sync with the micro-sd card from
 the phone, or a flash drive that's plugged in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried changing the services.msc to automatic and still, no luck, getting the same "outdated driver" message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've resorted to simple drag-and-drop onto my devices, but it's a pain losing out on the simplicity of WMP syncing, especially with the playlists. Also, the devices show up just fine in "My Computer," so I have no clue why WMP refuses to see the devices
 anymore. Any ideas on what to do, short of a re-install of Windows?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I'm running Windows 7 Professional 64-bit and WMP 12.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried deleting all the drivers in Device Manager for items not plugged in. I have also updated as many drivers as I can, but this has not helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did have a moment's reprieve from the problem when messing around plugging in an external hard drive suddenly WMP12 started recognising my USB stick and Android phone (Motorola Moto G), but this was short lived and as soon as I safely removed them and
 reinserted them the issue was back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been amazed that so few other complain of this issue online. I wonder if plugging in a friend's damaged USB stick caused the issue. In old forums some have said removing their phone or other devices sorts the problem but it hasn't with me as yet.</p>

New batteries (actually, an official Microsoft rechargeable pak), so that is not the issue.</p><p><br /></p><p>2. With batteries out, and XBox power supply unplugged from the back of the XBox,&nbsp;I did the press and hold power ordeal on both. Also did individual one-offs by console only and controller only as well.</p><p><br /></p><p>3. I have synched the controller to the console using a USB cord. (Even an official Microsoft one from my rechargeable battery pak.) Checked for updates for the controller.</p><p><br /></p><p>4. The other way to sync the controller, which involves the button on the console and the button on top of the controller, has been done.</p><p><br /></p><p>So that said, one of those methods, and I can't remember which one at the moment, worked and it lasted like two days tops.</p><p><br /></p><p>There is no new interference the console&nbsp;isn't alre

 </blockquote> <p>The issue has proven to be very simple: The official Microsoft</p><p>recharge&nbsp;pack was not 100 percent in the controller and not making a good connection, despite me putting in normally.<br /></p><p><br /></p><p>I had to use decent force to put it into the controller and not an issue since. And I found this out because the controller would not charge, but now does perfectly.</p>

                    <p>I've been getting the 0x87e00005 error code for a while now on almost every download. &nbsp;Some game downloads and updates work but others always get stuck&nbsp;at the exact same spot for each game. For example, if I download GTAIV for Xbox360 on the Xbox One, it ALWAYS gets stuck at 2.09GB (28%). Last time I let it go for 24 hours and it never went beyond that. Other games will get stuck at other points, but always the same point per game. It doesn't matter if it's an Xbox One game or a 360 game. They all do it. &nbsp;Besides all the standard **** that Xbox support had me do over the phone, I've done the following:</p><p><br /></p><p>-Reset the console (but keep game data)</p><p>-Clear local save games</p><p>-Change DNS to Google, then OpenDNS (neither made much difference but the first change appeared to finally allow me to get the Lego Worlds update, but everything after that failed)</p><p>-Change to Google DNS on my router too</p><p>-Tried 2 different wireless networks and a wired

            You can do following
<br />
<br />1. Windows Key+X
<br />Settings &gt; System &gt; Display 
<br />Choose appropriate percentage in Scale &amp; Lapout - Change the size of text, apps and other items
<br />You can also click on Custom Scaling to define your own level of percentage
<br />
<br />2. Another level of control and additional options are being offers by a free utility named WinAero which you can download from

            Hi Ronald.    I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Go to Settings &gt; System &gt; Display and change the scaling to 125% to see how that looks.  If it's not enough there are other presets and you can even set Custom sizing.  You can also test other Screen resolutions to trade some sharpness for size.  
<br />
<br />Another method is in web pages to click on the page and then zoom with your mouse wheel or + or - keys to resize the text and reframe the page.  This also works on the desktop and in many Windows.  
<br />
<br />Unfortunately they removed Text controls from Windows 10 so if you miss those If you want to express your opinion on this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback. They will not even see it here. This is a tech forums staffed mostly by volunteers trying to help others with your problems. 
<br />
<br />You can post back here the Feedback Share link and I'll vote it up with my MVP badge FWIW.  Others may also want to add to it. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Ronald, Microsoft removed the option to adjust the font sizes in the Creators Update 
<br />
<br />If you basically want to zoom in everything:
<br />Right click your Desktop, choose Display Settings
<br />Change the Scale Factor
<br />
<br />If like most of us you just want to change font sizes on icons, menus . . . etc.
<br />
<br />Most Users are using a great small free utility called Winaero Tweaker, which will let you adjust font sizes anywhere in Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />To adjust the font and font size in File Explorer: 
<br />Open Winaero Tweaker 
<br />On the left click Icons in the Advanced Appearance Settings Section 
<br />Then click 'Change Font' 
<br />Set your Font Size . . . etc. 
<br />Click Apply Changes 
<br />
<br />Then either log out or restart your PC for the change(s) to take effect 
<br />
<br />Click the link below to get WInaero Tweaker:
