<h2>            Unable to access Control Panel</h2>
                    <p>original title: So i guess I need a level 2 tech to fix my problems....</p>
<p>So I have been locked out of most of my control panel windows somehow. I have recently updated windows with windows update, recently deleted a copy of Norton that came with the PC and installed AVG Free in its place. I figure that the problem is with my
 Registry, So i call Compaq/HP to fix my problems, my computer is no longer under warranty though. I explained my difficulty to "Zeba" ( from India I guess) and she said for $60 a level 2 tech will have to fix my Registry.... Hmmmm.... the plot thickens. So,
 I am currently reinstalling Direct X and Running, Cyber Defenders Registry Cleaner to see if that will fix my problems. So, If you know or have a clue as to Fix this ConTrol PaNeL Lock out... Let me know....</p>

Do NOT use Registry Cleaners.<br />
<br />
They do more harm to your System than good.<br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
Norton is very hard to completely remove.<br />
If not completely removed, it may cause problems with other applications, etc..<br />
<br />
<a href="http://service1.symantec.com/SUPPORT/tsgeninfo.nsf/docid/2005033108162039" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://service1.symantec.com/SUPPORT/tsgeninfo.nsf/docid/2005033108162039</a><br />
<br />
Download and run the&nbsp;Norton Removal Tool from the above link to remove any Norton remnants.<br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
<br />
<p><span>Besides using an anti-virus, also scan for Malware/spyware:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>Malwarebytes is as the name says, a Malware Remover!</span></p>
<p><span>Download the Free Version from the link above.</span></p>
<p><span>Download, install, update and scan once a fortnight..
</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to use Malwarebytes after it is installed and Updated:</span></span><span><br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;Open Malwarebytes &gt; Click on the Update Tab&nbsp; across the top&gt; get the latest updates.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;On the <strong><span>Scanner</span></strong> tab, make sure the the
<strong><span>Perform&nbsp;quick scan</span></strong> option is selected and then click on the
<strong><span>Scan</span></strong> button to start scanning your computer
<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;MBAM will now start scanning your computer for malware. This process can take quite a while.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp;When the scan is finished a message box will appear<br />
<br />
5.&nbsp;You should click on the OK button to close the message box and continue with the Malware<strong><span>
</span></strong>removal process.<br />
<br />
6.&nbsp;You will now be back at the main Scanner screen. At this point you should click on the
<strong><span>Show Results</span></strong> button.<br />
<br />
7.&nbsp;A screen displaying all the malware that the program found will be shown<br />
<br />
8.&nbsp;You should now click on the <strong><span>Remove Selected</span></strong> button to remove all the listed malware. MBAM will now delete all of the files and registry keys and add them to the programs quarantine. When removing
 the files, MBAM may require a reboot in order to remove some of them. If it displays a message stating that it needs to reboot, please allow it to do so. Once your computer has rebooted, and you are logged in, please continue with the rest of the steps.<br />
<br />
9.&nbsp;When MBAM has finished removing the malware, it will open the scan log and display it in Notepad. Review the log as desired, and then close the Notepad window.<br />
<br />
10.&nbsp;You can now exit the MBAM program.<br />
<br />

<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Run the Vista System File Checker Tool:</span></span><span><br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
1. Open a Command Window in Administrator mode:</span></p>
<p><span>* click
<strong><span>Start</span></strong><br />
* click <strong><span>All Programs</span></strong>, then
<strong><span>Accessories</span></strong><br />
* right click on the <strong><span>Command Prompt </span>
</strong>option,<br />
* on the drop down menu which appears, click on the <strong><span>Run as Administrator
</span></strong>option.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>* If you haven’t disabled User Account Control (and you shouldn’t!) you will be asked for authorisation. Click the Continue button if you are the administrator or insert
 the administrator password.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Start the System File Checker</span></p>
<p><span>* In the Command Prompt window, type:
<strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong>,<br />
* press Enter.<br />
* You’ll see “the system scan will begin”.</span></p>
<p><span>The scan may take some time and windows will repair/replace any corrupt or missing files. You will be asked to insert your Vista DVD if it’s needed.</span></p>
<p><span>Close the Command Prompt Window when the job is finished.</span></p>
<p><span>One caveat: you need a Windows DVD to enable SFC to make more than minor repairs.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
<br />
If SFC finds serious errors it can not fix, you may have to do a Vista&nbsp;Repair Upgrade Install.<br />
<br />
If&nbsp;you do not have a Microsoft Vista DVD, borrow one from a friend.<br />

    <title>Fn keys are backwards - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sam conway  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fn keys are backwards</h2>
                    <p>Hello, recently I've upgraded to Windows 10 and I had noticed my keyboard had been altered. At first I had thought it to be that the keys were all jumbled but I recently discovered that the keys are messed up because it's acting as if the Fn key is being
 held down. For example I have keys that don't do anything as when you use Fn they would be used as a quick number key, these Keys are 7,8,9,U,I,O,P,J,K,L,M. Other keys are also functioning as if the Fn key is held down also but if I wanted them to be normal
 then I would have to hold down the Fn key to type those certain keys and that's annoying. I've tried device manager countless times and nothing has worked.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I solved the fn key problem by desactivating Synoptics pointing (go to "show hidden icons" on the bottom right) then we are able to uninstall Synoptics pointing device in "install/uninstall programs".</p>
<p>Restart computer and the keyboard will work again as before Win 10.</p>
<p>I hope this will help you.</p>

            <span>Hi <strong>Gaarashatan</strong>,</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Based on the issue description I understand that you receive Blue Screen of Death while gaming on windows 7 computer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Help me with little information.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>-What is the exact/complete error message?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>We are here to help you and guide you in the right direction.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to refer the help article and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Mostly likely cause of this issue is defective or mismatched RAM (Random Access Memory). See if the problem exists with combinations as you swap it in and out.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: </span></strong><span>Run Memory Diagnostics test to check for any memory problems. Refer the below mentioned link for the same.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: </span></strong><span>Update the chipset, video card, display and network adapter drivers to the latest by visiting the computer manufacturer’s website.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly</a></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Reinstalling <span>Windows 7</span> will delete any programs you've installed and will restore the default
<span>Windows</span> settings. You'll need to restore your user files, and reinstall any programs you've installed using the original installation discs or files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope it helps.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows Update Continuously Searching For Updates</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm hoping I can get some assistance from the Microsoft Community -- because my attempts to fix this have failed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am on an HP desktop computer running Windows 7 SP1. I have not been able to update my computer since July of 2015. I understand that it should take a little bit to search for updates, being that it has been so long, but I have let it run for 24 hours before
 with no luck.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried several things: making sure that I have Internet Explorer installed, changing Background Intellegence Services to on and automatic, searching the internet for different solutions, like seeing if it was my home network (which it wasn't, because
 my HP laptop with Windows 7 SP 1 searched and installed updates just fine, even WITH the KBs downloaded that added the Windows 10 upgrade icons).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've ran the Windows Update Agent FixIt, and had some time trying to fix one error -- finally fixed the error and it's still not doing anything for hours. (So in all, the FixIt Agent comes back with no errors now.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help save me some valuable time and sanity by guiding me in the right direction of how I might fix this. I'm highly technologically inclined, and can probably understand any instructions or steps I am given, I just don't know what to do anymore.</p>

            <p>Rather than opening yet another topic on this same issue, I'll take my chances here and 'hopefully' someone from Microsoft can reply with the right answer/fix. &nbsp;The issue of Windows 7 continuous searching for updates is very much alive and well at this date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I own a small computer support business and within the past couple of weeks, I've had three windows 7 PCs (all 64 bit), home and/or pro that&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;1. &nbsp;2 failed updates since the magical date of 05/26/2016</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;2. &nbsp;Each continuously search and search but never finish finding updates to download and install</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(YES -- I've done all you can imagine to tweak, fix, repair, manually update, safe mode, and all recommendations from sevenforums, tech sites galore, Microsoft site, and etc.) !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;3. &nbsp;I let one computer search for 48 hours (knowing well it would NOT get the updates)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;4. &nbsp;I rebuilt one from factory install -- it installed, but failed after that point to get updates</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;5. &nbsp;I re-imaged one completely from scratch with 7 and SP 1, got Microsoft Security Essentials installed (after 4 hours), and then attempted the first "Windows Updates" on it only to run for 30+ hours and never downloaded anything</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;6. &nbsp;On one computer I could never get past the errors thrown back at it for KB3172985 &amp; KB3173428. &nbsp;And it continued to search forever with no success. &nbsp;So, on this one computer I finally just installed Windows 10 (of course not a free license anymore)
 and guess what? &nbsp;YEAH -- it installed and working just fine --- conspiracy? &nbsp;------ whatever. &nbsp;The customer needed his system back! &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I simply cannot afford to spend the amount of time working on what should be a very simple process to clean-up someone's PC to have to run into this issue. &nbsp;There is a common issue here with Windows 7 and Microsoft MUST FIX IT. &nbsp;These customers do not want
 Windows 10 - period. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is all so coincidental; different computers from different users all having this Windows 7 update issue. &nbsp;Simply unacceptable by Microsoft. &nbsp;Yes, Microsoft. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm at a loss other than to offer customers Windows 10 rebuild or look at Apple. &nbsp;And, I just got a 4th laptop having the same issue. &nbsp;Ridiculous.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have a "real" solution to all this?</p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows 10 login problem after restarting using diagnostic startup</h2>
                    I restarted my Windows 10 computer using Diagnostic Startup which does not load networking. I login using my Microsoft account and a four number code.&nbsp; After the restart entered my code but I get the message that the user name or password is incorrect.&nbsp;
 I assume this happens because there is no internet connection.&nbsp; Is there another way to login?

                    Using Skype for Windows 10, I am unable to share my screen with others on a call. Clicking the + sign doesn't give me the option to share my screen as it seems to do with others. Any suggestions? Thanks.

                    <p>Hey folks. My HP Spectre x360 running Window 10 keep showing "Windows Installer Error" trying to install HP Photosmart Essential. I had un-installed all printers and re-installed afresh but no respite. The system can find the program even after installing
 the Photosmart Essential. Please help as the pop up on the screen is annoyingly disturbing.</p>

<br />Select your printer.
<br />Select Uninstall.
<br />
<br />Windows key+R, type control, hit Enter
<br />Open Devices and Printers.
<br />In the Devices and Printers window look for your Printer. If you see it listed, right-click on it and choose Delete or Remove Device
<br />
<br />Windows Key+R, type Cmd, hit Enter
<br />Type printui.exe /s &gt; OK.
<br />Click on Drivers tab.
<br />Look for Printer driver. If you see it click on it and click Remove at the bottom.
<br />Select OK.
<br />Select Apply and OK on the Print Server Properties windows.
<br />Close Devices and Printers.
<br />
<br />B. Install the Driver
<br />Go to the Printer manufacturer’s website and search for the latest Windows 10 drivers
<br />Reinstall the Printer driver
<br />Reboot the computer 
<br />
<br />Connect the printer.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: control printers
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click Add printer
<br />
<br />Click 'The printer what I want isn't listed'
<br />
<br />Select 'Add a local printer or network printer with manual settings'
<br />Select 'Use an existing port'
<br />Click Next
<br />
<br />Under Manufacturer, scroll down then select the printer brand
<br />Over the right hand side, scroll down through the list and look for your printer model.
<br />
<br />If you don't see it, click Windows Update and wait while Windows Update checks for the printer.
<br />
<br />If it doesn't find it, click the back button, then click Next again.
<br />
<br />This time, select printer brand and in the printer list, select a driver series that closely matches your printer model

<p><span><span>If the webpage is not configured to have any icon, the icon would appear with a globe.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For example, try creating the shortcut for the Microsoft webpage. Follow the below link:</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en/us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/en/us/default.aspx</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>The shortcut would appear with an M icon.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>So if the webpage is not configured with an icon, it would not appear.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If this still does not fix the fevicon issue, I suggest that you follow the below steps to fix this issue.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Reset Internet Explorer settings:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Exit
 all programs, including Internet Explorer (if it is running).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>If
 you use Windows Vista, click Start, type the following command in the Start Search box,<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and then press ENTER:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>inetcpl.cpl</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>The
 Internet Options dialog box appears.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>d.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Click
 the Advanced tab.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>e.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Under
 Reset Internet Explorer settings, click Reset. Then click Reset again.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>f.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>When
 Internet Explorer finishes resetting the settings, click Close in the Reset Internet<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>g.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Explorer
 Settings dialog box.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>h.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Start
 Internet Explorer again.<br />

<p><span><span>Note: Resetting the Internet Explorer setting would delete all the browsing history, saved passwords and forms on your computer.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>You can follow the below steps to set permissions for the user account:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. Right-click the file or folder, and then click Properties.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. Click the Security tab, and then click Edit.</span></span></p>

    <title>mouse pointer is moving on its own. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cottontail&#40;2&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            mouse pointer is moving on its own.</h2>
                    I have a HP TouchSmart All In One computer with 1 TB HD, 6GB of RAM, windows 8 pro with media player.&nbsp; I was using a wireless mouse from HP when&nbsp; the mouse pointer started moving to random places on the screen and randomly clicking on programs. I replaced
 the wireless mouse with a GE USB mouse but the problem has not gone away.<br />
Any help would be appreciated.<br />

            <p>I tried that and that's why I had to go into the registry editor to change the value of the one thing. (please forgive my informality, I am very lazy). Anyway, I didn't have to fix the problem because I remembered I can just view the files from the source
 codes&nbsp;while I'm on the page and see all of the items I use from there. Thank you for the guide though, I've done my fair share of using other people's pages to ask my questions so it's up there if anyone else has the same problem. Thank you again.</p>

<h2>            USB Installation Media on 1st PC via Mac--desperate</h2>
                    <div style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
<p>
Okay, so first things first:</p>
<p>
I have assembled my computer and am having trouble booting my OS of choice (Windows 10), apparently due to a “missing media driver.”</p>
<p>
I only have a MacBook (2010, El Capitan OS X) to format installation media onto a USB to introduce to the build.</p>
<p>
My build is as follows:</p>
<p>
CPU - AMD - Ryzen 5 1500X 3.5 GHz Quad-Core Processor MSI - B350 PC MATE ATX AM$ Motherboard Memory - G. Skill - Ripsaws V Series 16 GB (2 x 8 GB) DDR4-3200 Memory Storage - Kingston - A400 240 GB 2.5” Solid State Drive “ “ - Hitachi - Deskstar 7K2000 2 TB
 3.5” 7200RPM Internal Hard Drive Case - Corsair 200R ATX Mid Tower Case Power Supply - Thermaltake - 750 W 80+ Gold Certified Semi-Modular ATX Power Supply GPU - EVGA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti SC Gaming, 4GB GDDR5, DX12 OSD Support (PXOC) Graphics Card 04G-P4-6253-KR</p>
<p>
After extensive combing through message boards and troubleshooting threads, this is what I’ve already tried this far, both on my motherboard’s default BIOS settings and innumerous combinations of different settings. All methods below were achieved both in default
 BIOS settings and with tinkered BIOS settings:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Downloading the Windows 10 .iso straight onto a USB formatted individually for FAT and ExFAT using Apple’s Disk Utility, introducing said USB directly into the motherboard’s 2.0 USB ports. With this method I was not able to get past the boot device selection
 menu. This method has been employed on three separate USB drives—all SanDisk Cruzer sticks, one 16GB, another two 32GB.</p>
</li><li>
<p>
Formatting the USB (this time only using the two 32 GB sticks) with the downloaded application “NTFS For Mac” and then moving the .iso onto the USB in question, introducing the USB into the 2.0 USB ports on the motherboard. Using this method, I was able to
 enter the Windows 10 installation screen, but the resolution was less than normal (that is, the visual elements (like the mouse-arrow) were all larger than normal) and I was not able to get past the “missing media drivers” result, even after employing the
 typical solution of switching the USB port being used and re-clicking “Install Now.”</p>
</li><li>
<p>
Formatting the .iso and USB simultaneously using the downloaded application balenaEtcher. With this method, the individual files contained in the .iso (eg: boot) were visible when exploring the device in Finder. When inserted into the USB 2.0 ports, I again
 got to the Windows 10 Installation prompt, this time with a higher resolution. Again, I did not make it past the “missing media drivers” message, even after switching the port I used, rebooting the computer, pulling out my hair, etc.</p>
</li><li>
<p>
Formatted the USB and introduced the .iso using Apple’s Terminal (most recent attempt parroted this one:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nhgjqbq_zYA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nhgjqbq_zYA</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/Nhgjqbq_zYA?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/Nhgjqbq_zYA?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div>).
 Using this method I achieved the same results as I did with balenaEtcher: individual files seen when exploring in Finder, Windows 10 installation screen achieved, but no progress past the “missing media drivers” message regardless of port-switching, reboots,
 or bargaining.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>
What I have left to try:</p>
<p>
a) Formatting a USB directly from a computer that runs Windows 7 or later using Microsoft’s official installation tool.</p>
<p>
b) Piecing through online databases and finding the specific drivers needed to get my f***ing build to behave, then seeing whether I can use two USBs in tandem or if I need to put both drivers and .iso files onto the same drive.</p>
<p>
c) Purchasing a Windows 10 USB pre-loaded with both a license and installation media (dubious about this one, since the success rate is mixed and it’s an extra $30 above what a key costs normally)</p>
<p>
I’d appreciate any wisdom anyone else has in this regard. This is my first build and I’ve been struggling with this last step for the past week.</p>
<p>
Thank you for reading!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another person just had this same problem... He was trying to use Bootcamp on a MAC...</p>
<p>He ended up creating a Virtual machine on the mac to install windows 10, and created the boot media from there...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I personally would recommend a variation of your Option (a) if you are able to access a Win 7 machine... or any other windows machine Win 7 or higher...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Download a ISO instead of creating a flash drive, or use the one you already have... then burn the ISO to the flash drive using a free tool called RUFUS...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since this is a new machine, I am guessing the motherboard is set up for UEFI Bios by default...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since UEFI Bios was introduced, there are two options for creating installation media...
</p>
<p>For the most part, it needs to be created specifically for the type of Bios you intend to use... UEFI or Legacy...</p>
<p>
</p><p>RUFUS will create either... It just requires different settings...</p>
<p>
</p><p>UEFI needs to be GPT... UEFI... FAT32..</p>
<p>Legacy needs to be MBR... Bios (or UEFI CSM)... NTFS...</p>

            Hello Larry, I’m Virginia an independent advisor here.
<br />Unfortunately you cannot transfer an .iso directly to a USB &amp; have it boot, .iso files are intended to be used to create a bootable DVD by using disc burning software.
<br />You should use boot camp assistant to create the USB:

    <title>WMIDiag Diagnostic Results -- Beyond My Expertise - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> heyo_speaker  say:</h3>
<h2>            WMIDiag Diagnostic Results -- Beyond My Expertise</h2>
                    I'll admit it up front:&nbsp; I am not an expert on Windows.&nbsp; I have been using it for most of my life and have picked up a lot of problem solving techniques, but I am not fully educated as a programmer and do not have an in-depth understanding of a lot of
 the behind-the-scenes stuff that makes up Windows.&nbsp; I recently started a personal computer assistance business and have been able to help people for the most part, relying heavily on the Internet for information, but one client's issues have me stumped.&nbsp; He
 has Windows Vista Business Edition, 32-bit, and was having some problems that led me to investigate a hunch that some remnant of AVG Antivirus was leftover on his computer, interfering with the downloading of certain emails into Windows Mail and certain things
 on web pages.&nbsp; Windows Mail hangs when downloading at least one specific email from his mail server, and certain things on web pages take a very long time to load, if they load at all.<br />
<br />
My under-educated research process may have led me astray, or led me to discover some unrelated issues...&nbsp; or maybe I'm on the right track.&nbsp; I'll explain what I know so far.<br />
<br />
I ran the AVG Remover tool from AVG, and something in the log caught my eye:<br />

<br />
A Google search for "Failed to delete key 'avgoutlook.Addin'" led me to this forum thread:&nbsp;&nbsp; http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/topic440881.html<br />
<br />
narenxp (from the forum thread) says to "Use Revo uninstaller and windows installer clean up utitity", but I didn't try this because it did not seem to work for the original poster.
<br />
<br />
narenxp also said to try this:<br />
<br />
Press windows+R key and type cmd and click ok,copy the following command and run it<br />
net stop winmgmt<br />
cd /d %windir%\system32\wbem<br />
ren repository repository.old<br />
net start winmgmt<br />
<br />
I did some searching to figure out what he was doing, and it seems he is describing one way to re-create the "Repository" folder in the "wbem" directory.&nbsp; However, some further research led me to hesitate with implementing this potential solution, as I saw
 some people complain about having issues after doing so.<br />
<br />
narenxp later said to try this, which might just be another way of doing the same thing, since the original poster ran into problems with the first procedure:<br />
<br />
Press Windows+R key and type cmd and click ok and run these commands<br />
net stop winmgmt<br />
Press Y and enter<br />
Now go to<br />
C:\Windows\System32\wbem<br />
Delete the repository folder and run this command again<br />
net start winmgmt<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">NOTE:</span>&nbsp; I have no idea what the connection is between the "Repository" folder and AVG, or why narenxp recommended these procedures.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Or why the second procedure actually helped the original poster.&nbsp; Or if this would
 even solve anything on my client's computer.<br />
<br />
<br />
I then read about a possible way to fix the repository, by typing "winmgmt /salvagerepository" in the Command Prompt, but no inconsistencies were found in the Repository.&nbsp; I tried downloading email again and Windows Mail got hung up on the same message as before.<br />
<br />
I eventually found and downloaded a tool from Microsoft called "WMIDiag", and here are the parts of the WMIDiag log that caught my eye:<br />

--&nbsp; I don't know if these WMI issues have anything to do with AVG or my client's problems<br />
--&nbsp; I don't really know if remnants of AVG have anything to do with my client's problems<br />
--&nbsp; AVG Remover seems to have problems with parts of the removal (see log excerpt above)<br />
--&nbsp; WMIDiag seems to find problems (see log excerpts above)<br />
--&nbsp; I don't understand WMIDiag's recommendations for what I should do.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">What I still need to try:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; Connect his hard drive to my computer and scan it with Norton.&nbsp; (I have a feeling I might run into problems doing the online Norton scan through his computer, but I could try that instead.)<br />
<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">What I can do as a last resort:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; Re-install Windows and all of his programs from scratch.<br />
<br />
<br />
I just wanted to get this out in front of some people who might actually understand what this stuff means.&nbsp; I simply don't know enough to be able to understand what WMIDiag is saying I should do.&nbsp; I would appreciate it if anyone could enlighten me on this...
 or provide any information or advice whatsoever regarding any of the above-mentioned issues!&nbsp; Am I on the right track?&nbsp; Is there a completely different approach to the problem that I should be trying?&nbsp; What else could be interfering with the download of certain
 specific things?&nbsp; What could be interfering with the download of email into Windows Mail and/or slowing/blocking the download of certain web page objects?<br />
<br />
Thank you for taking the time to read all this, and thanks to anyone who can help.<br />

            Thank you so much for all of the information!!!&nbsp; I will try your suggestions as soon as I can get back to my client's computer.<br />
<br />
To answer your question, I am not accessing Windows Mail through a browser -- Windows Mail is a program on his computer that came with Vista.&nbsp; See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Mail<br />
(from Wikipedia article:&nbsp; "Windows Mail is not a component of Internet Explorer, unlike Outlook Express, which was bundled with Internet Explorer versions 4 to 6.")<br />
<br />
I really appreciate the time you have taken to look at my issue and provide suggestions.&nbsp; I will let you know if I have any success.<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            I looked at my client's computer again last night.&nbsp; At the end of my first visit I had installed Adobe Flash Player because it was required for chatting with the Microsoft Answer Desk (I didn't know you had to pay them to actually receive help), and then
 last night I learned that YouTube now works on his computer.&nbsp; There were other web pages that he was having problems with, which I didn't think had Flash content on them, but maybe they did.&nbsp; So the other web page problems he was having
<br />
But (obviously) the email-downloading problem remained after installing Adobe Flash.<br />
<br />
I first tried the Revo Uninstaller, but since AVG has already been uninstalled, it would not come up in Revo's list of installed programs.<br />
<br />
I then ran the Microsoft FixIt "Program Install and Uninstall Troubleshooter".&nbsp; AVG was not listed, so I couldn't complete the troubleshooter.&nbsp; There was one listing for "Name Not Available".&nbsp; I don't know what that is and didn't uninstall it.&nbsp; I had the option
 to manually enter the 38-character product code of the program I wanted to uninstall, but I didn't know AVG's product code and couldn't find it online (but I do see some 38-character codes that came up in the AVG Remover log.... ?&nbsp; See my original post.).<br />
<br />
I deleted all files in the "Temp" folder (except one that is apparently associated with the printer and could not be deleted).&nbsp; Windows Mail still had problems downloading messages.<br />
<br />
I deleted all files in "Prefetch" folder.&nbsp; Windows Mail still had problems downloading messages.<br />
<br />
I ran a utility called the "System File Checker" to scan for missing or corrupted system files.&nbsp; It returned the message "Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations."<br />
<br />
I created a System Restore point and also a backup copy of the registry (exported it to the Desktop).<br />
I didn't see any "HKLM" or "HKCM" directories in the registry -- are they subdirectories of one of the main directories?<br />
I searched the registry for "avg", "AVG", and "Avg" (in case the search is case sensitive), but I couldn't find any entries.&nbsp; (I selected "Match whole string only.")<br />
<br />
At some point I also tried disabling Windows Firewall, and still had the email-downloading issue.&nbsp; And on my first visit I had tried disabling Microsoft Security Essentials (his only installed security software) and still had the issue.<br />
<br />
So I haven't made any progress against the problem.&nbsp; Something invisible is still interfering with the download of emails and my only hunch is that it could be some part of AVG.&nbsp; But maybe some Windows or Windows Mail component has somehow become corrupted.&nbsp;
 I don't know how that would have happened, though.&nbsp; The only thing I can think of to do at this point would be to reinstall Windows and everything else from scratch.&nbsp; Or (I didn't think of this), perhaps I could do a repair installation of Windows?&nbsp; I can't
 remember how that works.&nbsp; I was just kind of stuck on the idea that it was some remnant of AVG that wasn't removed, but maybe it's not.&nbsp; But as I said, AVG Remover reports problems removing certain components.&nbsp; But WMIDiag also reports problems.&nbsp; (See my original
 post.)<br />
<br />
On my first visit, the email download would hang before it could finish downloading messages, but then my client accessed the email on the server through a website and deleted the first page of messages in the Inbox, and then Windows Mail was able to download
 the rest.&nbsp; To test it, I went back to his Inbox on the server and undeleted those messages, and then Windows Mail would hang when downloading message #2.&nbsp; When I tried downloading them again on last night's visit, it's not showing that it is stuck on message
 #2 (but maybe I have to wait longer for that to happen because he has a lot more messages on the server now), but the Send/Receive progress bar jumps around erratically and takes a very long time to make any progress (and might not actually be making progress
 at all).<br />
<br />
So it's like there is one specific email in his Inbox (maybe more now) that can't be downloaded, which led me to think that some little bit of AVG was in there reacting to that one message improperly.<br />
<br />
I just told the client that he could go back and delete some email from the server again to get the rest to download, but I told him that it might not be a permanent solution.&nbsp; And I think he had told me that he has had this problem in the past, so I think
 the problem will not really be solved by simply deleting the emails that cannot be downloaded.<br />
<br />
<br />
I just realized that maybe I should have checked the Program Files folder for AVG remnants, but still, how could they be running at startup?&nbsp; Actually, I can't remember if I checked the Startup list in msconfig, but I might have.&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope I did.&nbsp; I've been
 kind of busy and tired lately and I perhaps didn't think to check everything I should have.<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe I have to delete those keys reported by AVG Remover?&nbsp; I don't really know what I'm doing and wouldn't want to delete any registry items unless you think it will help and will not cause any problems.&nbsp; Though I did create a system restore point and also
 exported the registry.<br />
<br />
<br />
...My understanding of the in-depth workings of Windows is pretty vague, so I'm just kind of... unable to have much insight on my own as to what I'm doing and what these things mean.&nbsp; I don't know what a product code is, or how the registry works, or what a
 registry key is, or what the WMI repository is.&nbsp; I might just have to do more studying of what these things are (but it's hard when the articles about these things reference other things I'm not familiar with)!<br />
<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any other insights that might help?<br />
<br />
<br />
I did start an online Norton virus scan last night before I left.&nbsp; I called my client today and he said Trojan.Zeroaccess was discovered, but it doesn't look like this virus could be causing his issues (http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2011-071314-0410-99).&nbsp;
 I helped him over the phone with running the removal tool and he was going to let that run while he was away.<br />

<p><span>Hi rhawley64,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting on the Microsoft Answers Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>Have you tried to connect your XBOX to your computer with a wired connection?</span></p>
<p><span>1. First, have your Xbox turned on. Also have your PC on, since this next part is all with the computer. This will probably work with a wired connection as well
 (but you could probably just hook straight up to your router or modem then), but here it is. First go to start and go into your control panel. Switch to classic view by using the link in the top left corner of the window. Find Network Connections and open
 it. </span></p>
<p><span>2. You should see a "Local Area Connection" (unconnected, this is for the connection to the Xbox) and your internet connection (mine is called "Wireless Network
 Connection"). Connect the Ethernet cable to your laptop and to the back of the 360. Enable the "Local Area Connection". After it is completely connected, disable your internet connection. Once is it disable, right click the internet connection and click properties.
 Go to the advanced tab and check off "Allow other network users to connect through this computer's internet connection." Allow this to finish, it may take a little bit. Once it is done, your internet connection should say shared next to the status of the connection.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Enable your internet connection. Once it is fully connected, right click the "Local Area Connection" and click repair. Allow that to finish. On your Xbox,
 find the system panel and navigate through it until you find "Test Connection to Xbox Live". Test the connection. If it works, congratulations, you don't need this next part. For some, at this point, they get a DNS error. There are a number of ways to fix
 this. </span></p>
<p><span>4. You must have a connection to a router. In order to be able to navigate the internet again you need to disable the "Local Area Connection" and then repair
 the Internet Connection (follow steps above to enable everything again once you are done). Go to http://192.168.0.1. You will be asked for a login. On most routers it is:</span></p>
<p><span>Username: admin</span></p>
<p><span>Password: (no password)</span></p>
<p><span>If this does not work, look up the login information for you router model. Once logged in, you must find where your DNS server IPs would be listed. On the top
 bar, click Status. Under WAN you should find DNS IPs. Manually input these into your Xbox (rather than have it find them automatically) and test your connection again. At this point it should be working. Any other errors can be search for online.</span></p>
<p><span>After following the above steps were you able to establish a wireless connection through your computer with your Xbox?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Please post back and let us know if this information was helpful to resolving your issue or not so that we may further assist you if needed.</strong></span></p>
