<br />
Is there an update for Photo Story 3 which can change the aspect ratio of the pictures from 4:3 to 16:9 which is the aspect ratio of my flat screen TV?<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
1. Are you using Microsoft's Photo Story 3?<br />
2. Which operating system is installed on your computer?<br />
<br />
If you use the widescreen profiles, be sure to resize the images you use in the story before you import them. Photo Story can be tricked into making widescreen 16:9 aspect ratio stories by using a custom profile.<br />
<br />
I'd recommend you post the issue in Windows Live Photo Gallery forums for best assistance.<br />

<p>I just played a game of KotH, where there were maybe three friends fighting eachother. I fought and defended my "throne" like three times. Then, after the other guy one-move-Sally'd" me as Jade, I lost. He recieved 10 scores when I only got like 1.0's!!!
 Unfair!!!</p>

<p>It happens. People get upset that they lose and give a low score instead of learning from it and such. Also, friends tend to toss in 10's and such to boost but it doesn't make sense that they don't do it in a private lobby if that's what they want.</p>

<p>i was in a lobby and started to figure out the "king" and other opponents while i waited to play, and when i picked em apart, it started out as 10s, and as i won more, and more their respect scores slowly went down, till it was my friend giving me more points

<p>Why? It's a legit tactic if it's working. If the guy keeps getting punished for it, though, I can understand. I've seen people get hit when I use Hellfire and still stand there blocking. What else am I going to do if they present the opportunity? I spam
 it until they finally move. It's a normal tactic and nothing wrong with it, either. Nothing dishonorable or cheating with it. The game only knows winning and losing. It's still fighting, regardless of the context you desire to use it in.</p>

<p>Now that I can agree with. I'm usually against spamming the same move over and over again, but if you're paired up with somebody who's stupid enough to sit and continuously try to block Hellfire without realizing that it's unblockable after failing to block
 it high and low, then he deserves what he gets. But on the flip side of that, you have these morons who spam teleports until you finally get fed up and leave. THAT is why I have an issue with move spamming in most cases.</p>

<p>Spamming is a legit tactic? maybe if you're bad at everything else. Seriously Scorpion is the easiest character in the game, fact. I wouldn't be surpised if the reason your opponent was blocking in the first place was becuase you were spamming teleport or
 chain projectile. Then switched over to Hellfire when they blocked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I give points depending on the gameplay, but I do understand that friends will give their buddies straight 10's just for the points towards the achievement which can suck if you're the one stopping them from earning points by winning and as a result get
 straight 1's. I tend to stray away from KOTH but when I am I only normally stay when people give actual scores and they aren't kids who are just out to boost.</p>

<p>I'm up to around 8000 points...and that's a mixture of people giving me 10's and a lot of times 0's or 1's. Just depends on who is in the room. Some people are kind, others aren't. The best is when you have an almost full room and you have won a few games.
 Then at least you're bound to get some decent points. If you're playing in a room of 3 or 4, expect it to take a lot longer...Myself, I always give out 10's. Even when I get my *** kicked...after all it's just a game...</p>

<p>I will usually give out 10's no matter what. The only thing that bugs me is when somebody is amazing with one fighter and will never switch. I played with a guy who was amazing with Quan Chi and won every fight by doing crazy combos. Everybody in the lobby
 was giving out 0's and 1's but I just kept giving out 10's. </p>
<p>The problem for me is after the guy wins 15-20 straight matches shouldn't he pick a different fighter? I mean we all knew Quan Chi was his main and we also all knew he was way better then us. So shouldn't he try a different fighter to at least mix it up
 a bit? </p>
<p>I just left eventually but if it was me I would switch it up a bit. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The game doesn't have this odd 'honor' system you might have in your head. It only knows the difference between landing hits and who wins. It's legit, though you may not like it. I certainly don't, but if the opportunity presents itself then I won't hesitate.
 there are more than enough ways to get around spammed moves. I do force them to block and use Hellfire. It's a tactic and I do well with it. Nothing cheap if it's in the game and meant to be used. I've seen tournaments for various fighters where both players
 spam one or two kinds of attacks. Why aren't they banned? Because it's in the game and it's ridiculous to ban them from a single move to use. It's going to happen online all the time. There's no way it won't die out because there will always be people that
 do it. Now, I don't spam attacks after I get punished once for them. I learn, much like they learned how to get around my first tactic. It makes the game fun, having to switch tactics and styles of gameplay when fighting. I completely understand if you don't
 enjoy having that kind of tactic used against you. Nothing wrong with not liking it. The point&nbsp; I'm getting across is that it's legit and playing online will get you to face that kind of player more often unless you play only with friends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I won't lie, I don't do this around friends because I'm not playing to win with them. I just enjoy messing around and trying out different combos. Fun times!</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>To disable start up on Skype</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Open Skype application.</li><li>Select Tools.</li><li>Click on Options.</li><li>Select General settings.</li><li>Uncheck the Start Skype when I start Windows option.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>To log out of Skype preview</strong></p>

    <title>Family Membership Problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thecaniac17  say:</h3>
<h2>            Family Membership Problems</h2>
                    
<p>My dad just recently got the family membership for me, him, and my sister. I have seen some issues though. My xbox dashboard has the same things on it all the time. What I'm trying to say is, that everything on my dashboard looks like family related things.
 It hardly ever changes. I never see anything about Call of Duty or anything that has an above teen rating. I thought we changed the settings to where it wouldn't do that but apparently not. I can't even download videos such as Call of Duty because of its explicit
 content. If someone knows how to properly change the settings to where I can see everything on the dashboard and be able to download mature content such as Call of Duty videos please comment on this post. I greatly appreciate it.</p>
<p>If I am commenting in the wrong section please let me know that as well. This is my first xbox post. Thank you!</p>
<p>* Someone has to know how to do this. The quicker I can fix this the less aggravated I will be. Please help, thank you. *</p>

<p>The only way I know of to get past the explicit content was to download them from the xbox.com site. I was part of the family plan and hated it. It doesn't show any of the deals or what's going on with the community. So I just made a new account. That's
 the only way that truly worked for me.</p>

    <title>Re-installing XP on a Fujitsu-Siemens Amilo Pro V2000 Laptop. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Re-installing XP on a Fujitsu-Siemens Amilo Pro V2000 Laptop.</h2>
                    Hi all out there. This is my first time on here, hopefully not my last. I am hoping someone can answer the question as below, or can point me in the right place on the forums, to find the information I will need to solve the problems there are with the
 machine. <br />
<br />
This is NOT my laptop, I am just looking at it for someone else (never a good idea I know!!), as I thought I knew a reasonable amount about computers. The person who owns the laptop is on benefits and has very little money. The purchase date is not known.
<br />
The Hard Disk failed and so I installed a new one in the Laptop. However, I am unable to re-install Windows XP! I have formatted and initialised the Hard Disk and partitioned it into two. I have resorted to downloading the start XP from floppy disks (three
 times on two different computers!) direct from Microsoft. It downloads onto 6 Floppies (remember them, so slow!!). XP starts to load and takes the first 5 disks, ok. Disk 6 starts to load and then gives the BSOD! every time! I have tried every trick &amp; scrap
 of knowledge I have (which I thought was a fair bit having used computers since 1986 &amp; DOS 3. I also wrote my thesis on computers at university).
<br />
Do any others out there have any other information or advice or anything which will advance the position from here. Also, just this morning the machine will not start at all, it now just gives four (4) beeps and switches off, &amp; will do nothing else.<br />
<br />
Hoping you can help, ASAP.<br />
<br />
Thanking You in advance &amp; Regards<br />
<br />

            <p>Hello Mawgwr</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Microsoft Answers community is supported by users such as you and Zilo. No one here gets paid. Most of the information found here is provided by the members&nbsp;and their time is volunteered. With that said, Zilo was only pointing you to a community geared
 more specifically to your system. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for your issue, installing&nbsp;Windows XP is not your biggest problem at the moment, the system not booting up and giving beep codes is. This is an indication that the hardware has possibly failed in some way. I have found&nbsp;some information regarding beep
 codes for your system. However,&nbsp;of the&nbsp;listed codes found only 1 seems to fit as you have described. 1 long beep and 3 short beeps. This is an indication of memory failure. My suggestion would be to try and boot from only one&nbsp;stick of memory and see fit the
 system loads&nbsp;or you could contact Fujitsu for hardware support. Thanks. </p>

            OK. misunderstood. I thought the dotted background was the problem. But your problem is with screen show and backgrounds. 
<br />
<br />I was going to suggest repairing your system, but since you have already done that, it probably won't help.

            Normally a "black screen" is a bad thing, windows is non-functional.  When you saw the black background were you able to continue using the computer otherwise?

<h2>            Desktop icons stuck in position</h2>
                    I have just upgraded to W10 from W7. On 7 I had Dexpot installed, but it seemed to take ages to load a desktop in 10, so seeing as W10 includes much the same idea, I uninstalled it. However, now I am unable to move any of my existing icons. They are locked
 in position even though I have disabled all of the auto arrange and alignment options. I can't drag and drop, though I can delete or add new ones, but have no control over where they go. Any ideas?

            <p>Regrettably, method 1 didn't work, so I tried option 2.</p>
<p>Somehow, and I'm not sure why, after trying the suggestions in safe mode (although I was unable to find "Family Safety" anywhere) when I restarted and returned to the main user account the icons would move, but then after a few seconds the screen reset itself
 to the original configuration. As before, I could still add or delete shortcuts, but not move anything. Additionally, no shortcut icons showed on the desktop until I right-clicked - - - curious.</p>
<p>While in safe mode I tried to add an additional user account, but this just hung until I gave up, so I went back to normal mode.</p>
<p>I have created two new user accounts using different names, and when I switch to these I get full control over the desktop, being able to re-arrange icons to my satisfaction.</p>
<p>However, when I go back to the original users set up when updating from W7, they are still effectively "locked" though I can't find anything in the settings to indicate I have locked the screen through any form of choice.</p>
<p>So, having got half way there, is there any easy way to switch the user account dedicated apps (like email and browsers) from one old user to a new user account. If I can do this without changing the desktop settings I will then be able to get back to where
 I was with W7. I know I could do this with XP and others before, being able to "import" settings from one user account to another, but W10 doesn't seem to offer this option, unless it's hidden away somewhere.</p>
<p>For what it's worth, so far, despite this initial problem, W10 looks like a good update, and worth sticking with. Thanks for your help so far.</p>

            <p>Further to my earlier comments, I set up two new user accounts which worked fine. I kept the old user accounts alive though, while I transferred data from one to another.</p>
<p>I moved a couple of applications to one of the new accounts, then as a result of trying to segregate a few things by setting up multiple desktops, I found that the W10 system is somewhat inflexible when compared to Dexpot, which I used on W7.</p>
<p>So I thought I'd try something else, and used a USB stick with a portable version of Dexpot on it, thinking this wouldn't make any difference to Windows.</p>
<p>Wrong!</p>
<p>It still managed to lock up the desktop icons which were behaving themselves perfectly well before. And they stayed hidden until right clicking the desktop.</p>
<p>Switching back to the other new ID created showed that the icons on that desktop were still visible, and could be moved around fine, so it would appear that Dexpot is causing the problem, but only for the individual user account, and only once the program
 is run,</p>
<p>Effectively, using Dexpot in any way seems to corrupt the Windows desktop, so maybe it's worth your while having a look at what's causing that. My only option now is to delete three user accounts and create a new one, and not use Dexpot until it's updated
 to run on W10.</p>
<p>I hope this helps you, even if not me.</p>

            <p>A bit more info....</p>
<p>After convincing myself it was Dexpot causing the problem, I did everything I could to purge the system of it, but then just as I was completing this a control box for Stardock Fences popped up.</p>
<p>As soon as I clicked on this all the icons froze in place again, so maybe it's not Dexpot after all.</p>
<p>I uninstalled Fences and bingo! All the desktop icons can now be freely moved about as they should.</p>
<p>But.....</p>
<p>Everything seems to work OK on the main user ID, but on the others....zilch.</p>
<p>I can't drag and drop anything to the desktop, and can't see any icons whatever I try on any of the three other user account desktops.</p>
<p>I can still access everything through the start menu, can pin to the taskbar and start, but can't add anything to the desktop.</p>
<p>Not a major disaster, but not very satisfactory either.</p>
<p>Does this give you any more ideas?</p>
<p>I'm going to try one more thing before I head to bed. I'm going to create one more user account and see if everything works on that. If it does I'm just going to move all the second user data to it and call it a day!</p>

<h2>            Forced gamertag change</h2>
                    
<p>Is there any way to get in contact with the enforcement team? I lost my gamertag due to the terrible report system, the enforcement was revoked, and was told that</p>
<p>my original gamertag would be available within 24 hours, that happened on saturday... If they make a mistake they at least should try to see it gets fixed.</p>
<p>The forum they used is dead so i hope this one is ok.</p>

<p>Thanks for the replies, i already did that so i don't have anything to appeal to, &nbsp;it also seems that i didn't get a free gamertag change (i never wanted to change it), it would be nice to get someone from the staff even though i already paid, i have waited
 for almost 2 weeks to get my gamertag back and not even the support guys can help.</p>

<p>Already did and i shouldn't have to, people abuse the poor report system they implemented and i have to pay for their mistake? it is as simple as to file a complaint on your gamertag and you will loose it, you just need the numbers, but it's ok now i know
 which new gen console i'll get, the one without the worthless "case review".</p>
<p>And i am only replying in case someone else gets in the same situation as me, there are people that don't violate the code of conduct but they could care less, and they do have a number on complaints, i am the proof of it.</p>

<p>That is completely untrue.</p>
<p>You could of had 1000 complaints filed about your gamertag,if it hadn't been against the CoC/ToU then you wouldn't of been issued a forced name change.</p>

            You know what you should do? <br />
<br />
Your video driver is crashing but it is very recent and it is not at fault in and of itself.<br />
<br />
I'm fairly certain that XP does not have a TDR mechanism to revive the video subsystem such as later versions of Windows do.<br />
<br />
For that reason, you can't possibly be getting 0x116 errors like what you are getting is similar to.<br />
<br />
So how to fix?<br />
<br />
Pull out your video card. Clean the fan all nicely with a q-tip and rubbing alcohol. Be gentle as the fan blades can crack off rather easily.<br />
<br />
Make sure there is not a lot of dust and debris around the card. Use a can of compressed air if you must. Do not use alcohol on the electronic parts or the board itself.<br />
<br />
Once you are sure it is nice so heat can not build up easily on it, put it back in the machine and give it a nice firm push so it seats well, carefully. Make sure the power cable is attached to it very well too, if it requires that at all.<br />
<br />
Let me know how it is going for ya after these things and if you have any more crashes, please do not hesitate to allow me to see the new one(s).<br />
<br />
Monitor the card's temperature with MSI Afterburner. Watch some videos on YouTube at 1080p and tell me the highest temperature you see.<br />
<br />
Best of luck...<br />
<br />
Also, do you know the exact model of your psu at all?<br />
<br />

Here is the crash (you read it from bottom to top):<br />

See the watchdog reference? That is how your computer knows the hardware is acting funky...and it sees that your card can not recover so it assumes all hope is lost and then crashes on you.<br />

            Sorry you are having issues. Did you try detaching and re-attaching the type cover? Also, you can try a two button reset:
<br />
<br />________________________________________________
<br />Step 1:	Press and hold the power button on your Surface for 30 seconds and then release it.
<br />	
<br />Step 2:	Press and hold the volume-up button and the power button at the same time for at least 15 seconds and then release both. 
<br />	
<br />	The screen may flash the Surface logo, but continue holding the buttons down for at least 15 seconds.
<br />	
<br />Step 3:	After you release the buttons, wait 10 seconds.
<br />	
<br />Step 4:	Press and release the power button to turn your Surface back on. You should see the Surface logo.
<br />
<br />Let me know if this does not work. Please DO mark as Answer if this was of assistance.

    <title>Signing in to Windows Live Mail very slow - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikelew  say:</h3>
<h2>            Signing in to Windows Live Mail very slow</h2>
                    When I open the standalone Windows Live mail program to check email, it is extremely slow to show any emails. Even emails that &nbsp;are already in my system do not show in the view window until I am "logged in". The headers are there, but not the contents
 of the email. I know the login time and view of emails is related because the exact second it shows me logged in, the email's contents pop up. Sometimes it takes 20-30 seconds after Live Mail is opened before &nbsp;the emails are readable. New emails are actually
 done downloading before they are readable.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Hope this makes sense. I've googled this to no end at different times over the last year or so and have never found this exact issue.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have no desire to keep WLM open at all times. I like to close it and only open it when I want to deal with emails.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks for any tips</div>
                </div>

            Well, I heard back from Eric and he had me uncheck the top box "automatically detect settings" in LAN Settings under TOOLS in IE (can also be done in control panel)&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>It's under the CONNECTIONS tab in TOOLS</div>
<div><br />
<div>With that box unchecked, WLM works perfectly. Everything else seems to be fine with internet stuff so far even though I never had to manually enter any IP addresses.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This is amazing if it's all this was the whole time.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'll post again if Eric adds anything else.</div>

<h2>            Computer connects to WIFI but will not Display Web Pages says it is offline</h2>
                    
<div>
<p>I am using a Toshiba Satellite Laptop, running Windows XP with Service Pack 3.&nbsp; Ever since the install of Service pack 3 I am unable to access the internet using the built in LAN (Intel(R) PRO/Wireless 3945ABG network card).&nbsp; I am a truck driver, so I connect
 to many different public wireless access points, like those found at truck stops.</p>
<p>I am able to connect using my cellular wireless card.&nbsp; At the time of Service Pack 3 install I was using AVG Free.&nbsp; I have since installed Kaspersky Labs' internet Security.</p>
<p>This is what happens:</p>
<p>The wireless network connection shows that it is connected to a wireless access point and shows signal strength</p>
<p>When I start Internet Explorer or Firefox it shows that I am working offline. When I tell it to work online a window pops up that says 'Dial-up connection, select the service you want to connect to'.&nbsp; It has a drop down menu, and shows only cellular profile
 (my cellular wireless card) if you click on settings, internet properties, the setup it takes you to new connection wizard, and has option, to connect to a wireless network, view wireless in range, and then it will show the wireless networks in range and if
 you connect to one will connect and go back to the original problem.... it shows offline, click online, and window for dial up connection comes back.</p>
<p>It has been suggested that I update my drivers... I have done so.&nbsp; Same problem, no change.</p>
<p>I have run checkdisk.</p>
</div>
<div><span><span>It was suggested my settings were wrong and to set comp for: Dial whenever a network connection is not present (instead of Always dial my default connection)------- I have done
 so, still will not connect and when I run diagnostics wizard I get this rather lengthy message:<br />
</span></span></div>
<p>"windows is not currently managing your wireless network.&nbsp; To diagnose this wireless connection windows needs to be managing the connection.&nbsp; If you are using a non Microsoft application to manage wireless networks, please refer to that application to troubleshoot
 the wireless network problem."--------- I have no other 'non Microsoft application" that is managing my wireless network so far as I am aware, I never had this problem before my Microsoft updates.&nbsp; I connected to the internet regularly using WiFi for years,
 now this issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ran a diagnostics thing as suggested in other threads with people who had a similar problem:</p>

            Your wireless is misconfigured according to diagnostics! Do I understand you correctly, you are unable to connect with your wireless LAN (Intel(R) PRO/Wireless 3945ABG network card. Also you are unable to connect with your cellular wireless card which
 is also misconfigured according to what you say in your post. I will give you specific instructions how to correct this problem but you must follow the exact order in which they are given and do not reverse the order for any reason other wise you may still
 have problems. Please tell me the make and model of your cellular card. Which Drivers did you update? the drivers for Intel, the drivers for your cellular or both. Where did you get these drivers? Do you have software for Intel installed on your computer?
 please check, this is what Windows was asking for, you should&nbsp;have it otherwise Windows would not ask.&nbsp;Do you use your computer at home or elsewhere with a DialUp connection? Please post back with all the answers!

            If its KB4054517
<br />
<br />Many users are reporting issues with this update, I recommend you block it until further notice:
<br />
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>  
<br />
<br />After downloading, launch it, click Next, wait while it detects pending Windows Updates.
<br />
<br />Click the Hide Updates menu.
<br />
<br />Scroll through the list then select then select the update. Check the box next to the update then click Next to confirm changes. 
<br />
<br />You can try install it manually by downloading from the Microsoft Update Catalog:
<br /><a href="http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=KB4054517" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Sea...</a>

            Yes, i can see bios if needed. The computer starts up, goes through “diagnosing computer” the “repairing computer” then it goes to repair failed statement. I then have the option to troubleshoot on blue screen. Ive tried the reset pc option and to keep
 my files and settings, but it either goes immediately to a blue screen where the cursor wont move and stay there or go to blue screen, stay there, followed by an error about not being able to reinstall. I have very important files on my computer and now i
 cant access them. I cant do a clean install bc then i will lose the files. Since you posted the above, I saw that this update is a major screwup and my issue is not unique. Am I really just screwed at this point? How could an update mess things up so bad?
 All i want to do is get the files i need off this computer. I have hundreds of pictures of family, kids that ive got on there that i didnt back up this week yet. This is such a bummer this close to holidays.

<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>How
 is your printer connected to the laptop, wired or wireless connection?</span></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>Step 1:</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><span>I would suggest you to remove the printer from the computer manually and then reconnect it to the system and install the latest drivers and printer
 software from the manufacturer’s website and check whether you are able to print. Refer the article mentioned below.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>After installing the Pinter on the system follow the steps in article mentioned below (Share a printer).</span></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>Step 2:</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><span>Sharing a printer requires a few steps. First, you'll need to turn on file and printer sharing, and then you'll need to share your printer. When other
 people want to use your printer, they can follow a few steps to add your printer to their computers.</span></span></span></p>

<h2>            Error code &#34;Function Discovery Printer Port DLL&#34; not working</h2>
                    I have installed my Officejet J4580 printer on new Dell with Windows 7 which worked on my old system with XP.&nbsp; It will scan without problem but will not print.&nbsp; When I try to test print I get an error saying that the function discovery printer port dll
 is not working.&nbsp; HP says it is not a printer problem; Dell says it is not an operational problem but a port problem.&nbsp; I can't figure out how to fix it!!

            Create a Standard TCP/IP Port to the device rather than printing to a WSD port.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open the Ports tab of the printer and add a Standard TCP/IP Port using the hostname of the IP of the device network card.

            I don't think I am using a WSD port because it is connected through the USB.&nbsp; It is not a networked printer but a local printer.&nbsp; What would my "IP of the device network card" be?&nbsp; I am assuming I don't have one since I am connecting it directly through
 the USB port.<br />

            I am running Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit. <br />
<br />
When I try to print a document from Word, the printer shows up as ready and working but when I hit print I get this error:<br />
<br />
This error can appear if a default printer has not been designated or if the application is unable to locate an existing default printer. To correct this problem, try one of the following in Microsoft Windows:<br />
If a printer is not available in the Print dialog box, add a printer.<br />
If the application cannot find an existing printer that is already installed, set the printer as the default printer.<br />
If a default printer is installed but the application is unable to use it, uninstall the printer driver, and then install the latest version of the printer driver.<br />
If the printer is on a print server, make sure the printer is available, the network is functioning, the server is not stalled, the printer is not out of paper, or the printer is not suspended by the administrator. Printing issues associated with a network
 printer are best handled by your local network administrator.<br />
For more information about setting up and troubleshooting printer connections, see Windows Help and Support. (Click the Start button, and then click Help and Support.)<br />
<br />
<br />
I get the function discovery printer port dll is not working error when I select the printer from the device and printers of control panel.&nbsp; It shows the printer and says that it is ready.&nbsp; At this point I can chose to scan and that function works.&nbsp; If I click
 on properties under the hardware tab is says that the device is functioning properly.&nbsp; There are no exclamation points or concerns in my device manager.
<br />
<br />
I get the error&nbsp; when I click on the properties of the printer by clicking "customize your printer" then I have the option to print a test page.&nbsp; Once I hit print a test page it says "function discovery print provider" has stopped working.&nbsp; It says that windows
 is searching for a solution but then says "A problem caused the program to stop working correctly.&nbsp; Windows will close the program and notify you if a solution is available."&nbsp; it then shuts down the display box that has the properties.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Thank you so much for your help and let me know if you need any more information.<br />

            <p>Yay this worked. &nbsp;I had to turn off my computer a few times before the option came up for the recovery mode where I could get a command prompt. &nbsp;I had to change the drive to d drive (I have an HP Touchsmart 610) and the x86 to amd64 as I am running Windows
 7 Professional 64 bit. &nbsp;Gave up looking at it for a few days but decided I had to get it sorted today. &nbsp;Glad I found this as searching on the site is not that straight forward.&nbsp;</p>

<p>hey there, so i know it was said that there were supposed to be upwards of 300 gamer pics to choose from but i have maybe 80-100 available. Is there a way to make ur own or upload ur own? i tried going on explorer and saving a pic and trying to make that
 my profile pic but no dice. Can you put a picture on a thumb drive and upload it onto xbox one or something like that? if anyone knows, DO TELL! :)</p>

<p>I think they (MS) should allow you to use your own Gamerpics. &nbsp;I have no idea why they don't.</p>
<p>"fear of *** and willy shots flooding the community" is no excuse, on the 360 you could take a picture using the cam, and the amount of *** fluff from people on my friends list i've seen is unbelievable.. &nbsp;so that's just a lame excuse.</p>
<p>come on MS, let us upload our own Gamerpics.! &nbsp;- you know someone somewhere will hack a way anyway. &nbsp;if you really want to cover your backsides from legal then just add an "offensive" button.</p>

<p>The minor issue is licensing. With millions of users uploading pictures of other companies properties it gets a bit tricky. Some companies can pull it off without dealing with lawsuits. However considering how invested MS is with the gamertags and how they
 started with purchasable ones it becomes another can of worms. They would have to refund eery purchased gamertag and have an entirely different set of EULAs for user freedom. Also, this is why we cant design our own Avatar clothes unless it is premade or approved
 for use (Yes many have created theirs and had it put online). The cam idea more or less removed MS's hand in that to some extent, but still led to many issues.</p>

<p>However if someone "hacked" a way to use their own pictures as their gamerpic, that's a quick and simple way to receive a ban. OH, that gamerpic isn't authorized, therefore down with the ban hammer. There's no loopholes that have to be jumped through or

<p>I agree with upgrading 360 gamerpics to high resolution for the Xbox One (although I think it'll never happen) as well as simply adding more gamerpics for both consoles period. There should be thousands to choose from, relating to virtually everything, IMO.</p>

 either Drive. I have also found that when you go into My Computer when you first switch on, the two drives are shown as "DVD-RW DRIVE" but after you put a DVD disc in it and the eject it the drives changes to "CD DRIVE" only. I have been able to burn to these
 drives before. I have Power DVD and can play disc from the programme, but cannot auto play. I am not to concerned about playing DVD as I can overcome the problem. My main concern is that I cannot burn any disc's from either Drive.<br />
I have run the auto fix programme from Microsoft which says that neither of my drives will burn disc. What do I do next?

<p>Have your system has any buning software installed like 'Nero' or 'Ashampoo Burning Studio'?</p>
<p>If yes then while proceed with burning you will get an error message. Please provide the exact error message.</p>
<p>Do not go with the name of the drive(like 'CD DRIVE'). Only conclude if write fails.</p>
<p>I'll suggest you to use a Re-writable media as writing may failed. If you use a normal media that will be destroyed forever by faulty writing. But if you use Re-writable media then you can erase it &amp; will be able to reuse it.</p>

            Sorry I been a long time getting back, but problem still not solved. I have Nero 6 on my computer. Have found out now that neither drive will recognize a DVD disc in either drive. Both drives recognize a CD disc. I have tried removing Nero&nbsp;6 because I
 was told the programme can have effect, but made no effect. Have put Nero&nbsp;6 back on the computer. So I cannot even run the programme at present because it want detect DVD disc.

This is **** because it is not a new problem. I have the same problerm and others do also. They are not responding anymore becaue Microsoft always says it is a virus when they don't know what to do. Then they will tell you to restore format and restore your drive. Next they will tell you your version of wondows is an OEM version and contact the computer maker. I would like to get paid the same as they do for jacking people around. 


There is a problem with Window XP and Windoes 7 not recognizing some DVD drives and Misrososoft will ignore the problem intil everyne starts contacting computer user publications and web sites. When they are aske embarassing questions about telling people to restore their computers that will start to try to do something. 


You can also write to you computer manufacturer executive office. Tell them you are not getting proper support for your probem from Microsoft support.

<h2>            4K content not working on my Xbox One S anymore.</h2>
                    <p>My 4K isn’t working anymore on my Xbox one S. I don’t use it often so I started it up after a few months to watch a 4K Blu-ray movie and it looked like it was displaying at 1080. I checked the settings on my TV and the HDMI port has UHD color setting selected. I tried the Xbox on my 4K monitor and it just displays at 1080. The display settings on the Xbox show green checks in the 4K options for both screens. I reset the system and updated it again and still no 4K. The 4K Blu-ray app doesn’t display at 4K anymore either. I tried multiple cables as well. YouTube apps highest res was 1080 as well. So was Netflix. Any ideas on what’s causing it? It worked fine a few months ago and every time before that.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p><p><br /></p><p>I'm not sure if you are aware, but UHD colour just refers to HDR, not an UHD resolution.&nbsp; Enabling UHD colour won't automatically enable 4K resolution.&nbsp; Does your console report to be in 4K resolution?&nbsp; Does the OSD (on screen display) on your display/s show a 4K resolution I.e. 3840x2160?</p>
