            If you are seeing a message like this:<br />
<br />
Control Panel<br />
Windows cannot find 'C:\WINDOWS\system32\rundll32.exe'.&nbsp; Make sure you typed the name correctly, and then try again. To search for a file, click the Start button, and then click Search.<br />
<br />
The rundll32.exe file is one of the 3498 files that Windows File Protection looks after so it should never be missing.&nbsp; It takes extra effort even to delete it on purpose.<br />
<br />
If that is NOT the message you are seeing, you need to tell us <i>exactly </i>what the message you are seeing says and also tell us what your antivirus/antimalware software is:<br />
<i><br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE), McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!,&nbsp; avast!. Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.</i><br />
<br />
If you want to waste time reading through 24 pages of ideas that might work sometimes maybe and also entertain some bad advice, or ideas where the folks say "it doesn't work", "I'm getting an error" or "I don't have a CD", etc. follow that other thread.&nbsp; This
 issue is generally a one reply solution.<br />
<br />
If the message says what I noted above and you want to fix it now, do this:<br />
<br />
I uploaded a copy of the XP Pro SP3 file you need to my SkyDrive (everybody has a SkyDrive for sharing files).<br />
<br />
Here is the link to my SkyDrive and you can look for the file you need there:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=6a7e789cab1d6f39&amp;id=6A7E789CAB1D6F39!311" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=6a7e789cab1d6f39&amp;id=6A7E789CAB1D6F39!311</a><br />
<br />
You can download it and when you do, put a copy of the file in these folders (assuming Windows is installed on your C drive):<br />
<br />
<b>c:\windows\system32<br />
c:\windows\system32\dllcache&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; (that is where XP keeps backup copies of important files).<br />
<br />
When you see the files available for download, you may not see the file extension (.exe, .dll, .cpl, .sys, .zip, etc.), but when you download them they will have the correct extension.<br />
<br />
When you download the file (especially if you use Internet Explorer), when you get a chance to save the file, your browser may not save the file with an extension (like .exe, .dll, .cpl, .sys, .zip, etc.) so you will have to manually add the proper extension
 to the file when you download the file before you save it.<br />
<br />
You can download the file with no extension and then rename the file to add the proper extension.&nbsp; You don't want to try to use a file called
<b>rundll32 </b>when the file name really needs to be called <b>rundll32.exe</b> (if the downloaded file has no extension you will have to change the name of the file to add the proper extension to get it to work.<br />
<br />
You then need to copy/paste the downloaded file in the correct folder(s) on your system.<br />
<br />

<br />
<i>Control Panel<br />
Windows cannot find 'C:\WINDOWS\system32\rundll32.exe'.&nbsp; Make sure you typed the name correctly, and then try again. To search for a file, click the Start button, and then click Search.<br />

<br />
If the message above is the message you are seeing, you don't need to associate anything to Control Panel - if that is the message, the file is likely just missing and you just need to replace it.<br />
<br />
What file to copy?&nbsp; <br />
<br />
If you are seeing the message listed above, first you download the file from my SkyDrive and save it someplace on your system you can find it (like your Desktop), then you copy and past the file into these two locations:<br />
<br />
<b>c:\windows\system32<br />
c:\windows\system32\dllcache&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; (that is where XP keeps backup copies of important files).<br />
<br />
If you are not seeing the message above, you need to tell us exactly what the message says that you are seeing:<br />

            Hi,
<div>This error usually occurs when you are trying to run a game or application with a graphics that is not supported. Visit the graphics card manufacturer website and check if the card is compatible with Windows XP and the game.</div>
<div>If you have a graphics card that is compatible however still get the error then the drivers for the card have to be installed. By default the Windows drivers will be installed for the card, visit the card manufacturer website, download and install drivers
 for the model of the card that is installed on your computer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can refer the link provided, download and install the Directx 9.0c.</div>

<h2>            Private chat on Xbox Live. </h2>
                    
<p>Hi! I have one question about private chat. I am sorry if I make some mistakes, because my english is not very good (I'm Polish).</p>
<p>So. Does my friend need Xbox Live <strong>Gold </strong>to talk with me on private chat. I have got Gold account, but my friend no. Must he buy
<strong>Gold</strong> if he wants to use private chat. Sorry for my mistakes. I am waiting for answer.</p>

<span><strong>Below is my first post describing the circumstances...</strong></span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Hi so today I got home and I looked at my computer which was already running and there was an alert that said a registry entry was corrupted/deleted or something I can't remember but it said the entry was recovered using a log file and the recovery was successful.
 Now I know what the registry is and I know that that should be considered bad but I nothing else seemed to happen so I figured what ever right? Nothing else seems to be wrong. Then suddenly I get a warning from Windows that it's shutting down a program to
 protect the computer. This program just happens to be explorer.exe...Well now the OS is treating itself like a virus?? I'm not sure what to make of this so I click ok because I figure explorer will terminate and restart itself. Which it does. Now I don't need
 the computer so I shut it down. A few hours later I come back, turn it on, and after the computer POSTs and the Windows logo should show with the loading bar I instantly get a message that the System configuration file is missing and that I should use the
 repair console option on my original OS CD to repair/replace the file...well now I freak out a little bit. I get into the repair console and thats pretty much all I got. When I first enter the repair console it tells me the registry may be damaged or corrupted
 which it obviously is and that the same system file is missing. Well now I'm stuck because I'm only 17 and as good as I am with computers DOS and command line systems I can deal with but just barely. I reeeally need a GUI XD. I have no idea how to utilize
 the repair console properly. I've gone through all the commands the HELP command lists and that's gotten me nowhere. So, now I turn to my elders and hope they have some advice from that magical time I've heard of when command line systems ruled supreme. :)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Please help me. I have no way to get into my files without mounting the file system using a bootable flavor of Linux and it'd be really awesome if I could just replace this file and get my stuff and GTFO. I guess this will give me an excuse to upgrade to 7
 at least...</p>
<p>
Thanks so much.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Oh and I'm running NTFS not FAT32. Just FYI. Also no recent hardware/software changes. This was just out of the blue.&nbsp;</p>
</strong></span>
<p>
Hey I just realized it'd be good for you guys to know I'm sure I don't have any malware/virus/worm/trojan/spyware/rootkit or anything. I'm extremely careful with that. Scans are&nbsp;consistently&nbsp;run on my system plus slight paranoia helps lol.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>Ok, if you can boot using your bootable flavor of Linx and browse to a folder like
<strong>C:\System Volume Information\_restore{D86480E3-73EF-47BC-A0EB-A81BE6EE3ED8}\RP1\Snapshot
</strong>but look for the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">RP </span>folder with one of the most recent creation dates.</p>
<p>In the snapshot folder you should see five files:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>_REGISTRY_USER_.DEFAULT</strong> </li><li><strong>_REGISTRY_MACHINE_SECURITY</strong> </li><li><strong>_REGISTRY_MACHINE_SOFTWARE</strong> </li><li><strong>_REGISTRY_MACHINE_SYSTEM</strong> </li><li><strong>_REGISTRY_MACHINE_SAM</strong> </li></ul>
<p>Copy these files to the <strong>c:\windows\system32\config</strong> folder<br />
In the c:\windows\system32\config folder, rename DEFAULT to DEFAULT.old and do the same for the other four files, i.e.:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DEFAULT &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span>---- should now be&nbsp;<strong>DEFAULT.old</strong></span></strong>
</li><li><strong>SECURITY &nbsp; &nbsp;<span>---- should now be&nbsp;<strong>SECURITY.old</strong></span></strong>
</li><li><strong>SOFTWARE &nbsp;<span>---- should now be&nbsp;<strong>SOFTWARE.old</strong></span></strong>
</li><li><strong>SYSTEM &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span>---- should now be&nbsp;<strong>SYSTEM.old</strong></span></strong>
</li><li><strong>SAM &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span>---- should now be&nbsp;<strong>SAM.old</strong></span></strong>
</li></ul>
<p>Now rename the five hive files you've just copied to DEFAULT, SECURITY, SOFTWARE, SYSTEM and SAM i.e.:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>_REGISTRY_USER_.DEFAULT</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ---- should now be <strong>
DEFAULT</strong> </li><li><strong>_REGISTRY_MACHINE_SECURITY &nbsp; &nbsp;<span>---- should now be&nbsp;<strong>SECURITY</strong></span></strong>
</li><li><strong>_REGISTRY_MACHINE_SOFTWARE &nbsp;<span>---- should now be&nbsp;<strong>SOFTWARE</strong></span></strong>
</li><li><strong>_REGISTRY_MACHINE_SYSTEM &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span>---- should now be&nbsp;<strong>SYSTEM</strong></span></strong>
</li><li><strong>_REGISTRY_MACHINE_SAM &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span>---- should now be&nbsp;<strong>SAM</strong></span></strong>
</li></ul>
<div>Now reboot your computer and keep your fingers crossed!</div>

    <title>No separate Volume Control for Win10 Apps&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chadkameda  say:</h3>
<h2>            No separate Volume Control for Win10 Apps&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So, back in the days of running Win7, I could open the Sound Mixer, and every program I would open had its own individualized Volume Level Setting that I could adjust the way I wanted. When I went to Win8, and now Win10, I found that Apps obtained through
 the Windows Store did not receive an individual Volume Level Setting. I'd be happy if it was at least covered under a blanket Volume Level Setting under the "Windows Store App" type of label, but it is not, instead, it is only able to be adjusted by lowering
 the Main Volume Control.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does someone know if there is a way to change this, or are we going to need Microsoft to release an update to the Volume Control system first?</p>

<h2>            How to set printer as default</h2>
                    <p>The question is how to get Windows 10 to change the default printer based on the currently connected network. For example, when at work and&nbsp;connected to NETWORK-A&nbsp;the default printer should be PRINTER-A but when at home and connected to NETWORK-B the default
 printer should be PRINTER-B.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was a feature of Windows 7 and was accessed through the Manage Default Printer selection. How do we do this in Windows 10?</p>

<h2>            HELP&#33;&#33;&#33; I think i may have a virus on my computer&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the beginning <br />
<br />
<strong>1.</strong> Turn power button on, windows loads. no problem there. Before getting to my&nbsp;deskstop&nbsp;i have about 3 ways to do so&nbsp;in the order the program loads. to get on i can either&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; a. face recognition software<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. finger print software<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. normal windwos logon<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
my face recognition does not recognizes me. it automatically&nbsp;scans&nbsp; the side of my&nbsp;face and im on my deskstop, and the finger print scanner not working.<br />
the only option to get on is to sign on which&nbsp;I did.<br />
<br />
after sigining on , what the ____, i was goin thru the steps and i got a notepad pad poped up on my deskstop and in the notepad it said&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[.ShellClassInfo]<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LocalizedResourceName=@%SystemRoot%system32\shell32.dll,-21787<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it must have been when i was in the cmd box before tryin to get to the regedit that was&nbsp;taking long that i&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; had&nbsp;logoff my computer and log back on thus that notepad opening . that may be the cause of that but i dont know.<br />
<br />
<strong><br />
<br />
2</strong>.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have my internet thruough clear wireless which automactically loads when i logon to deskstop. on this case it&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
freezes and im not able to get on to the internet.<br />
<br />
<strong>3. windows liveonecare&nbsp;pops up and it says,<br />
</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows Live ONECARE cannot continue</p>
<p>The windows liveonecare is not not working or has stopped. To correct this problem, try restarting your computer. If the problem&nbsp;continues, click the below to get help.<br />
<br />
<strong>4</strong>.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've restarted before the same problem arise cept for the shell cmd, but when i click the help link int he tab nothing happens. i click to open any program nothing happens. eventually the computer shutdowns on its own or froze altogether. i went out
 and bought avg antivirus and anti-spyware cd since i read that windows liveonecare is discontinuing their product.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; what to do in this case please respond , thanks<br />
&nbsp;p.s&nbsp; all this software to keep physical beings from accessing my computer on the outside but the ones thats in cyberspace i dont have armor for , or i thought i had. ;-(<br />
<br />
i tried the usuall doin cntrl alt del to startup program tab&nbsp;i cant end processes it says permission denied then it eventually stalls, i cant use&nbsp;cmd line cause access is denied there to drive c: and im not particularly know what virus or malware im lookin
 for, its shows no programs running in the programs tab, eventually it shutdown&nbsp;or freeze i tried but not attempt&nbsp;has been successful<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shon</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p><span><span>We'll need to do a general troubleshooting to see if we can identify and resolve the problem.<span>&nbsp;</span>Skip any steps that you can't do because of how the system
 is working - but try them (in safe mode with networking if necessary or from the disk when possible).&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span></span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above
 information you should be able to restore with no problems.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp;
 Here's the procedure: </span></span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
</span><a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span></span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD (perhaps made on a different computer or perhaps in safe mode with networking if that is working).<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
If using the disk, cd to C:\Windows\System32. Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here
 or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s) using </span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will want to schedule itself to run at the next restart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Answer yes and then reboot to run the program.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive
 and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning&nbsp;startup (Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Event Viewer).&nbsp;
 Here's how to use Event Viewer: </span></span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></span></a><span><span>.
 &nbsp;Look in the System section.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may be infected with malware. Try to run anti-malware programs (in safe mode with networking if<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">necessary</span>).&nbsp;To fix this problem
 (if it is a problem) download,&nbsp;install, and run the following two programs:</span></span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;and</span></span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span></span><a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/</span></span></a><span><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download,
 install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried
 it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials</span></span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html</span></span></a><span><span>
 (with the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time). &nbsp;You may also want to try the free Avira at:</span></span><a href="http://www.free-av.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.free-av.com/</span></span></a><span><span>
 and Avast at: </span></span><a href="http://www.avast.com/index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.avast.com/index</span></span></a><span><span>.
 &nbsp;Reboot after completing all the scans.&nbsp; You may also want to try the free OneCare at</span></span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></span></a><span><span>
 and let it run all the options (except the registry cleaner) because that’s good maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, try a clean boot&nbsp;</span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 If the problem goes away then it's just a matter of tracking down the culprit causing the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the procedures in the article.&nbsp; Once found, delete, remove, deactivate, or uninstall it.&nbsp; Once done be sure to reset Vista back to normal status as
 explained in the procedures. If the problem occurs in clean mode then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Boot into Safe mode with networking and see if the problem occurs there.&nbsp; Either result helps us narrow down the search for the cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may be having troubles with your device drivers, firmware, and/or software.&nbsp;</span><span>Go to Device Manager by going to start / search
 box and type device manager and enter and then double-click on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Check each device for a red x, yellow ! or white ?.&nbsp; These identify devices with problems (probably drivers, but also conflicts or something else).&nbsp; Click on each
 for further details and troubleshooting tips.&nbsp; If you need to get drivers (and you should do any you have time to do - they may help in ways beyond just resolving this problem), do so from the computer vendor or device manufacturer (NOT from Microsoft Updates).&nbsp;
 In fact, you should turn off automatic driver updates from Windows Update as follows:</span></span><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/</span></span></a><span><span>.
 Proceed as follows to get the drivers: </span></span><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Once you have the drivers, you can install them through Device Manager as follows:</span></span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html</span></span></a><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Let's test your hard drive and RAM for hardware problems:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To test your hard drive, check the manufacturer and then get the diagnostic utility from:</span></span><a href="http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html</span></span></a><span><span>
 (and/or get one from your hard drive or computer manufacturer if they have one available – it wouldn’t hurt to try both).&nbsp; If it fails the test, replace it.&nbsp; If it passes the test, then there's probably nothing wrong with it.<br />
<br />
You can also test your RAM at </span></span><a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.memtest.org/</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 If it fails, test each chip individually to find those that are bad and replace them.&nbsp; If it passes, RAM is probably OK.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; To do this you have to also be able to boot normally.<span>&nbsp;</span>Here's the procedure:
</span></span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the
 system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:</span></span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></span></a><span><span>.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Please
 reply before doing the next step as it is a radical option and I’d like to make sure we’ve ruled out all other options before taking that step.</span></span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work (or you don’t have the disk), then I'm afraid the only option is a clean install.&nbsp; You can use Knoppix</span><a href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;with
 a good ISO copier like: </span><a href="http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;along
 with a blank CD.&nbsp; This should give you enough access to the system (if you can't get in any other way) to backup your important data.&nbsp; Once done, you can do a clean install either using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk or the Recovery Disk or the
 Recovery Partition (whatever process is dictated by your computer manufacturer – you may need to contact them for the procedure and perhaps to get recovery disks).&nbsp; To do a clean install proceed as follows:</span><a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/winvista_install_03.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/winvista_install_03.asp</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;(adapted
 as necessary by the procedures of your computer manufacturer).&nbsp; Then you will need to re-install all your programs, reset all your preferences, reconfigure your network and email settings, restore your backed up data, run Windows Update with possibly nearly
 100 updates pending,...</span></p>
<p><span><span>Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve or at least identify the cause of your problem.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>

<h2>            Kann man es noch stornieren&#63; -&#91;Translation - Can I still cancel it&#63;&#93;</h2>
                    <p>Ich wollte mir heute Red Dead Redemption 2 vorbestellen, also habe ich mir 2 Guthaben Karten gekauft. (20 und 50 Euro) Doch als ich sie einlösen wollte hat es nicht geklappt... ich schliesse also den Kaufvorgang und starte die Xbox One erneut. Ich gehe in
 den store und auf einmal läd das Spiel herunter, aber die Karten gehen immer noch nicht und eingelöst habe ich sie ja auch nicht. Dann bekomme ich eine Nachricht von einem Verwandten das gerade 70 Euro bei der Person über die Kreditkarte abgebucht wurden(die
 Karte ist aber der Xbox angegeben), obwohl ich ja den Kauf abgebrochen und nicht einmal die Zahlungsmethode geändert habe. Also habe ich jetzt 70 Euro ohne Wert in Guthaben Karten versenkt und 70 Euro mithilfe einer Kreditkarte aus dem Fenster geworfen.</p>
<p>Also ist meine Frage, ob man den Kauf stornieren kann, da ich den Kauf garnicht erst zugelassen und jetzt 140 Euro verschwendet habe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S.: Ich werde mich auch noch an den Support wenden.</p>

 once the game downloads, but the cards still do not go and I have not redeemed them either. Then I get a message from a relative that just 70 euros were charged to the person via the credit card (but map orientation is indicated on the Xbox), although I canceled
 the purchase and did not even change the payment method. So now I have 70 euros without value in credit cards sunk and 70 euro with a credit card thrown out of the window.</strong></p>
<p><strong>So my question is whether you can cancel the purchase, since I have not admitted the purchase and now have wasted 140 euros.</strong></p>
<p><strong>P.S.: I will also contact support.]</strong></p>

<h3> miacat63  say:</h3>
<h2>            What are XML docs and VHD Files.  </h2>
                    My External Hard Drive is nearly completely full after transferring to a new computer recently. I set up a back up for docs/photos etc, but suddenly is used nearly 170gb of space so only 8gb left out of 500.<br />
The big files are XML and VHD and if I try to open them to see what they are, I cannot open.&nbsp; Is it safe to just delete them from my EHD to free up space or are they really important?&nbsp; Thanks for any help

<p><span>Hi miacat63,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A Virtual Hard Disk (VHD) is a virtual hard disk file format, meaning that it can contain what is found on a physical Hard Disk Drive, such as
 files, folders, file system and disk partitions.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you created the backup of the files on the external hard drive, the VHD file could be that of the backup you performed.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the following articles for instructions on restoring the backup:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Restore-files-from-a-backup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Restore files from a backup</span></a></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For further information on XML and VHD files, refer the following articles:</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I’d recommend you to restore the backup saved in the external hard drive to the new Windows 7 computer before deleting the files.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information helps.</span></p>

    <title>Using Photos app and Windows Media Player in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> derrick leigh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using Photos app and Windows Media Player in Windows 10</h2>
                    I use Windows Media Player to cast music to my TV which has a sound system attached. I also use Onedrive to synchronise my music collection across two devices, a desktop and laptop. Unfortunately the photos app automatically downloads any album pictures
 from the Onedrive music folder and swamps my photo collection with hundreds of album covers. If I delete them I have to prevent WMP from updating album info and use it without album cover photos. Also, if I change the music libraries to ones on my devices,
 WMP adds the Onedrive folder without asking&nbsp;and downloads a duplicate library every time the system is rebooted, whatever the settings are set to. Has anyone found a workaround? The photos app needs a fix to prevent it downloading from the Onedrive music folder.

            <p>Hi Derrick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I completely understand your concern in this regard. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As I would like to inform that the Photos app feature will automatically Sync the all photos from the OneDrive. If you don't want it to happen, then follow the below mentioned steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>* Launch the <strong>Photos App</strong></p>
<p><strong>* </strong>Click <strong>Menu&nbsp;</strong>and select <strong>Settings (I.e. Gear Icon)&nbsp;</strong>on bottom left</p>
<p>* Under <strong>Sources, </strong>Click<strong> Cross Mark(I.e. 'X' )</strong> against the OneDrive path</p>
<p><strong>* </strong>Confirm your Choice by Clicking<strong> Remove Folder.</strong></p>
<p><br />
Hope this will address your query.<br />
</p>

            <p>Hi Yashwanth,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for a prompt reply. I also need to sync my photos across devices (one of the great benefits of Windows 10), so your suggestion does not fully address my concerns. The only folder listed in sources is the Onedrive Pictures folder, and if I were to
 remove it from the sources&nbsp;I would not be able to sync photos across devices, including two mobiles. For some reason Photos app downloads any pictures in the Onedrive Music folder, which is certainly not listed as a source folder in settings.&nbsp;&nbsp;That needs to
 be fixed, but in the meantime I'll use WMP without any media information. That seems to be my best compromise workaround. I should add that this problem also applies to my mobiles with the Photos app, and having to delete a thousand downloaded album covers
 from each mobile is a real pain! I look forward to an updated Photos app addressing this issue.</p>

<h2>            Dell factory image file windows 10 is corrupt and some files are missing. no recovery media</h2>
                    I purchased on line my Dell Inspiron 5551 with Windows 10 (manufactory install) laptop thru third party and received by mail in middle of July 2016. Since my first download from Microsoft Anniversary Update my laptop wasn't running like it should. The
 App store was on the blink, open app store and it would close immediately and give error, and some other minor issues. Then came Microsoft Creation or Creator update download and this update was done early giving those who already had windows 10 installed
 to download early. This was suppose to be the one, best of them all. Will I download/update from windows 10 version 1607 to 1703 and little at a time my app were not update correctly or not at all, Outlook mail was not looking like it should and giving me
 problems, office missing and during that my trail date expired. I think office and word should have a permanent spot on Windows 10 ( thinking out loud). My map was missing, photos as well, files missing. I was miserable. I called Microso

    <title>Can&#39;t connect a Garmin Bluetooth GPS receiver to Windows 10. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> spyrosspyrou  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t connect a Garmin Bluetooth GPS receiver to Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>I just bought a Garmin GLO, Bluetooth GPS receiver who claim it is compatible with Windows Vista or later. After receiving it I discover, in the tiny print, that it's not compatible with Windows 10.</p>
<p>After much research, I have discovered that there is no Bluetooth GPS receiver that is compatible with windows 10.</p>
<p>Is there a way to make it work, or is Mac so far ahead of the game that I will have change sides?&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems ridiculous to me that every time a new version of Windows is released it comes with a whole list of new bugs and set backs.</p>

<p><span>Hi </span>Spyrosspyrou<span>,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Bluetooth</span></strong><span> devices depend on the compatibility with the computer. If it keeps disconnecting or doesn’t connect at all, there may be an update/installation required on your computer to read wireless devices. To further isolate
 your concerns, we’d like to ask you a few questions:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>Which version or build of Windows device are you using? To know, press <strong>
Windows + R</strong> to open the <strong>Run</strong> window. Type <em><span style="color: rgba(83, 129, 53, 1)">winver</span>
</em>and press <strong>Enter</strong>. A new window will open showing the version and build number of your Windows device.</span></li><li><span>Is this Bluetooth device working before?</span></li><li><span>What were the recent changes made on your computer before you experienced this issue?</span></li><li><span>What troubleshooting steps have you done so far?</span></li><li><span>Can you check if the Bluetooth light on your device is blinking? (Indication that your device is ready to pair)</span></li><li><span>Have you already tried unpairing and pairing the device?</span></li><li><span>What is the exact make and model of your computer that your Bluetooth device connects with?</span></li><li><span>Have you already updated your computer’s BIOS and chipset drivers?</span></li><li><span>Have you already updated the Bluetooth driver?</span></li><li><span>Did you receive any error messages?</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>Get back to us once you provide answers to our questions.</span></p>

<p>Hi Johann.</p>
<p>Thanks for replying.</p>
<p>In answer to your questions</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. My version of Windows 10 is 1803 (OS Build 17134.165)</p>
<p>2. The Bluetooth device is brand new and works with my Mac device</p>
<p>3. No changes to my PC except for windows updates (it's a brand new PC)</p>
<p>4. Tried updating drivers for the GPS device and also extensively researched issues on the Garmin Support website.</p>
<p>5. The blue light is blinks and it pairs with my computer but does not connect.</p>
<p>6. I have paired and unpaired the device many times over.</p>
<p>7. My PC is a Microsoft Surface Book 2 which I bought about 3 weeks ago especially for use with the GPS device.</p>
<p>8. I have not yet updated the BIOS or chipset drivers</p>
<p>9. Bluetooth drivers are updated.</p>
<p>10. No error messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I checked Garmin support there were instructions on how to pair the device with windows vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8 but at the bottom, and in very small print, they state that it is not compatible with Windows 10.</p>
<p>After further researching I have not been able to find a Bluetooth GPS receiver that is compatible with Windows 10.</p>
<p>My conclusion is that Windows 10 is to blame.</p>
<p>If you can find a way to make it work then you are a genius. I pray that you are as my computer has cost me nearly £3400.</p>
<p>

<span>At this time, we recommend checking if there are any new BIOS (Basic Input / Output System) and chipset driver updates or releases from your computer manufacturer’s website. We recommend downloading and installing
 them to your computer to allow input/output devices like Bluetooth to work on your computer again.</span></p>

<p>I have updated all firmware and drivers, where possible.</p>
<p>Bluetooth GPS device still able to pair but unable to then connect.</p>
<p>After further researching I have found that this is a common issue for anyone wanting to connect any Bluetooth gps receiver to Windows 10. (Something to do with changes to Bluetooth protocol in Windows 10, but beyond my expertise to explain fully)</p>
<p>I have found one Bluetooth receiver which claims to be compatible with Windows 10. It's more expensive and not as good as the one I've bought but if all else fails I will buy one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have any more suggestions I will be only too willing to try them.</p>
<p>I'm afraid that my faith in Microsoft has been seriously deflated and I am having serious thoughts about changing to Mac.</p>
<p>PS.&nbsp; My Garmin receiver even claims to be compatible with Linux. WTF!!!??</p>

            What version of Windows XP do you have?<br />
<br />
Home Edition doesn't have Local Security Policy.&nbsp; Professional does.
