<h2>            PC starting up for no reason</h2>
                    <p>After I upgraded to Windows 10 when I put my PC on sleep it randomly starts back up again directly to the desktop, even if i have a password on it, and with the start button open for no reason and without me doing anything to it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else has this problem and how can I fix it?</p>

<p>
</p><p>You could also go to services and disables media sharing from there.<br />
<br />
Start, type in services click on services when it comes up scroll down to Windows Media Player network sharing service and disable.

Thank you for visiting the Microsoft Answers forum.<br />
<br />
It could be that the program requires administrator rights to be installed.&nbsp; Try this:<br />
Right-click the installation icon for the program, and then click Run as administrator.&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</p>
<p>If the program installs but does not run, right-click the program icon, click Properties, click the Compatibility tab, select the Run this program as an administrator check box, and then try to run the program.<br />
<br />
If that does not work, try doing a clean boot on the computer to see if some other program is interfering with the installation.&nbsp; Here's how to do a clean boot:<br />
Run Selective Startup using System Configuration<br />

If that does not work, I would suggest contacting Pinnacle support or visiting their web site to check their knowledge base for this issue.<br />

                    Free update of Windows 10 aborts mid term with error message 0xc1900200.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm running an HP Probook 430 Gen.1 previously with Windows 7 and upgraded to Windows 10 64 bits.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In general all updates do install with exception of this one which I think

<p>Hi again Jomel, Many thanks and Seasons greetings....I continue on with this question:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>This HP Probook 430 G1 was converted from 7 to 10 at least 3 years back and machine always running ok.&nbsp; &nbsp;I was checking the history of updates and could determine that latest messages also show successful other updates.&nbsp; &nbsp;For example&nbsp; "2017-12 Cumulative
 update for Windows 10 version 1607 for x64 based systems (KB4023056)"&nbsp; " successfully installed on 13/12/2017."</p>
<p>
</p><p>System seems to repeatedly try to install "Feature update to Windows 10 version 1709" which relates to the error message for quite some time and prior to this 1703 which also was not successful.&nbsp; ?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Dave,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We appreciate the update. The <em>We couldn't update the system partition </em>
error tell us that the problem caused by insufficient available space on EFI system reserved partition on your hard disk to perform the update. This system reserved partition contains necessary data in booting your computer and also needs to be updated when
 upgrading to Windows 10 1709.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The easiest way to clear the system reserved partition is by performing a clean install using an installation media created from a&nbsp;Windows 10 1709 ISO. This will create a new system reserved partition. However, it will clear all your data so make sure to
 create a backup of your files using an external drive or uploading them to OneDrive.&nbsp; For steps on how to perform a clean install, you may refer to the following link:

<p>
</p><p>Another method of resolving this issue is by resizing the system reserved partition. This involves using third-party programs that can resize the partition. When working with Windows partitions, make sure to always make a backup of your important files.

<p>Hi and thanks alot for the update.&nbsp; In the interim I contacted Microsoft support.&nbsp; &nbsp;First time round the support assistant from English speaking team triggered off the installation again of feature update windows 10 1709 but like the auto update assistant
 the process aborted mid term with the advice about the system reserved partition.&nbsp; &nbsp; I came back a second time to Microsoft support and got another assistant who performed quite a remarkable investigation with me following. I did not write down the details
 but I could see an investigation into the disk and sizing and a log file (where it appeared some boot files were eliminated?&nbsp; &nbsp;It was quite a fast and though investigative process.
</p>
<p>The allocation of system reserved partition continued with same sizing ( 100 GB )&nbsp; and the overall dis)k with 404 GB free capacity.&nbsp; &nbsp; So it seems from what I could see happening that some system related files were causing the problem.&nbsp; &nbsp; Anyway the support
 assistant reactivated the media creation and installation of the update and it proceeded perfectly until conclusion.&nbsp; &nbsp;Unfortunately the support assistant had signed off so I could not personally thank them for a great job.&nbsp; Would have been good if they had
 advised exactly what had been done so I could update this log.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Long story short.</p>
<p>My HDD crashed and didn't create a recovery disc. Couldn't locate the Windows 8 product key as it was pre-installed.</p>
<p>So I bought a new HDD and called microsoft for assistance, after MANY hours of Q&amp;A, they asked me to buy a new Key for $40.</p>
<p>This is so I can download Win8 iso file to create a bootable disc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought the key and they give me a website to download. It downloaded a Windows8-Setup app.</p>
<p>when I run the app, I entered the key, it validated correctly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it goes online to do "something", it return the above error "We Can't Connect right now. Check your internet connection and try again.".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I called microsoft again, and after many Tech gurus and many calls, they still couldn't help me.</p>
<p>One guru said he will email me a direct link, and that was 3 days ago and still have not receive the email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried multiple computers and on multiple internet networks,</p>
<p>I have tried switching off all firewalls &amp; virus scanners and yet still have this error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not rocket science but it shouldn't be trial &amp; error process either.</p>
<p>all the tech gurus are doing is read off a script and check whats next on their database.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any real gurus out there that can help? Appreciate and thanks in advance.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The key was bought from the ms contact centre. I chatted with the support team and they called me later to advise i can purchase a new key to download. I believe the key is newly generated and havent been used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try to call the ESD team tomorrow and see how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>any other help will be appreciated.</p>

<h2>            How can I veiw my pictures in albums on Surface Pro 3 with the new Windows 10 update&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I recently installed the Windows 10 update.&nbsp;I have spent lots of time organizing all of my photos into various albums. However, with&nbsp;the update, my pictures just show in order of the date which they were taken. I have tried everything to get them to go back
 into albums, but nothing works. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way I can get my photos organized again?</p>

            <p>Hi Izabel.P,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently, it is not possible to view your photos by their folder structure in the Photos app. We have heard loud feedback that users want to access their photos by folder, and we are taking that into account for future releases.</p>

<h2>            Struck with boredom. What to play&#63; What to do&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Well recently I've been struck with boredom. All the games that I have, Black Ops, Mw2, BFBC2, Halo Reach, etc all seem to have lost their strike of fun. So what do you guys recommend I do or what game to buy? Games that I like are shooters and sandbox games..which
 doesn't leave much of an option lol. Thoughts or suggestions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for reading</p>

<p>Stop playing MP games for a while. &nbsp;There are some amazing games that don't require lobbies, K/D ratios, or lag. &nbsp;Try out Oblivion, Dragon Age Origins, Dragon Age 2, Mass Effect 1 + 2, etc. &nbsp;There are plenty of games to keep you entertained while you rest
 from multiplayer. &nbsp;But if you're like me, you may never actually fully go back to MP games again. &nbsp;It has been quite a while since I've actually truly enjoyed playing against other players. &nbsp;(My recently played is satire, for the record.)</p>

<p>i would say to try and expand your horizons as well</p>
<p>you never know what you may like</p>
<p>you can always rent games if money is short</p>
<p>personally i wud suggest Alan Wake, i was never one to play strictly single player games, but the game is truly amazing personally, paid 12 bucks for it last week, and i woulda payed 60 after beatin it, i honestly feel like i ripped off Remedy (developer)
 lol, give it a shot any gamer deserves to try this game</p>

<p>Portal 2 was like a shot in the arm for me...Best Xbox experience I'd had in a loooong time. Also check the arcade, there are a few hidden gems there that people often look past; I've spent hours in Castlevania HD for example. If you're looking for a good
 time investment, FFXIII is pretty fun too! Lastly, if you haven't yet check out Left 4 Dead one and two. They're a little different than the shooters you listed.</p>

 can with 7.

<p>Slipstreaming worked when Windows Setup used a file copy method to install the software.&nbsp; Both Vista and Windows 7 use a image file so slipstreaming is not applicable, at least not in the sense it was with XP.&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead you have open the image file, edit,
 and then close the image again.&nbsp; An entirely different procedure.&nbsp; There is plenty about editing an image for deployment on TechNet.</p>
<p>There is a tool called VLite for editing hotfixes and such into a Windows 7 image but the problem is that there is a lot more to a service pack than just hotfixes and patches.&nbsp; It also does rewrites of core files that are not available in any hotfix or patch
 and can only be gotten by running the service pack installer.&nbsp; That was what autostreamer was able to do with XP service packs.</p>
<p>What we all really need is .iso files for Windows 7 with SP1.&nbsp; In other words, the images that went to manufacturing when SP1 released and will be in retail boxes shortly if not already.&nbsp; It should also be the image available for download from the Microsoft
 Store.&nbsp; TechNet and MSDN subscribers will shortly have these images as well.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 updates to old drivers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> the silent riot  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 updates to old drivers</h2>
                    <p>When I go to update my video drivers through device manager, Windows does not give me the most recent version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I get asked if I did basic procedures, let me just show you the evidence.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I go into Device Manager:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4b7ce162-2fdb-4af1-8d82-06ec2057a4a0" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>I search automatically for updates:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/42d194a5-ffd8-484f-84bc-e4b45f99e394" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows claims that my graphics driver is up to date:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e445e9a6-6c80-41b6-bb13-d4321df0c73d" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see here, this is my graphics card and driver version:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ceb04508-5a5e-4741-a3c2-0d53a2216d20" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>However, Nvidia clearly shows that I am no where near up to date:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/71639d62-d19c-4b8b-bdbc-42fc71dc1ddd" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see, Windows does not utilize the most up to date version needed for my graphics driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now you're asking, <br />
1.) Well why don't you just update using the standalone updater by Nvidia?</p>
<p>or<br />
2.) Why not download the graphics driver and have Windows install them from a folder?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I do either of the aforementioned methods my computer will not properly sleep or go into hibernation. &nbsp;When I attempt to come out of hibernation my graphics driver will fail and the computer is forced to restart before the screen can turn on. &nbsp;I have
 already brought this problem up <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-other_settings/screen-will-not-turn-back-on-or-remains-black/b94c23a1-99bd-46db-b16d-535aaa641b5a">
here</a>, but nothing was done about it.</p>
<p>The only way to update my graphics driver without sleep/hibernation problems is to use device manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked with Nvidia, they tried to help me, but ultimately said that this is a problem with Windows updater.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted my computer manufacturer, and even drove to their warehouse, they also confirmed that this is an issue with Windows updater.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, why doesn't Windows update to the newest Nvidia drivers?<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't say for sure about the current status, but especially concerning the issue of Graphics Drivers... Some of the ones that are provided by Microsoft are modified, and are not the same as the ones directly from the manufacturer....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Especially when it concerns the WDDM driver...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows was offering WDDM 1.3 and WDDM 2.0 through Windows Update before they were available through the manufacturer... In some cases they were of a newer number, and in some cases not..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Update only provides drivers that have been tested and approved for use in Win 10... in this case anyway...&nbsp; Drivers from the manufacturer may or may not function better...</p>
<p>
</p><p>To a certain degree, this applies to all Device Drivers through Windows Update...</p>

<h2>            Turned laptop off during system restore, now getting messages &#58; &#34;Explorer.EXE - Unable to locate component&#34; and &#34;dwwin.exe  - Unable to locate component&#34;</h2>
                    <p><u>Original Title : Turned laptop off during system restore. HELP.</u></p>
<p>I had problems with my laptop since I accidentally installed Babylon. It was blocking Google and affecting Microsoft Outlook. System Recover was also turned off by Babylon (I think), all recovery points before Sept 15 were gone. I ran System Recover a few
 times and the problems went away temporarily.&nbsp; The last time I ran System Restore it seemed to freeze and after a while I turned my computer off. Stupid, I know. Now it won't start. I'm very wary of using repair discs because I don't want to lose my files,
 especially my e-mails. Can anyone help? I'm desperate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The messages I'm getting areExplorer.EXE - Unable to locate component.</p>
<p>This application has failed to start because WININET.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>dwwin.exe&nbsp; - Unable to locate component.</p>
<p>This application has failed to start because URLMON.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem.

            I don't want to get your hopes up too much since you may be missing more than that one file, but if just wininet.dll is missing (or maybe one or two more files), there should be copies in other places on your system and you might be able to replace it/them.<br />
<br />
Start with easy stuff first:<br />
<br />
If you press Ctrl-Alt-Del you should be able to get into Task Manager.<br />
<br />
From TM, you can click File, New Task and in the Open box enter:<br />
<br />
<b>%SystemRoot%\system32\restore\rstrui.exe</b><br />
<br />
Click OK and the System Restore Dialogue box should open and you can see if you can get a Restore Point to work and restore your system back to a date prior to the incident.<br />
<br />
You can also use TM to see if you can copy in a replacement for your missing wininet.dll file.<br />
<br />
We know XP keeps backup copies of important file here (assuming XP is installed on your C drive):<br />
<br />
<b>c:\windows\system32\dllcache</b><br />
<br />
If you installed Service Pack 3 from a download, there should also be copies of most "good" files here:<br />
<br />
<b>c:\windows\ServicePackFiles\i386</b><br />
<br />
So from TM, click File, hold down the Ctrl key, click New Task and a Command Prompt Window should open.<br />
<br />
From the Command Prompt window enter this command (assuming XP is installed on your C drive):<br />
<br />
<b>copy c:\windows\system32\dllcache\wininet.dll&nbsp;&nbsp; c:\windows\system32</b><br />
<br />
or:<br />
<br />
<b>copy c:\windows\ServicePackFiles\i386\wininet.dll&nbsp;&nbsp; c:\windows\system32</b><br />
<br />
Hopefully, one of those will result in a One File(s) copied message.&nbsp; Respond in the affirmative if asked to overwrite an existing file.<br />
<br />
Enter 'exit' to close the Command Prompt window and from TM, click Shutdown, Restart and see how things look then.<br />
<br />
If other files are missing, make a note of them and repeat the copy process from TM and see if you can replace any missing files XP complains about during startup.<br />
<br />
If for some reason the copy commands fail or if the backup copies of the files are missing, we can look at another plan but try the easy stuff first.<br />

            <p>OK so &nbsp;there is no GB or European files still available, the GB one defaults to sunset deluxe every time; which runs fine on 10 but wont accept UK data files. it handles and recognises UK sterling just fine</p>

<p>
</p><p>So here is what i am going to do.</p>
<p>i shall install an old copy of Money 2005 on to my old works computer which is still on windows 7. then i shall restore my back up. once restored i shall export them to my flash drive as loose qif then import the loose qif to my home lap top.</p>

            <p>Well, that was a right faff but it has worked a treat. i am now fully up and running as normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>one thing I found is, it is important to put your checking/ current accounts in first or when you restore your credit cards it duplicates all the entries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so just to recap. I have installed Money Sunset deluxe on a UK based Lap top, then hit windows update. I have then used another computer running windows seven, loaded my money files to it and exported all my files one at a time as loose QIF files on to a
 flash drive. I have then imported those same QIF files to my lap top, re-adjusted the settings and &nbsp;re in-putted all my auto bills and deposits manually.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, all sorted done and dusted YAY!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps any fellow UK money users who like myself was mourning the demise of Microsoft Money after installing Windows 10.</p>

            <p>It sounds like you could have a virus or other malware. Get your antivirus program up to date and boot into
<u>Safe Mode</u>. Note that some viruses can hide themselves from your antivirus program in normal mode, so you really need to scan in
<u>Safe Mode</u>. To get into Safe Mode when you first power up, hit F8 about once a second until you get the menu and select Safe Mode. Then run a full system scan.</p>

<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-performance/windows-explorer-has-stopped-working/6ab02526-5071-4dcc-895f-d90202bad8b3"><u>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-performance/windows-explorer-has-stopped-working/6ab02526-5071-4dcc-895f-d90202bad8b3</u></a></p>
<p>If that fixes it, fine. If not, use System Restore to go back to a date prior to the beginning of the problem. To run System Restore, click Start -&gt; Programs -&gt; Accessories -&gt; System Tools -&gt; System Restore. Click the box that says
<i>Show more restore points</i>. </p>
<p>You can check for corrupted system files. Open an administrator command prompt and run SFC if the above doesn't help. Click START, then type
<u>sfc </u>in the search box, right-click SFC.EXE and click <i>Run as administrator</i>. Then from the command prompt type
<u>sfc /scannow</u><i>.</i></p>
<p>Finally if all else fails, you can check the rather cryptic system event log. To do so click Start -&gt; Control Panel -&gt; Administrative Tools -&gt; Event Viewer. Once in Event Viewer click on the system log and scroll through the entries looking for those flagged
 "error" to see if you can find hints as to where the problem could be.</p>
<p>I hope this helps. Good luck.</p>

A toolbar is a feature of a particular program. If you can't tell us what program you are talking about, nobody will know what toolbar you are talking about, and we can't help you. Your question is like asking "how can I get a hubcap for my car" and not telling
 us what is the brand, model, and year of the car you're talking about.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That said, let me add the following: most of us don't need such a toolbar, because of the Windows keyboard standard--Ctrl-C is copy, Ctrl-X is cut, and Ctrl-V is paste. The keyboard shortcuts are very easy to remember, are very easy to use, and work in most
 (but not all) programs.</p>

            <p>Hi edtarno,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's say you want to cut, copy, or paste something.&nbsp; What are you doing when you want to do that?&nbsp; I mean, what are you trying to cut, copy or paste?&nbsp; Is it text, pictures, or what?&nbsp; What did you open or click on to get to the place where you want to cut,
 copy, or paste?&nbsp;&nbsp; What's on the screen in front of you?&nbsp; At the bottom, there are some rectangular boxes in what is called a taskbar.&nbsp; Each box has a name in it.&nbsp; What names are there?&nbsp; Which one looks like it's a little bit indented from the others?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That should help us figure out which program you're talking about.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Cant start Safe Mode when 10 won&#39;t start&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shaela  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cant start Safe Mode when 10 won&#39;t start&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I had Windows 7 and came back from holidays to Windows 10.<br />
</p>
<p>When W10 starts and loads the desktop, it redraws the screen repeatedly again over and over.
<br />
<br />
Press CTRL-Alt-Del to seek and terminate any odd Processes but can't get the window to stay open beyond the redraw of the screen. I can't get the Settings window to stay open more than 2 seconds or any other program for that matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other ideas, other than F4 at login? I have read the many solutions to access Safe Mode, but they all require Windows 10 to be started, which really makes no sense since if it starts and hangs at the desktop, what good is Safe Mode then?</p>
<p>
</p><p>All solutions I read need Windows 10 to running. I remember the good old days when Safe Mode could be started without a dysfunctional O/S so we could troubleshoot a crashed O/S.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks to all who give their free time to help us.</p>

<p><strong>To get into safe mode when you cannot start Windows:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Start PC, just as Windows attempts to load, press and hold Power Button to perform a hard shut down</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Do this twice</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>To get into Safe Mode if you can Start Windows, Press Shift Key whilst clicking Restart</strong></p>

                    <p>i just purchased a new Lenovo laptop with win 10 preinstalled. I am working in china, so the system is set up in Chinese.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have downloaded the English language packs and have selected English as the default display&nbsp;language, but Chinese still displays "windows display language". the packs are fully downloaded, and I have restarted several times.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. I regret the inconvenience caused to you. Let me help you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can't burn music from the Groove Music service. This is copy protected. You cannot burn any songs from any of the streaming music services.
 You can burn MP3 and MP4 files you own to a CD. And also the Groove music app does not support burning to a CD. I suggest you to use Windows Media player for the same.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For using the groove app in a different system, I suggest you to go through the below article
</span><strong><span>How to use Groove on multiple computers
</span></strong><span>and check if it helps.</span></p>

<p><span>Hi Kyle,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The error message that you’ve encountered when installing <strong>NTVDM.EXE</strong> can be caused by a software conflict or there are broken system files. Let’s resolve your concern using the following methods:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 1:</strong> Install the latest build for Windows 10. Updates, usually provide fixes for some issues that you may experience on your computer. To check if you have the latest build, please click this
<em><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4018124" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Windows 10 update history">article</a></strong></em>. You’ll also see there the instructions on how to install the updates.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 2:</strong> Temporarily disable third-party antivirus software, if you have it installed on your device. This will ensure that it will not affect or cause issues when you install the application.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 3:</strong> Enable the feature under <strong>clean boot</strong> state. It will help us determine if there are third-party software that may cause conflict during the installation of the Windows feature (NTVDM.EXE). To perform clean
 boot in Windows, follow the steps provided&nbsp;<em><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="How to perform a clean boot in Windows">here</a></strong></em>.
 Once you're in the basic state, try to enable or install the application and check the result.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span><span><em><strong>Note:</strong></em><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><em><span><span>If the installation is successful and the issue has been resolved. Please go through the section “<strong>How to reset the computer to start as
 usual</strong>” to reset your computer to the normal startup.</span></span></em><span>
</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue still persists, try to run the <strong>System File Checker</strong> and the
<strong>DISM</strong> tools. It will help fix and restore corrupted system files. Check this
<em><strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93">Forum Article</a></strong></em> for the steps on how to run these tools.</span></p>

<h2>            Walmart pre-orders beginning to ship</h2>
                    
<p>I ordered a standard edition bundle and have been checking the order status just about every day. I noticed today that the option to CANCEL the order has disappeared from the order status page. Does this mean Walmart has begun the process of preparing their
 units for delivery? Hopefully so!</p>

<p>I dunno, I wouldn't get too excited, walmart has terrible customer service most of the time, I have a day one edition preordered there and it says my delivery date is 12/02 to 12/04. If they were doing the right thing they would ship them out early like
 everybody else. I'm not saying they won't but I'm not getting my hopes up that they will. Either way I sure do hope you're right as I want to be playing mine on day one!</p>

<p>It most likely means they have processed the order already and are preparing to ship it. They could hold it until Wed/Thurs though, even if they send you a tracking number soon. I ordered mine directly from MS and received an email Sunday with a tracking
 number for UPS. According to UPS, &nbsp;it will be delivered Tuesday 19th with Next Air Shipping. Who knows...</p>

<br />
Another possibility is that the cables are loose. Remove ALL power, then check cables in both<br />
ends. Remove and replace, do not just snug. For laptops you can often clean the power and<br />
<br />
Some DVD&nbsp;drives do not use the Windows default drivers so check with the System maker and<br />
device maker to see if there is firmware or drivers for you drive if needed.<br />
<br />
===============================<br />
<br />
Stage 2 : You could have drive issues as the CD/DVD is actually 4 drives in 1 case ( CD &amp; DVD<br />
burn and CD and DVD read). So it is not unusual for 1 or 2 parts to not function while the others<br />
do so properly. <br />
<br />
Did you complete the troubleshooter for the drive that still does not work? There are some<br />
registry entries that the troubleshooter does not fix and those "might" be the cause.<br />
<br />
Check with your System Maker and Device maker for both possible <strong>firmware updates</strong> and<br />
the correct Registry entries for your drive. <br />
<br />
These are the keys I think are the ones in question&nbsp;- for the CD/DVD drive sub-keys of course<br />
as there will other sub-keys in these keys. Be sure to ask for specific keys involved as well as<br />
the settings.<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Hardware Profiles\0001\System\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
You probably can find more info here and maybe even the exact registry settings for your CD/DVD<br />
drive from someone with the same model.<br />

<p>Use DevManView to locate CD/DVD in registry (be careful and make a Restore Point before<br />
changing anything) - find the device in&nbsp;DevManView&nbsp;and then Right Click on it Open in RegEdit.</p>
<p>DevManView - Free - an alternative to the standard Device Manager of Windows, which displays all<br />
devices and their properties in flat table, instead of tree viewer<br />

<p>ok so i just brought end game exspantion for battlefield 3 and it starts to download, the file size it states its gin to be is 1.73gb, so im like ok kool not that long, WRONG!</p>

<p>Remember, Xbox is an 8 year old system..........Download times may vary..... &nbsp;assume 1 gig is 1 hour..... &nbsp;Your running through any other device besides a DIRECT connection will be slower. &nbsp;Running the program to track your speed slows you down for example...
 &nbsp; Just wait till it's done. &nbsp;GOOD LUCK!!!!</p>

<p>bullet=WRONG</p>
<p>bong=WRONG</p>
<p>as i have explained im runing at 7mb per second, i know the speed im getting lol my laptop is the middle man between my hub and xbox that is how im monitering it .</p>
<p>to Bongkaos (HARDWARE) im using is not slowing me down in any way, </p>
<p>to Bullets no other equiptment is running on my internet, i have full control over my hub, all settings are in order i am not a novice user.</p>
<p>there isnt really a problem as such here, what im having trouble UNDERSTANDING is why the download size is larger then stated on its details, not why its downoading slow&lt; because its not., it should be 1.73gb but in reality its more around 12gb</p>

<p>The expansion pack is 1.7GB, it is definitely not 12GB, there are no Battlefield 3 downloads of that size on Xbox LIVE.<br />
<br />
The users who replied to this thread&nbsp;(including myself)&nbsp;are not official support agents, we are just users like you.&nbsp; With all due respect, we do not know what your technical understanding is, we can only work with the information you have given.<br />
<br />
We also do not know what your actual connection speed is.&nbsp; You have stated that you are downloading at 7mb/s, is that 7 Megabits per second, or 7 Megabytes per second?&nbsp; I'm sure you know, there is a bit of difference between the two.&nbsp; We also do not know what
 monitoring software is on your PC.<br />
<br />
Can you provide us with some more information?&nbsp; What speed do you get from your ISP for example?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</p>

<p>OBSESSIVE POWER: &nbsp;ok well just to say i have provided you with the information u need lol if u read the post you will see by the maths that i say "im downloading at 7mb per sec so by doing the maths you will know it should be finished within 5 minutes" 7x60x5=
 2100mb, which is more then enough for the 1.73gb download, MEGABITS would take farrrr longer wouldnt u say? so i do beleave you have the information needed =).</p>
<p>isp connection is maxed at 7MEGABYTES per second that is what im getting, im using the windows resource monitoring to view the speeds along with 1 other that cannot be named for legal reasons. hope that helps.</p>
<p>maybe in the next post i will record a video for you guys to have a look for yourselfs</p>

            <p>Hey there Pie! Have you let the download run to completion? If not, go to System, Settings, Storage, and mark down the storage space remaining. Then, download the expansion pack. When it finishes, go to System, Settings, Storage again and mark down the storage space remaining. The difference will let us know how big the expansion pack was.<br /><br />Let us know!</p>

<p>Hello good sir!!!! &nbsp;I apologize for suggesting a possible solution. &nbsp;I wish you Good Luck and lots of Happy Gaming. &nbsp; Again, IMHO &nbsp;your DL speeds may vary ...... As you know, MANY factors decide your accual DL/UL speeds. &nbsp; &nbsp;I hope you are able to play the
 content purchased.!.! &nbsp; &nbsp;The purchase only states the file size, &nbsp;not a DL speed...... &nbsp;Your original question was why it takes so long to download. &nbsp;With your "math" it seems more like a 12mb DL instead of a &nbsp;1.73mb download.....As Official Support suggested
 Please Verify The accual size of the content downloaded.... &nbsp;Please let us know how it goes!!!</p>

<p>I don't know in the first place how the credits come on the nl account. I added the xbox codes on the website instead of on my console and now the credits or on a nl account .
