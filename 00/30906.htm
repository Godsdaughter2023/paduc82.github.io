<p>Seriously we all have been waiting for this update for a long time now and the only info we get is that Microsoft is testing it? What they are building everything they want to build and then are gonna say "Okay i think we are good to release". Seriously
 if it is not out by Friday im gonna be super pissed off. I don't even think Microsoft is testing anything my friends and i think they are just holding it because this update has the most hype right now and not a lot of people have there eyes set on other games
 but this update. If this is true wow it just proves that Microsoft only care about freaking money and not there Customers/Supporters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sorry i had to get this out, I/we have been patient enough now it is time for this update to come out ASAP!!!</p>

<p>lol idk maybe they are taking so long because the want to bundle release with &nbsp;texture packs as well, well i can dream any ways &nbsp;but we are all a little anxious however the ability to flip from creative to survival is kind of a bummer but will be useful
 way to go about creating survival islands adventure maps ect. also flat maps 3 blocks of dirt down to bedrock have you seen the live stream they did? its painful to watch seeing as they picked the worst person in the world to demo it lol &nbsp;check it out here

<h2>            local account to microsoft account not working on Windows 8</h2>
                    Hi There,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 8, I originally setup my account as a local account only, but have since wished to make it a Microsoft Account.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a Microsoft account already, which I can log into with no problems. However, when I click the button that says to switch the user to a Microsoft Account, I go through the motions and when it comes to the final screen it says error 0xd0070005.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Does anyone have any suggestions on how I can get this to work?</div>
                </div>

<p><span>Please follow the below steps:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span>
 Move the mouse cursor to the upper or lower right corner of the screen to see the charms bar. If you are running Windows 8 on touch-screen device, swipe from the right edge of the screen to see the charms bar.</span></p>

 Lastly, enter your birth date, select gender, type the characters shown, and then click or tap Next button.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 8:</span></strong><span>
 In the last screen, you will see an option to turn on Family Safety feature for the new account. Enable “Is this is a child’s account? Turn of Family Safety to get reports of their PC use” option if the account is going to be used by a child. Click or tap

<p><b><span>Method 4:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Copy all the files from my existing
</span><span>account to the new one to save my configuration profiles from apps and games.
</span><span>Then go to the store and install the applications which were already installed in the other account to the new one. When everything is working you can delete or save the old account.</span></p>
<p><span>Give this a go; I’m confident you will find what you need here. But if you face any further issue please reply back

    <title>Windows Mail App uses wrong sender name in messages I send - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kari finn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Mail App uses wrong sender name in messages I send</h2>
                    An interesting and very annoying issue.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Background:&nbsp;</div>
<div>I have a few Microsoft Accounts (live.com, msn.com &amp; outlook.com). One account is to be used in various online forums I participate, for instance here, the profile (sender) name is set to a "pen name" I am known on these forums, for security reasons as
 in not to reveal my real name when sending mail from this address. All other accounts are set up using my real name as profile (sender) name.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When setting up this account in question I used this "pen name" of mine I have been used to use, the first name being my real name and the last name the nickname I'm known = Kari Finn (see screenshot:&nbsp;<a href="http://sdrv.ms/17lGXBu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://sdrv.ms/17lGXBu</a>).
 I have absolutely not used my real name in anything connected to this Microsoft Account. I want to be sure my forums identity does not reveal my real name.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Issue:</div>
<div>Sending mail from this "forums email address", the receiver can see the sender being Kari Finn
<b><i><u>if</u></i></b> I send the message from the Microsoft Account's web interface or a mail client, for instance Outlook 2013. However, if I send a message from this account using Windows Mail App, the sender name shown is my real name. The screenshot shows
 inbox of my ISPs email account where I sent the same message from this email account in question; the first one was sent from Windows Mail App and shows my real name as sender (blurred except the first letter), the second one was sent from Outlook 2013 and
 shows the sender name as it is supposed to show:&nbsp;<a href="http://sdrv.ms/1ax491G" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://sdrv.ms/1ax491G</a></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Notice that I have never used my real name in connection with this "forums" email account; from beginning I have told the system the name of the profile and sender should be Kari Finn. It is very strange how this account has "revealed" my real name, only
 thing I can think of is that as I have all my Microsoft Accounts set up on Mail app and all other accounts are using my real name, this one account has somehow messed the settings with these other accounts. But that sounds unreal?</div>

<div>Any ideas?</div>

            It looks like you have completely misunderstood my question.
<div><br />
<div>I am not talking about username (email address). I am talking about your name as it appears on messages you send, not about how your email address is shown to mail receivers.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This, the sender name, can freely be changed in outlook.com. I have never changed it, from the creation of the account it has been correct, the name I use on these forums. But somehow Windows Mail App messes with settings with my other email accounts and
 uses a wrong name.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>My question is about behavior of the Windows 8 Mail App, asked here at Microsoft Community in Windows 8 &gt; Email and Communication &gt; Mail App section<font color="#68217a">.&nbsp;</font>I do not know what would be a more suitable place to ask this.</div>
<br />
Although my email service provider is also Microsoft, this is not a service provider issue.

            Bumping this, the issue is driving me crazy.
<div><br />
<div>Windows 8.1 Mail App sends messages using a sender name which is not the name set as sender on Outlook.com Account Settings.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Example:</div>
<div><b>Paddy O'Neal</b> sets up an email account <b>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</b>. On
<b>Outlook.com Account Settings</b> he gives his name as <b>First name: Paddy</b>,
<b>Last name: TheIrishman</b>, as he does not want his real last name to be shown on messages he sends.</div>
<div><br />
<div>However, every email he sends using Windows 8.1 Mail App shows the sender name as
<b>Paddy O'Neal</b> instead of <b>Paddy TheIrishman</b> as it should be.<br />
<br />
When the receiver opens the mail message from Paddy, the header looks like this:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Wed 06/11/2013 16:12<br />
From: Paddy <b>O'Nea</b>l &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;</div>
<div>RE: Your Proposal</div>
<div><br />
<div>But it should look like this:<br />
<br />
<div>
<div>Wed 06/11/2013 16:12<br />
From: Paddy&nbsp;<b>TheIrishman</b>&nbsp;&lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;</div>
<div>RE: Your Proposal</div>
<div><br />

<p>That sounds odd.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A good try would be to isolate the accounts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remove additional accounts listed in mail app. Then send mail from the account to see if it displays the right name.</p>

<p>
</p><p>My solution. &nbsp;I searched for the wrong name in my &nbsp;contacts and deleted. I was interested to find out that it was attached to my name in my Messenger profile as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I deleted the offending name, I closed out of outlook. &nbsp;When I logged in again and sent my mail, my correct profile name appeared.</p>

            I realize that this posting is now 2 months old, but I am inquiring if there was a solution. I have a client that is dealing with the same issue. Did you get this resolved, and if so, what were the steps? SherylCamp's solution did not resolve the issue,
 because my client has neither Messenger, nor Outlook installed.

            Extremely frustrating issue and one that needs to be addressed asap. My partner has saved my contact details in his Windows 8 phone's contacts list using his nickname&nbsp;for me, which is totally private. I recently opened an Outlook account under my own correct,
 full name. Since then, my Gmail account, used through the Windows Mail app on my Windows 8.1 device, has been sending emails under the name that my partner uses as my nickname, which should be private. This is completely unacceptable and a serious breach of
 privacy as far as I'm concerned. At NO point did I EVER register with ANY account under that name.

            <p>This issues has popped up for me now as well, and is super frustrating.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what's happening.&nbsp; I have an automated email that's sent from our internal systems "from" my email address.&nbsp; The "from name" associated with that outbound email is "Form Notifications" (rather than my actual name).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However the mail app has now started displaying my name as "Form Notifications" in emails, rather than my actual name.&nbsp; Somehow the mail app has picked up the association of "Form Notifications" with my email address and assumes that's the name to use.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Similarly, I've got the same issue with LinkedIn.&nbsp; Whenever I get a connection request from LinkedIn (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***), it shows the name as "Allison Williams", who was the first connection request I received
 from LinkedIn on this new computer.&nbsp; Now any connection request I get from LinkedIn comes across as being a message from Allison Williams.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's maddening.&nbsp; </p>

<h2>            Players pretending to be microsoft employee&#38;&#35;39&#59;s resulting in youtube harrassment and damage to property.</h2>
                    
<p>Hello so I have what I consider to be a serious problem and I hope that not just does the community see this but ACTUALL microsoft employee's as this is by far unacceptable behavior. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So here's the story.. I have several friends in real life on xbox live, they invite me to a party, and they inform me of something outrageous.. So my friend who is like a brother to me tells me his little brothers friend just got the worst, lowest of
 low, trolling possible.. the child I am referring to is 10 yrs old.. &nbsp;So anyway this guy apparently joins his party and tells the poor kid that he is an xbox live employee, and that the kid is using an illegal copy of halo 4, and that his copy is also damaging
 his xbox.. He tells him he will need to speak with an adult for the kid to avoid the risk of permanent console ban. &nbsp;The boy gets his mother on.. he informs her that he is microsoft employee and that if they continue using that copy of halo 4 that her son
 will never be allowed to play on xbox live again. &nbsp;She has never played xbox before and really has no idea whats going on, especially because myself as well as a few friends took her son to the release of halo 4 and waited till late at night to get our copies...
 The troll tells her that everything will be alright as long as they break the copy of halo 4 for him to see and that he will compensate them a gift code to purchase a new copy on the xbox live marketplace.. Now I realize not many normal xbox live players would
 fall for this but let me adress this, the kid hasn't even had xbox live 3 months yet, has never encountered a troll before, and his mother knows less about xbox than he does... So he tells his mother to hold the disc &nbsp;up to the kinect and then to break it
 so that he can see its no longer usable.. So she does :( &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;This kid then tells her he is not a microsoft employee and begins insulting her telling her how stupid she is and that he recorded the entire thing and put it on youtube, she then contacts my freind I mentioned earlier and he contacts me, thats where
 I come in.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The boys mother tells us everything that happened, lets us know she has not only contacted the police but, contacted xbox live as well and apparently she was told they could not do anything about it because she did not know the players gamertag.. well
 we helped her poke around and found it.. His gamertag is DaaWarrior, &nbsp;So my friend and I invite him to our party for a little chat.. he gets on and claims he knows nothing about it, then saposedly his mother gets on.. she speaks to us calmly and sincerely,
 apologizing for her sons behavior and states that she would like for his mother to join the party so she can have her son apologize for what he did and she could possibly replace the broken disc. &nbsp;Now my friend and I are both over the age of 20 and are not
 easily fooled but she sounded very sincere and upset with her son, so we told her to wait a minute while we got the boy's mother. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;His mother gets on, and the lady who was saposedly the trolls mother completely changes charecter.... She starts insulting the boys mom telling her how stupid she is and that she is inbred and starts going on about how she is sooo poor and cannot afford
 another copy, WE WERE OUTRAGED! This was unacceptable the poor lady had already been harassed and now is getting it again, because we fell for the kids games thinking it was really his mother.... He then tells us how great this is and that he has everything,
 including what was happening now, all on youtube.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;So we kick him from the party and he begins spamming me invites, spamming friend requests, and another profile jumps in as well and starts spamming me The Ghost Wolfe. &nbsp;I get messages from this second profile stating that he is an xbox live moderator
 and is here to adress the issue. Then the original troll sends me messages stating "why did you sick an xbox live moderator on me" So in other words this kid after having someone pretend to be his mother, is now having someone pretend to be a microsoft moderator
 out to get him because of us... I get another message from the second troll telling me if I dont respond he will ban me... Obviously I know better.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;So I go online to try to find the youtube video to bring here as further evidence but I could not find it, it may not be up yet.... If I find it I will be sure to provide that as ONLY to an actually microsoft moderator as I dont want anyone else harrassing
 the poor boy and his mother any further! &nbsp; I thought I might add that in my search to find the youtube video I came across ALOT of other videos of players on xbox live, pretending to be microsoft agents, and harrassing children and more specifically their
 parents.. All &nbsp;you have to do to find these is google "kids parents harassed on xbox live" you will literally find hundreds of cases just like this that I personally believe in every event the troll deserve a perma ban!</p>
<p>The trolls names were:</p>
<p>DaaWarrior</p>
<p>The Ghost Wolfe</p>
<p>I also saved the messages that I recieved from them all though although they do not contain everything I have mentioned. THIS MUST be dealt with! I expect xbox live to take action against the troll's and to further investigate the videos I mentioned! &nbsp;The
 mother has already contacted the police witch I'm sure did her no good but, I know she as well as ALL of my friends and I will continue contacting whoever possible untill this ludacris situation is dealt with in a matter that satisfies the victims here!</p>

<p>Don´t name Gamertags here no matter what. </p>
<p>It´s you problem, you stepped in. </p>
<p>Learn the rules of Xbox Live. </p>
<p>YES it is not allow to pretend to be a Microsoft employee. </p>
<p>BUT Xbox Live Team Members do NEVER contact you over Xbox Live, they will write you officially e mails or call you.
</p>
<p>It is the kids and mothers problem when they do those things. </p>
<p>They also would NEVER ask you to break the disc. </p>
<p>If they want, they ask you to send it in but thats about it. </p>
<p>How can you be so foolish to do all that? </p>
<p>Those people are everywhere in the internet who pretend to be someone else. </p>
<p>Kids parents should know better and take better care. </p>
<p>That´s what I think. Xbox Live is not a babysitter.</p>

<p>[/quote]If you called support then they told you wrong.&nbsp; They almost always say to post this kind of info on the forums, but the XBL PET does NOT read this forum.&nbsp; I really wish MS would inform their employees what the correct action to do in this scenario.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
You need to block communications with this person, and file a complaint.&nbsp; If other people are being spammed with crap from this user, then they need to the same.&nbsp; MS will investigate and if the person in question is impersonating MS employees, they will find
 themselves permanently banned.</p>

<p>That isn't actually a movie file. The .mswmm file is a *project* file. It only contains the instructions on how to assemble your movie but it doesn't have any media within it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless you still have all the original media files (photos, videos, music), the project file is quite useless. It's like having a recipe but no ingredients.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to try opening the project file, download <a href="https://goo.gl/B1eRC" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Movie Maker 6.0</a>. It understands the contents of a project file. However, if you notice that your clips are all showing with Red Xs, that means it can't find any of the source media files.</p>

    <title>Microsoft store movie rentals downloaded to PC, not playing 5.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> darkonus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft store movie rentals downloaded to PC, not playing 5.1 surround sound</h2>
                    <p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/961ecf75-34a7-43aa-9208-4a6aba8e556e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/961ecf75-34a7-43aa-9208-4a6aba8e556e" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The only audio option settings I seemed to find for the Movies &amp; TV app were in the player while a movie is playing.&nbsp; Doesn't seem to be any other way to select between different audio settings like stereo or 5.1 surround. But why are the only audio options
 all (both in the above case) just showing "untitled" in the Windows 10 Movie &amp; TV app while playing rented store movies anyway?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've rented quite a few HD movies from the store the other day, and all showed as having Dolby 5.1 audio, such as Ex Machina, Pixels, Jurassic World! The above screen shot is while Ex Machina was playing in the app, but other supposed 5.1 audio movies had
 shown the same two confusing "untitled" audio options. Though one option does seem to increase the loudness of the stereo sound coming out the front two speakers, it doesn't matter which of the two options I select, the movies still play in simple stereo out
 the front two speakers, and never in 5.1 surround sound. </p>
<p>
</p><p>All the movies have been downloaded in full to my PC for play.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have my PC connected to my Sony receiver via the analog multi-in, which accepts my PC ASUS M5A97 motherboard's Realtek rear audio output through 3 TRS dual channel audio connectors. When 5.1 audio is selected from the Realtek audio manager, those plugs
 output front right/left speakers on one wire, rear left/right speakers on a second wire, and center/sub speakers on the third.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My 5.1 audio works perfectly hooked up this way within the Realtek's audio manager during testing, and my Sony receiver correctly plays the 5.1 test signals. The Windows 10 Netflix app also plays 5.1 surround sound to the receiver on movies listed with it,
 as well as the Leawo Blu-ray software player I have installed plays my Blu-ray DVDs with perfect 5.1 surround sound working too. Not any issues with all the other software playing 5.1 audio, therefore I see no reason why I would even want to accept and try
 the typical suggested fix, such as uninstall/re-install audio drivers. as a trouble shooting step either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems there is still something wrong going on with the Movies &amp; TV app itself and the mp4 movie files for it to be listing multiple audio options as simply "untitled" in the player. Kind of extremely disappointing to rent great movies such as Jurassic World,
 and not get the full effect being able to hear the surround sound working!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So has any issue been recognized and acknowledged by Microsoft with their Movies &amp; TV app player and PC 5.1 surround sound, and is there a fix now or in the works?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I can't get 5.1 surround on movies, I'm certainly not going to waste money renting from the Microsoft store, I'd rather wait until the movie is on Netflix or just rent a RedBox Blu-ray so I can actually hear the movie in 5.1 surround sound like they were
 meant to be heard and enjoyed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

            <p>OK, so I tried another rental download movie, Pixels, and no 5.1 surround sound on it either.
</p>
<p>After the rental expired I rented it again, only this time I chose the streaming option rather than downloading the movie to my PC. Well, when the same HD Pixel movie is played via streaming, 5.1 surround sound works perfectly!</p>

            <p>I can confirm this same behavior for Movies &amp; TV using both a Surface Pro 3 and a Surface Pro 4.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5.1 works fine when tested in the control panel sound configuration for my Marantz receiver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I stream from either of the Surface versions, the 5.1 works great, but on any downloaded movie I only get stereo output.</p>

            <p>I contacted support by phone and Microsoft refused to say they had any issues with their software or rented movie files from their store, again trying to "urge" me to reinstall my audio drivers! They did manage to coax me into renaming an entire folder which
 held what I suspected to be some of the DRM movie files information, which only managed to change the status of all my movies to Expired so I couldn't try playing them at all.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was eventually told that if movies were actually purchased and downloaded, 5.1 surround audio would definitely play correctly! Huh, what?!?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I didn't try playing all 7 movies that showed as having 5.1 surround sound which I had downloaded, only tried playing 3 of them, but none of the 3 worked properly so I did assume that the other 4 movies would also play in regular stereo sound as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If available movie rentals from the Microsoft store show they have 5.1 surround sound audio, and are allowed to be downloaded for offline viewing, but then won't play in Microsoft's Movies &amp; TV app in the listed 5.1 surround sound audio which was advertised,
 then that sure seems like unlawful false advertising by Microsoft, especially if they aren't going to warn customers of the possibility even after receiving multiple complaints about the issue!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft reps should personally be responding to each one of these reported issues immediately on these forums, and then either fix the issue with the files or app, or at least start listing under the rental information that 5.1 surround sound will not
 work when movie files are rented and downloaded for offline viewing!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Luckily I rented all 7 movies when they had the special .10 deal going on, Microsoft should refund me my .70 anyway for the hassle of wasting an hour of my time on the phone with support, which did absolutely nothing, and then having to re-rent every movie
 so I could stream them perfectly with 5.1 surround sound audio!</p>

Went through the installation process....and the program opened an auto-run patch window.&nbsp; Received an error message "Download Server Not Responding".&nbsp; Clicked on the "support" button in the patch window, it took me to 2K games support site for this issue:<br />
<br />
http://www.2kgames.com/bioshock/support/<br />
<br />
I found no support. IE was set as default browser prior to download.&nbsp; Avoided firewall during installation.&nbsp; I can't figure this out, and I kinda want to play my new (to me) game!<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>BioShock is a video game developed by 2K Boston (now known as Irrational Games). I would suggest you to follow the steps mentioned below;</p>
<p>Download Server Not Responding, error indicates that the BioShock installation has encountered a problem connecting to the internet when attempting to contact the download server.
 As stated in minimum requirements a internet connection is required so ensure that your mode/router is connected and working.</p>
<p><b>Method 1</b>:</p>

<h3> cf1234  say:</h3>
<h2>            I Am Unable to Safely Remove My USB External Hard Drive From My Laptop</h2>
                    <p>Whenever I try to safely remove my external USB hard drive from my laptop I am unable to do so.<br />
<br />
Note: The external hard drive has recently been formatted, and is only used for storage. So, only has documents, music, and videos - not programs etc.<br />
<br />
Also, I am aware that I can remove the external hard drive if I shut down my laptop, but this isn't practical if I am using my laptop, but want to move away from my desk.<br />
<br />
Here is the error message I see when I try to safely remove the external hard drive:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3a5591b0-6e32-4782-88da-75a6b66c54e2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3a5591b0-6e32-4782-88da-75a6b66c54e2" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed a program which says what is preventing the hard drive from being safely removed, but I still don't know what is the cause, and how to overcome it. This is what is preventing my external USB hard drive from being safely removed:<br />
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ef0c269b-09a4-40f9-9991-797b4d66a413" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ef0c269b-09a4-40f9-9991-797b4d66a413" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So, what is the issue which is preventing my external hard drive from being safely removed, and how do I overcome it?<br />
<br />
Thanks</p>

            Hi, I would, if possible add that drive to exclusions in Norton AV, reboot your system and see if you then get the same error when trying to safely remove that drive
<br />
<br />
<br />The two files indicated as locking the drive form ejection are:
<br />
<br />Symefa.db is associated with Symantic software
<br />
<br />TFXLog.slf is a system file that stores file information such as timestamps, read/write permissions and so on

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            If I did this, and the Norton issue was resolved, wouldn't the issue still exist due to the TFXLog.slf and Txf:$I30 still being present, and therefore preventing my external hard drive from being safely removed?

<h3> jadeneptune  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mouse Gone Wild Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>My mouse has taken on a life of its own. When I open a new page, it will automatically scroll -- horizontally or vertically, depending on the page. Opening VLC Media, it puts the volume down to zero, and I can't do anything to fix it. I tried opening the
 mouse in settings, but it acted on its own again and put the setting to the highest, and I couldn't get it to move. I also can't open drop-down windows, because they just click back up as if the mouse was clicked quickly a second time. I've read all of the
 questions posted so far, but nothing has been of use to me. (This is both trackpad and wireless mouse.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run an HP Pavilion laptop, Windows 10, Google Chrome. 64-bit operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Quick edit: I was able to grab the drop-down windows for posting by quickly latching on to the responses before they could disappear.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Can you right click on the Start button? </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can, right click on Start, then select Device Manager.&nbsp; Expand Mice and other pointing devices.&nbsp; Right click on anything listed there and select uninstall.&nbsp; Restarting the computer installs the drivers again.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8534d561-6220-4e32-90c0-40ae4735ffe0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8534d561-6220-4e32-90c0-40ae4735ffe0" height="346" width="462" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You may have to enter safe mode to do this.&nbsp;Another way to get in the Device Manager is to click once on the Start button, then just start typing Device Manager.&nbsp; This will be one click at the top of the list.&nbsp; In Device Manager, you can also click to highlight
 the driver, then click on Action, then Uninstall.</p>

<p>
</p><p>What you will be doing is reinstalling the mouse and touchpad drivers.&nbsp; Getting into Safe Mode will allow you to&nbsp;uninstall the drivers. &nbsp;If you have any specific questions, please ask.</p>

<p>It would help if you could check you audio device installed on that system.&nbsp; Look in the Device Manager and under sound devices it should be listed.&nbsp; To open the Device Manager, right click the Windows button and select it from the pop up menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What creates the pop up varies between systems.&nbsp; Some systems have an option to turn off the popups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might also open the Control Panel and see if an audio device User Interface is there.&nbsp; Use Cortana to find the control panel.</p>

            <p>If the hardware is not supported by the manufacturer in a given operating system - anything else will just be a kludge that may or may not work as expected or desired and probably would not be permanent.</p>
<p>The camera you have (Sony HDR-FX1E) is only available in Latin America and is not fully supported by Windows 7:<br />
<a href="http://esupport.sony.com/CA/perl/support-info.pl?info_id=546&amp;mdl=HDRFX1E" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://esupport.sony.com/CA/perl/support-info.pl?info_id=546&amp;mdl=HDRFX1E</a></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Drivers:</b>
<ul>
<li>The drivers needed to connect your Sony camcorder to a computer and transfer files are already included in the operating system.</li></ul>
</li><li><b>Software:</b>
<ul>
<li>When using Movie Maker™ software:
<ul>
<li>It is not possible to write video in the HDV format back to the tape from Movie Maker.
</li><li>It is necessary to import an entire movie from the tape, you will not be able to import partial segments of a movie.</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li><li><b>Not Supported:</b>
<ul>
<li>The USB streaming feature is not supported with the Windows 7 operating system.
</li><li>The Windows 7 Starter edition is not supported.</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>When a company states, "are already included in the operating system" in reference to drivers - they have already decided you now own a legacy device where the operating system you have chosen to use is concerned.</p>
<p>My best guess at what you are running into, "The USB streaming feature is not supported with the Windows 7 operating system."</p>

<p>Not sure how you have yours set up. Are you using the IR blaster?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I control everything through my Onkyo receiver (via the HDMI ports), just like I do with my 360. I'm not using the IR blaster, and everything is working fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...well, along with my Logitech Harmony remote.</p>

<p>I have a TX-NR609 and I believe it is the next model down from the OP. I set it up through the normal setup and I have not had any problems with it. The receiver along with my tv turns on when I say "xbox on". It also works when I say volume up, Mute, down
 etc. It is working as I figured it would. </p>

<h2>            Canon LBP5000 Laser Printer not Supported in Windows 8&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Canon LBP5000 laser printer doesn't work with the latest drivers (LBP5000_R113_V310_Win_x64_EN_7) in Windows 8. Is there any known solution for this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm using printer via USB. Installation of the drivers goes fine but when&nbsp;I try to print something it looks like that it never gets any response from the printer. Even driver uninstall will hung up the whole system. Only way to get rid of malfunctioning
 driver is to use regedit.exe. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Janne Rand</p>

            <p><span>Hi Janne,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1. Do you get any error message/code while printing?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Have you made any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p><span>3. Was it working on your previous operating System?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><u><span>Method 1: Use a troubleshooter to fix the issue:</span></u></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Press <b>Win + W</b> on the keyboard
</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Type on<b> “Troubleshooting”</b></span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click on<b> “Troubleshooting”</b></span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click on<b> “Hardware and Sound”</b></span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Select<b> Printer,</b></span></p>
<p><span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Run the <b>troubleshooter</b> and restart the computer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><u><span>Method 2: Temporarily </span></u></b><b><u><span>Disable Antivirus and Firewall</span></u></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Turn Windows Firewall on or off</span></b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Important Note:</span></b><span> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software,
 you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This problem wasn't solved after all. With following steps printer was working some time:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. I configured printer to my windows 7 laptop (via USB).</p>
<p>2. I connected to printer from my Windows 8 desktop via home group. Printing was working fine this way.</p>
<p>3. I connected printer directly to my windows 8 desktop and printing was still working fine! This got me thinking that some update fixed the issue.</p>
<p>4. At some point problem came back. Printing didn't work and whole system&nbsp;got unstable (explorer didn't open anymore etc.).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I fixed&nbsp;hanging problem&nbsp;and repeated steps and same result again. First printing works fine but then suddenly it stops from working.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried methods you described but non of them fixed the problem. Unfortunately it looks like that there's no easy solution for this problem.

            According to Canon's website, a driver for windows 8 will be available this month. Let's hope Canon will hold its promess because I had to downgrade from Win 8 to Win 7 for this only reason.<br />
By the way, my license of Win 7 was OEM when I upgraded to Win 8. Meanwhile, I upgraded my computer (new motherboard and processor) and so I had to buy a new OEM license of Win 7 and I will have to buy a new upgrade license for Win 8. If the driver is not ready
 for the end of January I will have to pay the full price for the new Win 8 upgrade license. Thanks to Canon which was not able to deliver in due time.<br />
With the same printer I had the same problem when I changed from Windows 7 -32 bits to Win 7 -64 bits. I had to wait several months until a 64 bits driver was issued by Canon.<br />
As far as I know other important manufacturers do not have this problem, at least not at this extent.<br />
I have sent a message to Canon about this but I am still waiting for an answer.<br />

            Meanwhile canon released a working windows 8 printer driver, although you can't find it in the normal download section here's the link to the canon download page where I found it.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://support-au.canon.com.au/contents/AU/EN/0100278702.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">download link</a><br />
<br />
To download it scroll down to the download section and check the agreement checkbox. Afterwards a download link appears.<br />

Hope this helps<br />

I will never buy a Canon product again : always too late with their drivers and they never answered my mails.<br />

            I had the same problems.<br />
<br />
Printer first did work, then didn't work with win, win7, xp-driver, non.<br />
I tried all.<br />
Once i tested the printer with another laptop, which i knowed that it worked ever, and it worked (Win7). Then i changed cable to win8-machine, and immediatetly he printed the saved jobs - very strange. But didnt work later.<br />
<br />
Some installation-notices say, that cable must be disconected when installing AND UNISTALLING, and that you shoud plug in the cable every time in the same divice (connector).<br />
<br />
At last it worked after complete de- and new installation, mentioning last points, AND THIS MIGHT BE THE MOST IMPORTANT POINT: I disconnected also the external USB-harddrive, that was pluged in to the device I used at first for the printer. I installed WIN7
 !!! 64-bit driver with the compatibility option (marking setup.exe and press the right mouse-button), disabling windows-firewall and Kaspersky-firewall (dont know if necessary) and restarting the PC before connecting the printer. Installing on USB-device.<br />
<br />
Maybe it would work also with the win8-driver (only on the english site till now), but mention to disconnect when installing and uninstalling, and always do use same divice.<br />
<br />
The printer was also very sensible in XP with plugging it on different devices, especially when other things are connected to other USB at the same time.<br />

<p>I got my printer behaving better with drivers downloaded from here: <a href="http://support-my.canon-asia.com/contents/MY/EN/0100278701.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support-my.canon-asia.com/contents/MY/EN/0100278701.html</a>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's still unstable so I'm not satisfied. What I have heard it sounds like there's some common problem with this model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My final solution&nbsp;is new printer in near future.</p>

            New experience:<br />
<br />
Today I have changed the cable between printer and PC. Additionally I have changed the laying of the Internetcable, made some distance to the other cables (many). I made several print-tests with conditions that didn't work two months before with the same drivers.
 Printer was switched on / printed-o.k. / changed cable from WIN8-PC to WIN-XP / printed - o.k. / switched on external harddrive / changed cable back to WIN8-PC / removed one color cassette during switched-on-printer, put it back/ printed - o.k. / changed cable
 to winXP-PC / printed - o.k./ changed back to Win8-PC / printed - o.k.<br />
<br />
This successful test could signify, that the real problem ist the cable, maybe the original cable has an insufficient shield or a contact problem.<br />

<h2>            Windows Update checkbox has disappeared</h2>
                    
<p>I UNchecked the checkbox in Windows Update settingsso as&nbsp;to not give me updates for Microsoft products and not to&nbsp;check for new optional Microsoft software when I update Windows.</p>
<p>After doing that, the checkbox disappeared from the settings window and I cannot reverse my decision. I read somewhere that it could be corrected using the policy editor. I attemppted to do it, but it didn't work satisfactorily.</p>
<p>Is there an effective way to reinstate this checkbox that has disappeared from the settings window?</p>

            Hello KKBim,
<br />
<br />I would have to ask, if the reason you are getting that pop up, is because it is the wifi at the University?  When you connect to that wifi does it put you on an intranet for the University?  I only ask because that could be the requirements needed for you to get connected.
<br />
<br />It sounds like because the wifi is asking for a username and password, that it is looking for your school account information.  However, before entering any username and password I would recommend reaching out to your Universities helpdesk to verify the process for getting on the wifi there.
<br />
<br />please let me know if there is anything else I can help with.
<br />
<br />Happy Holidays,
<br />
<br />Danielle

<h2>            Sizzling Sound when charging the device&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it just me experiencing a "sizzling" sound on the Surface Pro while the device is charging? I was doing my work, and kept hearing this strange noise. I thought it was something outside, but it was coming from the inside of the surface. It was predominant
 from the Ports on the side of the device, and I was quite concerned about it! This is a certified refurbished device, as my other one also had a hardware fault! Just wondered if this was normal, or I need another new one?</p>

<p>Hi DanHarper_1909</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for posting your concern here in Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Do you have any other accessories or peripherals connected to your Surface pro 6 aside from the charger? (Such as thumb drive or external storage devices) Also, u<span>sers may be able to hear a static hiss from their USB3 port when an accessory
 is attached. The sound is likely more noticeable because the Surface Pro is otherwise very quiet.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>And have you tried checking for any physical damage on the power supply or cable? And by any chance, have you tried a different power supply or charge with your Surface Pro 6?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Looking forward for your response.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Nick!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response. I have noticed the hissing on several occasions. In about 40% of cases when I hear the hissing, I have my hard drive attached to the surface. Otherwise the hissing only comes when the charger is attached.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There isn't any physical damage to the cable as far as I can visually see, and I have only used the cable from the box of my original surface. This is a refurbished one so I dont know if that will make any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>

</p><p>And yes, that is right. You will&nbsp;hear a static hiss when you have a USB device connected to it, such as thumb drive or external hard drive and when it's in heavy use. External hard drives may also produce sounds when you're transferring or downloading files
 to it. Though noisy, the Surface Pro should be functioning properly.</p>

<p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a similar issue. I have that weird hissing noise all the time even when I don´t charge. I´ve also changed the device to a new one but the noise is still there. And I am not using any program that could challenge my cpu.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have the surface pro 6 i5.</p>
<p>Do you think the noise is a normal thing or should I talk with the support center to change my device again?</p>
