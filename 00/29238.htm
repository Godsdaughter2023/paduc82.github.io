    <title>Left mouse drag not working - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Left mouse drag not working</h2>
                    <p>My wife has a Medion Laptop running Windows 8.1. She has suddenly encountered erratic and incorrect behaviour when using left-click drag with her USB Mouse - This is not just drag and drop in Windows itself, it is any drag feature including those commonly
 used in Excel and Word. It's hard to describe precisely as the behaviour varies from the click being treated as a double-click to the drag being ignored to the drag not covering the movement of the mouse correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- We have tried a variety of different Mice and they all encounter the same problem</p>
<p>- We have plugged into all 4 USB ports, same problem</p>
<p>- I checked for an updated driver, none available</p>
<p>- I tried uninstalling the HID-compliant mouse in Control Panel and connecting the mouse again, made no difference</p>
<p>- I checked the click lock setting, made no difference</p>
<p>- I tried pressing ESC while holding the left click, made no difference</p>
<p>- The touchpad mouse is working correctly, the problem is just with USB mice</p>
<p>
</p><p>My wife is an accountant and spends a lot of time using Excel so the touchpad mouse is not a workable long term solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anybody have any suggestions please? i'm scratching my head.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Dickie,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I appreciate your troubleshooting steps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the description, I understand that you are unable to use left click on your mouse.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This could be due to hardware conflicts.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try the methods.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Run the Hardware Devices troubleshooter.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;An automated troubleshooter is a tool that can find and automatically fix some problems with your computer. These troubleshooters aren't designed to fix every problem, but they're a useful tool to
 try because they can often save your time and effort.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Press “Windows Logo” + “W” keys from the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type “Troubleshooting” in the search bar and press “Enter”.</span></p>
<p><span>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the “Troubleshooting” window, click on “View All” on the left pane.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on
<strong>“Hardware and Devices"</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click “<strong><em>Next</em></strong>” and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the troubleshooting process.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to perform clean boot and check, using this Microsoft Article because may be a third party application is causing this issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>NOTE:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or
 an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may
 temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the
 computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps.
</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span>Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section “<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting”</strong> to boot the computer in normal mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information helps. Please let us know if you need any other assistance with Windows in future. We will be happy to assist you.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 goes to sleep too fast</h2>
                    It looks like there are other posts similar to this one, but I wanted to put it out there in case someone has found a solution. My computer goes to sleep after appx. 2 minutes. I've turned off all the power settings that would put it to sleep and still
 continues to happen. Very frustrating when trying to read text or do basically anything that requires more than 2 minutes of inactivity. Any solutions?!&nbsp;

</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><span>Right-click Desktop &gt; Personalize &gt; Screensaver</span></strong><span><br />
Even if you don't use a screensaver, this timer value is used to lock the screen.&nbsp; Set this to "none" and<em>make sure the checkbox is off so it doesn't require a password</em>.<br />
<br />
<br />
</span></li><li><strong><span>Power Options &gt; Change when to turn off the display<br />
<br />
</span></strong></li><li><strong><span>Power Options &gt; Change when the computer sleeps<br />
<br />
</span></strong></li><li><strong><span>Settings App &gt; Lock Screen Settings</span></strong></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>It's probably number 1, because even if your screensaver is set to "none", the timer on that page still applies. So it will time out after that time and go to the lock screen, which then also goes to sleep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So again, screensaver is the most likely cause, especially since you already checked the actual power settings. &nbsp;And again, the screensaver option applies even if you never had or used a screensaver, because the timer value still matters.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 activation key stopped working after two years of normal operation</h2>
                    I have been running Windows 7 (Home Premium version) on my computer since 2009, and in the last few days it kept saying that I didn't have a genuine activation key, even though it's a key I purchased from Microsoft.com. Not sure what went wrong.

<h2>            Realtek High Definition Audio Preventing sleep</h2>
                    <p>Realtek is keeping my&nbsp;PC from sleeping.<br />
<br />
I read some of the other threads of people having the same issue but nothing I found helped or really seemed to find what their original problems were either. I have checked to make sure there are no updates to either the Realtek Driver or Windows. Both are
 on their most current version.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\WINDOWS\system32&gt;powercfg -requests</p>
<p>DISPLAY:</p>
<p>None.</p>
<p>
</p><p>SYSTEM:</p>
<p>[DRIVER] Realtek High Definition Audio (HDAUDIO\FUNC_01&amp;VEN_10EC&amp;DEV_0892&amp;SUBSYS_18497893&amp;REV_1003\4&amp;6247a28&amp;0&amp;0001)</p>
<p>An audio stream is currently in use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I restart all my open media and communication programs it usually seems to clear this but I'm not sure what the root of the problem is to begin with. None of these programs were actively streaming any audio or video and had not been for at least six hours
 prior to the issue. My computer went to sleep last night just fine but was woken up in the middle of the night and this is what caused it to wake up and prevented it from sleeping again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had issues with it sleeping for a while so I just started looking into it recently.</p>

<span>Since when are you facing this issue?</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue could be due to some system files and drivers not working as expected.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Step 1: Let us run the power troubleshooter utility tool on the PC to check if that helps.

<span>Once it is done, restart the computer and check if that helps.
</span></p>

<p>I had this issue with my&nbsp;old computer but I built a new computer this summer. I didn't start having this issue consistently on my new computer until maybe mid-October.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I ran the troubleshooter. It said that the time to fall asleep was too long and that it fixed it. However, if I run the powercfg -requests command it still gives me the same error. So, I do not believe that actually&nbsp;fixed the issue.</p>

<p>
</p><p>There is no advanced power settings. There is Additional Settings. I went to that and my settings were already set to the defaults. I hit restore defaults anyways. But again I have the same error.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I closed all open active programs on my computer including Chrome and Discord. The only things I had running were Task Manager and Administrator: Command Prompt but I was still getting the notification that said that Realtek was using an active audio stream.</p>

            I ran the command prompt that I mentioned in my original post. And I don't have issues putting it to sleep manually. That's not an issue. It's when it should fall asleep or stay asleep on its own but it isn't.

<p>You may also find that clicking Start, Settings, Control Panel, Power Options - the Hibernate&nbsp; tab is missing.&nbsp; What is your situation with the Hibernate tab?</p>
<p>If you find the Hibernate tab, make sure the Enable hibernation option in enabled.</p>
<p>When everything is enabled, pressing the Shift key on the Turn Off Computer menu will change the Stand By button into a Hibernate button.</p>
<p>After you make any adjustments, reboot your system to be sure the changes "stick".</p>
<p>If that is not your solution, then:<br />
<br />
Almost always, and easy to check, it the video drivers for your system that should be downloaded from your manufacturers WWW site. Download the correct video driver, install, reboot.<br />
<br />
If you can't figure out how to get to the manufacturers WWW site, we can look it up for you:</p>
<p>What is your system make and model?&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is your XP version and Service Pack?&nbsp; There are Hibernation fixes in Service Pack 3, so if you are not on SP3, you need to be.</p>
<p>If you are not sure, do this:<br />
<br />
Click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
msinfo32<br />
<br />
Click OK, and when the System Summary info appears, click Edit, Select All, Copy and then paste back here.<br />
<br />
There will be some personal information (like System Name and User Name), and whatever appears to be private information to you, just delete it.</p>
<p>For video driver information, expand the Components, click Display, click Edit, Select All, Copy and then paste the information back here.</p>
<p>This will minimize back and forth Q&amp;A and eliminate guesswork and assumptions.</p>
<p>When you get it working, you can also add a Hibernate button to your Turn Off Computer menu so it becomes Hibernate, Stand By, Turn Off, Restart.&nbsp; This will save you an extra keyboard stoke (you won't have to press the Shift key to invoke Hibernation).</p>

<p>That info looks pretty good.</p>
<p>Do you have the Hibernate tab in your Power Options or is the tab missing and is the Hibernate option checked?</p>
<p>You can also use Internet Explorer to browse to the NVIDIA WWW site and let it scan for and check your video drivers:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/PreScan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/PreScan.aspx?lang=en-us</a></p>
<p>For your not coming out of Stand By with mouse click issue, do this:</p>
<p>Click Start, Settings, Control Panel, Mouse<br />
<br />
Click the Hardware tab, Properties<br />
<br />
Click the Power Management tab<br />
<br />
Enable (put a check in the box) that says Allow this device to bring the computer out of standby.<br />
<br />
After you make any adjustments, reboot your system to be sure the changes "stick".<br />
<br />
Standby actually carries with it a greater potential for data loss than Hibernation, so make your power saving option choices wisely (hint: use Hibernation instead).<br />
<br />
If you have cats in the house, beware of them bringing your system out of standby for you by walking on your mouse, or you may be back later with a "my system seems to come out of standby by itself" problem.</p>

<p>I see you already have a thread for your Standby issue, so let's try not to mix them up and get off in the weeds trying to fix two things in one thread (this is just an idea). &nbsp;I should have kept quiet about the Standby issue in this thread. &nbsp;You should
 try your Standby button on something simple - not while playing a game just to be sure the Standby mechanism works okay in a simple - nothing running but the desktop scenario. &nbsp;Don't complicate the&nbsp;environment&nbsp;by running a game. &nbsp;Maybe your game does not handle
 Standby at all. &nbsp;You need to make sure just a simple Standby operation works first.</p>
<p>Get Hibernate working in this thread, then get Standby working in the other thread. &nbsp;You have two issues to resolve and you do not need to reinstall the operating system.</p>
<p>Is there some reason you are not revealing the configuration (checked or unchecked) of your Enable hibernation check box in Power Options?</p>
<p>What did the NVIDIA page driver scan have to say about your video configuration?&nbsp; It is really pretty neat.</p>

            Hi terri,<br />
<br />
a) Which MP3 player do you have?<br />
<br />
b) Did you upgrade from Windows Vista to Windows 7 or it came preinstalled with your machine?<br />
<br />
c) How have you connected your MP3 player? Via USB cable?<br />
<br />
<br />
Try plugging the Mp3 player to another port on the computer and check if it works.<br />
<br />
<strong>First check if the plug and play service is enabled on the computer</strong>
<br />
<br />
1. Go to "Start" -&gt; "Run”, type "services.msc" and press on "Enter" button.<br />
2. Double-click on the service named "Plug and Play"<br />
3. Check the value in the “Startup type” the device needs to be “Started and automatic”<br />
<br />
<br />
If the above step does not fix the issue would suggest updating the Mp3 player drivers by visiting the player manufacture website.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>In the meantime you may try this :</strong> <br />
<br />
1. Click Start<br />
2. In the search box type "Device manager"<br />
3. Choose my MP3 <br />
4. Right Click on it<br />
5. Choose Uninstall<br />
6. Restart your machine and let Windows 7 automatically download drivers for you MP3 player ( make sure MP3 player is plugged in while performing this)<br />
<br />
<br />
There are two methods you can use to sync items to a device. One is automatic and the other is manual. When you connect a device to your computer for the first time, Windows Media Player selects the sync method that works best for your device, depending on
 the device's storage capacity and the size of your Player Library.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
a. As the Automatic Sync Is not working for you, you may try to sync manually.<br />
<br />
b. Let us know if you get any error message when you try to sync manually.<br />
<br />
c. Go through the below links that talks about how to sync manually:<br />
<br />

    <title>windows 10 should have built in android support - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> annonymous_user  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 10 should have built in android support</h2>
                    Windows 10 should have built in android support, for example one neat app where you can organize your connected Android devices either by WiFi or bluetooth. And, later they should have support for IOS as well, because it saves time picking your phone out
 of your pocket. Plus, they can reverse this as well, organize your computer from your Android/IOS device.

<p>It is not very clear what you want to achieve, would you mind clarify your requirement?</p>
<p>Are you referring to organizing Android and iOS application and run them inside Windows?</p>
<p>You should know they have different systems and not all Android and iOS apps run in Windows but software developers should create such interoperability.</p>
<p>Microsoft provides basic support for Android/iOS through Microsoft apps and for example you may install Microsoft Edge on these devices and sync your favorite and sessions across Android/iOS and Windows.</p>

            I'm talking about the other settings too, for example sync all your photos so you won't lose then and save tour messages in case you damage the sim card. I am talking about different OSes to team up to create one app which you can use to control another
 OS if you have the right to do so.

            What you are saying is work in progress and for example in Android and iOS , you may install Microsoft Apps and achieve similar tasks, for example you may save all of your files into OneDrive to sync them across Windows and other devices. You may install
 Microsoft Edge on Android and Sync your browser with Windows. You may look into Google Play and look for Microsoft and there you may install Apps to help you with these. More options and features should come in future.

<p>
</p><p>Agreed.&nbsp; I have an Android phone but barely use google services.&nbsp; It's very much a Microsoft led phone.&nbsp; I have Edge, Cortana, Microsoft Launcher, Onedrive and the rest of O365.&nbsp; My photos sync up to my Onedrive across all the apps on the phone that take
 photos.&nbsp; Messages on my phone also appear on my laptop thanks to Cortana.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I loved Windows phone but the lack of app support killed it off for me.&nbsp; Now I have the best of both worlds, the Android app store plus all my Microsoft hosted services and data.</p>

    <title>Lost files and programs after performing Windows 8 update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> toddstables  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lost files and programs after performing Windows 8 update</h2>
                    <p>A few days ago, Windows 8 did it's update thing. "Computer will restart in 15 minutes".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I let it do it's thing. It took an hour! When it was done I had to go through the whole process of setting up my computer just like I did when I first bought it...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I got it running, every file in my "Video's" directory was gone. In addition, I can no longer run AOM or even Steam.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's the point of letting Windows do updates if I have to start from scratch every time?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get back to where I was before the "improvement"? </p>

            <p><span>Hi Todd,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft community forum. I would appreciate if you could answer the following questions:
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Did you perform Windows update or upgrade?</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Did you get any prompt before upgrading?</p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To verify which version of Windows you have now, see
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/which-operating-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Which Windows operating system am I running</span></strong></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you have upgraded to Windows
<span>&nbsp;</span>8.1 , your Windows Store apps will need to be reinstalled from the Store. For instructions, see
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/update-from-windows-8-tutorial#start" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Welcome to the new Windows</span></strong></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you choose to “Keep nothing” when you upgrade to Windows&nbsp;8.1, or if you reset, refresh, or reinstall Windows, your personal files are temporarily saved to the Windows.old folder for 28 days (unless
 you formatted your hard drive before installing). If you decide you want some or all of these files back, you can usually retrieve them from this folder.</span></p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <div>Hi Carter,</div>
<div><br />
Thank you for choosing Windows 8 and for providing us an opportunity to assist you.<br />
<div>You have mentioned that the webcam picture is upside down, this could be due to some incorrect settings. Just a few questions first to get a clear picture of the issue;<br />
<ul>
<li>What is the make and model of the computer?<br />
</li><li>Are you using the&nbsp;built-in camera app or any other third party software?<br />
</li><li>Did you make any changes in the webcam settings after installing windows 8?<br />
</li></ul>
<div><strong>Method 1: Check software settings</strong></div>
<strong>
<div><br />
</strong>
<div>If you are using any third party software for webcam, please check the setting. Most of these softwares have settings to rotate the image. So check if any of these settings have been set to rotate the image upside down.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2: Modern app troubleshooter</strong></div>
<strong>
<div><br />
</strong>
<div>If you are using the&nbsp;built-in camera and seeing the image upside down, then I would suggest you to download and run the modern app troubleshooter. Here is the link:<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 3: Check the display driver</strong></div>
<strong>
<div><br />
</strong>
<div>If the above steps didn’t help you, I would suggest you to check the display driver as an outdated driver can cause such issues. Refer these steps:<br />
<div>a) Press Windows key + X, select device manager<br />
b) Locate you display adapter, right click on it and select properties<br />
c) Click on the Driver tab and click on Update driver<br />
d) Install if any updates are available.<br />
<div>You can also check in the manufacturer’s website to check if any updated display driver is available.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 4: Check compatibility</strong></div>
<strong>
<div><br />
</strong>
<div>If you couldn’t find any updated driver or if the updated river also didn’t resolve the issue, then I would suggest you to download Windows 7 display driver from the manufacturer website and install it in Windows 7 compatibility mode and check. Refer these
 steps:<br />
<div>a) Right click the driver installation file and select Properties then tap or click the Compatibility tab.<br />
b) Place a check in the Run this program in compatibility mode. <br />
c) Tap or click the drop down box and select Windows 7, then tap or click OK.<br />
d) Try installing the driver and check. <br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope this helps. If the issue remains unresolved, please get back to us with more information and we would be happy to help.</div>

    <title>Cannot use keyboard and touch pad at the same time... - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot use keyboard and touch pad at the same time...</h2>
                    Hello, I am using a Microsoft Surface Pro computer running on Windows 10 Pro. My issue comes in where I cannot use the keys on the keyboard and the touch pad at the same time. I have searched several different times trying to find a solution to the problem,
 however upon my discovery, my settings on my computer do not match the solutions given. Whether it be PalmTouch, SmartSense, or some other thing, neither come up in my settings. If you have a solution, please don't hesitate to enlighten me, as this is a time
 sensitive issue. Much thanks in advance.

            Hello, thank you for the reply, however I don't think its a sensitivity issue, its more like a multitasking issue. Like I can't use the touch pad unless I am not pressing any keys. Is there a way I can do both at the same time?

            Olivia, how exactly do you use your keyboard and touchpad at the same time though. 
<br />
<br />You are either typing or clicking. For instance, making this reply to you, my hand is not interacting with either the external mouse or touch pad on my laptop. 
<br />
<br />You can't be performing two forms of input interactions at the same time you are trying to accomplish one tasks when the simple fact is, computer behavior is sequential. Keep your hands only on the keyboard when you want to type something. 
<br />
<br />You don't want one hand type and click, thats just not proper computing etiquette. 
<br />
<br />If you are typing a document, type the document.
<br />Use the mouse when you complete typing the document to apply formatting if necessary. 
<br />
<br />I have a Surface Pro 3 and I have never in any circumstance had the need to have my hand on the touchpad and keyboard at the same time. I'm either typing or I am using the mouse to lick and navigate. Thats why the mouse is known as a point and click device; and must only be referenced when needed for a particular interaction.

            For example, if I were to be playing a game such as Minecraft, where I need to both move around with the keyboard and look around with the touch pad simultaneously, I would need to do both. It is very troubling not being able to look without moving and
 vice versa. Its a small issue I know, nonetheless frustrating.

            Changing touch pad sensitivity to most sensitive did the trick. Thanks.

<h2>            Microsoft XPS Document Writer missing and can&#39;t get it back</h2>
                    <p>So windows 10 pro updated itself to version 1803 and now ALL my printers are gone. I was able to reinstall my desktop printers just fine. However, no matter what I try I can't get back Microsoft XPS Document Writer. I need this to print from Quickbooks...</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far these are things that I have tried that did not work</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>Go to Devices and Printers and click on "Add a printer." Click through "The printer I want is not listed", "Add a local printer....", and under "Use an existing Port" select "PORTPROMPT: (Local Port)" if it's listed. Click Next,
 then scroll down to Microsoft in the left-hand column and pick "Microsoft XPS Document Writer v4" in the right-hand column, then click next until you're done. That should bring it back for you.</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>The above did not work because "Microsoft XPS Document Writer v4" is not even listed in the right hand column after selecting Microsoft. I tried to remedy this with the below.
</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>Go to setting &gt; Apps &amp; Features &gt; Manage optional features. If XPS viewer is not there, click add feature and select XPS viewer and click install.</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>This also did not work as when I click install it said "XPS Viewer install failed". Tried this several times with rebooting and fails every time<em>.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked for the files being present in the windows folder. C:\Windows\System32\spool\tools\Microsoft XPS Document Writer and has the below contents:</p>
<p>
</p><p>mxdw.gpd &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; GPD File</p>

<p>mxdw-manifest.ini &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Configuration settings</p>
<p>mxdw-piplineconfig.xml &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XML Document</p>
<p>prnms001.cat&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Security Catalog</p>
<p>prnms001.inf &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Setup Information</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea of what I can try next to get Microsoft XPS Document Writer back??? It has been working just fine for over a year until this update...</p>

<p><span>Hi hewie1513,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>What
 were the recent updates that were installed on your computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you receive this error message in Safe mode?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try the steps mentioned below.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span> To create a new windows explorer</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right
 click on the taskbar and click on Start Task manager.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on File and then click on new task.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Type
 explorer.exe in the dialog box and click on Run.</span></p>
<p><span>Now check if you receive this error message.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span> Boot the computer in safe mode.</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to boot the computer using safe mode option to check this behavior.</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Use
 F8 while restarting the computer.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Under
 Windows Advanced Boot options select Safe mode and press Enter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Once
 you login to Safe mode, open Windows Explorer and see if you receive this error message.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>While in Safe mode, if you don’t receive this error message then the issue might be due to conflicting software. Restart the computer back to normal
 windows startup.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 3:</span></strong><span> Perform a clean boot</span></p>
<p><span>A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.&nbsp;I would suggest you to follow the steps below to eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows 7</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> After you have finished troubleshooting,
 reset the computer to start as usual.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For your information:</span></p>
<p><span>You can always check event viewer if you encounter performance issues.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>Is there a Microsoft cloud&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sandsonik  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is there a Microsoft cloud&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My laptop was recently stolen and I had to get a new one.&nbsp; The weird thing is, when I signed into my brand new laptop, it began running a screensaver I had on my old one that rotated pictures.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The pictures are not located in OneDrive or&nbsp;DropBox - I checked - and I'm really inept with Windows 10 (hate, hate, hate 8 and 10!) so I can't figure out where it's drawing them from or whether that location might have other files of mine.&nbsp; It's a mystery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tend to think that the background setting was somehow spurred by my Windows sign-in, since I had yet to install anything on the new computer, so that made me wonder - is there data saved somewhere just based on my WIndows sign on?&nbsp; Do private users automatically
 get some storage space and might there be more stuff from my old computer there - maybe my Office documents - and how do I access it?</p>

<h2>            Cannot run System Restore with Norton Internet Security installed on Windows 7</h2>
                    Have new computer with Windows 7 and 60 day trial of Norton Internet Security.&nbsp; Cannot do a successful System Restore.&nbsp; I get this message:&nbsp; "System Restore could not access a file.&nbsp;This is probably because an antivirus program is running on the computer.&nbsp;
 Temporarily disable your antivirus program and retry System Restore.&nbsp; An unspecified error occurred during System Restore. (0x80070005)"&nbsp; I tried turning off the Norton antivirus, antispyware and firewall, but still&nbsp;get the same error message.&nbsp; I contacted
 Norton tech support and they said I have to remove the Norton, do the System Restore and then re-install the Norton. Is this correct?&nbsp; Do you know of any Internet Security software that I can get that does not require uninstalling and reinstalling in order
 to run System Restore?

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This might either be a software related issue or a memory leak issue. For us to properly isolate the cause of crashes while playing, we need additional information. Can you answer the questions below?</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What are the troubleshooting steps that you've done with the game support team?</li><li>Which version of Windows are you using?</li><li>When did this start to happen?</li><li>Have you tried updating your graphics driver?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, if you haven't updated your graphics driver, please do so as an initial workaround.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll wait for your response.</p>

<p>Hi, Anne, and thanks for your reply!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Windows 10 Home 64-bit (10.0, Build 16299).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issues started on Sunday, December 10 and has continued consistently since then. The issue occurs in only one game mode: MyCareer single-player games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, the CTD is always&nbsp;preceded by a similar event. Every single time it has happened (about 10 times now), it happens instantly when the ball goes out of bounds in the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th quarter. (It doesn't crash if it's still the 1st quarter.) No error
 message, either, just instant CTD. If the ball by sheer luck does not go out of bounds, I don't experience a crash. (I've successfully played two games where I was this lucky that the ball stayed in bounds.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before coming here for help, 2K Support had me try the following:</p>
<p>- verified my game data via the Steam client</p>
<p>- updated my NVidia gpu&nbsp;driver</p>
<p>- reinstalled DirectX and made sure it was up-to-date</p>
<p>- reinstalled Vcredist</p>
<p>- checked that audio drivers were also up to date</p>
<p>
</p><p>After following each of these directives, I tested the game again and still experienced the same CTD each time when the ball went out of bounds in the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th. I also tried changing various in-game settings, but couldn't find anything that would
 help prevent this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then gave my DxDiag and MSinfo to 2K Support, and after they analyzed it, they said that the problem might be a memory leak because they found the&nbsp;term RADAR_PRE_LEAD_64 in my MSinfo. (It appears 3 times, for errors dated 11/24, 11/29, and 12/08).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2K Support then recommended that I run mdsched.exe to check for errors. I did, and it came back with no errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They also recommended defragging my hard drive, but since I have&nbsp;only an SSD, I don't think I can manually force a defrag process. It optimizes weekly anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2K Support now says it is not authorized to offer more support in this area since they believe it may be a Microsoft/Windows issue. That's why I'm here, of course. :) What are your thoughts?</p>

            So, I was prompted by my laptop to install the latest Windows 10 update a couple nights ago. After installing and restarting, I decided to try playing again to see if it had any effect on my game, et voilà! No crashes since then (and I've played a few
 more games to be sure). This topic can be closed, I suppose. Thanks again!

    <title>subfolders have disappeared in outlook on office 365 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            subfolders have disappeared in outlook on office 365</h2>
                    <p>I have office 365 on two machines (laptop and desktop) both with all patches up to date. I have, within outlook, connections to various email accounts. I noticed on desktop that my icloud email account subfolders have all disappeared (if I open icloud on
 the web I can still see them or on my iPhone),.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I opened laptop to compare and watched as the subfolders disappeared one by one before my eyes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can only see inbox, sent items, deleted items, drafts, junk, outbox now - but no subfolders and the arrows to expand have disappeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried removing the mail accounts and re-adding to no avail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried installing icloud for windows - but that has never worked and always tries to get me to repair the app and restart the machine when it says it has installed, then it tells me to repair the mail again in an infinite loop..... which never repairs
 - it has never worked, but the email in outlook did use to work regardless</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I see my sub folders again?????</p>

            Hi  
<br />
<br />thank you for posting your query.
<br />
<br />could you try with another profile and set online mode and check if it works
<br />
<br />if sub folders are not displayed in cache mode, try this
<br />
<br />Close Outlook
<br />
<br />1. On your keyboard, click the Windows key + the R key to open the Run dialog box 
<br />
<br />       Windows Key + R
<br /> 
<br />Type Outlook.exe /cleanviews then click OK
<br />
<br />Outlook launch clean views
<br />
<br />Outlook will launch; check for missing folders. If the problem is not resolved, please continue.
<br />
<br />2. Clear and regenerate the Navigation Pane for the current profiles.
<br />
<br />Repeat steps 1 and 2 above
<br />Type Outlook.exe /resetnavpane then click OK
<br />
<br />Feel free to get back to us should you experience any doubt .
<br />
<br />Thanks,
<br />Cristhian

</span><br />
<br />
<span>if sub folders are not displayed in cache mode"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>so I have done the steps that you suggest after that but it made no difference on either laptop or desktop</span></p>

            Hi  andrewmitchell7
<br />
<br />thank you for answer
<br />
<br />if you have POP3 and IMAP accounts can’t use this feature Turn on Cached Exchange Mode
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/turn-on-cached-exchange-mode-7885af08-9a60-4ec3-850a-e221c1ed0c1c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/turn-o...</a>
<br />
<br />if you can see sub folders in other platforms it should be a view issue 
<br />
<br />yo can try to repair the Office 365 with  Click-to-Run application, follow these steps as appropriate for the version of Windows that the computer is running.
<br />
<br />Windows 10, Windows 8.1 and Windows 8:
<br />-On the Windows Start screen, type Control Panel.
<br />-Click or tap Control Panel.
<br />Under Programs, click or tap Uninstall a program. 
<br />Click or tap MicrosoftOffice 365, and then click or tap Change.
<br />Click or tap QuickRepair, and then click or tap Repair. You may have to restart your computer after the repair process is complete.

<p>ok - so yes its a IMAP type account as its apple (.me) so the first bit I cant do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When i follow your instructions to try and repair office 365, i can open up control panel as you suggest, but Microsoft Office 365 is not in the list of programs so i cant run a repair.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I go to Settings, Apps, I can find Microsoft Office Desktop Apps in the list.</p>
<p>If I click on that and then Advanced Options there is a "repair" option, I have ran that - but it made no difference.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also then tried the "reset" option, this just completely removed outlook - which I can no longer see at all.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see the subfolders if I go into mail rather than outlook - but I now have no other accounts - I will have to reset all my accounts up....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is outlook no longer working?</p>
        </p>

<p>so further to this, I have now re-installed the whole of office 365, outlook still shows no folders other than the Inbox, Drafts, Sent Items, Deleted Items, Junk, Outbox, whereas if I open the same mail account in Mail can see all the folders by clicking
 on the folders tab in the left pane</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Why is outlook no longer displaying folders - it was until recently</p>
