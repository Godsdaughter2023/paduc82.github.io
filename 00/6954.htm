    <title>AD Sync to Sharepoint&#47;Delve Profile - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lynnparsons wwfemail  say:</h3>
<h2>            AD Sync to Sharepoint&#47;Delve Profile</h2>
                    <p>We currently update on premises Active Directory with Employee Office, Phone, Mobile Phone information from our HR System periodically.&nbsp; We would like to allow employees to update those fields in their O365 Profile and do not want the AD Sync to overwrite
 with stale information.&nbsp; I read online that it is typically an update in AD that triggers the update/sync but it will occasionally do a full sync regardless of whether there has been a change? I changed the fields in my profile&nbsp; 24 hours ago and so far the
 AD Sync has not overwritten them.&nbsp; Is it just a matter of time? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would actually like to update AD from SharePoint which I have done in the past.&nbsp; This would update listings in other O365 apps (email, Teams, etc)&nbsp; but if I understand right,&nbsp; the sync of the fields mentioned from AD to SharePoint profiles&nbsp; is automatic
 and unconfigurable and running all the time and updates in SharePoint Delve stand a chance of being overwritten before I have a chance to update AD? &nbsp; Thanks in advance for insight and suggestions.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span>Hello LynnParsons WWFemail,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span>Based on my knowledge, the updates in AD will indeed overwrite the changes in online. This is because AAD Connect Sync just a tool that sync your on-premises
 information to Online, all your data is still configured in AD. Therefore, if you want to sync data from SharePoint Online to your on-premises AD, this is not feasible in my opinion. If I misunderstand your situation, please feel free to correct me.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span>Meanwhile, you mentioned that the changes on Office 365 were not be overwrite by AD, which may be due to the unsuccessful execution of synchronization.
 Please kindly run the AAD Connect again and then wait for a while (it can take 24 hours) to check the results.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span>If the problem persists, please open
<strong>Synchronization Service Manager</strong> and check if there are any error messages listed under
<strong>Operation</strong> tab. If so, please provide a screenshot of it to help us provide further assistance.</span></p>

<p>I'm using Nokia 520. Most of the time the ads are sent via a variety of unknown numbers blocking which is impossible while most of the same do use some specific expression(s). Any advice for blocking the SMS containing such phrase(s) if such a feature already

<p><span>1. Since beginning I have no Profile Controller application in the device.&nbsp;I could not see the icon of this application in the START/SETTINGS,
 as it was advised in the guide book. What should I do in order to get this application "alive"?</span></p>
<p><span>2. The next problem with the device I got yesterday and it is much serious.&nbsp;Yesterday afternoon, when I switch on my i-mate, the screen of the
 device was dark. I tried to switch off and switch on many times - no results, the screen was still dark. I provided the soft reset a few times - without positive result as well. I tried to do hard reset as well using Call start button &amp; Call end button together
 with soft reset button - no results.&nbsp;I tried some other combinations&nbsp;of buttons pushing - screen is still dark. How can I get normal screen on my device?</span></p>

            A 2 weeks old device is still under warranty. Therefore, I strongly recommend you take it back to the reseller. A hard reset should have resolved your issue. It did not, so the issue is much more serious. The reseller will either repair it or offer a replacement
 device.

<h2>            MS Project 2010 fails to open. error message&#58; not enough memory to complete the operation</h2>
                    
<p>i installed the Project 2010, and after installing if i try to open it, it said configuring...and then i get this message:</p>
<p>"There is not enough memory to complete the operation. Close programs, projects, or windows you aren't using, and then try again. "</p>
<p>i have 4 GB of Ram, and i checked the memory, it's at half...so that's not the problem. i found this:<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/837154" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/837154</a>&nbsp;and i think it has something to do with the separator characters..</p>

    <title>Frontpage theme borders not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dk_scully  say:</h3>
<h2>            Frontpage theme borders not working</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to create borders for the theme I'm using. The code is:</p>
<p><br />
&lt;meta name="Microsoft Theme" content="books- 1111, default"&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;meta name="Microsoft Border" content="tb, default"&gt;</p>
<p><br />
But every time I save the document, the "tb, default" changes to "none, default" and no matter how many times I change it back, the change just won't stay. The result is, none of the pages I'm uploading have the required top and bottom.</p>
<p><br />
This used to work. Why has it stopped, and how can I force it to start behaving again?</p>
<p><br />
Thank you!</p>

<h2>            Stuck at &#34;Hi there, welcome back&#33;&#34; after upgrading from 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Good evening,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just came back to Windows 10 since there is a new build. I've upgraded from Windows 8.1 (fresh re-installed a week ago). I had no problem during upgrade, but when it come to " Hi there, welcome back!", I click 'next' and nothing happens. After a couple
 of minutes, if I click, the screen gets brighter and the computer reboots to the same point. I tried to click on " I'm not Sid", same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to boot on safe mode (there, I saw it's still the build 10130), same stuff happens (it reboots two times and come back to the same point).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another guy had the same issue apparently (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/3b0ejr/setup_stuck/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll try again tomorrow morning, at least it will be on this forum for the next guy. Unless anyone has a solution for me?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the poor English, you'll guess that's not my usual language.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for your help,</p>

            I had the same experience when first installing build 10130. &nbsp;If I tried to click different areas of the screen, the computer would eventually reboot. &nbsp;However, if I clicked on "Next" once and then let the computer sit for 10-15 minutes, it eventually
 continued to the next page.

Was able to disable Picture Maanager.Upgrade was not available.I wanted to disable Picture</p>
<p>Manager because every time I saved a spreadsheet&nbsp;in Excel 2010,I was unable to view it. The screen always showed the Picture Manager icon.Any thoughts&nbsp; as to how I may save the spread sheets now that the Picture Manager is disabled.

<p>Ps.-I use Dal-up</p>

==========================================<br />
Sounds like the file association (open with) for the Excel files <br />
was set for Office Picture Manager.<br />
<br />
Would the issue improve it you change the file association <br />
for Excel files back to Excel?<br />

    <title>Email account no longer available. Is it possible to retrieve the - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Email account no longer available. Is it possible to retrieve the emails now&#63;</h2>
                    I am helping my Dad out with an email issue he is having. I noticed recently that emails I was sending to him ...@yahoo.com were bouncing. I checked the headers and found that his "reply-to" email address was an ...@hotmail.com account that he didn't know
 he had. I think he did register for this ..@hotmail.com account at some point, but forgot about it.
<br />
<br />
Anyway, his reply-to email has been a hotmail address for about a year, so I have sent him a lot of emails to hotmail that he's never read (along with a lot of people who did the same).
<br />
<br />
He tried to login to his account, but can't seem to get past the forgot my password. The second email registered looks like an old email account of my sister's and she doesn't remember the password either.
<br />
<br />
I tried filling out the form that you can use if you can't reset your password and they emailed him saying they needed more information (subject lines of emails). I'm not sure if he ever wrote back, but he said he tried to call a number for customer service
 and didn't get anywhere. <br />
<br />
When I send an email to that account now, I get a bounceback saying: "The error that the other server returned was: 550 Requested action not taken: mailbox unavailable"
<br />
<br />
Any advice is appreciated!<br />
<br />
<br />

            Thanks so much for the quick reply. So if I am receiving bouncebacks, does that mean the account is inactive? Just want to verify. I hate for Dad to lose all those emails:(<br />

If by "all those emails" you mean the ones sent to yahoo, we have no control over Yahoo.com.&nbsp; They should be in your sent folder on your mail and if that is either Hotmail, or outlook.com we can help you find them.<br />

    <title>Import External Data&#58; LIVE Currency Rates - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Import External Data&#58; LIVE Currency Rates</h2>
                    Hey all,&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp;I'm doing a pretty large spreadsheet that I use to link to several other spreadsheets. There are multiple bank accounts; all of which are in USD except one, and I want to import the live currency exchange rate to correctly modify the values into USD.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can't figure this out for my life.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've gone to Data (in the menu) &gt; Get External Data &gt; New Database Query and it says I don't have the ODCB Driver installed. The link Excel provides me then explains that I am unable to get this version in Japanese and must find an English version.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've gone to the Data tab, and under external data sources, chosen HTML, added the saved webpage (Page Source) file, and gotten a new workbook with the entire site, that does not update itself when the rate varies. When I save the file as a Web Archive
 I don't get any response.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This task seems rather simple, and I'm afraid I must be going about it all wrong because I can't imagine it being this complicated.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>PLEASE, PLEASE, help. I have been Googling for days and have found nothing that works. All I want is one cell, I1 to be exact, that displays the currency converter of $0.939172 (CAD-USD at the moment) in it. Please make my life simpler :)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you for any help you can offer...although feel free to try it on your own Mac Excell 2011 before responding and getting me all excited for nothing...this has also happened and I can't take any more failure.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>:) Thankssss</div>

<div>and then when i open it; it opens up a new workbook with the entire site info; but its not live. it just gives me the information on the site at the time I saved it. This one I saved as a web archive (which makes sense why it's not live) and the CAD file

            Hi Sara,
<div><br />
<div>So you are using a Japanese version of Office for the Mac? If not, the "Important" message shown on the page does not apply. And "Yes" they could have made that a bit clearer that it only applies if you are running a Japanese version of Office.</div>
<div><br />
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cccd1503-f3c5-412a-924b-15f51e239d7d" /></div>
<div>So if you are not using a Japanese version of Office then read on and it says that you have to get the ODBC drivers from a 3rd party vendor.</div>

            No; there is no way I have to buy $500 software to do this. The only point was to save me a step in my reporting and didn't remember it being so complicated.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>If anyone can suggest a place to find ODBC driver software that is $50 or less, I would be willing to do that. Otherwise I can just manually edit it each day.&nbsp;</div>

            Hi Sara,
<div><br />
<div>I don't see a way to insert a Web Data link directly from Excel 2011. However, what you can do is open your workbook on a PC, I used Excel 2013 to test, and insert the Data Source link there. Then bring it back to your Mac and the Refresh button does update
 the data from the source.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>When I open the WB on the Mac it does tell me that the Data Connections have been disabled but after enabling them and pressing Refresh it works.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps</div>

            Hi Sara,
<div><br />
<div>The name of the feature you are referring to is called <b>Web Query</b>. Unlike the Windows version of Excel, In Excel on the Mac you can’t get to the Web Query feature using the Ribbon. Notice that on the
<b>Data</b> tab of the Ribbon in Excel for the Mac, there is no<b> From Web</b> button like there is in Windows Excel. In both Mac and Windows Excel it is not obvious that the name of the feature you are referring to is Web Query.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>The Web Query feature does not involve ODBC or external drivers. There’s nothing extra to buy.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Excel comes with a built-in web query that might be what you are looking for regarding currency exchange rates. These easy steps will demonstrate the web query. Your Mac must have a live internet connection in order for this query to work:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>In Excel, start with a new worksheet</li><li>On the <b>Data</b> menu choose <b>Get External Data &gt; Run Saved Query</b></li><li>The Choose A Query dialog opens</li><li>Select <b>MSN MoneyCentral Currencies</b> and then click the <b>Get Data</b> button</li><li>The <b>Returning External Data</b> to Microsoft Excel dialog opens</li><li>Click the <b>OK</b> button</li></ol>
<div>Excel will then fetch up to the minute currency exchange rates from Money Central.&nbsp;</div>

    <title>stop auto-delete of client email messages - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> db327  say:</h3>
<h2>            stop auto-delete of client email messages</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently got a treo 800w with WM 6.1, a big change from PalmOS...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been wondering why email messages on WM keep disappearing.&nbsp; They delete themselves and don't go to the Deleted Items folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These messages are downloaded from a POP3 account, which is&nbsp;a temporary pass-thru account.&nbsp; I just realized that the messages are deleted from WM when they are removed from the POP3 server (and stored permanently on another client).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't want these messages to be deleted from WM.&nbsp;&nbsp;These are active messages that I want to keep in WM, sometimes indefinitely.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any way to stop these messages from being deleted automatically from WM?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance...</p>

            There is a setting in the POP3 options where you can specify how far back the mobile device will store messages.&nbsp; Given the memory limitations of mobile devices, the default is only set to store 3 days' worth of email messages, so as you download messages,
 the older ones are removed to make way for newer messages (the email is not really deleted, it is still on the server).&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
You can lengthen this time period by opening up the Messaging application, selecting the POP3 account you created, then tap Edit Account Setup &gt; Next &gt; Next &gt; Next &gt; Next &gt; tap the down arrow to the right of "Download messages" and select your desired time
 period.<br />

<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I already have the "Download messages" set to "All messages".&nbsp; I thought that changing that setting&nbsp;from the default of 3 days might solve the problem, but it didn't.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It appears that WM is synchronizing&nbsp;messages deleted from&nbsp;the server, thus automatically deleting those messages on my mobile device (without warning).&nbsp; This behavior is highly undesirable (stated politely).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anybody out there found a way around this "feature"?&nbsp; This is a very unusual implementation for a&nbsp;POP3 client.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance...</p>

<p>As Prof Julie replied, the key to them being deleted on your WM device, likely resides on the client PC also connected to that POP3 account, and is not likely related to your WM device settings at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will make a bold assumation, that the client PC is using Outlook, and in the accounts 'More Settings' (from the Change E-Mail Account are of Account Settings) it is likely not set to keep email on the server after retreival, which is the default
 setup within Outlook.&nbsp;&nbsp; I always set my POP3 accounts to leave the messages on the server, with a 10 day window, and also mark the option to delete from server when Outlook deletes them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have a web access interface for this POP3 you can log in thru that and see if the emails are truly gone - and if so, this would prove it.&nbsp;&nbsp; You may test making sure your PC client email application is closed and see if when your device
 retrieves emails, if they stay on your device until you reopen your PC client email application.&nbsp; From my experience, email that is setup on mobile devices (WM and Blackberry from my knowledge) never remove the items from the POP3 host server, until they are
 deleted by the device (Blackberry you can actually setup options to only delete from device, and not server - WM does not) - this way you have option to keep your device clean of emails, but always have them on the client PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

<p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is true that the client PC is using Outlook.&nbsp; It is set to keep messages on the server, for 3 days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When that client&nbsp;PC deletes the message from the POP3 server after 3 days, it appears that WM detects that the message&nbsp;has been deleted from the server and decides to automatically delete&nbsp;the message from&nbsp;the mobile device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is precisely the problem.&nbsp; The WM client should NOT delete these messages automatically.&nbsp; I still want the messages&nbsp;on my mobile device even though they are no longer on the server.&nbsp; As I mentioned earlier, I keep some&nbsp;messages on my mobile
 device&nbsp;indefinitely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keeping the message&nbsp;is how every other mobile device and POP3 client I have ever owned works.&nbsp; At a minimum, this delete behavior should be configurable.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would greatly appreciate if anyone has a solution to this problem.&nbsp; This is a show-stopper for me, and I will return this phone if&nbsp;I can't find a solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance...</p>

<p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is true that the client PC is using Outlook.&nbsp; It is set to keep messages on the server, for 3 days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When that client&nbsp;PC deletes the message from the POP3 server after 3 days, it appears that WM detects that the message&nbsp;has been deleted from the server and decides to automatically delete&nbsp;the message from&nbsp;the mobile device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is precisely the problem.&nbsp; The WM client should NOT delete these messages automatically.&nbsp; I still want the messages&nbsp;on my mobile device even though they are no longer on the server.&nbsp; As I mentioned earlier, I keep some&nbsp;messages on my mobile
 device&nbsp;indefinitely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keeping the message&nbsp;is how every other mobile device and POP3 client I have ever owned works.&nbsp; At a minimum, this delete behavior should be configurable.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would greatly appreciate if anyone has a solution to this problem.&nbsp; This is a show-stopper for me, and I will return this phone if&nbsp;I can't find a solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance...</p>

Ok, I have actually answered this one before.&nbsp; But I'll put this out there again.<br />
<br />
As the WM Client is NO MORE than a "Sync" software with E-Mail client Tendencies.&nbsp; This means that if it is on the server, it will be on your phone.&nbsp; There are 3 things you could do to fix this.<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; On your PC, Turn off "Delete Messages from server after download"<br />
<div>- This way, the files would always be there and therefore, never "disappear"
<br />
- Downside: most E-Mail servers have a Storage limit and is possible to reach this, depending on your daily load<br />
<br />
2. Set up a Back up E-mail&nbsp; and forward to this server<br />
<div>- I would Suggest Gmail (Google Mail). They have insane amounts of storage for each of their members. I know, I have one.
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fforums.microsoft.com%2fWindowsMobile%2fWebResource.axd%3fd%3dNySzF1eivP_rMoc50GQJzcvS4MHMOEKwYrCIgDtzuzlw7GsNki3H_INlfYaLgkxFCLVvZNcnIJT9x2uZNvyuIGWah9F3g0vyQYx7NayjHus1%26amp%3bamp%3bt%3d633337194230757564" /><br />
<div>- DO NOT set up your PC E-Mail Client to Download Messages from the Back-Up E-Mail. Instead access ONLY from a web browser.<br />
- Most E-Mail Clients have either "Rules" or "Filters" that you can set up. Set up a Rule/Filter that forwards the wanted E-Mails to the Back Up E-Mail. By "Wanted" I mean either ALL or only those from a specified domain or e-mail, etc.<br />
- Set up your WM E-Mail Client to Download from the Back up E-Mail. Be sure to Tell it to Downlaod ALL Messages.<br />
- As you are not Downloading/deleting it from the Back-Up Server, they will always be there.<br />
- The only Downside, though small, is that it may be an extra 10-15 minutes before it show up in your Back-up email, after you download it from the Initial Server. As you have do d/l it, the rules/filters process the emails and resend them, it has to find it's
 way to the new server, all the while, being scanned by various servers for viruses, etc.<br />
3. SYNC<br />
<div>- This is probably the simpilest, but is also, sometimes a pain.<br />
- Open your WM Mail Client. It should open on the "Select an Account" page (listing "Text Messaging" "OutLook E-Mail" "&lt;Whatever Mail Server you have set up&gt;" and "Setup E-Mail")<br />
- Select [Menu] -&gt; [Options]<br />
- Hightlight /press "OutLook E-mail"<br />
- Set the Features the way you want (Download the Past: "ALL", Message Format, Size Limit, etc)<br />
- Sync your WM Device to your computer.<br />
- This way ALL MESSAGES that have downloaded to your Microsoft Outlook will be SYNCed into your phone.<br />
- Downside: If you only want, for instance, your work e-mails, and you download them and your personnal E-mails to that computer, you get THEM ALL. Also, after SYNCing, all messages Deleted off of the computer you sync with, will be deleted off of your WM Device
 as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope one of these solutions help you....<br />

<p>ThreeTima,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply.&nbsp; I really appreciate you taking the time to write such a detailed response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You hit the nail on the head with your statement that the WM client is Sync software, not an email client.&nbsp; The WM/Treo documentation should make&nbsp;this distinction clear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, none of the options you suggested&nbsp;are&nbsp;viable for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. My current email providers have very low limits on email storage.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>2. I store large amounts of email on my primary client system, organized using folders,&nbsp;rules, and filters,&nbsp;and backed up regularly.&nbsp;&nbsp;I use a client-centric email management paradigm. I download messages from numerous accounts and manage&nbsp;them
 locally.&nbsp; For many reasons (which I won't bore everybody with), switching to&nbsp;a server-centric email management solution is not practical, nor am I willing to give up complete control over my email by storing it on an external provider's server.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. I have GB's of messages.&nbsp; Sync'ing all of them to the mobile device is not possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use my mobile device to track a small subset of important messages.&nbsp; Some of those messages might be a year old, but I still need to track them on the mobile device.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It should not be necessary to implement the workarounds&nbsp;suggested to emulate POP3 functionality.&nbsp; As a previous PalmOS owner, one of the reasons I bought a WM device is because I thought it would behave more like Windows (and Outlook) than other
 devices on the market.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you work for Microsoft, or if anybody from the Microsoft Pocket Outlook group is monitoring this thread, the lack of true POP3 support on WM is a
<strong><em><u>SERIOUS</u></em></strong> deficiency.&nbsp; Just because many people are moving to Push technology doesn't mean you can abandon true POP3 support.&nbsp; POP3 on&nbsp;WM&nbsp;should work just like Windows Outlook - download a copy of the message from the server,
 then optionally delete it from the server.&nbsp; Period!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I mentioned previously, this issue is a deal-killer for me. If I can't find a good POP3 client within the next days, the 800w and WM are going back to their makers.&nbsp; Between this issue and unresolved Send problems,
<strong><em><u>email on this device is useless</u></em></strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Thanks again for your detailed response.

            You see this as a serious deficiency, but you are probably in the minority here.&nbsp; Quite a few people do not manage their work&nbsp; from email (have you read "Getting Things Done"), but that is entirely a personal preference.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, mobile devices have only limited and fixed storage space (email is saved to main memory) and are not able to store an unlimited number of email messages.&nbsp; Furthermore, mobile devices were never intended to function as a primary repository of
 on a mobile device.&nbsp; (have you installed any backup application to your device yet?)&nbsp; At the very least, you should maintain all these email on your computer.<br />
<br />
Nonetheless, there is 3rd party messaging applications that you might check out.&nbsp; Some of them allow you to create folders and save messages to your created folders.&nbsp; You may find it somewhat tedious to use because you will have to maually choose to copy or
 move the email to these folders and if you have numerous messages you wish to save it could be time consuming, but once the emails are copied or moved to the folders, you will not lose them when you next sync your email.<br />
<br />
Having just reviewed the email category in this year's Smartphone &amp; Pocket PC Software Awards, I recommend you review the following applications to see if they meet your needs:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.pocketinformant.com/products_info.php?p_id=mail&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">FlexMail</a></li></ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.npopuk.org.uk/downloads.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">nPopUK</a></li></ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.pocketpcfreewares.com/en/index.php?soft=1344" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">QMail</a></li></ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.lonelycatgames.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">ProfiMail</a></li></ul>
In my opinion, FlexMail and nPopUK are the two best applications in the mix.&nbsp; FlexMail looks the best, has the nicest user interface, and is really easy to use; nPopUK provides some great functioality (for free), but the user interface is dated and setting
 things up is not so straightforward (it also does not handle IMAP email, but that probably won't be an issue to you).<br />

            <span>I would also like to point out that you can "SYNC" just a certian amount of them.&nbsp; I.E. you can change it to 1 month, if you don't want to have ALL of your messages.<br />
<br />
Also, another option is to Forward those you want to save for longer to, as I mentioned before, a back-up e-mail.<br />
<br />
As Prof also said, there are also other POP3 clients.&nbsp; But as you also stated, you have GBs of Messages. Even if you get a POP3 mail client, eventually you will have to Delete them manually because you can, and probably will, run out of space.<br />
<br />
I, personally, as said by the Prof, like it the way it is.&nbsp; If I have a message I wish to save, I forward it to my hotmail account, or my G-Mail account.. that way I can access it anywhere. even on my phone, either by the WM Client or by a Web browser (I use
 Skyfire, which is awesome, btw).<br />
<br />
Ultimatly, it is up to you.<br />
<br />
Hope you find your answer soon.<br />

            Thank you for your followups.<br />
<br />
I tried FlexMail, but got an error trying to install it:&nbsp;
<p>"FlexMail_4.01_setup is not a valid Pocket PC application"
</p>
This error is odd, because other folks have successfully installed FlexMail on an 800w.<br />
<br />
I've been using POP3 email on PDAs as I described above for 10+ years, long before Push/Sync came into vogue.&nbsp; I save nearly all messages on my main client and delete nearly all messages on my mobile device, keeping only those that are important/timely.&nbsp; I
 always have a copy on my main client.<br />
<br />
While I appreciate your suggestions, it seems really odd and cumbersome to create a separate account &amp; forward my "important" messages to that account merely to work around POP3 deficiencies or lack of configurability in this product.<br />
<br />
If others prefer this auto-delete behavior, that's fine.&nbsp; But, there should be a configuration option to choose whether the client behaves like a traditional POP3 client or whether it behaves like a Push/Sync client and auto-deletes messages.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Just like there is an option whether to delete messages on the server when they're deleted from the client, there should be an equivalent option whether to delete messages on the client when they're deleted from the server.&nbsp; I should be able to decide which
 messages stay &amp; go on my device.&nbsp; The device shouldn't decide for me.<br />
<br />
thanks again...<br />

<h2>            Burned CD Won&#39;t Play Past A Certain Track</h2>
                    <p>This isn't the first time this happened, but it's started to upset me. I'm using a CD-RW to burn songs onto and every time it takes almost 30 minutes and has an error. It'll play almost all the songs, then cut. It'll make some glitching sounds and then stop
 playing that song and every song after it. I'm using Windows Media Player to burn the songs, and it looks like it's doing them until I try to play them and they completely stop. Is there something I can do to burn a CD and keep all the songs actually playing?
 A program other than Windows? Or a way I can prevent this? If you need any more information, feel free to post a comment/answer below.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi - CD-RW discs are notoriously unreliable. Have you tried using a different disc? The best test would be to try a CD-R - even if it means wasting one or two. It will indicate if the fault is with your optical drive (which may just need a gentle clean)
 or the RW disc itself. I have binned numerous RW discs over the years - I still use them for test runs but they often just stop being reliable after a period of time (or occasionally never work very well from day one!)</p>
<p>Cheers, Ric.</p>

<h2>            nokia 808 gallery button not working whilst in camera</h2>
                    Hi all<br />
<br />
Had my 808 for a week, and I have been delighted with it, in fact I had no issues with it until an hour ago!<br />
<br />
I was taking some pics of my kids when the screnen when black, it would still take photos but I cannot see anything on screen. This is not great but a restart sorted it<br />
<br />
But since this incident when I am in camera and I click on the gallery in bottom right to see my latest photo, nothing happens, this is really annoying. I have to go into the gallery to view photos. The transition still works and the photo thumbnail in the
 camera UI works, but button is useless<br />
<br />
I have restarted phone a few times<br />
<br />
Any ideas guys?!

            Well I solved it in two ways<br />
<br />
Firstly I took out the memory card, when I put it into my pc it immediately' fixed' it and this sorted it<br />
<br />
I had also moved all the videos I had into my images folder on my memory card under a new folder '102NOKIA' so they would show up in gallery but this seemed to really slow the phone down and messed with the gallery icon in camera, so I've moved them all back
 to videos<br />
<br />
I love this phone but it really does need a software update or two, the gallery specifically needs to be more efficient with increased functionality, its crucial to a phone sold on its camera!

<p>great to hear that its fixed.&nbsp;&nbsp; i forgot to mention that i too connected my memory card and deleted a video that won't play in the phone and couldn't be deleted as it was always 'open'...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I guess that considering it's 1.3 gig processor,the quick opening of the gallery in itself is a big thing, apart from the smooth zooming&nbsp; and editing action, but i guess it could use a few tweaks.</p>

            I just managed to recreate this issue, the problem is USB OTG!<br />
<br />
Both times that I have had this issue it was immediately after I had backup up my photos via USB OTG onto a memory stick. Switching phone off and pulling the battery for a few mins solved it<br />
<br />
Did you use the USB OTG feature prior to the issue?

            I had noticed a few glitches such as gallery not launching from camera and camera taking photos but screen black. However, when I disabled the app Extra Buttons, as suggested in the thread "808 camera won't open", all the camera and gallery problems went
 away.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<p>nope... had never heard of that feature, let alone use it......in my case, i beleive it was because of a video file that somehow remained always open, and i figured it was overloading the processor somehow, like it happens in windows sometimes, so i removed
 the video and restarted the phone and voila, problemo solved...'</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i just have to mention that the pureview takes photos with amazing bokeh effects... kudos to nokia again for the excellent camera......screw the belle criticisers... for they just didn't experience the pureview for want of&nbsp; a couple million apps that they
 won't use anyways....:)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks for the tip with uninstalling the extra buttons app matthewleech.</p>

            <p>Hi, I am having the same problem when trying to use the sweep function in my outlook email. The success rate is about one in twenty, meaning, I'll receive a "successful sweep" statement, and then the next twenty attempts (or so), I'll get the "something
 went wrong" statement. I've tried clearing my cookies and cache firefox history, as suggested in another inquiry, but nothing changed. I've recently discovered the sweep function since I've recently started receiving way too many awful emails out of the blue,
 some of which are offensive, and I wish to make it so that I do not see them anymore. Is there an explanation as to why the seep function is not working, and is there another function I can use to accomplish the same thing?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your attention to this problem. Frustrated and annoyed ~ AKing-san</p>

            I have noticed that it seems to be any spam email that starts with an address of info.(whatever afterwards). why this is an issue i don't know but it needs to be fixed as it seems almost all spam begins with an address like this anymore.<br />

            <p>I was wondering if it is not just the info. but the format of the email address, but I would like to see if others can confirm.</p>
<p>Every one that fails for me has the email address displayed as follow: &lt;" &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt; "&gt;</p>
<p>I am unsure what these extra brackets etc are for, but I am also wondering if this is what has stopped these emails from automatically being picked up as spam also.</p>
<p>The spam used to work quite well, the odd one would sneak through, but that's to be expected. One of the main reason's I need to sweep is because of the sheer volume of spam emails in my inbox, and these are the exact emails I need to sweep!!!!</p>
<p>I hadn't checked my email for 2 weeks. Normally in that time I would come back to 50 approx emails.... This time it was over 1000. And because of the spam and failing sweep I am basically sitting here hour after hour deleting all this spam individually,
 hoping to eventually get to the few emails I actually need.</p>

            Why does this show that 12 people had their problem solved? I have the same issue and may just get rid of the email altogether. There don't appear to be any solutions posted here.

            Hi, I haven't heard anything back from you on this. I don't have any add-ins enabled and the system is still hanging up when I click on the file tab. It seems to be running a check for issues. How do you disable this. I don't need to check for these issues
 and it's pretty annoying. The system doesn't even give enough information about how to resolve the issues if I wanted to. Please let me know.

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thanks for your response.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Since application Safe Mode is working, try disabling the add-ins associated with Office applications and check.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To do that, do the following.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Open Excel Click on File and then click on options.</span></p>
<p><span>2. In the Options Window click on Add-ins.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Select Com Add-ins in the Manage list in the Add-ins section and click Go. Now uncheck the all the add-ins and click Ok.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For more information on managing add-in, refer to the Microsoft article provided in the previous post.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>If the issue still persist, you may repair Office 2016 installation and check if it helps resolve the issue.</span></p>
