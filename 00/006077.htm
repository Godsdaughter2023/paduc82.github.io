<p>What keyboard did you buy?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks from your typing that keys are sticking. I would probably return it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an aside, I use the Microsoft foldable keyboard and it is flawless in my experience plus it is great to pack because it is so thin!</p>

<p>What do you mean 'sticking'? Physically keys are not sticking. This is a programmatic problem. It is not obvious from my typing that keyboard itself is bad. This may be caused by the software&nbsp; issue, which is more obvious.</p>
<p>Why would I buy Microsoft's staff, there is a lot of half-price models present&nbsp; on the market, which is compatible with 3 types of devices. The problem is, it doesn't work good enough with Windows&nbsp; 10 Mobile due to some software issue, obviously.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ok I've got your point, you mean if something isn't working with Microsoft, this is a problem of whoever else but not Microsoft's.</p>
<p>Once again, I&nbsp; want Microsoft no more. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft's keyboard can be used with Microsoft products only.</p>
<p>This is not working for me. I will never buy a product made by the OS developer for the only reason that nothing else works with it.</p>
<p>These are the arguments for the monopoly support, resulting in higher costs and lower quality, which Microsoft is&nbsp; successfully demonstrating.</p>
<p>Also I just want more flexibility. I want a device which is compatible with everything.</p>
<p>And this should work with the OS that has no reasons not to.</p>
<p>You may argue about wasting my time etc, well thank you for your care about my time efficiency, but still this is not an argument for me.</p>
<p>I just want things to work how they should, how I want and how I need, how it makes more sense&nbsp; for me and the way giving&nbsp; more benefits for me, not the&nbsp; way simplifying things for monopoly. Do I have a right to expect the OS to
 be working properly with all kind of devices it should to? Are there devices which are not supposed to work even if they were designed to do so? What would be your opinion?&nbsp; May I just buy a keyboard which is supposed to be working and get it working?
</p>
<p>Well, here's my opinion. This keyboard, it doesn't seem not to work at all, there's just an issue which must be fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt; if a <span>key is repeating when you type then something is wrong with the keyboard.</span></p>

</p><p>What makes you think that the fault lies with Windows and not with the keyboard ? The responsibility for the compatibility of third party hardware is 100% with the manufacturer and not with the OS provider. How can you be so sure that the compatibility claims
 of a random cheap keyboard from ebay are 100% accurate ? Especially when the listing itself states (in bad english) "suitable

<p><span>"What makes you think that the fault lies with Windows "</span></p>
<p><span>The fact that Windows 10 is a buggy trash and these kind of bugs are now common. For example, there's still<span> (more then a year) a bug with the onscreen</span><span> touch virtual keyboard when switching&nbsp;</span></span> languages. I've reported
 this bug and provided all the logs, but it's still not fixed for years. And no one cares. This is a small example of all of my user experience with Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These things make me think this is Microsoft's software bug, not of a simple&nbsp; hardware. I believe such a simple device&nbsp; should&nbsp; not have any hardware problems in it, why would it? The fact it is Chinese makes no difference here. This is a keyboard, not a
 quantum computer.</p>
<p>As to Microsoft, more I use its products, more problems arrive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Simple&nbsp; things are no longer reliable. Additionally to annoying user interface bugs, which are never fixed, there's a lot more.</p>
<p>They occasionally delete users files, are you aware of that?</p>
<p>Recently my Pro activation suddenly had gone, due to an officially approved bug.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway this is all off topic unrelative to the bug itself. There's no need to argue what makes me think so or other way, the problem is unresolved.</p>

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Underneath each key on your keyboard is a flexible material that when the key is pressed, it pushes on the flexible material and presses on a microswitch. It just seems to me that for whatever reason, that
 flexible material is not working as expected and continues to be in the "down" position for longer than what it is supposed to which tells the device to continue to send that same signal.</p>

 I have not even considered the microswitches are faulty).</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">One would hope you can purchase a keyboard and get it to work. If it does not work then you contact the vendor and ask for help. Most reliable 3rd party vendors would send a replacement. Again, I would
 use the money back guarantee from eBay.</p>

<p>First of all, I'm not gonna argue with Microsoft's advocate. But I appreciate your opinion and your market review. Just let me buy what I want.</p>
<p>Second, it seems like...too many remote diagnosis without the patient presence :)</p>
<p>Your point&nbsp; that the&nbsp; keyboard is sending signals which shouldn't be sent - is not convincing for me.</p>
<p>I'm not aware of the&nbsp; Bluetooth protocol, maybe the keyboard SHOULD send these signals if there's no due response&nbsp; from the OS. So, it is not yet clear which side is misbehaving. From my own experience such issues could easily&nbsp; be on Microsoft's responsibility
 because of the bugs related to the protocol or something else.</p>
<p>Why would you be so sure of your conclusions?</p>
<p>You can't make such conclusions without even seeing a keyboard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted the seller, of course, and asked if this item&nbsp; is broken or this is its feature.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Depending on the answer I will choose some decision from the list of my options.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I find your answers irrelative to the&nbsp; question&nbsp; asked. I don't really need an advice&nbsp; on how to use ebay.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Greetings.</p>
<p>Recently we have upgraded our office 2010 to office 2013 in our environment. We are now doing UAT phase. We have seen for a user that 'Bing map' as is showing grayed out in excel , also while accessing the 'app store' it is&nbsp;showing as 'access denied to catalog'.</p>
<p>All the system are in domain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some observation from my end</p>
<p>======================</p>
<p>1. We have checked&nbsp;&nbsp;in 2 other system with 3 different user(having different rights) and we have found that it is working ok for those user in those system.</p>
<p>2. There should not be a trusted site issue as in other systems this is working fine.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; There should not be user specific issue we have already checked this.</p>
<p>4. I have not yet got any chance to make that particular user to log in to another system and check whether this is working or not.</p>
<p>======================</p>
<p>Could you please let me know if there is anything I am missing here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Avisekh Das</p>

<h2>            Edge Not Working in 15007 or 15014 on Surface Pro 3</h2>
                    <p>Since updating to 15007, Microsoft Edge is not working on my Surface Pro 3 at all. &nbsp;When I click on a link, Edge will run, but the page is never displayed. &nbsp;The same thing happens if I key in a search term or URL. &nbsp;I can get the "Where to next?" page and
 text box, but nothing happens when I attempt to search or go to a web page. &nbsp; Anyone else?</p>

                    <p>This is a document-specific error that comes up when I try to create a new style, even though none of the nested styles I've created in this document are more than 3 or 4 layers deep. I'm not having this problem with other documents, so I just need to figure
 out how to fix this one. Has anyone else seen anything like this? Thanks!</p>

            <p>This was probably some sort of corruption.</p>
<p>Do note that you will get the error message you cited if you try to nest styles in eleven levels or more, that is, if style 1 is based on style 2 which in turn is based on style 3 etc.</p>

    <title>Default proofing language setting isn&#39;t working in Office 365, - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Default proofing language setting isn&#39;t working in Office 365, Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Regardless of my&nbsp;<em>Default Editing Language</em> setting (File-&gt;Options-&gt;Language-&gt;Choose Editing Language), all of the Office apps keep using my&nbsp;<em>Windows Display Language</em> as the default proofing language.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that the problem isn't that the setting for Default Editing Language in Office is changed each time I restart, but that it simply doesn't seem to matter what I've set as my Default Editing Language.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done the following testing:</p>
<p>Changing the Windows Display Language also changes the proofing language when I open a new Office document</p>
<p>It's not only the Danish spellcheck that isn't kicking in - no matter what my Default Editing Language is, the proofing is dictated by the Windows Display Language.</p>
<p>The Windows 'Country or Region' setting doesn't seem to matter.</p>
<p>Even deleting English from the list of possible proofing languages (within Office) doesn't make a difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone experienced this problem? Do you have a solution or a workaround?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are screenshots of the two setting menus I've been talking about:</p>

<p>Hello&nbsp;Andreas Østergård,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I replicated your concern using one of the Office applications which is Microsoft Word. Upon checking the Review tab of the application, I tried disabling the
<em>Detect language automatically</em> option. I was able to use the language I want to. You can check the images below as a reference:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to the <strong>Review </strong>tab then click <strong>Language </strong>option</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8599bd13-7cfd-4bd7-8f92-e68224104a26?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8599bd13-7cfd-4bd7-8f92-e68224104a26?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Disable the <strong>Detect language automatically</strong> option then select the language you want to apply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9418e4a4-bcac-4f65-abf8-887981272141?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9418e4a4-bcac-4f65-abf8-887981272141?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Click <strong>Set As Default</strong>. You will now receive an popup asking if you want to keep the choosen language as default.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click <strong>OK</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please respond to this thread to let me know how the issue progresses. Similarly, if you have more questions, please inform me by replying to this post.</p>

<p>Thank you for helping me out! Sadly, it doesn't seem to solve the problem. It's quite odd really, because the fact that the&nbsp;<em>Detect language automatically&nbsp;</em>checkbox should be empty is retained when I restart word, but the chosen language is not.</p>
<p>According to the message, what is happening is a change to Normal.dotm. I don't think my issue is in Normal.dotm, since it shows up in all of my Office apps.</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;Andreas Østergård,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to follow with this concern, since the suggestion above didn't work, you can proceed with repairing your Office. You can check this
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> for the steps.<br />
</p>
<p>If repair didn't help, you can use the <em><strong>Easy Fix tool</strong></em> to completely uninstall Office. The download link for the tool is provided on the same article. Once done, try re-installing Office and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To notify us and have us get back to you, simply reply to this post.</p>

<p>Hi Jomel Ber</p>
<p>I tried to run the Repair, but it didn't solve the problem</p>
<p>I've now tried to uninstall Office with the Easy Fix Tool, but that didn't help either. However, the Easy Fix Tool seems to have run into some problems along the way which might be to blame. I ran it again (with the same results) in order to screenshot what
 it had to say:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/718d42af-6792-4229-8e87-7323c292424d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/718d42af-6792-4229-8e87-7323c292424d?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>I restarted, but all of my Office apps were still installed (and exhibiting the same behavior)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to just uninstall Office from Apps and Features (I've got the following two programs)</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d16ad9f7-5564-4fea-91b4-7b32b1ab5e42?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d16ad9f7-5564-4fea-91b4-7b32b1ab5e42?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Which one should be uninstalled? Will uninstalling delete my custom stylesheets etc.?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, thank you for taking the time</p>
<p>Andreas</p>

<p>Thank you for standing by. If you want to manually uninstall Office, you can try to uninstall it via
<strong>Control Panel &gt; Programs &gt; Uninstall a program</strong>.&nbsp;Uninstalling Office only removes the Office applications from your computer, it doesn't remove any files, documents, or workbooks you created using the Office apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have additional questions, or if the issue persists after the troubleshooting steps above, please let me know by replying to this thread. This way, I'll get notified and respond back to you as soon as I can.</p>

<p><span>I've now un- and reinstalled office. My custom style was no longer default, but that was solved by changing Normal.dotm. However, my proofing problem wasn't solved. As it turns out though, what I had before was the
 Microsoft Store version, and what I installed now was Office 365 from my school (Office 365 ProPlus, I believe). In this version, I had the option to separately change the Office Display Language (It didn't follow the Windows Display Language). This meant
 I could change the Windows Display Language, thus changing the default proofing language, while keeping the Office Display Language English. I lost Cortana along the way, but I'll be able to deal with that.</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for helping me out!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Edit: Nevermind. All my Office apps behave the way I described, except for Onenote 2016. Even though it says the Office Display Language is English - it isn't. It's following the Windows Display Language, so it's Danish. Since OneNote 2016 is where I do
 most of my typing and using shortcuts, well... I'm afraid not a lot have been solved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't take this as a personal attack against anyone - but I find it quite odd how many places in Office the right setting seem to be available, but changing that setting simply doesn't do anything. Why is there even a 'set proofing language'-option if the
 proofing language still follows the Windows Display Language? And why has OneNote 2016 got a 'set Display Language'-option when that, too, follows the WDL?</p>

<p>Thank you for the update and I truly understand where you are coming from, Andreas. With regard to the OneNote issue, I just want to clarify if you're using OneNote 2016 that came up with your Office suite or the OneNote for Windows 10 (pre-installed). To
 know the difference between these two applications, you can refer to this <strong>
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/what-s-the-difference-between-onenote-and-onenote-2016-a624e692-b78b-4c09-b07f-46181958118f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're using the pre-installed OneNote for Windows 10, it would depend on the languages installed on your computer to check the spelling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll wait for your update.</p>

<p><span>Hi </span><strong>Andreas Østergård</strong>,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I appreciate you for confirming the version of OneNote that you’re using. As what was mentioned, the proofing language of your other Office applications are now working as expected, however, OneNote 2016 still doesn’t. To isolate if the issue is just
 with OneNote 2016 version, would you be able to try using the <strong>OneNote for Windows 10</strong> and see if the proofing language will work accordingly. Click here to download the app, just in case you don’t have it yet installed. Then, refer to this
 article: <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/check-spelling-in-onenote-for-windows-10-91d36aa5-637c-4dcc-8a0f-acdd9a6f2acb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Check spelling in OneNote for Windows 10</a></strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Please respond to this thread to let me know how the issue progresses. Similarly, if you have more questions, please inform me by replying to this post.</span></p>

<p>Hi Louie Del</p>
<p>I've now done a bit of testing on OneNote for Windows 10, and I can confirm that it follows the language that is on top of the 'preferred languages' list in Windows. In this screenshot, the Windows Display Language is Danish, and the language on top of the
 preferred languages list is English - and OneNote for Windows 10 is in English.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2e3f4b00-2eeb-44d5-98f4-792ee58460b9?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2e3f4b00-2eeb-44d5-98f4-792ee58460b9?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Using OneNote for Windows 10 isn't really an option for me though - fx I heavily rely on the equation tool in OneNote 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, just to clarify, the Proofing Language of my other Office applications isn't working as expected per se - it is still not following the setting within Office, it is instead following the Windows Display Language. However, since my other Office apps
 are now 'stuck' in English for the Display Language, regardless of the WDL, I can set my WDL to Danish. If the settings&nbsp;<em>did</em> work though, I would prefer to have my WDL be English, because Cortana isn't available in Danish.</p>
<p>The situation can be boiled down to this: </p>
<ul>
<li>The Display Language in OneNote 2016 is stuck to Danish. In my other Office apps, it's stuck to English.</li><li>The proofing language in all of them follows the Windows Display Language.</li><li>In OneNote for Windows 10, the Display Language follows the language on top of the preferred languages list</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: I've just discovered an important detail. I've only got the English Language pack for Office installed - this is why it's stuck to English</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5de51a9f-0ebd-4187-837b-a33e427c512c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5de51a9f-0ebd-4187-837b-a33e427c512c?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>However, since I've got 365 ProPlus, OneNote 2016 is not included in this, and as such it's a separate installation -&nbsp;<em>and this installation is in Danish</em> (da-dk)</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ece91d55-05d7-4e4d-9c21-0268414e58f4?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ece91d55-05d7-4e4d-9c21-0268414e58f4?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>But I installed OneNote from&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/install-or-reinstall-onenote-2016-for-windows-c08068d8-b517-4464-9ff2-132cb9c45c08" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>, and there's no option to install a specific language.
 So do you have an idea as to how I may go about getting the English version installed instead? I feel confident that, if I could do that, my problem would be solved (although I would lose Cortana, since I'd still have to let my WDL be Danish).</p>

    <title>Cant get any new Windows 10 updates. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cant get any new Windows 10 updates.</h2>
                    I have been searching the forums and the web to find a solution to why I can't update windows 10. I have currently not found any and have tried many different suggested actions. My current problem is that I am stuck on Windows 10 Home Insider Preview Build
 10162. I have been stuck on it for a long time but it only started causing me problems when I was warned it would shut down from time to time eventually escalating to not letting me turn my computer on. I was wondering if there is some way I haven't found
 or if I am going to have to buy a full version of windows 10. I had windows 7 Home Premium installed before I had updated but I cant seem to find the rollback option. I will appreciate any suggestions and help.

<h2>            Flash problems with Windows 8.1 and IE 11</h2>
                    <p>Ever since I updated to Windows 8.1 (my laptop and Surface RT) I haven't been able to use any page or content that uses Flash.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm told to&nbsp;download and install&nbsp;the latest version, but the Adobe site tells me that Flash is embedded in IE for Win 8. When I "test" Flash I'm told that I'm not using IE. This is while I'm using IE to view the site. This occurs on the desktop IE and the
 start screen IE.<br />
<br />
Any help would be much appreciated ...</p>

<p>I have a question on first time Windows Mobile 6 use. I live in the US, but am buying a smartphone from the UK.&nbsp; The phone is unbranded and unlocked.&nbsp; I wrote the manufacturer, which told me the phone in the US and the UK have the same specs
 ("devices sold in UK and US are the same").&nbsp; Under windows Mobile 6, then, when I turn this phone on for the first time, will it prompt me for my location and set all settings accordingly, or do you think it will be "pre-set" to the UK (i.e., currency, weight,
 spelling, etc.)?&nbsp; I've never had or used WinMo before!!<br />
<br />
Thanks a ton!!</p>

    <title>Opening Visio files in Visio Online within SharePoint- default - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> darren graham &#40;darren.graham&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Opening Visio files in Visio Online within SharePoint- default zoom&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have a share point library containing many visio cross functional process charts as part of our Quality Management System.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Users access a modern share point home page which has a file viewer web part for which I have assigned the visio drawing representing the high level business model of our processes. Users then click on the various shapes to open the appropriate cross functional
 diagrams</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that our cross functional flowcharts use vertical swimlanes and are in portrait orientation(printable to A3/A4 if required), so when the user opens a process from the home model, the default behaviour is to open the diagram in full screen
 mode - landscape window with portrait drawing in the middle and effectively we cannot read the detail without zooming in using the slider at the bottom (or CTRL + mouse). Default zoom is about 45% and we really need 100% to read the detail of the shapes etc.
 and when you go from process to process or even pages within a process diagram the zoom resets every time to full page. Incredibly annoying and not user friendly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything in the back end setting of SharePoint or is there a piece of code which we can apply so that when visios are opened in Visio Online the default behavior is to load at either 100% zoom or page width.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that converting the diagrams into a landscape format with horizontal swimlanes would solve the problem and would fill the screen real estate better but due to the volume of diagrams, resources etc that is not an option for us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help or suggestions would be welcome.</p>
<p><br />
</p>

<p>Hi Darren,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your clarification. Based on my test, we are not able to set up a specific zoom value when opening files with Visio Online. As we discussed above, you may submit the feedback via SharePoint Uservoice. This is the best way to let the related team
 hear your voice. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your understanding. </p>

<h2>            Excel 2010&#58; How to pull data from an unknown number of sheets&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've created a simple little invoice template in Excel that works nicely for me. &nbsp;But I'd like to do some basic reporting for each month. &nbsp;My workbook has these sheets:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Totals - Template - Inv1 - Inv2 - Inv3 ----</p>
<p>
</p><p>The totals is obviously where I'm looking to get my basic reporting info. &nbsp;The template is where I copy from when making a new invoice, and then the 1 2, 3, etc are my individual invoices. &nbsp;I know the formula to get the data from multiple sheets, for example
 I can do =sum('Inv1'!A20+'Inv2'!A20+'Inv3'!A20).</p>
<p>
</p><p>But here's my problem... I don't know, month to month, how many Inv# sheets I'm going to create. &nbsp;Obviously I can, at the end of the month, redo all my formulas, but this will be a royal pain. &nbsp;Is there a way to use wildcards when creating these formulas?
 &nbsp;What I essentially want is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"If the sheet has a name of Inv*, then grab the value in cell A20 and add it."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then no matter how many sheets (invoices) I create for this month it'll get me the correct data.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t Change Skype Status, Among Other Things - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nathanrode  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t Change Skype Status, Among Other Things</h2>
                    <p>I started having a few issues with Skype yesterday. Mainly, when I open the Skype app (7.59) on my MacBook Air 10.13.2, it logs me in, but I'm listed as offline, as are my contacts. I can't change my status. If I select online or away, it just reverts to
 offline. My contacts that are listed offline are online as they can still call me and I can still call them. But once I tried to merge calls yesterday for a three-way conversation, it wouldn't let me. That's it in a nutshell. I hit up Skype Support on Twitter
 and they acknowledge my message, asking for my platform, OS and such. That's where it was left, about 12 hours ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure this has any effect, but I first noticed all this early Friday afternoon. Early Friday morning, we had lost internet, as we just had a snowstorm. We have Spectrum. AT&amp;T was out in our neighborhood the day before. We never completely lost power.
 Our internet came back in just a couple hours. I noticed I couldn't merge the calls so I tried the whole uninstall/reinstall route. When I installed the "Skype for Mac" option from the web site, I got a Skype loading window that just spun forever. Bailed on
 that, downloaded "Classic Skype" and that opens up and logs me in, but I obviously have the online/offline and merging calls issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I record Skype calls for work and it's something we do routinely so I'm hoping I can get some answers quickly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has any suggestions, I'm all ears. Thanks in advance!</p>

            I created a new account to see if that would work as a temp solution. It seems to be fine. I logged out of the new one and back into the old one and it says I'm online. Haven't tried calls yet as it's Sunday, but it was a positive step at least.

<h2>            Emoticons not working after Microsoft update</h2>
                    I use the emoticons everyday on Skype but after the recent Microsoft update last night, they have not been working. I can see them when I type them in to compose a message to someone but when I send it to them it either disappears or it turns into text.
 I also cannot see any emoticons that anyone sends me. I’ve checked under the settings and the box to show the emoticons is checked. Any ideas?

<h2>            Excel 2010 Hangs While Print Spooler is Running&#33;&#63;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I'm not sure this is the right forum, but I'm having a really weird problem with Excel 2010. Just installed it and found that I had trouble printing and trouble using Excel. Excel just hangs... I can click on the cells but none of the menus work. Funny thing
 is, I noticed that when I stopped the print spooler (because of my inability to print) I noticed that Excel started working. I've tested this behavior several times - all with the same result. It doesn't make sense to me. I'm not getting the same problem with
 Word or Outlook...</p>
<p>I'm running on Windows 7 x64. Does anyone have any suggestions? I've tried repairing Office and uninstalling the print and document services under Programs/Turn Windows Features on or off. Neither have helped.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            I just HAD to respond to this answer. I am having the same issue. It happens wityh my Samsung Laserjet printer, my HP Laserjet printer, my Epson inkjet printer, my HP Deskjet printer and yes all my printers.  So to the asnwer of "if it works fine with XPS writer have your printer manufacturer develop a better driver" I say HA! You sir are not paying attention to the question.  I am about 2 hours from returning my Office 2010 product and downloading open office, I **** you not!

    <title>Excel Cell Formatting Question &#40;Excel 2010&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> larrysweet  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel Cell Formatting Question &#40;Excel 2010&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to change the color of cells representing bits in a controller status word (32 bits) based on a value in another cell.&nbsp; See picture below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My conditional formatting formula is as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=BITWISE_AND($E$20, (2^($F20-1)))</p>
<p>
</p><p>$E$20 is the 32 bit controller status word</p>
<p>$F20 is the column with the bit positions within that word.&nbsp; (Note: not all bits are used in all cases).</p>
<p>I am changing the background color for the descriptions in column G to indicate that that bit is on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This formula works for all values up to 65535 (0xFFFF) but fails when I go over this value.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I get a formula to work for all values between 0x0 - 0xFFFFFFFF</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried having a separate range for the high order word by dividing the controller status word by 16 to simulate a bitwise shift right but that didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there an easier way to accomplish this using VBA?&nbsp; I am new to this programming in Excel so am not sure how I would accomplish that and what event I would trigger on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any and all insight would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My bitwise functions are as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Public Function BITWISE_XOR(x As Long, y As Long)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BITWISE_XOR = x Xor y<br />
End Function<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Public Function BITWISE_NOT(x As Long)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BITWISE_NOT = Not x<br />
End Function<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Public Function BITWISE_AND(x As Long, y As Long)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BITWISE_AND = x And y<br />
End Function<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Public Function BITWISE_OR(x As Long, y As Long)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BITWISE_OR = x Or y<br />
End Function</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

</p><blockquote>This formula works for all values up to 65535 (0xFFFF) but fails when I go over this value.</blockquote>
<p>I can not reproduce that issue, your code works up to 0x7FFFFFFF which is the largest value hat fits into a Long.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest that you use this function instead:</p>
<p>
</p><p>#If Win64 Then<br />
Function BITAND(ByVal A As LongLong, ByVal B As LongLong)<br />
#Else<br />
Function BITAND(ByVal A As Long, ByVal B As Long)<br />
#End If<br />
&nbsp; BITAND = A And B<br />
End Function</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if you have a 64-bit Office you can also get the last bit at 0x80000000. </p>
<p>Furthermore you can remove that function on XL2013 and above, this versions have this (and more functions for bit calculations) built in.</p>

Function BITAND(ByVal A As LongLong, ByVal B As LongLong)<br />
#Else<br />
Function BITAND(ByVal A As Long, ByVal B As Long)<br />
#End If<br />
&nbsp; BITAND = A And B<br />
End Function</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if you have a 64-bit Office you can also get the last bit at 0x80000000. </p>
<p>Furthermore you can remove that function on XL2013 and above, this versions have this (and more functions for bit calculations) built in.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for the information Andreas.&nbsp; You are correct.&nbsp; With further testing I do see that my code is working for all but the most significant bit.&nbsp; Unfortunately I don't have 64-bit Office so I can't use the LongLong data type.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will have to find another solution to handle this one case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps I can modify my range and have a separate formula to check for the FFFFFFFF case and set that bit individually?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems like there should be an easier solution though ....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other suggestions for this case?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<p>Well, IMHO in your case, the basic question is: </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the status word from the controller &gt; 0x7FFFFFFF?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so:</p>
<p>a) The last bit is set.</p>
<p>b) You have to subtract 0x80000000 from the status word to get the lower bits with the function.</p>

<p>Thank you for the reply Andreas. &nbsp;Yes, the controller returns a full unsigned 32 bit value. &nbsp;I am just looking for a simple way to modify my original formula to handle this high order bit.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Access to Exchange Online with ADFS outage</h2>
                    
<p>ADFS experts, can you please assist me in better understanding the impacts for ADFS outage from an Outlook 2016 client perspective?&nbsp; I understand that users that haven't authenticated via ADFS prior to an outage would be unable to access Exchange Online,
 but what is the user experience for a user that authenticated to Exchange Online prior to ADFS becoming unavailable?</p>
<p>Are there specific settings in ADFS that can be used to extend token validity at the risk of reducing the security design?</p>

<p>I saw this blog post, but it doesn't explicitly state the ongoing authentication behavior of a client.&nbsp; Seems to just indicate what the initial authentication behavior, which isn't helpful in answering my question.</p>

<p>That depends mostly on whether you are using Modern authentication. Outlook 2016 is enabled by default, so should be your O365 tenant, unless you have specifically disabled those. With Modern auth enabled, the client gets and access and refresh token, and
 can remain active up to 90 days even if your AD FS is inaccessible. Granted of course he already has a valid token.</p>
<p>If not using Modern auth, max you can get is few hours (8 if memory serves right).</p>

<p>Vasil, this is very helpful. &nbsp;I do not believe that we'll be able to utilize Modern Authentication because we'll be using Exchange Online and on-premises Lync.&nbsp; "On-premises and hybrid deployments aren't supported topologies for modern authentication (ADAL).
 Support for modern authentication (ADAL) for on-premises and hybrid topologies is on the roadmap and will be announced in the future." &nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3126604" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.microsoft.com/.../3126604</a></p>
<p>Beyond that, can you refer me to documentation that details why Modern Authentication can remain active up to 90 days and why non-Modern Auth has a max of a few hours? &nbsp;Are these configurable values?</p>

<p>Good stuff. &nbsp;So if I'm interpreting the link you provided correctly, users connecting with Outlook 2016 utilizing Modern Authentication will be able to continue to utilize Outlook 2016 and Exchange Online without issue for up to 60 minutes from the time
 when their token was granted or refreshed.</p>
<p>Can you refer me to any documentation that details the non-Modern Authentication timeouts? &nbsp;Are these timeouts dependent on the TokenLifeTime value defined in the RelyingPartyTrust configuration within ADFS?&nbsp; From what I've read, 0 value in TokenLifetime
 property is default and represents 60 minutes.</p>

<p>They will be fine until the refresh token is valid, as having a refresh token means they can talk to EvoSTS and get another access token automatically, bypassing your AD FS server.</p>
<p>The non-MA timeouts are also listed there, those are the general values listed against each workload in the table. You cannot override those with any setting on your AD FS.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, the article that you referenced, <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Session-timeouts-for-Office-365-37a5c116-5b07-4f70-8333-5b86fd2c3c40" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.office.com/.../Session-timeouts-for-Office-365-37a5c116-5b07-4f70-8333-5b86fd2c3c40</a> &nbsp;only applies to browser based clients, which include Modern Auth. &nbsp;I don't see session timeout details that would apply to Outlook 2013 or Outlook 2016 configured
 with ModAuth disabled. &nbsp;Am I missing something? </p>

<p>Hi ME3994,</p>
<p>Upon researching, I find no other official article has clarified the session timeout time for non-modern authentication Outlook client.</p>
<p>As far as I know, it should be several hours. But no official document provides the exact time.</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding and efforts.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

            <p>Hi sebrof,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Here's a couple of things about scheduled scans. To run, the PC must be on and connected to the internet (it cannot be shutdown, in sleep mode, in hybrid sleep mode, or in hibernation). The power saving settings must be such that the PC does not shut
 down or go asleep during the scan (or it will be as if it never happened). <b>Scans do not begin precisely when scheduled - some can start an hour or so earlier or later than the officially set time (depending on Microsoft's servers and the loads at that time)</b>.
 There is a way to use Task Scheduler rather than MSE to awaken sleeping computers, run the scans, and then shut them down when done, but it is somewhat complex. More on that shortly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Also, go to settings and check scheduled scans and uncheck the box that prevents them from starting unless the system is on and idle (if you're using the system when it's scheduled or it otherwise isn't idle - perhaps downloading Windows Updates or
 doing something else - then the scan will not start and will be missed). If a scan is missed it does not start at the next available time, but waits for the next scheduled scan.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Go to Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Services / scroll to Task Scheduler and make sure it is started and automatic. If not set it to automatic and restart it. If it won't start, click on the dependencies tab and do the same thing for
 each of the ones listed. If any of those won't start, continue with it's dependencies and do the same thing. When you get to the end, reverse course and Start the ones you couldn't because of the dependencies as you go until you get to Task Scheduler and hopefully
 it will now go to automatic and start. If you changed nothing read on. If you changed anything, reboot and see if that helps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>There is a way to use Task Scheduler rather than MSE to awaken sleeping computers, run the scans, and then shut them down when done, but it is somewhat complex. You can also use it to create different scheduled scans of different types since MSE only
 allows one choice.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Please see </span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/running-mse-full-scan-as-a-scheduled-task/f627f5ce-0b74-4b1d-be64-d6ceeb4d9b02"><span>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/running-mse-full-scan-as-a-scheduled-task/f627f5ce-0b74-4b1d-be64-d6ceeb4d9b02</span></a><span>
 - especially the later corrections from GreginMich.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The post from GreginMich here </span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/scheduled-scans-not-working/fd769043-f67e-4990-8805-a02427f22dff"><span>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/scheduled-scans-not-working/fd769043-f67e-4990-8805-a02427f22dff</span></a><span>
 will also be useful.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I'd also suggest the post from GreginMich here </span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/i-would-like-to-schedule-mse-to-scan-pc-with/58474560-4cca-49c1-a51a-76ca9bc3b9f2"><span>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/i-would-like-to-schedule-mse-to-scan-pc-with/58474560-4cca-49c1-a51a-76ca9bc3b9f2</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I hope this helps. If not (which would be uncommon as something above "fixes" most such problems), then there may be some other problem with the MSE installation that we need to address and do a more thorough troubleshooting - so please post back with
 what you did, what did and didn't happen, any error messages, and and anything else you think might help us to help you.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>

Change the power settings so the computer does not go into hibernation, sleep, energy saving mode, etc while you're running a scan.</p>
