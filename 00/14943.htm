<h3> andyandjunewilliams  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 725 windows 10 alarm ringtone customisation</h2>
                    Just changed to windows 10 on my Nokia Lumia 725.&nbsp; Have changed all ringtones I want to, but the alarm keeps defaulting to pathetic tinkle that wouldn't wake anyone up.&nbsp; Any ideas?&nbsp; I've been down the usual route, have saved my choice of ringtone but it
 still defaults to tinkle.

<h2>            Map Loader Nokia</h2>
                    I have a Nokia N70 with memory card included. I installed Nokia Maps with Pc Suite on the memory card and whenever i open Nokia Map Loader to put some maps on my phone it says "no storage device detected.......and something more but in the same sense"
 . What should i do, should i use a card reader ? Or should it work just whit my phone connected in USB ?

            Hi andu_tm<br />
<br />
Have you run Nokia Maps application on your N70 at least once with memory card in place, to define folder structure required by Maploader application?<br />
<br />
As N70 is S60 2nd edition there is no "data transfer" facility for leaving memory card in phone, so you need to place in card reader on your PC.

            Hi andu_tm<br />
<br />
You are given the choice of "network connection" being "as needed" or "never". If you have a cheap data plan you could enable connection as it would then download map data as you zoom down to your position, but it is not essential as necessary data is saved
 when you exit the program.<br />
<br />
You don't mention which external BT GPS receiver you intend using with Nokia Maps, which application will ask for when run.

            Hi CanEnv567  
<br />
<br />Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Outlook doesn't support subcategories natively (as in Color Categories). You can make your own subcategories using a naming convention - "Category - Subcategory" format - or by assigning 2 categories to an item, or by using colors. For example, Red color is the "category" and subcategories are the names assigned to the red color.  Outlook subcategories
<br />
<br />You can't create a separate subcategory system but you can create a custom form with extra fields that might help. Use the keywords field type  - note that it won't allow you to group by both category and subcategory fields, but you can create multiple keyword fields that might meet your needs. A screenshot is on my subcategories page linked above. I prefer using the naming convention method - i feel it gives me more options for sorting and grouping - not perfect, but as close as outlook is going to let me get. Two categories work well if you use filtered views - filter to show only items assigned to the main category then group by category to group the "subcategories" together. 
<br />
<br />Manage forms: Go to File, Options, Advanced - Custom forms button, then Manage forms. Screenshot: <a href="http://screencast.com/t/aquCfWeK5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://screencast.com/t/aquCfWeK5</a> its not a very useful screenshot since none of my test forms use categories, but in looking at the list of forms, I could use personal and business categories and a subcategory for the type of customization.

<h2>            Outlook keeps forwarding emails and I cant stop it&#33;</h2>
                    I had my outlook email set to forward my emails to my gmail account. I wanted it to stop forwarding them but when I went to settings&gt;options&gt;connected accounts there were no accounts listed that emails were being forwarded to! I ended up deleting my gmail
 account and started a new one so that I would no longer receive the emails from my outlook account. But now every email I receive &nbsp;on my outlook account has an attachment from MAILER-DAEMON because it cant forward that message. This makes it very frustrating
 the read and sort through emails and I just want it to stop, but I dont know how because it doesnt show up in the settings. Please help!

            hard reset your device.<br />
<br />
turn it off<br />
take the battery out<br />
hold the power button for about 5 seconds to drain any residual power<br />
put the battery back in<br />
reboot the device<br />

this does happen on occation, and in my case, this helps it reset.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It did not solve the problem. On the other hand I got my 3G, and T-mobile logo back but still no SMS. Any clues?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can send receive MMS, use internet, talk, but no regular SMS text messaging.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            try to delete the thread that you are having problems with.<br />
<br />
there is a glitch in the n900 that seems to be triggered by someone sending you a message that is more the 140 characters and is broken up into 2 or more messages. it doesnt happen all the time, but seems like i have problems when that happens if i am too fast
 and start to open the first message and the second populates after it.<br />
<br />
some of the symptoms are:<br />
<br />
cannot see messages,<br />
you can see the message come in, but cannot open it.<br />
only see the messages you send.<br />
avatars missing<br />
messages not sending out.<br />
<br />
so, if you dont mind loosing some sms...then delete them all and see if that works. if not, report back.<br />

<p>Hi Linely!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for responding to my question!&nbsp; I have the HTC Touch with Rogers Wireless.&nbsp; I don't have any programs running in the background, I actually opted to have the Task Manager close programs with a single tap (so that shouldn't be the problem
 I think? especially after the problem still occurs a few times after I use the calender program, immediately following a soft reboot).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On another note, I have another &nbsp;problme with the data connection turning itself back on by itself when I turn it off to specifally use Wi-Fi only.&nbsp; Very annoying since I think I'm surfing the net free of charge when only to discover that I
 was on the data connection the whole time!!!!! grrrrr......</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks again!</p>

<p>Since a soft reset doesn't seem to cure the isue because it re-occurs, I wonder if there was a program that you might have installed that is causing the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It might be worth trying a Hard Reset and without loading anything "extra", see if it all goes well for a few days.&nbsp; If it does, try adding one thing at a time to see if you can determine the culprit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I might also consider sending a note to HTC to see if this is a know issue.&nbsp; I had a Touch for a couple of weeks so I could see how it worked for forum questins ... I did not experience this.&nbsp; Although I also did not add any extra programs.</p>

<p>Good idea, although I didn't add any programs at all to the device.&nbsp; The only thing I downloaded were some songs for the music player.&nbsp; You think that would be the culprit???</p>

            I forgot to comment on the data connection turning on.&nbsp; You have to have something set to automatically check at a specific interval.&nbsp; Email possibly?

<p>I do have the email to check about every hour so it may be that, but even though it's checking, why wouldn't the device automatically use the Wi-Fi connection that's currently on?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as the calender program not consistently working, for some reason, it hasn't been a problem as of late, and I didn't really do anything in terms of deleting extras, hard reset etc.....grrr...go figure.......</p>

<h2>            How to filter out data rows that contain a value from a list&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry if this information exists elsewhere-- I am having trouble finding the right keywords to search for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have data across multiple columns, 4000 rows long.</p>
<p>I'd like to filter out rows that contain one of a long list of values.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, fake data: 4000 rows of this:</p>
<p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Red Beret</td>
<td>3433</td>
<td>342</td>
<td>$23332.00</td>
<td>
<p>January</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Texas Blue Bonnets</td>
<td>3423</td>
<td>346</td>
<td>$2342.00</td>
<td>
<p>January</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Susanna</td>
<td>23423</td>
<td>564</td>
<td>$345.00</td>
<td>February</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Houston</td>
<td>232</td>
<td>56</td>
<td>$25.00</td>
<td>March</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Green with Envy</td>
<td>23432</td>
<td>876</td>
<td>$60,034</td>
<td>March</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</p><p>
</p><p>List of 1000 values like these:</p>
<p>Red</p>
<p>Green</p>
<p>Blue&nbsp;</p>
<p>Purple</p>
<p>Pink</p>
<p>Turquoise</p>
<p>Magenta</p>
<p>
</p><p>Goal: to separate the rows that contain the listed values from the rows that do not.</p>
<p>So in this example I'd like to end up with a full list of all rows that include color names in one place, and a full list of all rows that do *not* include color names in another place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this possible in Excel, using relatively basic steps?</p>

            Look in help for advanced filter. You can arrange the criteria to do exactly what you want. As you are setting up the filter, do not chose filter in place.<br />

<h3> masterofevil22  say:</h3>
<h2>            AMD 390X support in Windows 10 - Please Assist</h2>
                    <p>So, I've recently purchased the MSI 390X 8GB and have installed the latest copy of Windows 10 Preview (as of the 4th of July). &nbsp;I can get all the way through the setup of Windows 10; while it's most likely using a generic display driver. &nbsp;However, once the
 program (Explorer.exe, unless they changed it..) starts up, aka Windows boots, I see nothing. &nbsp;It is just black. &nbsp;I normally boot to a 3x1 (3 1080p monitors) desktop. &nbsp;While I do have a TV connected via HDMI as well, it is not on by default. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went on AMD's site and they recommend using the latest drivers that are built into the preview, as there are no Windows 10 specific drivers (beta or otherwise) available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question then is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to transfer the 15.6 beta drivers that I have in Windows 7 64bit to the proper directory in Windows 10 and make that work? &nbsp;Or, is there another way that anyone else has had any luck with? &nbsp;I understand this card has just hit the market and
 Windows 10 preview is just that and changing/adding all the time. &nbsp;Just a shot in the dark. &nbsp;Any advice would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for being a part of Windows 10 Insider Program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand your situation and will help you in troubleshooting the issue. With the information, I understand that the issue has occurred due to incompatible Graphics card drivers, correct me if I’m wrong. I would like to inform you that we do have a work
 around for this and suggest you to uninstall and re-install the <strong>Graphics card</strong> drivers in compatibility mode and check if that helps. Here is the steps:</p>

            <p>Hi Aqariangirl,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no PAID version of MSE.&nbsp; MSE is only available free.&nbsp; If you see a paid version, it is a scam and you should avoid it as they are trying to steal your money or your identity or infect your computer.&nbsp; Even some of the free MSE sites out there are
 scams to infect your computer or worse.&nbsp; Get MSE <strong>only</strong> from the link below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To get MSE, first&nbsp;check out this article and follow ALL the procedures: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/check-list-for-installing-microsoft-security/bf757e6a-e320-4a67-92bc-767e6acb26c4">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/check-list-for-installing-microsoft-security/bf757e6a-e320-4a67-92bc-767e6acb26c4</a> - but also check out the next paragraph before you begin the download.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do or ever did have any other AV program installed on your computer (even if you didn't use it), you need to make sure they are all uninstalled and fully removed before you install. To fully remove them, check out this listing of removal tools<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91</b></a>
 or the listing in that article at the bottom under troubleshooting steps (why this link isn't at the top near things to do first where it discusses removing all the prior and current AV programs is beyond me) or, if not on the lists, go to the website of the
 AV software and get and use the removal tool for that product.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To install, go to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx</a> and click on languages and locales at the bottom of the Download button and then choose your language and the appropriate version for your operating system. When you download, save it to the
 desktop (rather than running it). When finished, right click on the installation icon and click run as Administrator (even if you’re logged in as an administrator) as I’ve found this sometimes helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Then you need to configure your settings, set a scheduled scan, enable real-time protection, update MSE, and then run a quick scan (or a full scan if you have time).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I hope this helps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>

<h3> mr_bean  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does Win7 64bit UAC stop Norton Antivirus running&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've also posted a question on the Norton Internet Security (NIS) forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After some problems of inadvertant installtion of malware on Father in Laws machine I removed said items and ran an update of NIS 2012 to NIS 2013, this all seemed to go fine, but after update I noticed NIS icon wasn't showing in System tray.&nbsp; To cut a long
 story short I reverted to NIS2012 but it turned out that Windows UAC was blocking many features of NIS2012 and also 2013.&nbsp; I can disable UAC and NIS will run fine, but switch UAC back on and NIS is restricted.&nbsp; It wasn't the case until after the update of
 NIS2012 to 2013.&nbsp; I've tried numerous uninstalls, Norton Removal tool and still it's teh same.&nbsp; I'm accessing the machine remotely which makes life harder but I'm out of ideas - any suggestions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Machine is running Win7 64 bit with all the latest updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

            <p>From the details in your posting at Symantec, the problem is likely due to the McAfee installation and/or issues with the Norton update itself, not with UAC.&nbsp; That's just a symptom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I'm posting here primarily to tell you that the best way to stop these&nbsp;problems is&nbsp;to create a Restricted [Standard user] account for your Father-in-Law to use regularly and keep the Administrator account only for use when you are calling in to
 help remotely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ran both a Windows XP and later Vista system this way for 2 young nephews through their tween to teen years and never got a true infection, nor had issues with rogue&nbsp;software installation since they simply couldn't do it.&nbsp; Of course I also never gave them
 the Administrator password and so had to deal with upgrades, etc. when I was around on weekends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this case, if you tell your in-law that he will be safer using the Standard account and have less problems, he'd likely understand and be willing to operate that way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your post in the Norton forum talks too much about the Norton 2012 history and not enough about the 2013 inwstallation failure, so you're likely to continue getting the useless types of responses about malware removal until you focus on that instead.</p>

Thanks Rob,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Agree with with the fact that UAC is just a symptom, but at the moment it's all I have to go on.&nbsp; Given that it wasn't a symptom before I updated to NIS2013 and afterwards it was, it points to something the initial NIS2013 installation did.&nbsp; I'm inclined
 to rule out MacAfee or Defender because I removed them before I installed NIS2013.&nbsp; What I'm trying to identify is what is causing UAC to work in this way even after several NIS2013 and NIS2012 removals and re-installations.&nbsp; I suspect someting failed to register
 corectly but identifying what, when or why is proving very difficult.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I like the idea of different user accounts, it hadn't crossed my mind to do this on a single user machine but it makes a lot of sense.&nbsp; Next opportunity I get I'll set up new accounts, who knows this may even cure the UAC/NIS issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I see what you mean about focussing on teh NIS2012 installation, but that's because all I did with NIS 2013 was update from NIS2012, notice a problem, attempt to fix it with a few uninstalls, NRT's and then resorted to returning to NIS2012.&nbsp; As far as I
 can tell at the moment the issue is the same with NIS2012/2013.</p>

            <p>Since those coming here to install MSE in place of Norton (any version) are always told to run the Norton Removal Tool that they provide due to problems just like this, that might be your best method.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just be certain you have your license information preserved somewhere, since this tool removes everything from the registry and files as I recall and so you'll likely need to re-enter that during a registration process once the tool and at least one full
 system reboot is completed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Never skip this reboot step with anti-malware [un]installs, regardless of what the products [don't]&nbsp;tell you, you'll always regret it later if you don't.&nbsp; I'm sure this is annoying on a remote connection, but it's generally the reason that the necessary
 processes don't complete properly and remnants of the previous product/version remain to interfere with the new product version.&nbsp; I've been doing this religiously for over 2 decades and virtually never have such problems as a result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You post in the Symantec Norton forums is the proper place to continue this, since those here would be more likely to be removing Norton completely in favor of MSE and other Microsoft products.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good Luck.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Already run the Norton Removal Tool (NRT) about a zillion times and yes, remote reboots do make it more difficult.&nbsp; It's interesting that you thought NRT removed all information, including product key, so did I, but to date all executions of NRT have not
 resulted in me having to re-enter the security key when I have re-installed - maybe this is another pointer to the real problem...</p>

            Wow, OK.&nbsp; Sorry if my question wasn't clear.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
The problem is, the emails do not print with the outlook-assigned category.&nbsp; Ironic that I was thinking it was your response that needed further clarification.&nbsp; By saying "...included in the view I want to print" are you referring to the print preview pane?&nbsp;
 I can only assume that you are, so by that rationale, no, the categories do not appear on the email's print preview pane.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
How do I make that happen?&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there a print option that allows me to print with category?&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
For further clarification and to clear up any confusion, my question is, how do I print emails that include the category, by color or name of category, or both?&nbsp; How do I get the email that I print out, to do so with any reference whatsoever to the assigned
 category?&nbsp; I am hoping to have the category show somewhere on the piece of paper that prints.&nbsp; This way when I am holding the email that I printed, rather than scan the email for clues as to what it pertains to, I simply make note of the color, know immediately
 what it pertains to and proceed quite happily.<br />
<br />
For even further clarification, here's an example.&nbsp; If you, Mr. Valentine community star, send me an email and I add it to the RED category that I have set up in Outlook for "People who don't know the answer but reply to my help forum thread anyway because
 they want to get bumped up to 'Community Rockstar'/Question Unanswered/Action Unresolved" and I then print said email, and notice that the RED category does not show in the print preview pane, nor does any reference to the category name, how do I get the RED
 color or the category name to show up on the piece of paper that the email prints on?&nbsp; Is there any known way to make this, seemingly uncomplicated command to happen?&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I would be most appreciative to anyone who understands my question, who knows the answer, and who is willing to respond with any meaningful help at all.&nbsp; I would be so thankful, so delighted, so joyous and burn candles at your feet in eternal gratitude, singing
 of your awesomeness and dancing in celebration.<br />
<br />
Happy Monday. &nbsp; <br />

            <p>Still an unclear question, and now&nbsp;a snide one as well. Outlook does not assign categories to messages. In fact&nbsp;Outlook strips categories from any messages it recieves that have a category assigned. You must be talking about Categories that you have assigned,
 not Outlook. If so, how are you assigning them? With Rules? Manually? Where do these "categories" appear on your message forms? In what format is the message? From what view are you attempting to print the message?
</p>
<p>The reason you get no answers is that you have not clarified your question. Post the precise steps you are using and what is not happening that you think should.
</p>
<p>There has not been a lot of development around the printing of emails in Outlook since by definition printing is not how emails are typically used.

<h3> jonathanbenbow  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 and uncredited 20gb OneDrive Storage</h2>
                    <p>It seems that there are countless issues with people not receiving their 20gb free OneDrive storage after purchasing an Office 365 subscription. I am one of those people and no matter how hard I try and no matter who I speak to, I cannot get this problem
 resolved. Using the live chat support I have spent several hours running around in circles from one agent to the other. Each session starts with the usual stock statements and questions which not only point out the obvious, but also show that they are not
 reading the notes of the previous encounter with one of their colleagues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This would be a typical conversation:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>"Hello, I have purchased a 365 subscription and despite my free trial ending 2 months ago, I have not been credited with the 20gb free storage. If I look in my skydrive account it is still showing only 7gb storage. I have checked to make sure I am using
 the correct account to login with and my 365 account was purchased using the same account. I only have one Microsoft account anyway, so that wouldn't be an issue".</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>"Hello, so I understand you have not been credited with your 20gb SkyDrive storage after purchasing an Office 365 subscription?"</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>"That is correct"</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>"Thank you. 20gb of storage is only added to your account once the free trial is over and the paid subscription starts"</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>"Yes I know which is why I mentioned in my original query (above) that my trial ended 2 months ago"</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>"Yes I see. Please make sure you are using the same account with SkyDrive that you used to purchase Office 365"</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>And so it goes on until we have gone through all of the precompiled statements and questions until we get to the point where the agent says "Please contact [enter support department here] as I do not have access to the systems to change your account".</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The departments I have been sent to: SkyDrive Support, Office Support, Microsoft generic support, these forums, Technical Support, Account Billing support, these forums again, Office support again.... and so on. Each time I am passed to a new support agent,
 I have to go through it all again from the beginning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This is, quite frankly, unacceptable. I am a paying customer who has chosen to purchase one of Microsoft's flagship products based on what Microsoft tells me comes with the package. 20gb of free storage is part of that package which I, and countless other
 people, have not received. Now I understand that payment systems, operating systems, cloud storage systems and locally installed software all have to talk to each in order for a transaction like this to work. I also know that sometimes technology fails or
 bugs escape through the testing phase and can cause issues for a minority of customers. That is all accepted and is part and parcel of a complex system.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>What is not acceptable is when a bug or a communication failure between systems is found it is simply swept under the carpet by lazy and unqualified support staff. This issue is clearly large enough to have gotten the attention of someone whose job it is
 to fix. I cannot believe a glaring error like this can go unnoticed by one of the worlds leading software companies. So why isn't even an acknowledgment of the problem being communicated to the customer? Why are the support staff so ignorant to it? Even if
 a solution has not been found, at least let those affected by it know that the problem is being addressed so we can all get on with our lives.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I tried again yesterday to get through to someone, somewhere, somehow. I went through the usual channels and jumped through the same hoops, hoping against hope that I would connect with someone proactive enough to take ownership of the issue and escalate
 it internally to people I simply cannot reach. Alas, all that happened was once again I was directed to these forums. So, once again I asked the question in the questions section, and once again I trawled through questions asked by others regarding the same
 problem. The answers were all the same, once the usual stock statements were made such as "you don't get the free storage until after the free trial", they were swiftly followed by the statement that should go down in the annals of Microsoft Support History
 - "We cannot help you here, you need to contact customer support". AAAAARRGGGH!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Interestingly I cam across a question that had a refreshingly different response. Have a read
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_365hp-office_storage/lost-20gb-additional-skydrive-storage-after/0b38e513-89ed-41f7-9914-4b335ba9c190">

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Now I don't know if the guy who responded will have his comments removed, so here is a quote from what he said so that it can be preserved:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em>I will probably get censured for this, but F* IT!&nbsp; I am so ANGRY and frustrated&nbsp; with those ignorant lazy paid morons shifting their work onto us and giving you the run around.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>&nbsp;Either he is stupid, or lying.&nbsp; We, on this forum have no access to MS internal systems. So how can we fix that sort of internal "accounting" error. If he was trained or competent, he, or someone he has contact with would fix your problem.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>&nbsp;Yes, there are 10's of thousands of people being misdirected to this forum for that question and other similar ones, either by misleading web links or directly by those lazy slobs telling people to come here.&nbsp; We see lots of people coming here explicitly
 because they are NOT getting help from paid support, when they clearly are the only ones who can fix those problems.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Rohn007, if you are reading this, thank you for your honesty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So where do we go from here? Cancel our subscriptions and use what? Open source office software? Its a possibility if you use Office, and especially Excel, only lightly and you have no need for OneNote or Access. Cancel our subscriptions and use pirated
 Office? Also a possibility, but potentially risky. Give in and just purchase extra OneDrive storage? Well, yes it is a possibility if you need the space. Continue trying to get the problem resolved and spend hours a day, each day, going around in never ending
 circles being passed from pillar to post? If you have the time and do not suffer stress too easily then this is a possibility. Or, to quote Rhon007, "use a bigger stick" and get the media interested in the issue. Try and generate some bad publicity. There
 are many respected tech blogs and forums where you can vent your frustrations. there is Twitter and Facebook too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I don't know what i am going to do right now, but I do know that the Surface Pro 2 I was eyeing up is no longer on my list of purchases, that once this laptop dies I will not be investing in another Windows machine, my Windows Phone will be replaced with
 Android or iOS when my contract expires and once my 365 subscription runs out it will not be renewed. My long standing relationship with Microsoft will be coming to an end unless this problem is resolved, and quite frankly a genuine apology is offered, before
 I jump ship. Like they say, I will be voting with my wallet on this one. Besides, its probably about time I took a fresh outlook on my computing needs. Android and iOS are forging ahead in the consumer market with an invigorated vibe and fresh feel about them
 whilst Microsoft seems aged and tired in comparison. They certainly don't seem too bothered about losing me anyway.</p>

            <p>I am facing the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My trial copy expired on 12th April 2014 and I tried to purchase the one year office 365 subscription online but kept failing with error of not able to create my order after I clicked payment at paypal. On 14th April 2014 I purchased a copy from retail shop
 and activated it on the very day. Everything went fine except I don't see the 20GB in my onedrive account. I contacted tech. support and was being passing around through the night. Answer desk and onedrive tech support remote into my system and checked. No
 solution and kept passing me from one tech support to another. In the end, told me cant help me. Seriously, I am so disappointed with MICROSOFT!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The worst is from tech to tech I need to repeat all the information and background again and again. The worst is I need to&nbsp;show&nbsp;to one of the tech that office 365 subscription did come with free 20GB! Then he added another user account on my subscription
 and show me the 20GB on that account. I need to show him is 20GB per account and my subscription is up to 5 accounts. Each account should have 20GB! My goodness I still need to train your&nbsp;tech on&nbsp;the product package that you are selling!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today is 17th April 2014. 48hrs! Oh please! Where is my 20GB? Don't tell me to contact billing department, office department or sale, customer service. I have&nbsp;contacted with all of them. everyone is pointing at another department!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>OMG!! I could not agree more.. I have spent the better part of the evening trying to get the One drive Space added to the only Microsoft Account I have.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start off with one support person and have to explain I purchased pre paid card form Best Buy when I bought my new Surface Pro 3. I created my one and ONLY Microsoft account and activated Office 365 Home. Logged into OneDrive with the same account and no
 space added. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The support person sends me a link to log into my Office account where is shows that I only have one active install and one person added to the Office 365. I logged into the account like they asked then spent the next 20 minutes trying to explain to them
 that there is NO OneDrive info listed in the Account Profile. I offered to send a screenshot several times and once it finally sunk in that there was NO OneDrive info listed in my Office account then they &nbsp;sent me a link to talk to someone else.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click on the link and get another support person..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again go through my issue and then I am told that I am not logged into the correct account. I asked well when I only have one account what other account would I log into. Then they said I need to log into One Drive separately.. Yes I know this and I
 am logged in where it only shows 7 gigs of free space and not 27 gigs like it should.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then he proceeds to ask me what my email address is. I tell him the email address and then he tells me that email doesn't exist. I tell him then how did I receive a confirmation email from Microsoft confirming my Office 365 activation. At which the support
 tells me I am being rude and disconnects the session. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I really do not understand how you have people working for you when they don't know how to support the product and don't know that there is an issue. When I have to teach the support person that I get 5 user accounts and each gets 20 gigs of space but I
 only have one account created and only one account activated. It is not rocket science.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think that this brand new Surface Pro 3 that I have and absolutely love is going back and so is Office 365. I just dropped $1600 on a products that their own people can't support and all they do is pass you to the next support person till the person just
 gives up and disconnects the support session or they are so frustrated after being sent to 5 different people and have to explain and type the same thing over and over again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It was a toss up between the Surface Pro 3 and the Mac Book Air because they have same specs and cost the same money. I went with the Surface because it turns into a tablet and I can use the pen in OneNote for meetings. However, this frustration and inability
 to get support that I need&nbsp;and is probably a simple fix it not worth all this. I have lived with not writing on a tablet in OneNote till now so it's not like I am loosing any functionality. I just looked at it as a bonus.

<h2>            Very annoying cross country subscription renewal with Office 365</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I bought Office365 via Amazon on the UK, but I live in Belgium.&nbsp; As an English speaker I don't want any of my websites or subscriptions in any other language.&nbsp; Now unfortunately MS have this rigid and dare I say stupid approach to your country of residence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can only do anything I want in a Belgium website, so I cannot get anything in English.&nbsp; If I go on a English version of the MS (Office) website, it insists I have an English address to renew my subscription, which I don't have (it has to be linked to the
 credit card).&nbsp; Whenever I try to renew my office subscription I keep getting put on an American MS store site, which is totally useless, even from the Belgian site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I want to do it pay MS more money to renew my existing Office365 subscription.&nbsp; Does anyone know simple site that can just pay to have a new Office365 Home license or renew my subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can order Office365 on Amazon.fr, I can only hope I can still install Office in English, but its a physical box they send, with a license code.&nbsp; I don't want to re-install everything, I just need to renew my subscription!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why does MS make this process so complicated!</p>
<p>

            This microsoft's behaviour goes in the opposite way proposed by the own company. The product should be united and easy to manage in a without borders world (considering the globalization process and the internet).<br />
<br />
I did my Office 365 account in UK. It expires now in July and I simply can't do the renewing in an easy way from Brazil.<br />
Why?<br />
Is it that difficult to manage the client's information across an "all-connected" world?<br />
It would be a significant improvement if microsoft start allowing region changes in Office subscriptions.<br />
It is quite easy on Xbox live.

<h2>            Missing contacts in PC Suite</h2>
                    Hi, I am currently running Nokia PC Suite 6.70.22 on Windows XP SP2 via Bluetooth. I can successfully sync my contacts between Outlook 2003 and my Nokia 6230i. All contacts that are in Outlook are sync'd correctly to the 6230i. However, when I view Contacts
 within Nokia PC Suite, some of the contacts are missing. The contacts are there when viewed on the phone. But there are not there when viewing through the Nokia PC Suite software. Does anyone have any ideas? Cheers William

            The contacts from the phone memory are just showed there.<br />
<br />
Can it possibly be that those contacts are stored on the SIM-card and not on the phone memory?

            All contacts are stored in the phone memory. No contacts at all are stored on the SIM-card.

            I think you have a sync problem with Nokia Phone Browser and phone. Since you have all of your contacts in Outlook, you could try to empty your phone of al the contacts and use it then with Nokia Phone Browser to make sure that shown empt list too.<br />
<br />
Then create new syncronisation settings with the PC Sync for contacts. Do that by selecting settings- create new-and follow the wizard through. (Note: important to do that so that you donät loose your contacts in Outlook, if Pc Sync things that you would actually
 like to "delete all"<br />
<br />
Now you should have all your contacts "freshly" in your phone. Now you can try to syncronise the contacts to Nokia Phone Browser.<br />
<br />
I had once tis problem with my earlier phone (was not 6230i though) and this trick helped me, but if you try do it properly so tat you don't loose your contacts.

            Thanks for this Professor. Unfortunately, I have already carried out this procedure several times. Yes, it sorts the problem initially but then when any contacts are added/deleted/modified, the problems returns.<br />
<br />
I think the problem is that the Phone Browser syncing is simply not up to the job.<br />
<br />
I was hoping there was a more permanent solution to this?

            OK, have you tried pressing the update botton in Nokia Phone Browser (a phone icon with folder) in upper part of the application. That starts the update whenever you make changes (if for some unknown reason it does not start automatically.<br />
<br />
BTW, I assume you have read this forum, if you get operation could not be completed message, you need to run a command to fix it. Search the forum using the error message and you will find the fix.

            I too am having a sync problem Nokia 6230 connected with Bluetooth (TDK Systems). Communication seems fine, but the Nokia applications have problems.<br />
<br />
I used v6.1 Data Suite, and although it reported the usage of both Phone (158) and SIM (10) memory, it did not pull a significant number of the phone contacts across. It did not seem to be because of the memory used.<br />
<br />
I thought an upgrade to v6.7 would sort it, but find the application to be more limited. It seems that the Data Suite doesn't evolve, it just revolves !!<br />
<br />
I now cannot see ANY sim contacts, and still several phone contacts are missing !! No stats are given in the new interface, which is more like an explorer Windows than an application. 152 in Contact Browser, 162 in actual phone (but not the new ones from Outlook
 yet)<br />
<br />
Entries from Outlook were brought in and an &amp; (ampersand) prefix added (although this shows in the summary pane to the left as an underscore)<br />
<br />
What is required is for Data SUite to pull ALL the contacts to the PC, allow the user to edit them, allow the user to change the storage(phone/SIM), or even BULK move between storage areas (so you can pull off one phone, and push to another), and to sync with
 the user's PIM, without loss or skipping of entries. Not much to ask this many generations on - other programs can do it !

            I have a similar problem. I recently changed from a 6610 and PCSuite v6.7 to a 6230i and PCSuite v6.8. After a few (un)installation problems discussed in other threads, I now have everything up and running. Synchronising with MSOutlook, I was able to load
 all my old contact list onto the new phone.<br />
BUT, when I look at the contact list via the FileManager, I see nothing. It seems empty, but I know it is not, because everything is present on the phone and in MSOutlook. It's not a disaster, but when I write an SMS on PC, I have to enter the destination phone
 number manually. With my old setup, I just had to write "Steve" and my mate Steve's phone number would be picked from the contact list.<br />
PCSuite is not picking up on the contact list in the phone's memory.<br />
Can anyone tell me why not?<br />

            My Contacts-folder in PC Suite seemed empty after successful synchronization. The simple solution for me was:<br />
Right-click in the Contacts folder (in an area outside active columns). You should get a list of options. Choose "Refresh" and answer "Yes" to updtae. That's it, or, at least it was for me: (6233 phone, Operating system:<br />

            Here is something what can be try also:<br />
1. If you use some old PC Suite version, update it to PC Suite 6.82 (unistall old version before of update).<br />
2. Press F5 button in Contacts folder.<br />
3. If that did not help, (and you are using PC Suite 6.82) see this:

<h2>            Lumia 640 XL built in Korea reverts to original language on upgrade to to W10</h2>
                    <p>I own a Lumia 640 XL built in Korea running W8.1. It came with the language of origin, but I was able, after some problems to find the English setting.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I needed an unlocked phone for use internationally and the dual sim is very useful when I travel. However, when I upgraded to W10 the phone reverted to to the original language and caused so much of a problem that I restored W8.1.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Due to lack of support for W8.1, I have lost some functionality, Skype being the biggest problem. Other programs have become unstable as well.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there some way to run the W10 upgrade and force the phone to retain the English setting?</p>

<p>When you had W10 on the phone a phone reset would reset to W10. When the phone restarts following a reset the first thing that is done is to set the phone language.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go back to W10, reset the phone. System, about, phone reset. Select the desired language when the phone restarts.</p>

<p>Thank you very much. But because it's in Korean, I find it almost impossible to navigate through the options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was hoping for a way to force it to remain in English during the update.</p>

<p>Hello Paul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Going through the menu with a different language is difficult. However, you can retain the English settings on your phone while on Windows 10. But before doing so, let us configure your phone's settings first by following the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Settings</strong>. You can do this by swiping your phone screen to the left to open the
<strong>Apps lists</strong>. Look for the gear icon which stands for Settings&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/702d207c-3705-47ae-bfb8-77d79c6bafc8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/702d207c-3705-47ae-bfb8-77d79c6bafc8" /></a>
 .</li><li>Scroll down and look for the Language settings which looks like this <strong>
언어. </strong>Another trick to recognize the Language settings is by looking for the time zone which looks like UTC -6:00. Language is the third settings from that.</li><li>Once you open the Language settings, you will see a plus sign <strong>(+). </strong>
Tap that icon and select your preferred language which is English.</li><li>Under the plus sign, you will see a box which means restart the phone (<span><span><strong>전화 다시 시작</strong>). Tap the box to apply the changes on your Settings.</span></span></li></ol>
<p><span><span>Next thing to do is to make sure that the Region and language settings are aligned.
</span></span>Go to Settings and then look for the region. Select your country or region and then restart the phone again to apply the changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After configuring your phone's settings, you can now upgrade your phone back to Windows 10 by using the Upgrade Advisor app. Always make sure to backup your files and settings to avoid data loss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Should you have any other questions, feel free to ask the Community.</p>

<p>Thank you for your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fortunately I was able to run the update without any major problems. It did an extremely long time tho, probably due to the number of updates needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My concern now is that, in just a few months, I may have to be looking for a new phone as a W10 "refugee".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again</p>
