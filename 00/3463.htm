<h2>            Why task added in Teams Planner tab will not show in Planner webpage</h2>
                    <p>I add a team in Microsoft teams and add planner tab for the team group. And then I add some task under the planner tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I go to Planner webpage of Office365 and under the same name group, I cann't find the task I added via Microsoft Teams.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has the Microsoft Teams connected to planner or vice versa?</p>

<p><span>Hi Li,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It’s an expected behavior that the newly created planner tab in Microsoft Teams will not appear on the Office 365 Planner page. If you want to see the newly created planner tab on a new webpage, please click the “Go to website”
 icon in the upper right corner of the team’s interface as follows:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d0c793c1-0066-4c8b-82f4-82b7e64b06c0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d0c793c1-0066-4c8b-82f4-82b7e64b06c0" /></a></p>
<p><span>Here is an article for your reference: <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/brismith/2016/11/17/microsoft-teams-and-microsoft-planner-what-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/brismith/2016/11/17/microsoft-teams-and-microsoft-planner-what-to-expect/</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Besides, if you use an existing plan when you create a new planner in Microsoft Teams, the tasks will be synchronized between Microsoft Teams and Office 365 Planner webpage. You can use creating a plan in Office 365 planner
 first, and then add it to Microsoft Teams as a temporarily workaround. If you have more concerns about this, I recommend that you vote for this feature via this link:</span></p>

            <p><strong>Update: </strong>Would you believe it...eventually it did finish restoring. For me it did take nearly 2 hours sitting on that status in the store, but eventually it is installed and seems to be working fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>------Original Message----</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just got this problem today and removing and then trying to re-install the Outlook Mail and Calendar apps. So I'm stuck without the&nbsp;Microsoft provided&nbsp;apps for Mail and Calendar at the moment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried wsreset.exe, it was the first thing I thought of to try, but it has no affect on the problem for me either. Sometimes getting a new Build can solve these odd little quirks, as I think that causes a re-installation of all the default apps at
 the moment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is if this occurs after RTM it's not going to be suitable to just say "Wait for the next build" to people who aren't on the insider program.</p>

            Just to tell that after installing Whatsapp it'll always remain connected to the internet &amp; there is no way to disconnect it. So it'll drain the battery quite fast &amp; will cost u a lot for ur data.

<p>Hi Spamcannibal,</p>
<p>Currently, Microsoft only supports URIBL, SURBL, Spamhaus(SBL,XBL, PBL) and invcaluement partner block lists as described in the following article:</p>
<p><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn458545(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn458545(v=exchg.150).aspx</a></p>
<p>If your emails from Office 365 are blocked or marked as spam by one of the services, we will surely help to remove from the block lists.</p>
<p>As we cannot prevent so many blacklists providers adding Exchange Online IPs into their blacklists, if the emails from Office 365 are marked as spam by some other third-party spam services, it’s suggested that customer contact the recipients’ side to let
 them add the custom domain he is using and the specific IP address which is blocked by the 3rd party blacklist to the white list.</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Robert</p>

<p>The blacklists you do or do not support is not the problem. The problem is the avalanche of spam that comes hourly from office365. It is not as if it is different unique spam, it is the same "do you want a loan" spam over and over. Don't you people use any
 kind of filtering at all? &nbsp;Office 365 is currently the worst spam offender in our blacklist and from what we can see you don't really seem to care. The is completely irresponsible. For a company that is the moneybags of the internet world it is also unforgivable.</p>

<p>Hi Spamcannibal,</p>
<p>Thanks for the updates.</p>
<p>In Office 365, we have the Outbound spam filtering in EOP is always enabled if you use the service for sending outbound email.</p>
<p>However, we cannot control the customers’ behavior to send out spam emails. Surely, if a customer continues to send outbound spam through the service, they will be blocked from sending messages.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Robert</p>

<p>Well if you take a look at the list of blocked IP's you will see that most of the events are not more than a week or so old and there are over 300 of them with more added daily. That ought to give you a clue that your spam filtering is absent or NOT WORKING.
 I repeat, currently office 365 is the worst spam offender in our block list. You can ignore it or fix it. I am providing this information to HELP Microsoft and its users. It's no skin off our back if the block list remains.</p>

<h2>            &#40;fixed&#41; Build 10565 edge locks up computer</h2>
                    <p>Howdy,</p>
<p>Since last night when I installed 10565 (12hrs) my laptop has locked up 4 times while viewing websites on edge, mouse stops then can not alt tab or anything. All I see is the hard drive light flickering but can not access anything. I end up having to hold
 power button till machine shuts off and then I restart and no mention of bad shutdown, just boots normally and edge launches itself and whatever tabs were open and after about 20 minutes of use it locks up again. Prior to this some times edge would just suddenly
 close I would have to click the icon to re open edge these are new issues since the new build was installed.</p>

</p><p>That's a symptom of a driver problem, not an application problem.&nbsp; The Event log may have some clues.&nbsp; If it happens frequently enough you could try adding a trace.&nbsp; Sounds like you should be suspecting the drive you notice staying active, especially if

<h2>            Can&#39;t connect to server - Error 815</h2>
                    Sending and receiving e-mails using Outlook 2007 has been OK for a long time, now it cannot connect to the server and comes up with Error 815 suggesting I contact my ISP for the service name field of the connection properties.&nbsp; My ISP says this is not
 needed and the fault is with Outlook.&nbsp; I have checked everything and it all seems to be OK.&nbsp; I have Windows Vista Business Service Pack 2.&nbsp; Also when it is trying to connect it says it is doing it through WAN Miniport PPOE or something like that.&nbsp; What is
 WAN Miniport? My ISP suggests using their online e-mail and this is what I am doing at the moment, but I would like my Outlook back. Any suggestions?

<p>It depends on the other person's wireless carrier and their policies.&nbsp; Many carriers do not charge for incoming international long distance calls.&nbsp; I did a quick search and Telstra does not charge for this but the other party should confirm.&nbsp; You would pay
 but the other party should not but again I would have them double check.</p>

    <title>Warning&#58; Disabling the new Windows Update UI may cause problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vidyaranjan a v  say:</h3>
<h2>            Warning&#58;  Disabling the new Windows Update UI may cause problems</h2>
                    <p><span>We’ve seen a few forum posts talking about changing registry keys to alter the update experience we shipped in Technical Preview build 9926. There are a couple of reasons that we don’t recommend doing things like that.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>First, the default experience is what we’ve tested across not just the Windows 10 team, but across all of Microsoft before we released it to you. That doesn’t mean that you won’t still find bugs, but it’s definitely the code that’s been most thoroughly
 tested. Changing things back to older versions is risky because the combination of those old settings with the rest of Windows 10 is not something that’s been validated or supported, so we can’t predict the side effects. It’s possible that changing registry
 settings related to update could cause a machine to no longer be able to get new updates or Technical Preview builds.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The other reason to avoid changing the default update experience is that a lot of update-related code is actually being re-written in order to scale across the variety of different device types Windows 10 will support. Since Technical Previews are
 a work-in-progress, some code that may still be in build 9926 won’t actually ship in the final version of Windows 10 that we provide to all our customers, so trying to re-enable that code temporarily won’t provide a way to accurately assess Windows 10’s update
 capabilities.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>We want to hear your feedback!</strong> We’re sharing Technical Preview releases early so we can understand exactly how customers are using our software and make sure we are designing our experiences to address those scenarios. The more
 specific the feedback, the more helpful it is for us – saying “I hate the new Windows Update UI” isn’t very useful, but when we see “I need to be able to tell Windows Update to grab updates from WU itself and not from my internal corporate server, so the new
 Windows Update UI is painful for me”, we can actually understand what changes we could make to solve those specific problems. We can’t promise to fix everything that everyone asks for – and sometimes what one customer wants is exactly what another customer
<em>doesn’t </em>want – but the more you can help us understand why you want something changed, the better we can try to meet those needs.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for listening, and we look forward to hearing your responses.</span></p>

            <p>Everything you wrote makes perfect sense, and I appreciate that you've taken the time to respond to the registry threads. For me, an old-n-crusty programmer, Sys Admin and Windows user since the Windows 95 days, threads talking about registry keys are usually
 people worried about what Microsoft is going to take away from them. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Change in the windows platform over the years has had it's ups and downs, but for the most part windows as a platform is light years ahead of where it began, and speaking only for myself, it's evolution is an exciting thing to take part in. At the same time,
 I totally understand the fear, having "lost"&nbsp;parts of the Windows experience and functionalities I had used to this&nbsp;change many, many times before as the platform grew across Windows 98 / Millenium / and so on to today. There is a part of myself that during
 testing periods like now is looking to see what you guys have taken away, as well as what new things you have brought. Does this make me cynical? I don't think so, just experienced.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So as I read your post again and see you remind and warn users of the risks and of the fluid nature of the code at this time I am relieved and pleased that you have taken the time to respond and maybe more importantly take the time to explain that the "Why's"
 are what you are looking for amid all the technicalities. I don't believe I remember ever seeing that in previous&nbsp;Microsoft testing rounds, and it's a huge sign of how things on your end have changed. Keep up the good work!

            <p>I think it is fine the way it is now, at first I had second thoughts because I was just use to the old way it always was.
</p>
<p>My suggestion for improvements, allows us the kb article of the update that is going to be installed,
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/930743?wa=wsignin1.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">KB</a>&gt; &gt;https://support.microsoft.com/kb/930743?wa=wsignin1.0&lt;</p>
<p>Let the user decide what KB&nbsp;to install, not all of us use every update. I don't mind being the wuclient but more technical information is&nbsp;a must. Currently I have to chase down the KB&nbsp;article.&nbsp;Since this is the prerelease I made the decision to install.</p>

<p>OK, so do that on your other computer until the next build, or update. Not running this build defeats the whole purpose of the TP program.</p>

<p>People get set in their ways so quickly!&nbsp; Already trying to change the new build back to the older one!&nbsp; Had an idea (and had already read) that the Windows Update was pretty much under MS control for these tech previews.&nbsp; It is your sandbox and we should
 play in it as you wish.&nbsp; Feel like things coming down the pike are tested to work or you'd like them to be tested to see if they work.&nbsp; Think the same is true for system restores and such.&nbsp; Glad to see MS trying out some new things and letting the buying public
 test them out.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I used the Windows Update for a GPU driver and honestly, the one you all sent ended up working better than an 8.1 driver I got from the GPU manufacturer.&nbsp; Apparently it had been tested to work with the Windows 10 tech preview.&nbsp;Shows what I know!&nbsp;Seems like
 you folks know a little bit about operating systems.&nbsp; So guess I'll trust you all to get the new system up and running</p>

            <p>I too am very appreciative of your formal response to the latest " Bug " that now has not only myself, but others in a bit of disarray. I am speaking entirely of my personal operations as to me having to follow all instructions and not deviate from the norm
 and do irrational experimental alterations to any or all codes supplied via the updating process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is clearly disturbing is on your end with your technical expertise, you are implying that you had some knowledge to what these codes might do and might not do but what it has done, is completely altered some of the registry entries especially to the
 Explorer.exe and with that, there is no access to the start menu as well as the metro app section and above all, the very wonderful Cortana feature that will surely have&nbsp; " Google Speech " paying close attention..
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There needs to be, and I say this seriously, Microsoft's core value of giving the User a sense of control with the ability to accept automatic updates as well as having the ability to not have any updates installed unless permission is given. There are a
 lot of novice as well as trained source code developers who have the ability to understand a certain update and at lease research it first before installing and as such, could have avoided what I had to do to get all back to normal. In the newer version builds
 it gives no form of denial of automatically updating and all is handled by Maintenance via set times with no, " NEVER" offered which is in my opinion a door to a dangerous situation which is prevalent with the latest snafu. I had to use the MBR window which
 gives you the option of Rolling Back or automatically after 20 seconds, for the default OS to&nbsp;run cause&nbsp; could not access the update as it is not even listed in the control panel anymore [ build 9926 with the latest update installed ] &nbsp;which I could have uninstalled
 that update cause you can't do it via, restore to a certain date where there is no restore point made available. I for one took the opportunity to install these 10 versions on Virtualbox and I had to use the roll back and then with he iso 9841, install again
 which then using " My PC " I went into Restore and update and did a check for version check and it then downloaded the 9879 and would not search for the newer 9926 saying no new builds are available. and that left me now having to go to Microsoft download
 site and get the link to iso 9926 to make a dvd and do a direct installed over the 9879 build......</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see,&nbsp; am tenacious, but others testers may not have my patience cause I have been around sense the commodore computers with DOS and I am a believer in Microsoft as well as totally appreciative of having to not spend up front for a newer operating
 system and plus, feel like my input is valued and appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you guys can develop a patch to send out or a bug fix to this problem cause without it, you cannot access the main features and eventually must start all over from scratch or do what you have said, Not to do...Keep up the great work..</p>

            <p>Real simple.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Win7,8,8.1&nbsp; windows update GUI was straightforward and spot on.
</p>
<p>Being able to set it Auto install, manual install, just important security or all recommended updates.
</p>
<p>Being able to click on the KB's and go straight to Microsoft site and find out exactly the issues involved.</p>
<p>Being able to see download and install in real time. Gauge how much longer it will take.</p>
<p>Being able to check/uncheck boxes on updates to download n install. </p>
<p>Being able to HIDE unwanted updates so I'm not notified over and over.</p>
<p>Being able to restore hidden updates if I change my mind.</p>
<p>Being able to see ALL the update history. Time,date,successfull or unsuccessfully installed.</p>
<p>Being able to put a shortcut on the desktop so I can run it easily and often.</p>
<p>Last but not least,&nbsp; Don't mix updates with upgrades.&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Mr. Miller. We all may not be as resourceful as yourself and your clear and precise explanations and pointers are impressive but Dave as well as myself are pin pointing that in the latest build(s) the ability to even open up " Windows Updates " are no longer
 presented to you in the Control Panel and furthermore when you do get to check for the latest updates, you see the feature that clearly points to you that ALL updates are now handled via a maintenance feature with a time stamp and there is no " NEVER " Option
 provided. I too loved all the options you listed as this is what gave you personal control plus the time to investigate before jumping into the pool or having that sick feeling of " Should I or Should I not "</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think if you can do restore and have sight to restore points that when you get that excuse from the big boys that there will always be " BUGS " you should have the option of rolling back that UPDATE so as not to do what I had to do which was a complete
 uninstall as you can't even use the start or metro apps or even access the MY PC and then find out the latest UPDATE, wiped out the explorer.exe which is like having a eight cylinder engine running on two cylinders...</p>

            <p>Thanks for communicating with us about these issues.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>People editing the Registry in order to get the old look of certain parts of the UI is just a symptom. It is hard to argue objectively about aesthetics, as well as things you got used to and thus became attached to. While all the optimizations under the
 hood are appreciated, for a lot of people the changes to the UI aren't.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I like the way the traditional Control Panel, including Windows Update, UI looks and feels. I don't like the way the new Settings UI looks.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I like the way the Windows 7 Start Menu looks. I am able to accept the look the Windows 10 98XX non-xaml Start Menu looks. I don't like the way the Windows 10 9926 Start Menu looks.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>There is simply not much else to it, I am truly sorry if this kind of feedback is not helpful. If you are asking what you should do about this situation, the answer is to please allow us to continue using your new Operating System while preserving mostly
 the old looks if(!) we chose to do so. We shouldn't have to edit the Registry, instead it should be totally normal to be able to choose freely which type of UI each individual user likes better. This is either possible for you to allow, or it isn't. As long
 as we have to edit the registry, the metrics you are able to collect on us about which interface is more widely used are skewed.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I accept the fact that editing the Registry might result in normal Updates as well as the Update Process to the next build failing, if that should happen I have noone else to blame but myself.<br />

<h2>            Nokia 635 has lost all my contacts</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I recently upgraded from a 630 to 635 and gave the 630 to a family member.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I have come to my phone and all of my contacts have disappeared and they have been replaced by theirs! Their phone has just their contacts as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried searching and the only thing I can find is that my contacts may have been synced to my microsoft account and I may be able to restore from there, but quite where that is or what I need to do, I have no idea. All the messages and photos are still
 there, just no contacts...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made the mistake of speaking to O2, who are a complete waste of time and after an hour and a half, it was the usual 'the hand set must be faulty, send it in" - it's already been back once in the 3 months I've had it and they didn't find anything last time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had nothing but problems with this phone since getting it and am completely fed up with it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help?</p>
<p>

            Did you set up on the new phone the same default MS account you had on the old one ? I'm guessing you also did not reset the old phone before giving it away ?<br />

<blockquote>
<p>Hi, I recently upgraded from a 630 to 635 and gave the 630 to a family member.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I have come to my phone and all of my contacts have disappeared and they have been replaced by theirs! Their phone has just their contacts as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried searching and the only thing I can find is that my contacts may have been synced to my microsoft account and I may be able to restore from there, but quite where that is or what I need to do, I have no idea. All the messages and photos are still
 there, just no contacts...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made the mistake of speaking to O2, who are a complete waste of time and after an hour and a half, it was the usual 'the hand set must be faulty, send it in" - it's already been back once in the 3 months I've had it and they didn't find anything last time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had nothing but problems with this phone since getting it and am completely fed up with it.

<h2>            SharePoint Online Content Types keep disappearing</h2>
                    
<p>split from this thread</p>
<p>hello eric,</p>
<p>the document content type "web part page", parent type is "basic page"&nbsp;is affected. it's happening on all site collections within the tenant. specifically what is occurring is that the document template url keeps disappearing. we discovered this issue last
 week when we noticed that the "web part page" content type was prompting the user to upload a document instead of take them to the "new web part page" screen to give it a create the page and select the page layout.</p>
<p>we resolved this issue by adding the url to the existing document template '/_layouts/15/spcf.aspx' for the content type through the content hub and republished it. that had resolved the issue temporarily,&nbsp;as of today the url to the document template&nbsp;is
 missing again at the site collection level and in the content hub.</p>



<p>please let me know if you need further information on this issue.</p>
<p>regards,</p>
<p>lisa</p>

<p>1.&nbsp;Could you confirm whether the issue happens to other Published Content Types? For example, could you create a new one with the same parent and publish it and check the outcome?<br />
2.&nbsp;Does the Base Page content type works without issue?<br />
3.&nbsp;Could try un-publishing it and check if the issue will still exist?</p>

<p>Hi Eric,</p>
<p>As far as I can tell this issue isn't affecting other Content Types. I did just have an "ah-ha" moment when I discovered the "Basic Page" Content Type is missing the Document Template path for this CT. It's parent is the Document Content Type and it is also
 missing the Document Template path for it's CT.</p>
<p>So with that said, when I added the "Basic Page" Content Type to the Site Pages library it is asking for me to upload instead of taking me to the next screen to create the page.</p>
<p>Do you want me to un-publish Basic Page? I'm assuming since it is missing its template URL then we need to resolve that as well.
</p>
<p>Do you have the paths to the Document and Basic Page Content Type templates (/_layouts/15/----)?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>I found the path to the Basic Page Content Type template (/_layouts/15/bpcf.aspx) and added it back and republished. Also I added the template back again and republished the Web Part Page content type (/_layouts/15/spcf.aspx).
</p>

<p>Hi Eric,</p>
<p>As of this morning the Content Types still are referencing their document templates so this is good. I'm going to continue to monitor this but I think this issue is now resolved.</p>
<p>What I'd like to know is if you have any idea how or why these may have disappeared from the Content Hub?</p>

                    <p>Please don't assume I know computer terms because I don't. Thank you,. I read a previous, now locked, forum post about this and they suggested entering into Email Accont through "File"... where is this FILE?</p>
<p><em>I HATE the suggested contacts and I really have to get rid of them. I have X and X and X and they only come back. I cannot see how to delete the folder or the individuals permanently</em></p>

            Are the suggested contacts coming up when you click To?  
<br />Are you using Outlook installed on your desktop? 
<br />
<br />Those suggested contacts are a new feature of the autocomplete list. If they have an X to the right, they are likely people you recently emailed. If no X to delete, they are people who sent you mail that Outlook.com thinks you might want to email. 
<br />
<br />
<br />In Outlook.com on the web: switch to the people module - there should be a folder named "Suggested" - select the first name and click Remove at the top of the list. Keep clicking to delete the next, and the next...

<h2>            Worksheet_SelectionChange&#40;ByVal Target As Range&#41; with multiple targets on one worksheet</h2>
                    <p>Good morning,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to get 2 different popup calendars to work on two cells in excel.&nbsp; The calendar itself works and looks fine but I need it to appear on two different cells with two different calendars.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Calendar 1 will be their birth date (Year Range is 1929-2004).&nbsp; To bring up Calendar 1, Cell U9 is formatted custom "mmmm d, yyyy" and to call the calendar, i am using the following code:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Private Sub Worksheet_SelectionChange(ByVal Target As Range)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'check cells for desired format to trigger the BirthDate.show routine otherwise exit the sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Dim DateFormats, DF</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; DateFormats = Array("m/d/yy;@", "mmmm d, yyyy", "mmm d, yyyy")</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; For Each DF In DateFormats</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If DF = Target.NumberFormat Then</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If BirthDate.HelpLabel.Caption &lt;&gt; "" Then</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; BirthDate.Height = 191 + BirthDate.HelpLabel.Height</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Else: BirthDate.Height = 191</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; BirthDate.Show</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; End If</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; End If</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Next</p>
<p>
</p><p>End Sub</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Calendar 2 will be the previous 365 days (current year plus last year).&nbsp; To bring up Calendar 2, cell C38 is formatted Custom "mmm d, yyyy".&nbsp; I would like to use another calendar "StartDate" for the second cell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions to make this work [two calendars from two different Selection Change on the same worksheet would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you,</p>
<p>
</p><p>K.</p>

<p>Not sure if I understand your problem correctly but if you want to perform different&nbsp;actions depending on where the Target cell is located&nbsp;then the following 2 examples might help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first example below specifies if the target is a specific cell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select Case Target.Address<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case "$A$3"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Code here for cell $A$3<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case "$B$3"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Code here for cell $B$3<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not essential to have case else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'but code here if any other cell<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End Select<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second example below specifies if the target is in a specific column.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select Case Target.Column<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'this is anywhere in column A<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Code here if target is in Column A<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case 2&nbsp; 'this is anywhere in column B<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Code here if target is in&nbsp;column B<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Not essential to have case else<br />

    <title>New laptop comes with Office 2016, but unable to activate with e-mail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> weng_seng  say:</h3>
<h2>            New laptop comes with Office 2016, but unable to activate with e-mail that has another product key</h2>
                    <p>I have a microsoft e-mail that activated Microsoft office 2016 at my home. Everything is fine and no issue with that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently my company bought a new laptop that comes with Microsoft home office and business 2016. After all the laptop setup and stuff, I open office and it's asking me to sign in with a microsoft account to activate, so I sign in with my&nbsp;microsoft e-mail.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought that the product key is included in the motherboard of this laptop so I expect it to be a full microsoft office or it should be activated itself, but this is not the case.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now every time I open any Words or Excel, it prompt me the activation wizard to activate office. If I choose "activate the software over the internet", a long list of text appear that tells me the product key already been activated maximum number of times.
 Seems like I can't do anything other than trying to activate the software by phone.&nbsp;I also tried Office Updates but it's still the same.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But before that, I would like to understand a few thing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Is this issue has anything to do with the microsoft e-mail that contain of other product keys for another laptop? I'm expecting that a microsoft account can contain multiple product key in different laptops and there should not be any conflict. Unless
 the ideal way is to have one microsoft e-mail associate with one product key only.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I'm able to get the 25 character product key from stores.office.com in my account. Is there any way I can activate my office with this data?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Is it possible that this office that comes with the laptop is not full version? Are other laptops bundled with microsoft office also the same where user need to activate themselves or microsoft office suppose to be fully activated? I need to send to the
 seller if this microsoft office might not be full version</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Weng, </p>
<p>
</p><p>A Microsoft account can handle multiple Office suites once you purchase using it. Since you’ve mentioned that your device comes with a pre-installed Office 2016 this program should be activated by the dealer before distributing it and this will depend on
 the package that your company agreed upon purchasing the unit. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The pre-installed Office on the laptop is registered with the different Microsoft account that’s why you can’t use your own account to activate it. If you want to use your Office program associated with your own account, you need to uninstall the pre-installed
 Office on the laptop before you can install yours. <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to install an Office program using a new 25-characters product key that’s purchased from Microsoft Store, you need to go to this
<a href="https://setup.office.com/?ms.officeurl=setup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> and redeem it using a Microsoft account that you’ve used to purchase the program. You need to uninstall the pre-installed Office 2016 first on the laptop and restart the device before doing so.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you have any other concerns, don’t hesitate to let us know. </p>
        </p>

<p>Hi Genevieve,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case, is that means that I should send back to my dealer to check on this? I didn't know that I should sign in with different microsoft account to activate the product.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And by "<span>create a new installation", do you mean I should download the installation file from&nbsp;</span>https://setup.office.com to do a new installation? Will that help to activate the product?&nbsp;</p>

<p>A Microsoft account is required to download and install the latest Office programs on a computer. It's possible that the dealer used a different Microsoft account to install Office on your device. You can contact your dealer for more information on how they
 set up Office on your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, you’re correct. If you want to install a different Office program on the computer or install your own Office program that’s associated with your own Microsoft account, please go to this
<a href="https://setup.office.com/?ms.officeurl=setup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>. But first, you need to uninstall the pre-installed Office 2016 on the laptop and don’t forget to restart the device once you've successfully uninstalled it.

    <title>Why is Excel 2011 so slow&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> middkid  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is Excel 2011 so slow&#63;</h2>
                    Been using various PCs over the years in Corporate Finance roles and became quite the Excel expert. &nbsp;Recently moved into more of a Strategy role and got a new MacBook Pro with a 2.2 Core i7 and 8 GB of ram (running 10.6.7). &nbsp;I have been extremely disappointed
 in how slowly Excel 2011 runs. &nbsp;Last night I had a file with a few data tables and charts. &nbsp;I needed to subtotal one of the data tables (~10,000 rows) and the process literally took 2 hours. &nbsp;I had to leave work and actually kept the MacBook open in my car
 just so it could finish. &nbsp;I can almost work faster in VMWare. &nbsp;During the 2 hour subtotal last night I checked activity monitor and it was using 1GB of RAM but the processor was pegged at 100% utilization. &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm seeing sluggish behavior throughout. &nbsp;Even simple things like copying multiple rows of data, which would instantaneous on my 4 year old PC running XP, give me the spinning beach ball for a few seconds on my MacBook Pro. &nbsp;Very disappointing.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Are there any plans to optimize this code? </div>
                </div>

            MacExcel does tend to run <i>a bit</i> slower than WinXL (there <i>are </i>advantages to owning the low-level operating system routines), but it sounds to me like there's something else going on. I've never seen anything like 2 hours to subtotal 10,000
 rows. Are your row values the result of complex calculations?
<div><br />
<div>It may pay dividends to do some basic troubleshooting:</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;- Make sure Office and OSX are updated to the latest revisions (14.1.2, and 10.6.8, respectively)</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;- Use the Disk Utility application to repair disk permissions.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;- Use Font Book to get rid of corrupt/duplicate fonts (this is a significant issue with XL11. See</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://word.mvps.org/mac/fontweeding.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://word.mvps.org/mac/fontweeding.html</a>&nbsp;for guidance - yes,it's a Word site, but it applies).</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;- With ALL Office applications closed, rename or delete your preference file/folder</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ~/Library/Preferences/com.microsoft.Excel.plist</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ~/Library/Preferences/Microsoft/</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;where ~ is your home directory.</div>
<div>&nbsp; - If the problem persists, create a new user account and determine if an app or system extension is</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; interfering with XL. See &nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2439218" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2439218</a></div>

<h2>            xxx- Me and my Horrible N8- why &#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Why is my new N8 re starting by itself when I am connecting to web tv? This happened 6 out of 10 times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why is everything frozen when watching certain you tube videos?&nbsp; I return to the same video and get the same result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why is there nothing I can do even if I pressed every buttons on the phone to re start?&nbsp; I have to wait up to 5 minutes before I am able to switch the phone off by pressing the top button.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I pressed 10 seconds to get the 3 times vibration signal and the same problems return.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is good to know Nokia is able to boast one of the highest megapixel but why does it blurs super easily?&nbsp; All settings have been attempted but it is still the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I feel like I am spending more and more with my N8 than my own girlfriend and it is getting very boring.&nbsp; Her 3 day old HTC Desire blows my phone away!&nbsp;</p>

            I had 1.0610.05.06 15-05-06 Firmware on my phone. I started the update and monitored it all the time.<br />
Durin the period when the test software was running, the windows side of program told me that connection was lost. The instructions tell me to reboot my phone. So I did this and now I'm left with Nokia logo flashing on and off on the screen.<br />
<br />
So tomorrow my whole work day will be used to get this to nearest nokia service.

            I'm just wondering what happened there. It seems that for some reason during the software test it lost connection with PC. Might be that the software program failed or?<br />
<br />
Imho the tester software should have some output on the screen to tell the used how far has it progressed so far and what's the name of the current test. I know this isn't much used for the user but it would be good feedback during these first steps of development?<br />
<br />
Also that notice that came from the updater software wasn't really that clear. First you get lots of warnings not to touch the phone during updating and then you tell the user to take the battery off. This isn't really logical.<br />
<br />
I'm wondering what would have happened if I would have ignored the instructions to disconnect the battery and just waited for the test program to do something. Or even press the "retry" button without pulling the battery out.

<br />
Sounds silly, but did you foolow the instructions to the letter? Was the USB cable connected directly to the PC, or via a hub? Was the computer being used heavily for anything else during the upgrade? (it's recommended not to run anything else until it's completed)

I won't even answer to your questions, because it's pretty clear that the software clashes during test run and looses connectivity because the phone isn't responding anymore.

                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Im currently on 10074 which i've just downloaded. One problem im having specificially is that the apps are no longer showing as icons (Such as Store, Project Spartan etc) and when i click on them they bring up a message that states 'Invalid value for registry'
 - Is there any fix for this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also this is something that has happened with a few builds, and thats the start menu and search bar dont work. The start menu doesnt show when i click on the Windows button in the corner or the button on my keyboard. Again, is there any fix for this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p><span>Hi Majid,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft community forum. Let me assist you with your concern.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You won’t be losing the license for Windows 8.1. If you want to go back to your previous operating system. You'll need to reinstall your version of Windows from the recovery or installation media
 that came with your PC (typically DVD media). </span></p>

<p><span>As of now we don’t have information regarding the purchase of Windows 10 Technical Preview.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Before you install Windows Technical Preview</span></strong></p>

<h2>            Shopping in my Nokia Lumia 900</h2>
                    Today just my nephews grabbed my cell and I formatted it completely without any photo or anything, then I do not even know what to do because my phone had my credit card with which to buy my apps (they were few in the distrust had) now I go to my cell,
 I do not have an application and I enter my phone but nothing, I have nothing, I went back to enter my credit card but all I want back my apps and songs that had already purchased legally in my Nokia Lumia 900!

            <p>You can find your purchase history here (on your PC), and you can install apps straight for there:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/my/purchase-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/my/purchase-history</a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Just make sure you initialize your phone with the same Microsoft Account before reinstalling the apps.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Make sure your credit card info is up to date here:</p>
