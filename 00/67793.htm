<p>
</p><p>I have a PC 64 bit system on Windows 10 and downloaded Songsmith from Windows Store after asking Chat if it is compatible with my OS. After installation, I clicked it on and was given a choice of "Repair" or "Remove." I did the repair but that didn't work.
 I removed the program, and re-downloaded it and got the same choices. Finally ended up spending an hour on the phone with Tech Support before she told me to turn the computer off for at least 25 minutes so it could rest and call her back. I laughed when she
 said that, of course. Have any of you made it work in Windows 10. Thanks.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Rob,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In order to help you better, could you please confirm a couple of things:
</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Are you getting any error message?</li><li>Have you installed all the pending Windows updates?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to install all the latest pending Windows updates as below and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to “<strong>settings”</strong> and click on <strong>“update and security”.</strong></li><li>Under tab <strong>“Windows update”,</strong> click on the icon <strong>“check for updates”.</strong></li><li>Then once you find the <strong>pending updates</strong> install it and check.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>To determine whether the issue is particular with the app songsmith or all app, so I suggest you to try downloading other apps and check if it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful and do let us know if you need further assistance. We will be glad to assist.</p>

            <p>I have the same experience just as you. The Songsmith has only 32 bits and mostly all computers now are 64 bits. They couldn't do anything about it. I did talk to the guy who was very helpful but he told me to get a refund or contact Songsmith. I tried contacting
 them but couldn't reach them nor they answer my emails so i decided to get my refund from Paypal.</p>
<p>I truly hope there could be a 64 bit system that can be used for my pc. I think they should change it to 64 bit as 32 it is almost obsolete, i should say.</p>

<h2>            Xbox One X constantly glitching with external drive</h2>
                    <p>For reasons completely unknown to me, my Xbox will randomly stop detecting my Seagate 2 TB external drive and I won't be able to play any games on it. I've fixed this before by unplugging it and changing the port, the USB 3 cable for it, changing my power mode, hard resetting, and even reformatting my drive. This happens every two to three weeks and I've already reformatted my external drive three times at least now. This has been happening for the past three or four months, and last night it started again but this time nothing worked, at all. My Xbox finally detected it but&nbsp;would lag uncontrollably and nothing would open because it would take too long to start, even getting as bad as causing the actual homepage itself to do so in a continuous loop of a black screen and the error message for it. I finally relented and formatted my drive yet again, losing all 35 games I had downloaded for the third time since I bought it last December and now suddenly everything works fine.&nbsp;I d

I can understand how this issue can be frustrating for you, but for us to help you further,&nbsp;can you provide information on the following please:</p><p><br /></p><p>1. Do you have your console on instant on or power saving when not in use?</p><p><br /></p><p>2. Is your console connected directly to the mains? No surge protectors or possibly faulty power strips?</p><p><br /></p><p>3. Have you tried any other external hard drives on your console?</p><p><br /></p><p>I'm thinking either the drive is faulty, or there is a power issue with console. Either way, something is causing your drive to become currupt, possibily affecting the drive's MBR (Master Boot Record) thereby rendering the drive undetectable.&nbsp; You may need to test another hard drive to see.</p><p><br /></p><p>Please answer the above questions.</p><p><br /></p><p>Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

<br />Due the migration of Skype and Microsoft last October 2016, all Skype accounts are now Microsoft accounts. If you're going to close your Skype account, you will also lose access to other MS products such as OneDrive, XBOX and etc.
<br />
<br />Before you merge a Skype account with a Microsoft account, there's a multiple confirmation about this. Once you confirmed these changes, unfortunately, there's no option to unlink these accounts.
<br />
<br />Additional details:
<br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA142/how-do-i-close-my-skype-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA142/how-do-i...</a>
<br />
<br />Since Skype is now part of Microsoft product, deleting Skype account will be the same with deleting a Microsoft account. If you haven’t updated or migrated the Skype account you want to delete to a Microsoft account, then you will need to go through it before deleting the account. You may use a different Microsoft account (Dummy email address) if you don’t want your Microsoft account to be deleted. However, if it’s already updated to a Microsoft then there’s no option to unmerge it and it will delete the Microsoft account as well.

<h3> wjniemi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win7&#47;Win10 dual boot giving winload.exe error 605</h2>
                    <p>I have a dual boot system, or used to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently the winload.exe file expired (?) and now when I try to boot the system it gives me the option to boot to the tech preview, but it kicks out the winload.exe error 605 message.<br />
<br />
From that screen I can only reboot and repeat the problem or choose my Win7 OS which still works.<br />
<br />
The Win10&nbsp;preview&nbsp;partition&nbsp;started out its life as a Win8.1 partition and was updated to Win10.&nbsp; I wasn't using it much.<br />
<br />
So far I have downloaded a Win10 install iso and burned it to a DVD.&nbsp; I think I could install from this but I really would prefer to repair the current installation rather than install over it.<br />
<br />
I also created a Win8 disk.<br />
<br />
When I try to boot to either disk it's not giving me enough information to know whether I am installing over my Win7 partition, my now defunct Win10 partition, or what.<br />
<br />
Wouldn't it be simple to just provide a replacement winload.exe file and copy it into the proper directory?<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated.</p>

    <title>Audio Service Not Running - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> palpha3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Audio Service Not Running</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I'm attempting to fix my mother's laptop while I'm visiting her for a few days.&nbsp; She has no idea what she did or how it got this way so I'm starting from scratch.&nbsp; I've read a few posts regarding the same issue so I've tried a few things out to solve the "Audio
 Is Not Running."<br />
<br />
As 'David - Support Engineer' recommends:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "<span><span>Ensure that the services below are started as well and that they are all set to Automatic – Start them in the order listed:</span>
</span>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DCOM Server Process Launcher<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Plug and Play<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Multimedia Class Scheduler<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remote Procedure Call (RPC)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows Audio Endpoint Builder</span> </span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us know if any services won’t start and what error message you get."</span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span>1. DCOM Server Process Launcher is Started and set to Automatic.&nbsp;
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Plug and Play has not been Started but it is set to Automatic.&nbsp; I started it and the bar increases quickly to about 50% and slows down then
 stops.&nbsp; An error message appears saying :</span> </span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Windows could not start the Plug and Play service on Local Computer.</span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Error 1053: The service did not respond to start or control request in a timely fashion."</span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Multimedia Class Scheduler
</span></span><span><span>is Started and set to Automatic.
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. Remote Procedure Call (RPC)
</span></span><span><span>is not Started but is set to Automatic.&nbsp; When I start it the bar increase to about 95% then an error message appears saying:</span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Windows could not start the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) service on Local Computer.</span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Error 1059: Circular service dependency was specified.</span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span>5.
</span></span><span><span>Windows Audio Endpoint Builder
</span></span><span><span>is not Started but is set to Automatic.&nbsp; When I start it the bar increase to about 95% then an error message appears saying:</span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span><span>"Windows could not start the Windows Audio Endpoint Builder service on Local Computer.</span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Error 1059: Circular service dependency was specified.</span>
</span></p>

<p><span><span>As 'Augustine the GEEK' recommends I restarted my dependencies using:</span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "</span>
</span><strong>Method 2:<br />
</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start, Run ( Orelse Press WIN+ keys on the keyboard ) and type the following:</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CMD /K SC CONFIG SPOOLER DEPEND= RPCSS</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>and hit enter."</p>
<p>I did and it was done successfully.&nbsp; I then tried starting 2, 4 and 5 again.&nbsp; When I went to start the Plug and Play it had Starting beside it so I left it alone (however, it's been Starting for a while now).&nbsp; RPC was able to start up but I'm still receiving
 the same message for the Windows Audio Endpoint Builder.&nbsp; Also, for some reason nothing is shown in the Device Manager screen.&nbsp; It just sits there empty so I can't see whether or the driver is missing.&nbsp; I'm not sure how to get it to actually show the devices.&nbsp;
 I've never seen this happen before so if you have any thoughts please let me know.&nbsp; The laptop is running Vista SP1.&nbsp; I've tried installing SP2 but it keeps telling me it can't and is reverting back to the SP1 version.&nbsp; The error message I receive for that
 is 800D7000.&nbsp; And lastly, I wanted to do an update of Vista with the CD but my mother has no idea where she placed it so I can't go that route either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your thoughts and advice are welcome and appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Paulo</p>

<p><span>Hello Paulo,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thank you for writing to Microsoft Vista Community Forums.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Since we don't have the Windows Vista DVD, you may try to recreate Plug and play service on your computer as it might help us to fix the issue.<br />
<br />
To delete a Service: <br />
1. Click Start and type CMD in the start search box.<br />
2. Right click on the CMD in the list and click on run as administrator.<br />
3. Type in the following command in Command prompt.<br />
sc delete PlugPlay, (to find the service name you can get into services.msc and <br />
double click on the particular service)<br />
<br />
To create Service:<br />
1. Click Start/Run/regedit <br />
2. Choose HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE <br />
3. Click File/Load Hive under display name you will find the name of the service.<br />
4. Browse to *(See note below on this)* C:\Windows\Repair\. Double-click the file
<br />
called system. <br />
5. Enter the word "test" (without the quotes) in the box and click OK.<br />
6. Leave the registry editor open and open a command prompt and type in the following (this copies the keys to the proper locations):
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>a. "reg copy hklm\test\controlset001\services\PlugPlay hklm\system\currentcontrolset\services\PlugPlay /s /f"
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>b.&nbsp; Press ENTER<br />
<br />
You should get "Operation completed successfully" or something similar as the <br />
output after each command <br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Restart the computer and check the service is present again.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps. <br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thanks and Regards, <br />

<h2>            Call of Duty World at War</h2>
                    
<p>I called in today, and was told to post here. I need someone who is in enforcement to spend a day or so in Call of Duty World at War. There tends to be an average of 1-2 cheaters/hackers in each game. I don't know how long it would take to do an initial
 purge, but I would suggest some sort of ongoing policing. I realize the game doesn't have a vast multiplayer base that it used to have, but there's still 13,000 paying customers in the game, barely able to enjoy the matches. Even if you can stay away from
 the hacker in the game, a portion of the screen is taken up with brightly colored advertisements telling you which youtube video they went to to get their "no clipping," or "god mode" hacks from.</p>
<p>If you need anything, feel free to message me.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Its up to the game developers to patch these exploits Horton. All MS can do is continue to ban these individuals and they certainly are catching and permanently banning&nbsp;a lot of them every day. But so long as the Dev's continue to refuse to patch these
 games the problem will never be resolved.<br />
<br />
But you can help them in their endeavor by reporting anyone you see using these mods.<br />
<br />
As rank resets are so prevalent in this game could you take a moment to read through this

<h2>            Want a refund for Fallout 4 season pass&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I bought the season pass last month and was never able to install it. &nbsp;I looked online and through the forums and found out that the reason I can't install it was because it hasn't been released yet.. &nbsp;WTH??? &nbsp;How the heck can they sell software that hasn't
 been released? &nbsp;I bought it not knowing that it hasn't been released yet even though it shows a release date of
<span>11/10/2015.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<span>11/10/2015.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't install it and haven't heard squat about when or even if it is going to be released. I've played the game twice now and dont think I will be interested in playing it again. &nbsp;How can I get a refund for a game that I paid for but doesn't look like
 it will ever be delivered?</p>
<p>Also is this normal for a pre-release add on to be sold without notifying you that it is pre-release and might never be released? &nbsp;And why are there 8000+ ratings if it hasn't been released? &nbsp;Seriously confused! :(</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Why is the same computer listed twice on the Store App, under Settings&#58; Your account&#58; Your PCs&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today I noticed that the same computer is listed twice when I navigate to <em>
Start: Settings: Your account: Your PCs</em>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I see that I can remove the computers, but I'm warned that I will not be able to use any apps installed from the store and so I have not done so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm also unable to find any additional details about the computers listed from the&nbsp;"Your account" page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can safely identify and remove the duplicate PC without losing access to my downloaded apps, or how can I merge the two PCs?</p>

            <p>Hey there,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's what happened to us. We had to return our surface and receive a replacement, no big deal, buy anything new and sometimes you may get a manufacturing flaw. Anyway, we named our NEW surface exactly the same as our OLD surface which resulted in 2 listings
 in the store of the same computer. Exactly what you are seeing right now. Have you by chance named 2 of your computers exactly the same or received a replacement for your PC and named it the same as the first one like we did? This is the only way that I know
 of to have 2 PCs listed in the store with exactly the same name.&nbsp;If either of what I&nbsp;described is the case then you do need to remove one. I used this link:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/windows-store-install-apps-five-pcs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/windows-store-install-apps-five-pcs</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my case the old surface was listed first and the new surface was listed second. It makes sense when you think about it, it is a list with the first computer registered on the top of the list, the next one below etc etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope that helps!</p>

            <p>Must be another Microsoft Mixup as I had the same problem and certainly did not list the computer affected twice.&nbsp; I have three computers listed under my account: a Dell laptop, a Surface RT, and a Surface Pro 2, which&nbsp;was listed twice before I applied the
 following fix.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I looked at the apps installed for each listing of the Surface Pro 2.&nbsp; The first listing had all my apps but one.&nbsp; The second listing had only one app, Windows Alarms, and, what a joke!, listed it as being installed on 6/26/13, when I didn't acquire my Surface
 Pro 2 until 10/22/13 (must be the date Windows Alarms was installed on my Surface RT under Windows RT 8.1 Preview, else the date MS added Windows Alarms to Win8.1 Preview).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Since the order that all the PC's were listed in my Account corresponded to the order they were listed in the dropdown for installed apps in the Your Apps tab of WIndows Store, I figured it was relatively safe to delete the copy of the Surface Pro 2 that
 only had Windows Alarms listed as an installed app.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>After I removed the aforementioned Surface Pro 2 listing, I still had all my other apps installed and working and the first copy of the Surface Pro 2 still existed as a listing both under my Windows Store Account and in the installed apps dropdown for the
 Your Apps Windows Store tab (found by dragging down from the top of the screen when viewing the Windows Store Home Screen).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In general Windows Store is a pathetic example of Microsoft programming prowess.&nbsp; 1/2 the time I tried to check Windows Store app listings, I'd get a "Sorry.&nbsp; Can't connect to Windows Store now.&nbsp; Please Try Again Later."&nbsp; Never have this problem with Google
 Play.&nbsp; Maybe Microsoft should spend less time excoriating Google and more time making its own products just plain work.&nbsp; The One Experience Everywhere usually doesn't work right all of the time!</p>

 else besides gaming. I don't even check email or surf the web on it. I have also tried a fresh install of windows 10 and still nothing, I have also tried an SFC, i checked my HDD for errors and it says nothing (i personally think the HDD is going old, but
 not sure) I have tried so many things and cant understand what is going on. I have also scanned for corrupt files and no problems were found there.</p>

            Hi.
<br />
<br />What I can recommend is that you completely repair the operating system, but first you must backup your files, although with this method the data is not lost but it is a good idea to backup as a security measure, third-party applications if they are uninstalled, check this link.

<h2>            Skype for business keeps crashing after Windows 10 Anniversary Update &#40;AU&#41;</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p><span>For the past week after my laptop installed the anniversary update on its own without letting me know it was doing so, I have been experiencing various
 problems, but one major one is that Skype for business 2016 (via Office365 Pro Plus university account) has stopped working completely. &nbsp;I go and launch it and a few seconds later it comes up with the generic "this program has stopped working" screen and it
 tries to find a fix and then shut's it's self-down. &nbsp;I have tried the following things to get this resolved:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
<span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Reinstall Office 365 64-bit</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
<span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Looked online for any reference as to what the cause is to only find that there is hardly any info out there, till it lead me to the 3<sup>rd</sup> option.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
<span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Came upon an article that said I should download and run a program called offCAT – office configuration analyzer tool, which after running told me that the cause is due to the D3D9.dll
 not initializing properly.&nbsp; From there I contacted my University IT department to contact Microsoft for help and they have told me to do pretty much all I have done already, including double checking that I have the latest .NET framework installed, which I
 do.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
<span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>I have tried using any standalone version of Lync that I could find, after first uninstalling Office365, but those also did not work and gave the same error.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As a last resort I thought I would post on here to see if anyone has any further insights as to how I can get Skype For Business to work again.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Italian234,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>To help you investigate and fix the issue, I want to confirm some information:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Are your operating system and Office 2016 suits the latest versions? If no, please update them to the latest version and see if there are any improvements. You can open any Office 2016 application, such as Outlook 2016, to update the Office 2016
 suits as the following steps: In Outlook 2016, navigate to&nbsp;<strong>FILE</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Office Account</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Update Options</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Update now</strong>.&nbsp;<br />
2. Hold the windows key + Letter ‘R’ from the keyboard to launch the Run command, paste “lync.exe /safe” in the open box to start Lync in safe mode and see if the issue persists.<br />
3.<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">&nbsp;Do an Online Repair for all your Office programs&nbsp;</a>and see if it helps.<br />
4. Try to clear the Skype for Business cache referring to the following steps to see if the issue persists.</p>
<p>a. Navigate to the&nbsp;<em>%localappdata%\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Lync</em>&nbsp;folder.<br />
b. Delete your sip profile folder<br />
c. Go into the&nbsp;<strong>Tracing</strong>&nbsp;folder<br />
d. Delete the all files, but not the folders</p>
<p>5. Since the issue may be related to the software in this computer, please&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">perform a clean boot</a>&nbsp;and check if the issue can be fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists after performing the steps above, let us know and we will further assist you. And two questions here:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">A screenshot of the error message.</span></p>

            I have done all those steps and nothing seems to help. &nbsp;I have rebooted my computer several times since the issue arose and it does not help me (side note, anytime I restart my computer I get logged out of everything including my office accounts and upon
 opening Chrome I have to re-sign into all my accounts, this might be related but I am not sure). &nbsp;Below is the error message and I am running office365 ProPlus version 1611 (Build 7571.2072).<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bc6581f8-6496-4c5c-9f9d-42ccc0a0f5f8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bc6581f8-6496-4c5c-9f9d-42ccc0a0f5f8" /></a>

            <p>Hi Italian234,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the delay response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the current channel, we have a new release on Dec.13 and the version is 1611(Build 7571.2075). So please check if the version is the latest with your channel. Please check
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt592918.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Version and build numbers of update channel releases for Office 365 clients.</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, please check if other office applications have the same issue. If you start another application such as Word or Excel in the Office 2016 ProPlus and then open the Skype for Business client, is there any improvement?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lance</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Have you made any changes to the computer prior to this issue?<br />
2.&nbsp;When exactly do you receive this error message?</p>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>Follow the methods mentioned below and check.<br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong> Run a virus scan with Microsoft Safety scanner and check.<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a><br />
Note:&nbsp; Before performing the security scan take a backup of important data.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong> <strong>Check a drive for errors<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Check-a-drive-for-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Check-a-drive-for-errors</a><br />
<strong>Note:</strong> Answer ‘Y’ when chkdsk asks you if you want to check the drive next time Windows boots.<br />
While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive, then chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.<br />

<h2>            Does not sort picture date correctly</h2>
                    <p>I hate the new Windows 10 Photo App. I have photos that were taken years ago showing up as having been taken last week. &nbsp;There is no way to correct the dates. &nbsp;My original photos have the correct dates. &nbsp;The photo app sets up albums that have no meaning
 and puts photos into the albums that are not related either by subject matter or date and there is virtually NO helpful information either on Microsoft site or on the app itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I previously used Windows Live Photo Gallery to organize my photos, but it is not working right with Windows 10. &nbsp;Microsoft just doesn't get it. &nbsp;Why can't they leave a good thing alone.</p>

            Thank you for the answer. I don't know how I got an Acer utility on my computer, since it is a Gateway laptop. Can Live Updater be co-opted? Can I trust it when they ask me to Update something?

<p>FWIW: I'm using an Acer laptop and that came also loaded with some manufacturer bloat-ware which included exactly the same Live Updater.</p>
<p>Gateway and Acer have/had some business connections. Perhaps you want to read up on that a bit by looking at some internet search results.</p>
<p>IMO, the Live Updater is an absolutely useless program. I uninstalled it years ago.</p>

            <p>Windows Movie Maker&nbsp;2.6 (WMM 2.6) is based off of the old WMM 2.1 from Windows XP.&nbsp; Is that really what you want to install on Windows 7?&nbsp; The latest version of Movie Maker is Movie Maker 2012 which is part of Windows Essentials and can be downloaded from
<a href="http://download.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft directly</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are loading WMM 2.6 because you want a "classic" version of Movie Maker with a traditional timeline, you might at least want to load
<a href="http://goo.gl/B1eRC" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">WMM 6.0</a> which has a 64-bit version, better memory management, GPU support, etc.</p>
