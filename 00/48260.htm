<h2>            My computer freezes and will not respond when it has been left alone for anywhere from 2 to 30 min.</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>So i just updated to windows 7 ultimate from vista premium. i was super excited but when i left it running to so updates last night it froze two minutes after i left it. how did i know when it froze you ask. well the clock read 11:02 and i left it at 11:00.
 i didnt think mutch of it the updates had all downloaded even though the on screen progress bar &nbsp;was still at 60%. you know things happen but then i went to work leaving it on to download some more software; low and behold when i got back it was frozen again.
 this time the screen was black. so i reboot. then start it up, run chrome to check some emails and take out the trash. by the time i was back it had done it again. one thing that i did notice was that then i would move my mouse the light that indicates that
 the processor is working would not light up like it does when the computer is working normally and if that&nbsp;isn't&nbsp;enough it will randomly reboot. and when i say random i mean random.</p>
<p>&nbsp;i have a core i7 920</p>
<p>msi eclipse motherboard</p>

<p>640 gb wd caviar black hard drive</p>

<p><span><span><span>Hello Turkish85,<br />
<br />
</span></span></span><span><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers Forum!</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>I would suggest you to check in safe mode. Whether you’re getting the same problem.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span>To perform safe mode, please follow the below instructions.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.
</span><span>Click the </span>
</span><strong><span>Start</span></strong><span><span> button, click the arrow next to the
</span></span><strong><span>Lock</span></strong><span><span> button, and then click
</span></span><strong><span>Restart</span></strong><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.</span></span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span><span>Do one of the following:
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·</span></span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span><span>If your computer has a single operating system installed, press and hold the F8 key as your computer restarts. You need to press F8 before the
</span></span><span><span>Windows</span></span><span><span>
 logo appears. If the </span></span><span><span>Windows</span></span><span><span>
 logo appears, you will need to try again by waiting until the </span></span><span><span>Windows</span></span><span><span>
 logon prompt appears, and then shutting down and restarting your computer.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·</span></span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span><span>If your computer has more than one operating system, use the arrow keys to highlight the operating system you want to start in safe mode, and then press F8.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.</span></span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span><span>On the
</span></span><strong><span>Advanced Boot Options</span></strong><span><span> screen, use the arrow
 keys to highlight the safe mode with option you want, and then press ENTER. For more information about options, see
</span></span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>advanced
 startup options (including safe mode)</span></span></a></span><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>4.</span></span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span><span>Log on to your computer with a user account that has administrator rights.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span>When your computer is in safe mode, you'll see the words
<strong><span>Safe Mode </span></strong>in the corners of the display. To exit safe mode, restart your computer and let
<span>Windows</span> start normally.</span></p>
<p>
<span>For more information please follow this link:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
</span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</a></span></p>
<p>
<span>If it works in safe mode than would suggest you to perform clean boot in normal mode.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Steps to perform a Clean Boot:</span></p>
<p>
<span>1. Click Start on your Desktop</span></p>
<p>
<span>2. Type msconfig in the Start Search box and then press ENTER.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click&nbsp;&nbsp; Continue.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>3. On the General tab, click Selective Startup.</span></p>
<p>
<span>4. Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.</span></p>
<p>
<span>5. Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.</span></p>
<p>
<span>6. Click OK.</span></p>
<p>
<span>7. When you are prompted, click Restart.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;To return your computer back to normal boot:
</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;1. Click Start on your Desktop</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span><span>2. Type msconfig in the Start Search box and then press ENTER.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click&nbsp;&nbsp; Continue.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;3. Click the General tab.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;4. Click Normal Startup - load all device drivers and services, and then click OK.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;5. When you are prompted, click Restart to restart the computer.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;For information on using “Clean Boot”, see the following Microsoft Article:</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/331796" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/331796</span></a></span></p>
<p>
<span>If the issue still persists, you can try running the System File Checker (SFC.exe) and check if the issue persists.&nbsp; To do this, follow these steps:<br />
<br />
</span><span>1.&nbsp; Open an elevated command prompt. To do this, click Start, click All Programs, click Accessories, right-click Command Prompt, and then click Run as administrator. If you
 are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Allow.
</span></p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp;Type the following command, and then press ENTER: sfc /scannow</span></p>
<p><span>The sfc /scannow command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct
 Microsoft versions</span></p>

    <title>Most Overrated Game Franchises Ever Made - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ragnarok5000  say:</h3>
<h2>            Most Overrated Game Franchises Ever Made</h2>
                    
<p>Here's my opinion of the most overrated game series ever made:</p>
<p>1. Call of Duty = Reason: I never understood why everyone likes Call of Duty so much, I gave MW2, Black Ops 1, and WoW a chance, I liked WoW, but strongly disliked MW2 &amp; Black Ops 1, as of result, I never brought another Call of Duty again ever since. Activision
 needs to give Call of Duty a rest, nobody cares about it no more.</p>
<p>2. Any RPG from Square Enix = Reason: I never understood why everyone liked Final Fantasy &amp; Kingdom Hearts so much. I never liked the Final Fantasy franchise, I gave VII &amp; X a chance, played them for about 2-3 hours respectively and never got into them.
 The storyline is cliche, the combat system is terrible, and the voice-acting is really cheesy. I also never liked the Kingdom Hearts series, I've played the first one for about 2 hours and its just Final Fantasy with Disney characters, but with even worse
 storyline.</p>
<p>3. Assassin's Creed = Reason: I fairly enjoyed AC 2 &amp; 4, but the rest of them I never cared for them. I tried AC 3 on the PS3 when it came out, played it for 3 hours and then returned it the next day, the game was way too boring for me. Overall, I think
 AC 2 &amp; 4 are the only good games in the franchise, the rest sucked. Ubisoft needs to take a long break from AC after Syndicate &amp; Victory.</p>
<p>4. Killzone = Reason: It's Halo with an awful multiplayer &amp; little more cliche plots than Halo has ever gotten. I liked Killzone 2 &amp; 3, didn't liked Killzone Shadow Fall that much and I HATE Killzone 1.One advantage Killzone has over Halo is their graphics
 are even better than Halo (but Halo 2 looks much better than Killzone 1). Overall, Killzone has almost always been an mediocre Dutch/Nederlandse Halo clone.</p>
<p>5. Halo = Reason: I liked Halo 1, 2, and Reach, I thought Halo 3 was alright, but the rest of the Halo games are terrible. First off, Halo 4 is Call of Duty with aliens, second Halo Wars &amp; Spartan **** are worthless spin-offs, third Halo MCC (while much
 more playable now) was plagued with bugs &amp; glitches. At least I understood why people liked Halo so much, but it's still an overrated franchise though.</p>
<p>6. Uncharted = Reason: I never liked the Uncharted series, but knew very well why everyone likes Uncharted so much. I tried all Uncharteds on PS3 and never got into them. The second one was alright, but strongly disliked the first &amp; third ones. Uncharted
 is just Tomb Raider with an Indiana Jones wannabe character (Nathan Drake), since I never cared for Uncharted, I won't buy Uncharted 4.</p>
<p>7. Crysis = Reason: I quite liked Crysis 1, but didn't liked Crysis 2 &amp; 3. Crysis 2 &amp; 3 have been nothing but hype, sure the graphics are amazing at all, but the gameplay is shallow &amp; mediocre at best. Overall, Crysis 1 is the only good game in this franchise,
 the rest are just Call of Duty with aliens &amp; PC-like graphics. Plus the multiplayer is pretty bad. Fairly overrated German Halo/Call of Duty clone.</p>
<p>8. Mario = Reason: I used to liked Mario, but after Sunshine Mario is slowly starting to become the Call of Duty in platformers. Nintendo continues to make yearly Mario games. I think Crash Bandicoot, Rayman, and Banjo Kazooie are much better platformers
 nowadays, Mario has had its day, I think its time for Mario to retire.</p>
<p>9. Metal Gear Solid = Reason: I understood why people liked MGS so much despite the fact that I actually don't care about MGS. I tried MGS 1 on PS1 and MGS 2 &amp; 3 on PS2 and never got into them. The graphics are good, the storyline is nice, the soundtrack
 is decent and voice-acting is alright, the problem is the gameplay. I find the gameplay mechanics to be fairly clunky and mediocre at best. Overall, MGS is a fairly overrated franchise, but I knew why people liked it so much though. I think Splinter Cell is
 much better.</p>
<p>10. Fable = Reason: I tried all Fables 1-3, I find them to be fun for a while then it gets real stupid. The storyline makes very little to no sense whatsoever, the graphics are bad, and the combat system is bland. This is what you can expect from a typical
 European RPG game. Overall, Fable has been nothing but a mediocre British Elder Scrolls clone.</p>

<p>Nothing particularly comes to mind when i try to think of overrated games. If lots of people enjoy something but i don't, meh it's jut not for me, doesn't make it "overrated"...</p>

<p>Hmmmrmmm OP you just listed some of the best, staple, genre-defining, uber-unit-selling, huge-fanbase-having franchises ever created ever. I don't like all of them, but like some pervy gaming voyeur on the outside looking in, licking the window with a stupid
 grin on my face... I can see what they're doing well and right and why people like them.</p>
<p>I've played some first-rate tatt in my time. I've also played some outstanding games. Some of the ones I thought were outstanding, people told me they were tatt, and some of the ones that I thought were tatt, were loved by millions.</p>
<p>In terms of rating... I hate when Arcade/Indie/low budget games with a dev team of one get to share the same rating system as huge blockbuster games with hundreds of developers and muh-trillions of dollars in budgets. I don't care how fun Fez is... it should
 NOT be ranked next to GTAV. IMO {=|</p>

<p>Undisputedly, The Elder Scrolls games. &nbsp;God they are so bland and boring. &nbsp;Combat is still awkward looking. &nbsp;And my lord the voice acting is atrocious. &nbsp;Undisputed KING OF OVERRATED. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I definitely put Metal Gear Solid in there as one of the most overrated franchises as well. &nbsp;Convoluted story line (I don't even think Hideo Kojima knows what is going on any more). &nbsp;Nearly everything about the game is unoriginal. &nbsp;They stole Snake's look
 from Kurt Russell in Escape from New York/LA. &nbsp;His body was made after JCVD. &nbsp;The weird Japanese humor doesn't appeal to me either. &nbsp;I will take Splinter Cell over Metal Gear hands down. &nbsp;Despite my feeling that this franchise is overrated, I do not wish it
 ill will. &nbsp;We need more tactical stealth espionage games. &nbsp;It is pretty sad that I can count on one hand games like MGS and Splinter Cell.</p>

<p>I love both the Splinter Cell and Metal Gear series, but wow, you can't really compare the two. &nbsp;I would never say that Metal Gear is over-rated. &nbsp;At least in my opinion, this is one of the best series on any console and the reviews anywhere you look reflect
 it. &nbsp;MGS4 Guns of the Patriots was awesome!!</p>
<p>Wikipedia -</p>
<p>Following the critical acclaim it received upon its release, Metal Gear Solid 4 won many Game of the Year awards from many international outlets, these including GameSpot, Gamezine,[88] and PALGN, along with a significant amount of Readers' Choice awards,

 Acting", "Most Memorable Moment", and "Best Action/Adventure Game". IGN awarded the game "Best PS3 Game of 2008", "Best Graphics Technology", "Best Original Score", and "Best Action Game". PALGN awarded it "Game of the Year", "PS3 Game of the Year", and "Best
 Visuals". PC World also heralded MGS4 with "Game of the Year". Playfire awarded the game "Game of the Year", "Best Action/Adventure Game", and "Best Graphics". MGS4 also won "Game of the Year" from the Portuguese Eurogamer.[90] On NeoGAF, MGS4 was also awarded
 "Game of the Year". The German site 4PLAYER.de gave MGS4 "Game of the Year" also. GamePro awarded the game "Best PS3 Game of 2008" and "Best Action/Adventure Game". 1UP.com gave MGS4 "Game of the Year", "Best PS3 Game", "Best Action Game", and "Best Audiovisual
 Experience". Fox News Channel awarded the game "Best PS3 Game of 2008" and "Best Game of 2008". GameSpy awarded it "Best PS3 Action Game". From Gamezine, MGS4 won "Game of the Year", and "Best PS3 Game". Giant Bomb gave it "Best PS3-Only Game", "Best Graphics",
 and "Most Satisfying Sequel". In the Golden Joystick 2008 awards, MGS4 was awarded "Best PS3 Game". At Tokyo Game Show 2009, Metal Gear Solid 4 received the Grand Award (alongside Mario Kart Wii) and the Award of Excellence. The readers of PlayStation Official

<p>Bizarro I've played MGS4 as well, I really enjoyed it but not a 10/10 game, I'll give it a 9/10 because the AI can get pretty bad at times, the first MGS I actually liked though, Konami has improved the game mechanics from its predecessors a lot.</p>

<p>I wouldn't put the 2 together either. &nbsp;Splinter Cell is leagues ahead of MGS in my opinion. &nbsp;I couldn't even finish MGS 4 itnwas so boring. &nbsp;Metal Gear Solid can not even create a story, character or a Metal Gear without stealing the idea or copying it from
 someone else.. &nbsp;Also Raiden is one of the worst character creations of all time. &nbsp;</p>

    <title>Sound problem in Windows 8 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davesg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sound problem in Windows 8</h2>
                    I've installed a Genius SM-Live 5.1 sound card and updated the driver from manufacturer website for Windows 8. The sound test in the speaker configuration works and if I use IE (You Tube) I get sound. I also get sound from an old golf sim (Links 2003)
 from the .ssf file. I'm&nbsp;<span>not getting Windows sounds and I also don't get sound using Media Player. Any suggestions?</span>

            I suspect the issue is with the incompatible sound card drivers. Did you install the latest Windows 8 drivers from the Genius website?<br />
<br />
Uninstall the existing sound card drivers and then install the latest Windows 8 drivers<br />

            <p>Thanks for your response RozyMario. I did download the latest driver for Windows 8 from the Genius website prior to my original post.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&nbsp;'ve since uninstalled all sound drivers&nbsp;(from within Device Manager as well as Programs/uninstall). I then used Revo Uninstall to check for traces of C Media&nbsp;(which there were) and deleted those traces. I re-booted and&nbsp;went into BIOS and disabled Audio.
 I re-installed the latest driver from the downloaded files but this time drilling into the sub folders "SMValue5.1" and using setup in &nbsp;"8738-1.04(W8-CR)". I then configured the speakers to 5.1 (no sound in the test at this point) and then configured the sound
 in PCI 3D Audio Configuration which I loaded from the taskbar. Sound at last! </p>

<br />
uninstall all the sound drivers and use the sound drivers cd (which came with your sound card) and then update it from the official website<br />
<br />
the problem may be with the incompatible drivers!!

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
One possible reason why your Bluetooth device is not showing up on your Windows 10 PC is due to an incompatible driver. Since you have made sure that all driver and settings are updated, we suggest that you run the Bluetooth troubleshooter found on this article:

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Starting yesterday, my laptop, an Inspiron 1525 running Vista Home Premium with only one account (mine)&nbsp;on it,&nbsp;started developing what I think is every computer problem known to man.&nbsp; Here is the cycle of events from first to now:</p>
<ol>
<li>My laptop was turned off, and upon my starting it up the Blue Screen of Death appeared.&nbsp; However, my laptop restarted itself almost immediately after the BSoD popped up, and it ran perfectly fine afterwards so I wasn't too concerned.</li><li>For a while, I had been getting this popup message about how McAfee failed to initialize and how I needed to reinstall McAfee.&nbsp; I theorized that my subscription to McAfee might have expired and<em>that's</em>why this message kept popping up, so I Googled
 the text of the error message and realized that when that appears it is an indicator that McAfee was irreparably damaged.&nbsp; Thus, I started looking for a new antivuirus software.</li><li>I downloaded a free software from AVG and PC Tools' AntiVirus Free program and ran the installers for both.</li><li>AVG failed to complete installation, but AntiVirus Free installed perfectly and began a scan.</li><li>PC Tools found many(~130) infections on my computer, and all but two were Low Risk tracking cookie-like infections.&nbsp; One of the two exceptions was a medium-risk infection while the other was high-risk.</li><li>I clicked on the "More details" option for the High-Risk infection, and Internet Exploer 8 opened but closed out immediately.&nbsp; This happened several times after&nbsp;I tried repeating the action.&nbsp; I told AntiVirus to remove the infections, and it claimed to
 have done so. </li><li>Afterwards I tried opening Mozilla Firefox, but it crashed upon opening, and did so every time I tried to open it.</li><li>Disturbed, I restarted my computer and installed updates in the process. </li><li>Startup after the downloads were installed ran normally until I logged in and realized that I could not connect to my home wireless connection.&nbsp; This status appeared when I moved the cursor over the network connection icon: "Connection Status: Unknown The
 remote procedure call failed and did not execute" </li><li>Restarted computer, input password at login screen and got the following error message: "Access is Denied"</li><li>Restarted again by holding down power button and then turning it on again, attempted to log on and got different error message: "The System Event Notification Service failed the logon.&nbsp; The remote procedure call failed and did not execute."</li><li>Restarted laptop again the same way and was actually able to log in, however, nothing opened when I clicked on them&nbsp;or when I ran them as administrator (when I tried to run Windows Explorer as Admin. I got one of the following error messages: "The dependency
 service or group failed to start" or "The RPC server is too busy to complete the operation").&nbsp; Furthermore, the options for Shut Down, Restart and Hibernate were grayed out and unable to be clicked, with an explanation being "The system administrator has&nbsp;disabled
 some power states for this user account." </li><li>Restarted computer, got new failure message upon logon attempt ("The User Profile Service service failed the login.&nbsp; The remote procedure call failed and did not execute.")</li><li>Restarted computer in Safe Mode, was able to log in but was unable to run anything in the manner described in #12</li><li>Restarted computer in Safe Mode with Command Prompt, ordered it to run System Restore (C:\Windows\system\restore\restrui.exe) and got failure popup that said: "The dependency service or group failed to start."</li><li>Computer restarted by itself after multiple attempts at executing System Restore.&nbsp; I could not log in, and tried<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">MANY</span></strong> times to&nbsp;restart my computer.&nbsp; In normal&nbsp;mode&nbsp;I couldn't log in about 90%&nbsp;of
 the time (and when I could, I couldn't run anything, as described in #12, I got the network connection error message&nbsp;[see #9], Windows Defender, Problem Reporter and sundry other progam failed to intialize, and when I couldn't login I got&nbsp;one of the following
 error messages "The System Event Notification...did not execute" [see #11] or "The User Profile Service...did not execute" [see #13].&nbsp; Each failed login resulted in the laptop&nbsp;"Logging Off"&nbsp;and bringing me back to the initial log-in screen,&nbsp;however, the picture
 above my name changed from the chess pieces to an&nbsp;orange flower.)</li><li>Current situation is that I have the same problems as before (unable to&nbsp;run any programs&nbsp;in the&nbsp;rare&nbsp;event that I could actually log on, and the login error messages.)</li><li>Approximately 12 hours after the initial problems occured (see #6) I was able to log on and open Ad-Aware 2008 and the PC Tools software (which runs in the taskbar and scans the&nbsp;computer uponstartup), however, no other programs would open with the exception
 of Microsoft Word 2007. </li><li>I ran a&nbsp;Full Scan on both Ad-Aware and PC Tools AntiVirus&nbsp;Free.&nbsp; When both scans were complete, PC Tools detected 12 High-Risk&nbsp;Trojans, 2 Elevated Risk downloaders and 1 Low-Risk&nbsp;Info File.&nbsp; Ad-Aware detected 30 Low-Risk infections composed of tracking
 cookies and the like.&nbsp; Because I&nbsp;was not connected to the internet thanks to the error message mentioned in #9,&nbsp;I could "Click for more details" on any of the infections and thus had Ad-Aware and PC Tool AntiVirus remove the infections.
</li><li>Ad-Aware removed the infections but said&nbsp;that the computer needed&nbsp;to be restarted before the infections could be permanently removed.&nbsp; PC Tools failed to create a restore&nbsp;point before removal (because Windows Defender&nbsp;couldn't be turned on, as mentioned
 in #16) but claimed to remove all 15 infections. </li><li>I ran another full scan with AntiVirus Free, and the scan came up with no infections.</li><li>I restarted my computer with the power button because I couldn't shut it down the normal way&nbsp;[see #12], but could not log on.&nbsp; Restarted several times and when I could&nbsp;logon&nbsp;the prior problems with not being&nbsp;able to run any progam persisted.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any time I&nbsp;turned
 the computer on&nbsp;in&nbsp;Safe Mode, the&nbsp;laptop&nbsp;would restart itself after a short period of time.&nbsp;</li><li>After several more restart/login attempts, I restarted my computer once more and was&nbsp;greeted by a silver&nbsp;background and a&nbsp;popup window called "Startup Repair."</li><li>Startup Repair asked if I wanted to do system restore.&nbsp; I said yes, and after&nbsp;a diagnosis I was given a results popup that said "Root Cause Found -- Registry is corrupt" and "Repair Action - System Restore."</li><li>Computer restarted after hitting "Finish" on Startup Repair (ostensibly System&nbsp;Restore had occurred).&nbsp; Was not able to login (User Profile Service error)</li><li>Restarted manually,&nbsp;attempted to log in but was thwarted by the System Event Notification failure.&nbsp; More of the same (manual restarts followed by failed login attempts) followed.</li><li>Was able to login after a restart, but computer restarted itself (while in Normal, not Safe, Mode).&nbsp; Was able to l
 more&nbsp;times, and when I was able to,&nbsp;nothing could be run, like before.</li></ol>
<p>I&nbsp;am at my wit's end and I need help!&nbsp;&nbsp;:(&nbsp; I am desperate and feel that I have exhausted every avenue.&nbsp; Please&nbsp;give me some answers, or I will have to take my machine to the Geek Squad and probably have it wiped.&nbsp; Thank&nbsp;you so much for any help you can give.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>It sounds to me like you were massively infected (or maybe still are) and that this resulted in corrupting or deleting or changing some of your critical system
 files.&nbsp; I'm not sure there's any good solution but a clean install, but we'll try everything possible before resorting to that drastic step (you can skip everything else and go to the end and do that if you want as it will be faster - but that&nbsp;decision is
 up to you - I'd try to fix the problems first but it will take some time and there are no guarantees).&nbsp; And for heaven's sake, please do not go anywhere near Geek Squad - find a<strong>reputable</strong> computer repair shop or send it back to the manufacturer
 for service if you decide on that course of action.&nbsp; You don't need them to do a clean install - I've included the procedures below to save you an unnecessary expense.&nbsp; A computer repair shop may be required, but we haven't come close to reaching that point
 yet.</span></p>
<p><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above
 information you should be able to restore with no problems.&nbsp; You will need to use a disk to do that as you note it is not working from your system<span>by booting to the
 genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk (which has System Restore as an option).&nbsp;<span>If you don't have either
 disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span><span><a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></a></span><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span><span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></a></span><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD (perhaps made on a different computer or perhaps in safe mode with networking if that is working).&nbsp;<span>To boot to the CD you may need to change
 the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work, and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp;
 When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
</span><span>If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from
 a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure: </span><span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p>
<span><span><span><span>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp;
 Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
If using the disk, cd to C:\Windows\System32. Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here
 or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s) using </span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will want to schedule itself to run at the next restart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Answer yes and then reboot to run the program.&nbsp;
 It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive and mostly remove that as a potential cause.&nbsp; That ends what can be done from the disk.&nbsp; If you can use safe mode (I'm not quite sure at this point), then proceed - otherwise reply
 with results at this point.</span></span></p>
<span>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any error messages from the Event Viewer concerning&nbsp;startup (Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Event Viewer).&nbsp; Here's how
 to use Event Viewer: </span></span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></span></a><span><span>.
 &nbsp;Look in the System section.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may still be infected with malware. Try to run anti-malware programs (in safe mode with networking if<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">necessary</span>).&nbsp;To fix
 this problem (if it is a problem) download,&nbsp;install, and run the following two programs:</span></span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;and</span></span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span></span><a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/</span></span></a><span><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp;</span><span>Use removal
 tools when appropriate</span></span><a href="http://www.raymond.cc/blog/archives/2009/05/05/comprehensive-list-of-uninstallers-or-removal-tools-for-antivirus-software/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.raymond.cc/blog/archives/2009/05/05/comprehensive-list-of-uninstallers-or-removal-tools-for-antivirus-software/</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;</span><span>Once
 you've uninstalled your current AV program, download, install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless
 you decide to switch which I did when I first tried it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials</span></span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html</span></span></a><span><span>
 (with the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time). &nbsp;You may also want to try the free Avira at:</span></span><a href="http://www.free-av.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.free-av.com/</span></span></a><span><span>
 and Avast at: </span></span><a href="http://www.avast.com/index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.avast.com/index</span></span></a><span><span>.
 &nbsp;Reboot after completing all the scans.&nbsp; You may also want to try the free OneCare at</span></span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/center/whatsnew.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/center/whatsnew.htm</span></span></a><span><span>
 and let it run all the options (except the registry cleaner) because that’s good maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Since you were infected (and probably still are), here's a more aggressive malware solution compliments of PA Bear MS MVP:</span></span></p>
<span>
<p><em><span><span>Microsoft PCSafety provides home users (only) with no-charge support in dealing with
 malware infections such as viruses, spyware (including unwanted software), and adware.</span></span></em><em><span><br />
</span></em><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/oas/default.aspx?&amp;prid=7552&amp;st=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><em><span><span>https://support.microsoft.com/oas/default.aspx?&amp;prid=7552&amp;st=1</span></span></em></a></p>
<p><em><span><span>Also available via the Consumer Security Support home page:</span></span></em><a href="https://consumersecuritysupport.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><em><span><span>https://consumersecuritysupport.microsoft.com/</span></span></em></a></p>
<p><span><em><span>Otherwise...</span></em></span></p>
<p><em><span><span>1. See if you can download/run the MSRT manually:</span></span></em><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/malwareremove/default.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><em><span><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security/malwareremove/default.mspx</span></span></em></a></p>
<p><span><em><span>NB: Run the FULL scan, not the QUICK scan!&nbsp; You may need to download the MSRT on a non-infected machine, then
 transfer MRT.EXE to the infected machine and rename it to SCAN.EXE before running it.</span></em></span></p>
<p><em><span><span>2a. WinXP =&gt; Run the Windows Live Safety Center's 'Protection' scan (only!) in Safe
 Mode with Networking, if need be:</span></span></em><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/center/howsafe.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><em><span><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/center/howsafe.htm</span></span></em></a></p>
<p><em><span><span>2b. Vista or Win7=&gt; Run this scan instead:</span></span></em><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/center/whatsnew.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><em><span><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/center/whatsnew.htm</span></span></em></a></p>
<p><span><em><span>3. Now post the requested logs in an appropriate forum for assistance by an expert in such matters. DO NOT
 SKIP THIS STEP!!</span></em></span></p>
<p><em><span><span>I can recommend the expert assistance offered in these forums:</span></span></em><a href="http://spywarehammer.com/simplemachinesforum/index.php?board=10.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><em><span><span>http://spywarehammer.com/simplemachinesforum/index.php?board=10.0</span></span></em></a><em><span><span>,</span></span></em><a href="http://www.spywarewarrior.com/viewforum.php?f=5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><em><span><span>http://www.spywarewarrior.com/viewforum.php?f=5</span></span></em></a><em><span><span>,</span></span></em><a href="http://www.dslreports.com/forum/cleanup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><em><span><span>http://www.dslreports.com/forum/cleanup</span></span></em></a><em><span><span>,</span></span></em><a href="http://www.bluetack.co.uk/forums/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><em><span><span>http://www.bluetack.co.uk/forums/index.php</span></span></em></a><em><span><span>,

<p><em><span>If these procedures look too complex - and there is no shame in admitting this isn't your cup of tea - take the machine to a local, reputable and independent
 (i.e., not BigBoxStoreUSA or Geek Squad) computer repair shop.</span></em></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work,</span><span><span>try a clean boot&nbsp;</span></span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span>.&nbsp;
 If the problem goes away then it's just a matter of tracking down the culprit causing the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the procedures in the article.&nbsp; Once found, delete, remove, deactivate, or uninstall it.&nbsp; Once done be sure to reset Vista back to normal status as
 explained in the procedures. If the problem occurs in clean mode then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Let's test your hard drive and RAM for hardware problems:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To test your hard drive, check the manufacturer and then get the diagnostic utility from:</span></span><a href="http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html</span></span></a><span><span>
 (and/or get one from your hard drive or computer manufacturer if they have one available – it wouldn’t hurt to try both).&nbsp; If it fails the test, replace it.&nbsp; If it passes the test, then there's probably nothing wrong with it.<br />
<br />
You can also test your RAM at </span></span><a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.memtest.org/</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 If it fails, test each chip individually to find those that are bad and replace them.&nbsp; If it passes, RAM is probably OK.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE - do you have one?).&nbsp; To do this you have to also be able to boot normally so this may not apply
 in your case.<span>&nbsp; </span>Here's the procedure: </span></span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the
 system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:</span></span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></span></a><span><span>.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Please
 reply before doing the next step as it is a radical option and I’d like to make sure we’ve ruled out all other options before taking that step.</span></span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work (or you don’t have the disk), then I'm afraid the only option is a clean install.&nbsp; You can use Knoppix</span><a href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;with
 a good ISO copier like: </span><a href="http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;along
 with a blank CD.&nbsp; This should give you enough access to the system (if you can't get in any other way) to backup your important data.&nbsp; Once done, you can do a clean install either using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk or the Recovery Disk or the
 Recovery Partition (whatever process is dictated by your computer manufacturer – you may need to contact them for the procedure and perhaps to get recovery disks).&nbsp; To do a clean install proceed as follows:</span><a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/winvista_install_03.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/winvista_install_03.asp</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;(adapted
 as necessary by the procedures of your computer manufacturer).&nbsp; Then you will need to re-install all your programs, reset all your preferences, reconfigure your network and email settings, restore your backed up data, run Windows Update with possibly nearly
 150 updates pending,...</span></p>
<p><span><span>Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve or at least identify the cause of your problem.&nbsp; If&nbsp; not, post back and we'll see if there's anything else we can try besides
 spending money at a computer repair shop.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>
<p><span>P.S. I said it earlier, but want to emphasize the point.&nbsp; Do NOT use Geek Squad if you decide on taking it in for repairs (they are not well trained and mostly
 don't know what they are doing).&nbsp; Find a reputable computer repair shop or send it back to the manufacturer for sevice.</span></p>

                    Several months ago a community member provided information to accomplish my above question.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I did something that caused this shortcut to stop working, I have tried everything I know to no avail and apparently the file is no longer in my computer.
 I would very much appreciate some help to get me back to an operational&nbsp;Hibernation DESKTOP SHORTCUT.&nbsp;

<p>Thank you for the reply, I have tried your recommendation for hibernate in the recent past, but this does not work.&nbsp;I have&nbsp;Sleep &amp; Restart desktop shortcuts that do function, but I do not remember how I installed them based on information that was sent to
 be by a community member.</p>

<p>I have the same problem as Dolemite2k. I guess you have to enter the code from top-right corner at the main screen, right? Game just tries to connect to Online Pass content but it doesn't ask for the code.</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>The situation has changed since I carried out a disk check.</p>
<p>I now have a failed update code 80244019 and error code C1900101-40017.</p>
<p>Service Registration is no longer a problem it would appear.</p>
<p>In view of the change is your suggested course of action still appropriate?</p>

                    The motherboard on my computer failed, so I had to install a new motherboard.&nbsp; Windows 10 won't install saying I already have Windows 10 installed on another computer (my trashed motherboard) I get error code 0xC004C008.&nbsp; I have called Microsoft customer
 service twice but haven't found anyone that speaks English well enough for me to understand.

            It depends on how Windows 10 was originally configured on your computer.<br />
<br />
If its a full retail store bought license online or offline, it is transferable to a new computer or motherboard.<br />

If its the free upgrade from a retail store bought Windows 7 or Windows 8 license, it is transferable to a new computer or motherboard.<br />

If its the free upgrade from a OEM preinstalled Windows 7 or Windows 8 license, it is NOT transferable to a new computer or motherboard.<br />

<h2>            Iomega 100MB zip drives does not get recognized</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Iomega 100MB zip drives</p>
<p>HI there all,...</p>
<p>Is there anyone out there can can help me with an Iomega Zip drive. I have the 100 MB drive and I hv disks that have content on it I would really want to transfer to my system...I have a Dell Precision 690, running 64 bit Win 8.1 Pro.....Please help!!! &nbsp;I
 tried looking for drivers, but no luck, I need something to trust. I thought Win 8 would pick up on it, since the combatibility site said it was plausible. But I dont know, it doesnt see the drive when I hooked it up. Any instructions would greatly be appreciated...
 I am a digital artist and needed stuff for my portfolio, etc.,....anyways, I need help....</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks,&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows startup crashes after Linux installation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xios83  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows startup crashes after Linux installation</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>the following happened:&nbsp;</p>
<p>I created a new and empty partition on my hp laptop and installed Linux on it. (I checked the partition on Windows and it said it's empty, but Linux told me that there is something on it.) After I installed Linux I wanted to go into Windows via the Linux
 grub. But Windows crashes at the startup animation (starting Windows) and I get the blue screen.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I can see all the files from Windows when I use Linux. But not the former HP Recovery device, therefore I sadly cannot recover my system in that way.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I tried bootrec to fix the problem:</p>
<p>Bootrec /fixmbr - works</p>
<p>bootrec / fixboot - works</p>
<p>bootrec /rebuildbcd - does not work</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>with the linux-partition manager GParted I can see the following:</p>
<p>/dev/sda1 &nbsp;unknown &nbsp;992.50 KB unknown (possible former HP Recovery device)</p>
<p>/dev/sda2 &nbsp;ntfs &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 199.00 MB System (flagged as boot)</p>
<p>/dev/sda3 &nbsp;ntsf &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 397.19 MB &nbsp;(my Windows installation)</p>
<p>/dev/sda4 &nbsp;ext4 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 68.73 MB &nbsp; (my Linux installation)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When I use the Windows recovery disk or want to make a new installation Windows can't identify my hard-drive.</p>
<p>I checked on microsoft's page:</p>
<p>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-PK/windows7/windows-7-installation-problem-hard-drive-not-found</p>
<p>They recommend to download the driver of the hard drive and to load it in the installation. I did so on HP's homepage (in German) for my "Intel Rapid-Storage Technology, but I get the error message "specific location does not contain information about your
 hardware".</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Here are my specifications for my computer:</p>
<p>http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c02572791&amp;tmp_task=prodinfoCategory&amp;cc=de&amp;dlc=de&amp;lc=de&amp;os=4063&amp;product=4353627&amp;sw_lang=</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I am desperate to get my Windows back, but how if the hard drive is not detected by Windows?</p>
<p>Please help!</p>

            <p>Solved!!!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I found the answer somewhere on the Internet. I did not delete the Linux-Partition (which apparently blocked Windows somehow.)&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Solution for those who need it later:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1. insert Windows CD/DVD and do the "startup recovery" to restore the Windows MBR</p>
<p>2. insert Linux CD/DVD, go to the live session and use GParted to delete the Linux Partition. (You might need to unmount or delete the Flag if there is a key in front of the Partition)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Windows just starts normally and does Checkdisk after exiting the Linux-live CD. Everything is the same as left weeks ago, Just the HP Recovery Partition is formated differently and the data are lost (not a big deal though).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>hope this helps others as well!</p>

    <title>Why do I get this error when I try to do recovery on an acer by - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hekmatwali  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why do I get this error when I try to do recovery on an acer by pressing ALT &#43; F10&#58; hdd recovery validation failed press any key to continue</h2>
                    Hello guys. It's been around 3-4 months now that I've tried to find a solution for this problem. I wanne do a recovery on my Acer Aspire 5553G, but I'm getting this error:&nbsp;
hdd recovery validation failed, press any key to continue .<br />
<br />
This error appears when I have restarted computer and I am trying to enter the erecovery management program when I am restarting pc. When I turn on pc I press ALT+F10 which I think is called the Cache command or something.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Questions you might ask:<br />
<br />
Have I gone into bios and turned recovery on? Yes.<br />
Have I tried to reinstall using a disc? I didn't get the disc, when I bought the computer.<br />
Did I make a back-up recovery disc when I first got the computer? No, because I was 12 and didn't know a lot about computers and this was my first. So I didn't "posses" this kind of knowledge.<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope I find a solution for this problem and thanks in presence to those who answer and try to help
<div>Regards,</div>
<div><br />
Wali</div>

            The Factory Restore process is proprietary to Acer. It is not a Windows facility. If it does not work then you have two options:
<div>
<ul>
<li>Ask the Acer helpdesk for advice.</li><li>Order a Factory Restore DVD from Acer. There might be a handling charge.</li></ul>

If I could make my own recovery partition instead of using Acer Erecovery management.<br />

I believe there is a virus that might have corrupted the Hard Drive, but I'm not sure any ideas on how I can check too?

<div>Viruses will not survive a Factory Restore process.</div>
<div><br />
Since I have purchased several Acer machines myself, I am aware of these options:
<div>
<ul>
<li>When you first load Windows then you are prompted to burn a set of recovery DVDs. If you took this step then you can use these disks to restore the system.</li><li>Use the Factory Restore method that relies on a hidden disk partition. I assume that this method does not work on your machine.</li><li>Order a Factory Restore DVD from your Acer distributor. There might be a handling charge.</li><li>Buy a Windows 7 DVD and re-install Windows yourself.</li><li>Get the machine serviced by your Acer distributor.</li></ul>

This is one of my last options as I've already used $300+ fixing this pc several times :D Why do I fix it? Cause it has 8 GB Ram IC i7 and all that other good sht :D<br />

</li><li>Buy a Windows 7 DVD and re-install Windows yourself.<br />
I have considered this, but I believe that would buy a new computer than doing so :D<br />
<br />
</li><li>Get the machine serviced by your Acer distributor.<br />
The warranty is over.... And getting another year or 2 years of warranty would cost $400-600.</li></ul>

<p>Hi Vanessa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I've researched for this issue with AOL not syncing with Windows 10 and found a thread with an answer. Follow&nbsp;Wungraileng Vashi's answer on this
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_call/aol-mail-on-outlookcom-windows-10-mail-account-not/53e0ed3a-49be-4c5e-af23-1d167b87f180">thread</a></strong> for steps on how you
 can resolve this. Also, as mentioned on the thread I've given, better get in contact with AOL support team as they have the steps on how you can make the mail client sync again. Here's a
<strong><a href="https://help.aol.com/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> for options on how you can contact them.</p>

<p>Hi Ian!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Guess what? The next day it wasn't loading any AOL mail. But the annoying message about not syncing was gone. So I deleted AOL and then set it up again. It worked.&nbsp; So maybe you should add that step for the next dummie that comes along LOL &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On my android
 phone I just got the AOL app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the next day or so there was an update and my Microsoft games quit working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I uninstalled and reinstalled&nbsp; it a few times before it started working again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hate when there is an easy solution but my mind wont cough it up.</p>
<p>Im learning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your help :)</p>
<p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for your reply.&nbsp; &nbsp;My laptop is HP 2000, win.7, Home Premium.</p>
<p>I did resolve my issue with the continious pop up window displaying that</p>
<p>my TouchControl is not working.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I clicked on the drop down link in that window called details and found a</p>
<p>version number for TouchControl.&nbsp;&nbsp; I then went to programs (86) and began</p>
<p>going through programs and when I got to Simple Pass I discovered that</p>
<p>it had the same version number.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had never used Simple Pass which&nbsp; I think</p>
<p>is an online identity protection program when purchasing things.&nbsp; So, I went to</p>
<p>my Contol Panel and uninstalled Simple Pass.&nbsp;&nbsp; I rebooted and my problem</p>
<p>went away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I know my method was unprofessional but it worked.&nbsp;&nbsp; Before I</p>
<p>uninstalled Simple Pass I did research it online and found that if you have never</p>
<p>used it then it would uninstall clean but if you have been using it then you may</p>
<p>very well have problems purchasing items online at those websites where you were</p>
<p>using Simple Pass.&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, thank you again.&nbsp;&nbsp; I suppose I'll be back one day with</p>
<p>something else!, &nbsp; :)&nbsp; k</p>

                    <p>I have a laptop with a valid copy of Windows 7&nbsp;home premium&nbsp;on it. &nbsp;I downloaded the&nbsp;free upgrade windows 10 and installed it. &nbsp;Now my PC is not activated and when I try to run the Activate process, it returns the error "Error code: 0xC004F050" saying my
 license could not be found or was invalid. </p>
<p>I tried entering my valid CD-KEYs using the option to change the product key, but it says they are not valid keys. &nbsp;I guess that means they are not Windows 10 keys which is correct</p>

            <span>Hi,<br />
<br />
Thank you for being a part of Windows 10.<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to try the following steps.<br />
<br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1. Right Click on Start icon, then click
<strong>Run (Administrator)</strong>, then type: <strong>slui.exe 4<br />
</strong>2. Next press the 'ENTER' key<br />
3. Select your 'Country' from the list.<br />
4. Choose the 'Phone Activation' option.<br />
5. Stay on the phone (do not select/press any options) and wait for a person to help you with activation.<br />
6. Explain your problem clearly to the support person.<br />
<br />
</span><span>Hope this helps. Let us know if you have any other issues with Windows in future.</span>

<p>I have contacted MS support. I was told the issue would resolve itself in time. The support person even validated my product key. However, I'm going on 3 weeks not being able to activate my product. I have contacted support 3 times, once per week with the
 same message. Please provide a resolution.</p>

<p>Hi Anton,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you have completed the game entirely but the achievement for that didn't unlock? Is that correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes that specific data does not sync properly and may take some time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest removing your profile from your Xbox and then go ahead and do a <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console">
 turn on the Xbox. Once the Xbox is back on go ahead and re-add your profile and let the data re-sync.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may need to wait about 72 hours for achievements to update.</p>

            You could try to contact ubisoft and let them know about the issue. Sometimes they could fix it with the next Update and the achievement will pop up. But it is also possible that the achievment is glitched. I had complete everything in AC Origins too,
 but there are two Story achievments from the DLC wich Do not unlock.&nbsp;

<h2>            File recovery issue&#58; Windows 8.1 upgraded to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>OT: HELP PLEASE!! File recovery issue: Windows 8.1 upgraded to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi All</p>
<p>
</p><p>Long story, but I really need help recovering (if possible) my personal files. I am in the middle of family law proceedings and, a few days ago, I lost an enormous volume of important documents, not to mention heaps of photos etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After installing a few Windows updates manually (Windows 8.1), my computer would not reboot, apparently due to the following issue - C:\WINDOWS\System32\Logfiles\srt\srttrail.txt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I knew it was something to do with the updates and, having had issues with updates previously, I knew how to interrupt the boot process and start in safe mode. I would simply uninstall the updates. No good...would not boot in safe mode. For the next 48 hours,
 I tried this solution and that solution, but nothing would work (wouldn't refresh, wouldn't restore, tried everything I could think of in Windows diagnostics, including disabling secure boot and allowing legacy boot options, tried to learn about how I could
 find a solution in CMD). In the end, I got so frustrated that I was trying to back up my data using xcopy/robocopy (I know, don't ask), following which I would do a reset or recovery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Found some guidelines online re system recovery and, to my pleasure, noted that I would be provided an opportunity to backup my data. Off I went, but at the crucial step, when the glorious backup prompt was to reveal itself, the bloody programme went straight
 into system recovery!! Whooshka!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was so annoyed, but I figured I might be able to get the data back somehow. So there I am, surfing the net after the system recovery, and I get prompted to upgrade to Windows 10. Thought why not, and went ahead and did it. Next morning, I thought, ****
 that probably wasn't a good idea to upgrade. Enter data recovery efforts (Recuva, EaseUS etc)...and the attainment of a very basic understanding of the concepts. I have been searching, probably without much hope, for my likely-overwritten files ever since.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hoping someone can enlighten me on a means by which I may have some luck? Oh, and also answer a few, no doubt, dumb questions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. A deep search of all drives in Recuva found 4 million files, yet ignored all of them?!? I understand that this means there are none that are recoverable?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. However, doing another search (not a deep search) files were found, and while scoping the results, I notice a whole bunch of large .swm files from 2013, numbered from 1 through 50-odd. Then I noticed that they were from a recovery image and were duplicated
 on both my recovery drive (D:\) and external storage (F:\). I had seen this file extension and numbering system when foolishly trying to backup my data in CMD, so I am hopeful that these files (which I believe are an old image of my OS?) may contain some of
 my data. Can someone please advise if I am on the right track, what .swm files are and if there is any hope, given the size, that they contain my personal data pre-2013? Screen dump of Recuva below.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4bad5c98-ad5a-467d-acf9-310533d0f811" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4bad5c98-ad5a-467d-acf9-310533d0f811" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>On another no doubt foolhardy angle, I noticed some strange things about my recovery drive and backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My recovery folder in the D:\ drive, after the shenanigans above, is quite new, so there is not much data in there yet. Yet, my recovery 'image', is much larger. After checking this out, I discovered that the image has previous versions from late last year!!
 &nbsp;See all of the images below. Am I able to access these previous versions of the recovery image without turning everything to ****? What happens if i click the 'Open' or 'Restore' buttons, as per the third image below?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it likely that my personal documents, photos etc will be in there, or is it just the OS?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a bit of a computer dunce, so any help would be much appreciated!!</p>
<p>

<h2>            i need help with getting direct x 11 to work on ddo.</h2>
                    Ok i have done the following to try and get Dungeons and Dragons Online to run under direct x11 graphics setting:
<div>
<div>1. Checked to see if these items are met by the system (and correctly reported to the game**) it will detect and ask to enable DX10/11 mode:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>- Operating system must be Vista or Win7&lt;windows 7 home premium&gt;</div>
<div>- Graphics card model must support it &lt;apparently it does scents It says i'm running DX11&gt;</div>
<div>- The graphics cards drivers must correctly report it to the system (and thereby DDO) &lt;sends 10 but not 11&gt;</div>
<div>- DirectX 10/11 must be installed (and fully updated).&lt;running DX11.&gt;</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>**couldn't tell if it was being reported to the game or not. i'm good with computers but i'm not good enough to understand all the terms, codes, errors, or commands to be and techie (i'll admit i know more than the average person but not enough to&nbsp;dissect
 a program bit by bit)&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>2. went to &gt;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=2DA43D38-DB71-4C1B-BC6A-9B6652CD92A3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=2DA43D38-DB71-4C1B-BC6A-9B6652CD92A3</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<span>make
 sure DX is fully updated (make sure you 'save' the dxwebupdater.exe file to desktop and run it using right-click &gt; run as admin***).</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>*** did that as stated</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div>3. checked to see that none of the .exe files were in any&nbsp;compatibility mode or in run as admin.(none of the files were in compatibility mode or
 run as admin)</div>
<div>4. reset the the graphic settings to default.</div>
<div>5. restart the client and login.****</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>**** gives me the option to select direct x 9 or direct x 10 but when i select 10 and restart the client i get a grey screen when i log back on.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>i just got my computer 3-4 months ago and it runs the game fine but i would like to run the game in direct x 11 but it doesn't give me the option
 to. I would really&nbsp;appreciate&nbsp;any help to possibly force direct x11 to send its information to the client. but i can't seem to find any solutions that work or any thing.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>again thanks for all the help,</div>
<div><br />

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to perform clean boot and check.</span></p>
<p><span>Place the computer in a clean boot state and then check if it helps. You can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers
 and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>To set the computer in clean boot, follow the steps from the link:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to perform a clean boot</a>

<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:
</span></b><span>After checking in clean boot, follow
<b>step: 7</b> from the article to reset the computer to normal boot.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would also suggest you to run the game in older version and check.</span></p>
<p><span>Make older programs run in this version of
<span>Windows</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows</a></span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 3:</span></b></p>
<p><span>If the above doesn’t work, I would suggest you to contact the game vendor.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>They will work for the main Windows 10 platforms but with Windows 10 S/SN all of the scripty/prompty/reghacky methods of administration are disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't get me wrong I like that fact for the use I have in mind for these devices, but I wondered if there was (or is going to be) any pre/intra/post installation method of removing these distractions (which in a school they really are!!!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is an app that you can load into Intune for education called "Set up School PCs" which does do some bits, but still leaves possibly the worst parts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 S could be really good, but it still needs a bit of tweaking from an educational administrative perspective.</p>

<p>Hi Mr Da Costa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am aware of the fact that I can upgrade to Windows 10 Pro and that only Windows Store apps can be applied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upgrading defeats the object of the exercise, which is to have "Chromebook" style devices that are managed, and cannot execute external code.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact I want these to be "Edgebooks".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only use for these devices is browsing the internet for research and using cloud based O365 apps (or Edge based online versions) to present said research. There is no other requirement for these devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We currently use G Suite and find it very useful for this reason. However, our Organisation Leaders have decided that they want a Microsoft based cloud system so we have to find a best fit.</p>

    <title>MW3 Disconnect Servers and Xbox Live - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            MW3 Disconnect Servers and Xbox Live</h2>
                    
<p>So, when I'm playing MW3, It'll either back me out of the game and give me the "MW3 servers are down" bs or...it'll just kick me out of everything, including Xbox Live. This only happens when I'm playing MW3, it's never happened before. Anyone know what's
 wrong?</p>

<p>It's been happening to me every time I get on, Even in campaign it disconnects me, I connect 4-6 more times and it will let me play half a match, (as odd as this sounds) It really is aggravating leveling up every match then losing it over and over. I payed
 for Elite, Xbox live for a year, I can't even play the game, Please tell me your fixing it, I actually prayed I could play 1 match, I'm not &nbsp;obsessed with the game or anything, But when you get kicked out 30 sum times a day, it makes you really want just one
 match at any cost, I had a 20/5 match and it ended, right after the final kill cam ended, I got disconnected, Though I did get the points. Please fix this asap.</p>
