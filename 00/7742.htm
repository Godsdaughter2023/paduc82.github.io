<h2>            Keep Excel file from closing&#63;</h2>
                    Is it possible to password protect an Excel 2010 file to keep it from being closed? The file needs to stay open 24/7 and there are times where someone will accidently close it out.

            <p>Clearly you need some mechanism to allow the workbook to be closed under certain circumstances. Use the code below in the ThisWorkbook code module:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Private Sub Workbook_BeforeClose(Cancel As Boolean)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If StrComp(ThisWorkbook.Worksheets("Sheet1").Range("A1").Text, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "password", vbBinaryCompare) &lt;&gt; 0 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cancel = True<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
End Sub<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here, the workbook cannot be closed unless cell A1 on Sheet1 contains the word "password". To close the file, enter "password" in cell A1.</p>

</p><p>I got an email that I'd like to forward to somebody so I click on forward and was going to use the drop down menu to get the email address. No dropdown menu. So then I decide to open the address book. No address book. Well there is because I've seen it before
 but it looks like in one of the recent "upgrades" or something they decided to "improve" things by hiding it</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is it anyway with "improving" things by hiding stuff. I've seen that in other places too. Like browsers where you upgrade to the latest version and suddenly hey where did my favorites go</p>

    <title>Account compromised but unable to recover it through form - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Account compromised but unable to recover it through form</h2>
                    <div>
<p class="contentStandard">I tried logging in to my Skype account today and it did not accept my password. When I tried re-setting the password it showed an email address that was not mine. When I tried recovering the account using the online form (https://account.live.com/acsr)
 I received an email saying the automated system has determined that the information is not sufficient and tells me to resubmit the form. I've submitted it twice now and I keep getting the automated email saying the information was not sufficient. When I tried
 for a third time it now says to wait 24 hours before trying again. I contacted Skype customer service via chat and was told that they cannot help with this issue (which is now identity theft) until the automated form is accepted. This seems like a broken system.
 The form won't go through and they can't help me without the form going through. I am very worried about this since the account is still under my name on Skype... whoever has access to this account is not me but is using my legal name. At this point I don't
 care about the account, I just don't want my legal name being used by a hacker on Skype (I'm currently interviewing for jobs and using Skype for interviews). Any suggestions on what to do at this point?&nbsp;<br />

            Same thing happened to me few days ago. They hacked into my Skype account and linked to their Microsoft account. Recovering account through online form didn't work. And I was several times talking to support and they couldn't help. It's so obvious that
 account is hacked. My skype name is exactly the same as my gmail name and I had that account for many years. Now e-mail address&nbsp; got changed to some weird e-mail address. System is fundamentally broken and it rewards hackers leaving actual users without access
 to their account that contains all contacts, e-mail adresses, actual home address and other information. Apparently only thing I can do is to create new Skype account and tell your contacts to delete it. It seems that Microsoft doesn't care much about that.

<p><span>Hello,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We feel for your frustration. The account recovery process is fully automated and the only way to lift the restriction of the account is to provide
 the correct and matching information for the account you are trying to recover. </span>
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We suggest for you to revisit the answers provided on the form, change whatever is inaccurate; then resubmit the form. There is no limit as to how
 many tries you'd make. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If all things fail, we suggest for you to create a new account instead.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regards,
</span></p>

<p>Joseph,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already have another account created, this is more of a security issue with someone using my old account with my legal name (identity theft) and Microsoft continues to tell me to try submitting a form (allows for twice every 24 hours) in order to get any
 help. Seems like there should be other options for customers who are experiencing identity theft. Very disappointed and will use Zoom, WebEx, Google Hangouts, etc. in the future for conferencing needs.&nbsp;</p>

            Microsoft has listened to customer feedback and is allowing users who are comfortable with Skype Classic to continue use it for the forseeable future until all the issues in Skype 8 are sorted out.
<br />
<br />The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report, remove Skype 8 then reinstall the classic version.
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.

            Hi.
<br />
<br />If you have some problems with the current version, you can uninstall and return to the Classic version, since it has extended its period until new notice.

    <title>Excel crashing due to corrupt data connection - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rosskartzmark  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel crashing due to corrupt data connection</h2>
                    <p>I have been programming in Excel for 20 years. I spend 75% of my time trying to recover corrupt workbooks. The problem seems to be caused by data connections to SQLserver that become corrupt for no reason. It is worse if the queries use parameters linked
 to cells. This problem has existed in every version of Excel and every OS/platform I have ever worked on. Since the is not way to reconnect existing tables, pivots and slicers to rebuilt or new connections, the process is basically . . . start again. If you
 have a workbook with 20 sheets, this can be VERY time consuming.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Evey new version seems to get worse - it's like trudging into a swamp. The dinosaurs were around for hundreds of millions of years and I am sure Microsoft will long outlive me, but surely the will eventually drown in their customer's vomit.</p>

<h2>            lost skype contacts and credit</h2>
                    <p>I no longer manage to access my original Skype account with contacts and a credit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"New" accounts are forced on me using MS accounts that do not contain any relevant Skype data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I now download the application and try to access the original account using the correct Skype name, the name is not found. It does get found in the Web version but then I am forced to change the password again (the previous one which worked only minutes
 ago is declared incorrect which scenario is apt to happen any number of consecutive times) and when I do, I can again no longer access the Skype name based account, only the MS account based Skype account with no relevant data and no credit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help - I am in a situation I did not create and &nbsp;in which I cannot use contacts I need (also) for my work. Is there a way how I can simply access the old account or at least transfer the data in it somewhere accessible?</p>

<p>Big thanks, Susan, for being available so promptly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact I have been able to isolate the problem myself in the meantime: I was able to access the original account about a week ago and then lost it, and I have been able to relocate it again, now it is working on one computer, and I already know why I lost
 it last week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anytime I try to install on another pc or my android, the password is declared invalid and I am being forcedly led to reset it. The same happens if I log out from the already functioning screen - I cannot log with the same password another time. All the
 passwords I reset earlier in the process were for one use only !!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can we please arrange for the access system to work normally again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have a nice time until we talk again.</p>

    <title>Post Migration Calendar issues from on Prem to Office 365 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joefilipowicz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Post Migration Calendar issues from on Prem to Office 365</h2>
                    
<p>Admin Email address: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>

<p>We migrated from an on prem exchange 2010 server to office 365 two weeks ago.&nbsp; Since the migration we have had all kinds of problems with calendar events, specifically meetings with other people. When we attempt to cancel or change the time of the meeting
 that was created pre-migration, we receive an outlook error (Office for mac) or an undeliverable (Office 2010 windows).&nbsp; The event is generally removed from outlook but the other invitees never get notified and it remains on their calendar.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>There's more. If the meeting organizer signs into OWA and tries to delete a meeting they were the organizer for, it disappears for 3-5 seconds then reappears.&nbsp; The cancelation moves to their drafts folder.&nbsp; Deleting the contents of the drafts folder (In
 OWA) has no effect on the calendar appointment, it stays there on their calendar.&nbsp; The only way to remove it from their calendar that I have found is by performing the following:</p>
<p>1. Log into a terminal server as the user with their AD credentials.&nbsp; <br />
2. Launch Outlook 2013 and connect it to their O365 account.<br />
3. Open calendar and cancel the series, which brings up a Outlook dialog box asking to send cancellation.
<br />
4. After clicking "Send Cancellation" an Outlook error box pops up saying "The Operation Failed" I can only click "ok" to clear the error which sends me back to the Outlook dialog box.<br />
5. I close the dialog box by clicking the X in the right hand corner<br />
6. Magically the meeting is removed from the local Outlook calendar which then removes it from OWA and all other devices that are synced. And it does not go to the drafts folder.</p>
<p>I also have two users that dont receive meeting invites from internal or external people. Maybe that should be an additional post.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
Any direction would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p><br />
Joe Filipowicz</p>

<p>Hi Joe,</p>
<p>Generally, lacking of X.500 address under the migrated mailboxes in Office 365 might cause this kind of issue when replying to old emails or calendar events which existed on-premises Exchange before migration. To double confirm if it is this situation, I
 would like to collect the result of the cmdlet via private message (Protect your Privacy)<br />
<strong>Get-Mailbox -Identity "affected user's email address"|fl *address*</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, can you share the <strong>undeliverable message</strong> you received in Outlook client via PM also for further investigation?<br />
I have sent you a PM to request this information. Please click on the link below to access to your Private Message.<br />
<a href="https://community.office365.com/user/conversations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://community.office365.com/user/conversations</a></p>
<p>And as the issue “<strong>cannot remove meetings in OWA</strong>” might be caused by different factors, to ensure you get dedicated support, we recommend you create a new thread in our forum so that our engineers will concentrate on this issue. This will
 also help those who has the same issue quickly find the helpful reference.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time.</p>

<p>Hi Joe,</p>
<p>Thanks so much for the information. From&nbsp;PS&nbsp;results, we can see the user JoshW’s on-premises X500 address is added in cloud which is correct. However, the issue could be with a missing X500 or LegacyExchangeDN on
<strong>ANY</strong> of the attendees in the affected calendar event, including any of the members of DLs that might be listed as an attendee.</p>
<p>In this situation, it might require tremendous effort to go through each attendee and compare the X500, LegacyExchangeDN to see which one has the discrepancy. At this point, we recommend you recreate the meetings as it would be easier to for customers who
 having this issue.</p>
<p>Best regards,<br />
Ran<br />

<p>Thank you for your response. &nbsp;I understand recreating the meetings might be the best step foward. &nbsp;However you didnt address the second part of the question where I stated that we cannot delete the old meetings without them coming back and a cancelation
 going to the users drafts folder. &nbsp;What is the suggestion there? Why is that happening?</p>

<p>Hi Joe, </p>
<p>Yes, we recommend you create a new meeting with the same attendees to work around this issue and continue to use this meeting. As we discussed above, normally, we recommend our customers raise a sole issue in one thread so that our engineers can concentrate
 on this issue. And since the issue “<strong>cannot remove meetings in OWA</strong>” might have the different root cause as the first one, to find out the root cause of it and resolve it, please create a new thread in our forum.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time on this.</p>
<p>Best regards,<br />
Ran<br />

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Communities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please assist me with the following information related to this issue:</p>
<ol>
<li>How are you accessing Outlook.com emails?

Is it Lenovo Phone, computer or tablet?</li><li>Which version of Windows is installed on the Device?</li></ol>
<p>I would like to inform you that deleting Outlook.com email account&nbsp;accessing through email client(Microsoft Office Outlook) or Mail app or Outlook.com app, will not affect the settings, calendar and contacts on people. They will stay as it is if you access
 the same Outlook.com account on any other device.</p>

<p>I noticed using a tablet yesterday that the code the cat walked in had synced.&nbsp; So do you think I should delete and reinstall?</p>

            <p>Using the language setting did not help.</p>
<p>When zZoe walked over the key board she changed the lower value on the outlook mail. When I tried to change it back to gmail it disappeared.</p>
<p>I really need this to be fixed as even my calendars are not syncing.</p>
<p>So do&nbsp; I need to delete and reinstall outlook, really miss using it and I cannot do anything but send mail. Outlook has my people and calendar and it is scary to think about deleting and reinstalling.</p>

            Dear Eugene,
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />If you are using Outlook.com and you are trying to find a specific email and you remember title of the emails that are missing or email address or even domain, try use search. In this article you will find all the suggestions and tips how to search for specific email <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/search-mail-and-people-in-outlook-com-88108edf-028e-4306-b87e-7400bbb40aa7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/search...</a> If you will find those emails, you will see in which folder they are. Also, please check all the folders, especially Junk <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/working-with-message-folders-in-outlook-com-6bb0723a-f39f-4a8d-bb3f-fab5dcc2510a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/workin...</a>
<br />If your problem is different, could you please describe your situation more clearly ? What and where you are looking ? Which email client you are using ?
<br />Looking forward to your reply!

            Have already used microsoft uninstall to remove old versions and have reinstalled. If I try to open an Office 2010 document emailed to me and saved on my hard drive I get the message that Office is not installed and would I like to install it after a while
 an error message saying the program encountered a problem and does not open the word document.

            <p>Here are a couple of possible &nbsp;ways of fixing the problem:</p>
Microsoft Office 2010 Professional Plus configures each time you start - http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2528748
Office Apps reconfigure every time they are started
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Look at the event handler for error messages. In one case it was showing an error that
<span>HKLM/Software/Classes/.msg </span>could not be accessed.</span></p>
<p><span>This is how I fixed it:</span></p>
<p><span><span>·</span></span><span>Using Regedit navigate to the reg key identified in the error</span></p>
<p><span><span>·</span></span><span>When accessing Permissions, I got an error message, but ignored
 that.&nbsp; Open the Permissions window</span></p>
<p><span><span>·</span></span><span>click on the "Advanced" button.</span></p>
<p><span><span>·</span></span><span>Then select the "Owner" tab,</span></p>
<p><span><span>·</span></span><span>set the owner as "Adminstrators".
</span></p>
<p><span><span>·</span></span><span>Click Apply and OK.</span></p>
<p><span><span>·</span></span><span>Close Regedit,
</span></p>
<p><span><span>·</span></span><span>Run the application again, the Configuration process will
 run.&nbsp; Then close Outlook.</span></p>
<p><span><span>·</span></span><span>Open Regedit again</span></p>
<p><span><span>·</span></span><span>locate the same Classes/.msg key.&nbsp; You should now see a number
 of sub keys.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>·</span></span><b><u><span>For each sub key</span></u></b><b><span>
</span></b><span>, right click on it to select Permissions.</span></p>
<p><span><span>·</span></span><span>Click on the "Advanced" button,
</span></p>
<p><span><span>·</span></span><span>then the "Owner" tab,
</span></p>
<p><span><span>·</span></span><span>set the owner as "Administrators",
</span></p>
<p><span><span>·</span></span><span>click Apply and OK.</span></p>
<p><span><span>·</span></span><span>On the security tab, click on the Add button.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span><span>·</span></span><span>Add "SYSTEM" as a new user, and put a tick next to "Full Control".&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span><span>·</span></span><span>Click Apply and OK, and you should then see other users added.</span></p>
<p><span><span>·</span></span><span>Repeat the above for all sub keys.</span></p>
<p><span><span>·</span></span><span>Close Regedit,</span></p>
<p><span><span>·</span></span><span>reboot.</span></p>
<p><span>If there is no error message, ie normal operations try adding the NoReReg key, ie manual method:</span></p>
<p><span>Before you close up shop and start working on this reg fix, open the version of Word that you will want to be your default. In other
 words, say you have two versions of Word on your system. You want to use 2007, but you want 2003 to be the version that opens by default when you click on a DOC file. Open Word 2003 before you insert the fix below. This will ensure that Word 2003 is the last
 version opened and it will, if necessary, reset the registry to that version. (More on getting around this default in the next section.)
</span></p>
<p><span><span>·</span></span><span>Now make sure Word (office apps) is closed
</span></p>
<p><span><span>·</span></span><span>Start regedit<span>&nbsp;
</span>&lt;Win<span>&nbsp; </span>R&gt; and type REGEDIT<br />
Note that if this doesn't do anything, you're using a system where the administrator has taken away your ability to edit the registry so you don't mess it up!</span></p>
<p><span><span>·</span></span><span>Once within the registry, click the + (plus sign) to expand
 the <b><span>/HKEY_CURRENT_USER/</span></b><span>
</span>folder. </span></p>
<p><span><span>·</span></span><span>Scroll down and locate the
<b><span>/Software/</span></b> folder and expand that one. We have a long journey ahead, so hang in there!
</span></p>
<p><span><span>·</span></span><span>Once within the Software folder, scroll down that branch
 of the folder tree until you find the folder for <b><span>/Microsoft/</span></b>. Click the + to expand that one.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>·</span></span><span>Now scroll down to locate the
<b><span>/Office/</span></b> folder. </span></p>
<p><span><span>·</span></span><span>There you'll see the numbered versions
 of the Office versions you have:<br />
2010 is 14.0<br />
2007 is 12.0<br />
2003 is 11.0<br />
2002 is 10.0e. </span></p>
<p><span><span>·</span></span><span>This fix can be used for all recent versions. Or at least,
 I know it works as far back as 2000. I can't confirm anything earlier. But if you're still using a version older than 2000, speed is obviously not an issue for you!&lt;grin&gt; Expand the folder for the version you want to speed up. (Note, this speed up fix will
 only help you if you are running multiple versions. So if you only have one version of Office on your system. Don't bother with this setting, as it won't do anything for you.)
</span></p>
<p><span><span>·</span></span><span>Move to the
<b><span>/Word/</span></b><span>
</span>folder and expand that. Almost there! </span></p>
<p><span><span>·</span></span><span>Okay, locate the
<b><span>/Options/</span></b><span>
</span>folder and select that one. This is the folder where you'll be adding a new registry key.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>·</span></span><span>With the Options folder selected in the route we took above,
 click Edit &gt; New &gt; DWORD Value </span></p>
<p><span><span>·</span></span><span>This will insert a new registry key
 into the Options folder. It will be highlighted in edit mode so you can go right ahead and start typing the name of this key:
<b><span>NoReReg</span></b> <br />
<br />
Hit the Enter key after typing the name to have the name accepted. </span></p>
<p><span><span>·</span></span><span>Now double click this new key to open it. The Value data
 will read 0 (zero) by default. Change that setting to the number 1 </span></p>
<p><span><span>·</span></span><span>click OK to accept that value.
</span></p>
<p><span>Then close the registry. You did it!</span></p>
<p><span>So what is it that you've done? Well, you went into the Word registry settings for the version of Word you selected and you set
 a new registry key. The key is an option that stops Word from reregistering itself if another version is the current default. The value of 1 means Yes. So the NoRereg (no reregistering) is set to Yes...i.e., don't do it! This will cause Word to ignore the
 default version and just open, without taking several minutes to go through the reregistering hassle.
</span></p>
<p><span>Shortcut method:</span></p>
<p><span><span>·</span></span><span>&lt;win R&gt; to start run dialog</span></p>
<p><span><span>·</span></span><span>enter this command
</span></p>
<div>
<p>
<span>reg add HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Word\Options /v NoReReg /t REG_DWORD /d 1</span></p>
<p><span>repeat for each office app and each version installed</span></p>

            <p>Not happy to do that much to Registry.</p>
<p>Surely this is a Microsoft error either with Office or Windows 7.</p>
<p>Now when I try to open work emailed from work either in Word or Excel I get the message that the program is not installed and would I like to install, even though Excel is already open. When I answer yes to this I get the error message that there is not
 enough memory to perform this task, I have 1.75Gb of free space how much does it need!!</p>

            Yes, it is a Windows error, and the registry is the problem. It has to be fixed somehow. Manual editing is one way of doing it. Or running as admin may be enough. It is hard to tell at this distance.<br />

            2 days, ouch!<br />

Please make notes as you go of the symptoms (error messages etc) and the solutions. On this list we would like to know so we can eliminate the 2 days of pain for many others.<br />

            <p>Hello Chandana....,.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting in the forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately there in no option to organize files into Folders on thep phone.</p>
<p>But you can organize files into folders using <strong>SkyDrive</strong> application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you have a Microsoft account you can use SkyDrive to store and organize your files.</p>
<p>On your phone&nbsp;go to&nbsp;he <strong>office</strong>&nbsp; swipe to "<strong>places</strong>" there will be
<strong>SkyDrive</strong> location available.</p>
<p>Tap on SkyDrive and you will see all files stored on your SkyDrive (if there are any)</p>
<p>It will let you to organize you files same way, as you would do that on your PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To learn how to use SkyDrive you can here:</p>

<p>Hi Karim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your screenshot. Since you have turned on the notifications in iOS settings, then you need to open Outlook, tap "<strong>Settings</strong>", you can find that by opening up the left navigation menu and clicking the "<strong>gear</strong>" icon
 at the bottom. In the <strong>Notification </strong>under "<strong>Calendar</strong>", turn on push notifications there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still cannot turn on the notification, please contact in-app support for further assistance.
<strong>Open the left navigation menu &gt; tap the ? &gt; Help &amp; Feedback &gt; Click Contact Support.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Hi Karim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your update. Your settings are correct. You can try to create a test appointment and check if it works. If the issue persists, it is suggested to reinstall Outlook for iOS and check if the issue can be fixed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it still doesn't work, please contact in-app support as I mentioned. Our related engineers will help you to solve the issue.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            word copy &#38; paste between computers</h2>
                    We have 2 mac minis &amp; a MacBook air in our office. &nbsp;We have shared document file storage on a central hard drive but program/application files are on each computer. &nbsp;Somehow, when one of us uses the copy function in word (&amp; sometimes excel) and then another
 of us tries to paste, we will paste what the other person copied, not what we copied. &nbsp;It's like we have a shared clipboard. &nbsp;This doesn't happen every time, and we can't seem to pinpoint the exact triggers for when it does happen. There are also times when
 one of us will do a google search/amazon search/etc and the words we type will come up when we paste. &nbsp;The only common factors I can think of are: 1. Our company email is through gmail but we started having issues with google chrome we try not to use that
 much anymore. &nbsp;2. We have multiple licenses for Office 365 using the same email address but we each have the software downloaded on our computers so we aren't logged into Office together at t

<p>I'm afraid I don't have a solution, but perhaps this may help point you in the right direction :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's highly improbable that the issue has anything to do with the Office software, itself. Mac Office 2016 does not have any sort of Clipboard of its own. It uses the OS X Clipboard which is implemented independently on each device. In fact, it's specific
 to each User Account on the Mac, so if you log in as User A &amp; copy any content then switch to User B on the same Mac, what User A copied is not available to be pasted... IOW, User B's Clipboard will be empty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further, Cut/Copy actions are not 'remembered' by the document files in which they are performed. Once the file is closed the history of those actions is purged from memory (although the
<em>content</em> can be retained on that user's Clipboard for additional pasting elsewhere). If the document is opened by a different user or a separate installation of the software there is no record of those actions retained in the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some thoughts on what to pursue:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you using any sort of 3rd party Clipboard management software, such as Keyboard Maestro, iClip, iClipboard, CloudClip, etc.?</li><li>If none of the above, it may have something to do with network configuration set to automatically back up the Macs. Using the same credentials could be contributing to the confusion.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>You might check in the <strong><a href="https://discussions.apple.com/community/mac_os" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Apple Community</a></strong> for your version of OS X to see if there are any reports of similar behavior.</p>

<h2>            Camera App- Error 0xA00F4271&#40;0xC00D3704&#41; on Windows 10 Mobile phone</h2>
                    <p>I saw that after many pages of replies to "<span>Camera App- Error 0xA00F4271(0xC00D3704)</span>"&nbsp; and no solution, the thread was locked so nobody can reply. So I decided to try to start a thread like it again, but focusing on us abandoned Windows
 phone users who have had that problem on their Windows 10 Mobile phones. Mine is an HP EliteX3, while there are&nbsp; others I saw in the replies to the original thread ["Camera App- Error 0xA00F4271(0xC00D3704)" ]&nbsp; who have reported the same issue, many are seeing
 it on their Lumia 950XL, some on Lumias of all kinds of other number models (830, etc) that upgraded to Windows 10.</p>
<p>So Microsoft, what is your fix for this?&nbsp; If you give me a new phone, might that fix it? If so, can I go to the Microsoft store where I got my HP Elite X3 and get it changed for a new one? Or do I need to go through HP? Will either do it even if it is out
 of warranty?</p>
<p>Hoping you come through on this for us.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Office 365 - Outlook 64 bit</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>My office regularly (once/twice of below each day):</p>
<ul>
<li>randomly crashes when I try to search for an email</li><li>gives me a low memory warning when I try to open my sent files or expand a folder structure</li></ul>
<p>I have a 64bit install on a machine with 16Gb of memory and Windows 10. Can someone help fix this problem?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi John Bills,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To further troubleshoot this error, Please help to provide some information below:</p>
<ol>
<li>The detailed version of your Outlook client; you mean the issue happens once or twice a day, could you check whether it happens with a specific situation? For example, search emails in a single folder or when you only expand your Sent Items;</li><li>You mean Outlook crashes when you search emails, please clarify whether this happens when you perform a normal search or search with Common Properties, and whether the problem occurs with any search scope;</li><li>Whether your mail account is configured with Exchange;</li><li>Whether you have a large number of folders in your Outlook profile; especially a huge number of Public folders.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please update your Outlook client if you have not get the latest version of Outlook. You may hold Ctrl to start Outlook client in
<strong>safe mode</strong> and check whether the problem persists, if Outlook search works fine in safe mode, then you can disable add-ins by navigating to File&gt;Options&gt;Add-in&gt;Com-in Add. And you can check whether your Outlook client search indexing is marked,
 please go to File&gt;Options&gt;Search&gt;Indexing Options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the problem with expand a folder, this problem occurs when your Outlook messaging profile includes a Microsoft Exchange account that is configured to use Cached Exchange Mode, the&nbsp;<strong>Download Public Folder Favorites</strong>&nbsp;option is enabled, and
 you have lots of cached folders.&nbsp;Please go to File&gt;Account Settings&gt;Choose your account&gt;Change&gt;More Settings&gt;Advanced,
<strong>Uncheck</strong> Download Public Folder Favorites. Restart Outlook and check the problem. If the problem persists, please delete caches under
<em>C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Caches </em>and <em>C:\Users\user name\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Caches</em>,
<strong>NOTE</strong> that you should backup your caches first before you delete them.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Jason</p>

</p><p>I want to escalate this thread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I have had Outlook run out of memory over 20 times. Each time I had to close Outlook and open again just to expand folders in my mailbox (not public folders where there are hundreds). Also, I have had Outlook crash multiple times.</p>

<p>Hi John Bills,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand it brings you inconvenience and let’s narrow down this issue. Please provide your test results via the methods I have mentioned above, by starting Outlook in safe mode to check whether it crashes when you search emails, and we need to know whether
 your Outlook crashes when you search in All Mailboxes, All Outlook Items or a specific folder. And please check whether your Outlook client search&nbsp; indexing is marked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And please go to File&gt;Account Settings&gt;Choose your account&gt;Change&gt;More Settings&gt;Advanced,&nbsp;<strong>Uncheck</strong>&nbsp;Download Public Folder Favorites. Restart Outlook and check the problem. If the problem persists, you may delete caches under&nbsp;<em>C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Caches&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>C:\Users\user
 name\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Caches</em>.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>&nbsp;that you should backup your caches first before you delete them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let us know your test results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
