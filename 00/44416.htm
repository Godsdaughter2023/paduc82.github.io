<h2>            Groove music editing and trouble shooting</h2>
                    <p>I am wondering if there is any way to edit music on groove that automatically uploads from my music folders. Many of the "new" icons on the groove app show a folder with "unknown artist" and/or have no cover picture art. These are complete CDs in which I
 uploaded before installing Windows 10. Do I have to tweek something in the original folders?</p>

            <p>With earlier Windows, the default music player gave options for editing (individually and mass) various details such as Title, Artist, Album Genre etc. of music tracks. This is sadly lacking in Music Groove. Infact with each successive version of Windows
 this option got further limited and with Win 10, its totally disappeared.</p>

<h2>            Error&#58; Additional Space Required to Reset Computer</h2>
                    I'm trying to completely wipe my system because its performance has steadily declined over time and I suspect it's riddled with viruses, though it's still usable. I also believe said viruses are taking all the space on my computer, and I can't delete anything
 because everything I can delete has already been done and I still need 3.6 more gigabytes before I have enough space, and the only things I can delete are on the C:\\ drive and are questionably delectable. I'm worried anything I delete there will have damning
 ramifications to my computer's health and am quite hesitant to delete anything off of it more than what I've already done. I've deleted everything that I can find that's not in official Windows folders. Please help, I need this computer! If it helps, I've
 got Windows 10 on my HP Stream that I've had since June (it's March the next year).

            Hi raijinrises
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />You can execute following to gain space on your computer
<br />
<br />1. Use Storage Sense to delete unnecessary files
<br />Type Storage in Cortana Search Box &gt; Click Storage &gt; Click Change how we free up space &gt; Down below there is button Clean now under Free up space now which you should press
<br />
<br />2. Use Disk Cleanup
<br />Type Disk Cleanup in Cortana Search box &gt; Click Disk Cleanup &gt; Check relevant options (you can also clean system files)
<br />
<br />3. Analyze disk space
<br />You should analyze your existing space with help of third party softwares and remove un-necessary files. TreeSize is most popular one and is a Microsoft Store app.
<br />

<br />
<br />4. Check for log files in CBS directory
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Logs\CBS &gt; Check the size of CBS.Log and if size is huge &gt; 
<br />Type services in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Services &gt; Scroll down to find the Windows Modules Installer service and double-click on it &gt; Set its startup type to Manual &gt; Reboot your computer
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Logs\CBS &gt; Delete all of the files in the CBS folder (or rename and move to a backup drive) &gt; Reboot your computer &gt; Then go back into the Services App and set Windows Modules Installer Service back to Automatic Startup (Note CBS log files contain information about windows update. 
<br />
<br />5. Microsoft has also some suggestions to improve disk space.

<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            Hi raijinrises, you would be amazed how many users with a HP Stream ask the exact same question here on Community each day . . . 
<br />
<br />Honestly, there is only one answer,  backup your data and perform a clean install of the 32Bit version of Windows 10 - that will give you more internal storage space - I know this is not the answer you are looking for, but it is the only and best Answer. You will then have enough space for the next year of Windows 10 updates and your system will be faster . .. 
<br />
<br />Any device with a 32 GB SSD is not good enough to run Windows 10, regardless of the system specs put out by Microsoft. 
<br />
<br />I honestly don't know why the manufacturers produced these devices. 
<br />
<br />The Windows 10 folder with a couple of updates will very quickly eat up 20 - 25GB of your hard drive, mine is currently 23GB 
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything, however you will not have enough space to create the bootable Windows 10 media, you will need to do that on another working PC
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool 
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS: 
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

            There are data recovery places out there that will take the drive apart, but these are very pricey. I've heard that in some cases you can replace the controller board on the drive (if you have the exact same drive). Chances are for the time and money involved
 you would be further ahead purchasing a new copy.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<h2>            Laptop with broken monitor, can I install Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    I want to install Windows 7 on a laptop.<br />
The laptop's LCD screen is broken, 3/4 of the display doesn't show up.<br />
Windows Vista still detects it as a functional monitor and uses it as default when I start it up.<br />
Now I use the laptop with an external display.<br />
If I try to install Windows 7 with my external monitor connected, will the installation screens go to the laptop's broken monitor or the external monitor?

<p><span>Hi

<p><span>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Answers.</span></p>
<p><span>The broken screen of the laptop will not cause any problem,
<span>&nbsp;</span>you will be able to install Windows 7 on your computer <span>&nbsp;</span>and the display settings will be the same. It will not affect the display of your computer but i recommend you to fix the monitor and later upgrade to Windows 7.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sorry, but I'm a little confused, did you actually get all the achievements you wanted unlocked? Or are they still locked? And can I also ask why you were deleting and downloading your profile numerous times?

<p>While disconnected from Xbox LIVE the date of unlocking Achivements is whatever your console date is set to which might not necessarily be accurate. This can cause dates to be out of sync as the console can revert to the default 2005 date if restarted without
 being connected to Xbox LIVE. When you reconnect to Xbox LIVE, the xbox.com web site will use whatever date "timestamp" that the console was set to while disconnected from Xbox LIVE. Whether or not it's accurate depends on what the date and time was on your
 console at the time the Achievement(s) were unlocked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the future, you might want to consider simply setting yourself to "Busy" If you don't want to be bothered by popups from your friends and randoms. You'll still get Achivement notices and popups related to being disconnected/connected to Xbox LIVE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you recover your gamertag, the dates for the Achievements should match whatever is listed on xbox.com.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

            <p>Hello Manegame, <br />
<br />
The RSA Soft Token Software is not on the Windows 8 Compatibility Center. You would need to check with the manufacturer to see if they have any information about compatibility.
<br />
<br />
You can install in compatibility mode for Windows 7, Windows Vista or Windows XP.
<br />
You can right click on a .exe file and choose Troubleshoot Compatibility. <br />
<br />
Or you can go to Control Panel, click on Troubleshooting icon and follow the prompts.
<br />
Then select, Run Programs made for previous versions of Windows. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps. <br />
<br />
<br />
Marilyn </p>

<p>Dear <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/d27d82e2-fb05-4614-acb9-ca0ca5ab7ba8" title="Azaruddin Syed">
<p>Thanks much for your response. I deleted the cache and cookies, but still
 got the popup which appears in the middle of the video display (very annoying), However, after looking into it further I find that it is actually a Google Ads popup ad&nbsp;from 107Erroranswers.com saying "How to fix Error 107". It doesn't say I have Error 107,
 just sort of a scam ad on how to fix it. Below is the link to their website if you would like to see what I mean. I suppose irritating ads have to pay for the beautiful YouTube music videos. I am very sorry to have taken up your time with this.

<h2>            Skype for business integration with Outlook 2016</h2>
                    
<p>the Skype Meeting add-in isn't available in Outlook 2016. &nbsp;In Outlook 2013, the addin was associated with UCAddin.dll, in the office15 folder -- however, there is no UCaddin.dll in my office15 or office16 folders -- so there is no add-in button available
 -- Does outlook 2016 have Skype for Business calendar/meeting integration, and if so, where/how?</p>

<p>hi bcoe_neil,</p>
<p>the skype meeting add-in is still available in outlook 2016. please click file &gt; options &gt; add-ins to check if you can see it. here is an
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3097122" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a> for your reference.</p>
<p>i did a lot of research and didn’t find a place to download this add-in. i suggest you reinstall &nbsp;office 2016 and check the result, because i just installed office 2016 on my computer and it works fine. please refer to the following screenshot:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/67749e93-967b-4508-b15a-0a66c5185f3d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/67749e93-967b-4508-b15a-0a66c5185f3d" /></a></p>
<p><i>does outlook 2016 have skype for business calendar/meeting integration, and if so, where/how?</i></p>
<p>yes. for instance, create a new skype meeting in the outlook client. it’s the same as office 2013. &nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/23496655-7560-4968-9bda-b2c0700b5117" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/23496655-7560-4968-9bda-b2c0700b5117" /></a></p>

    <title>Repeated prompt for windows update KB890830 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jelbruce  say:</h3>
<h2>            Repeated prompt for windows update KB890830</h2>
                    
<p>My computer isn't updating daily like it should.&nbsp; The only update offer that I receive is for KB890830.&nbsp; I've checked my update history and it shows that the update has been successful, but it continues everyday.&nbsp; I've also tried deselecting the update so
 the prompting will discontinue, but even then, it's still giving me problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I filed an incident report and was told to do the following (see below) - which I did, but even that didn't help.&nbsp;&nbsp;Can anyone offer some advice?&nbsp; It's getting very annoying!&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This issue could be also caused if the specific registry branch is corrupted. At this time, please refer to the following steps to troubleshoot the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Step 1: Backup the Registry</span></p>
<p><span>=====================</span></p>
<p><span>As we need to modify some registry keys to troubleshoot this issue, let’s perform the following steps to backup the current Registry first.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Click Start, click Run, type regedit, and click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2. Select My Computer (the root node) in the left pane, click Export under the File menu, choose "All" under Export range, Select Desktop in the Save
 in box, type backup in File Name, and then click Save.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please Note: The backup file is on the Desktop and named backup.reg. We can simply restore the registry by double-clicking the backup.reg file. After
 we have completed the troubleshooting and the issue has been resolved, we can delete this file.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3. Close the Registry Editor.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Step 2: Restore the relevant Registry Key</span></p>
<p><span>===============================</span></p>
<p><span>1. Click Start, Run, type: notepad C:\fix.reg and press Enter. Choose Yes when you are prompted.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>2. Copy the following commands and then paste them into the opened Notepad window.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\RemovalTools]</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\RemovalTools\MRT]</span></p>
<p><span>"EULA"=dword:00000001</span></p>
<p><span>"Version"="73D860EC-4829-44DD-A064-2E36FCC21D40"</span></p>
<p><span>"GUID"="9DAA3924-5CC7-4E01-A35C-9F83F2F35C3B"</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3. After pasting the above commands, please close the Notepad window. Choose Yes when you are prompted to save the file.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Click Start, Run, type: C:\fix.reg and press Enter to run the commands we have pasted.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>5. A dialog box will pop-up saying "Are you sure you want to add the information in C:\fix.reg to the registry?". Click Yes on this dialog box</span></p>
<p><span>6. Reboot the machine.</span></p>
<p><span>7. After the machine reboots, please install the latest version of KB890830 again by the following direct link.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ooops!&nbsp; Sorry I meant Security Center and NIS 2010.&nbsp; Sorry for the cofusion.</p>
<p>Re:&nbsp; Vista Home Basic 32bit / Norton 2010</p>
<p>Should I be running Windows Security Center <em>and </em>Norton 2010 all at the same time?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I already understand that I should not have two Firewallls running at the same time and have disabled the firewall in Defender, but what about the rest?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><span>Windows</span> Security Center is a tool to check the status of several security essentials on your computer, including firewall settings,<span>Windows</span> automatic updating, anti-malware software settings, Internet security settings, and User
 Account Control settings. If<span>Windows</span> detects a problem with any of these security essentials (for example, if your antivirus program is out of date), Security Center displays a notification and places a Security Center icon
 in the notification area . Click the notification or double-click the Security Center icon to open Security Center and get information about how to fix the problem.</p>
<p>In short , You can run Norton keeping your windows security center turned on</p>
<p>Use either windows firewall or Norton firewall. Do not use two firewall at the same time</p>
<p>I hope the above info helps</p>

<h2>            Sea of thieves crashes after 15 minutes or 30 minutes</h2>
                    The game is closing for me and some friends and we literally set a timer for it, it crashes in 15 minutes almost everytime, and some time in 30 minutes and we have tried a lot of solutions like the Windows Powershell, checking the graphics, playing alone
 or coop, and we always get kicked and the game is unplayable like this, we want to know the solution or at least know if they are working on it because we have been playing since the game start waiting every day for this issue to get fixed.&nbsp; We havent encounter
 another issues like the "beard" kind issues but like now the game is unplayable for us.&nbsp;

            Hello there IVAN! Unfortunately some games just like to crash. You can try updated your graphics drivers but thats about all you can do for application programs. Since you tried so many different options it seems that its just an application error and that it may need to be patched.
<br />
<br />Hope I could help.

<h2>            Why do I need MSVCR.dll for WLM&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I reinstalled Windows-10x64 but was not allowed to do a "save files" because I was booting from a Windows-10.iso.&nbsp; After restoring (not reinstalling) Windows Live Mail, I get an error message "The code execution cannot proceed because MSCVR.dll was not found.&nbsp;
 Reinstalling the program may fix the problem."&nbsp; But I cannot do that since Microsoft won't allow that download anymore.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, it doesn't appear that MSVCR.dll was ever on my system (according to my VHD backup) and WLM ran just fine.</li><li>Why does WLM need it today when it didn't need it yesterday. please?</li></ul>

<p>The Visual C++ Runtime libraries are needed to run any program written in this language. It's likely that because you didn't install the program its dependencies have not been properly recorded. You may be lucky and find that a repair of the installation
 will correct this: repair&nbsp;should check that all the program files are present and correct and properly registered where necessary. To do this, close all running programs, then press Windows key + R, type

<p>jFiredog:</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply.&nbsp; The error message was simply: "Windows cannot find wlarp..."&nbsp; However, by running it on my Win7 I found it in Windows Live/Installer<em>.&nbsp;
</em>Note that I created the Windows/Live directory after the reinstall. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Anyway, I ran wlarp.exe and selected <em>Repair all Windows Essentials programs</em>.&nbsp; However, the response was
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Done!</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">The programs you selected have been uninstalled.</p>
Undeterred, I tried WLM again, same message about MSCR110.dll.<br />
.<br />
<p>I certainly appreciate your time and expertise so I want to make clear where I am at so I don't waste your time on a wild goose chase..</p>
<ul>
<li>I have an HP Pavilion PC with original Windows 10x64 Home Premium.</li><li>It was stuck in a BSOD loop (likely caused by the AMD update).&nbsp; Before reinstalling I created a C:drive-only VHD using disk2vhd.&nbsp;
</li><li>I did a full reinstall from the Windows-10.iso.&nbsp; I wasn't allowed a "save-my-files" because I was booting from a USB.</li><li>I restored my VHD to the C:drive, taking me back to square 0 except for the boot sector stuff (which I know little about).&nbsp; It still didn't boot but I had saved the new Windows directory (using robocopy to preserve all permissions and the like).<br />
</li><li>I moved Windows.new back to C:\Windows--getting a hybrid installation.&nbsp; It booted and I had all my files except that shortcuts to programs like Live Mail were deleted from the Desktop.&nbsp; So I tried to run WLM from Program Files (x86)--which gave me the message
 I am whining about.</li></ul>
<p>I do understand that one can't just cut out a directory like Windows and put in a different one and not expect mismatches and other problems.&nbsp; (I did an sfc and all was fixed).&nbsp; But recovering my system by copying individual files is a Herculean task.&nbsp; I
 have several 100,000 .eml files scattered among a number of Recovered folders from past PC's.&nbsp; I have many projects scattered in different directories.</p>
<ul>
<li>I was hoping to at least get Live Mail running.&nbsp; I still don't see why it needs MSCVR.dll all of a sudden.&nbsp; But I suppose a different Windows and Registry could cause this.&nbsp; I can't reinstall it now can I?&nbsp; Hmm! I have Laplink could it transfer Live Mail
 from my Win7 (I'm thinking)?</li></ul>
<p>I know you're a busy person jFiredog.&nbsp; Any suggestions would be appreciated.<br />

            I'm sorry, I just can't understand how you've gone about installing Windows Live Mail. There is really only one way to do it, and that is by running the installer file called
<strong>wlsetup-all.exe</strong>. This will place the required files in the appropriate directories, set up the appropriate registry entries and environment variables and ensure that the Windows files needed for the program's operations are present and correct.
 If you did something else - and it certainly looks like it - then I doubt that you'll ever get the program to function properly.

<p>I didn't reinstall Windows Live Mail.&nbsp; I am using the same<em> \Program Files </em>
and <em>\Program Files (x64)</em> I had when the BSOD occurred.&nbsp; In fact, the same C:drive--except, to get it to boot, I overwrote the
<em>\Windows</em> directory.&nbsp; I put in the Windows directory that is installed by a full Windows reinstall.&nbsp; Laugh if you wish, but I only had a few choices&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Keep trying to recover my PC that was in a BSOD loop.<br />
.</li><li>Keep a completely reinstalled system with everything of mine gone (doing a "save file" was not permitted) and try to recover my files.<br />
.</li><li>Keep my C:drive and destroy my programs by overwriting C:\Windows which includes the Registry, and trying to reinstall the programs that don't work.&nbsp; WLM is one of them.
<ul>
<li>I don't have wlsetup-all.exe.&nbsp; I do have wlsetup.exe but that cries for MSVCR100.dll.&nbsp; I suppose wlsetup-all.exe would bring that in, but that is not available, and Microsoft does not permit WLM downloads today.&nbsp; (Am I correct?).</li><li>I did download MSVCR100.dll using VSU_4\vcredist_x64.exe (I have Win10x64) at https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30679 . Now I have system32\MSCVR100.dll but WLM still says it can't find it.<br />
.</li></ul>
</li><li>Since I still have my C:drive VHD file, I can always go back to step 1. :-)</li></ol>
<p>Thanks for your patience with me.</p>

    <title>No sound in windows media player &#40;11.0.6002.18111&#41; only when - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xios  say:</h3>
<h2>            No sound in windows media player &#40;11.0.6002.18111&#41; only when trying to play mp3 files. No way of fixing&#47;uninstalling or re-installing. Need advice&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    I've recently encountered a problem with Windows Media Player 11 (specific version in the subject title) where no sound will play atall when trying to play mp3 files. When trying to play a track the progress indicator is moving VERY slowly and jumps in
 a stuttering fashion and no sound whatsoever is coming from the speakers. This is a recent problem.<br />
<br />
All audio files work on other audio programs like Real-player, quick time e.t.c. and sound comes from the computer normally. The only sound issue i have is with windows media player specifically when trying to play mp3 files. Video files still play fine, wav
 files play fine also. How annoying it is that it has suddenly decided that it no longer likes mp3 files!<br />
<br />
More annoyingly i have come across the fact that i cannot uninstall the player as in Vista it is part of the literal OS, i can neither download and install the WMP install package from Microsoft as i tried that and it tells me i have a more recent version of
 window media player and so cannot use the downloaded installer to install or repair windows media player. So it is impossible for me to get an install package that is as recent as the one on the computer, you would have thought the downloadable install on
 the microsoft website would be the most recent one but nope!<br />
<br />
I can't think of any way to fix this. To me it feels heavily like a Codec issue to do with WMP and MP3 files but i don't really know about Codecs enough to go about fixing the specific Codec with the issue, or to even track down which codec it may be to find
 out if it 'is' a codec issue in the first place.<br />
<br />
I have tried troubleshooting the specific settings with the options menu in WMP 11 to no avail (obviously), i have also tried an audio fault/repair tool that microsfts audio troubleshooting prompted me to try, that found no issues with the actual sound devices
 on the system... i KNOW that, its an issue with WMP and mp3 files!<br />
<br />
So, to recap, WMP won't play MP3 files, i can't run a repair tool as there is no 'installation' package for WMP 11, there isn't an uninstall utility either meaning i can't uninstall it to re-install a fresh one, i can't download the install package and run
 it as apparently i have a more up to date version than the one available on the microsoft website. So what do i do?!?!<br />
<br />
I need some advice on how to go about trying to fix this as I've hit a bit of a brick wall...<br />
<br />
Any advice would be highly appreciated!

            FIXED!<br />
<br />
randomly enough the sample rate and bit depth format had somehow been set to high in the sound driver control panel advanced tab.<br />
<br />
After hitting 'restore defaults' it reset the sample rate and bit depth back to: 16bit 44.1khz<br />
<br />
The sound now plays perfectly.<br />
<br />
Odd it only effected mp3 files!<br />
<br />
thanks for the help folks, it seems i ended up sorting it out on my own though! kudos to me!! haha

    <title>error code after changing Gamertag - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> reptileegg  say:</h3>
<h2>            error code after changing Gamertag</h2>
                    
<p>I changed my Gamertag then on my apps page it had a blank download queued that would not install. I have no idea what the download is as it is blank and the only thing I had done recently is play FIFA and then start up Titanfall (I think I got to the title
 screen, then decided to go and change my GT before finding a game).</p>
<p>The error code is 0x80072ee6 and this is on Xbox One.</p>
<p>It tries to download then stops and says "installation stopped". I did a hard reset but it is still there on the queue section of my apps page. This site does not list this error code when I entered it. What is going on please?</p>

<p>milkman - I cancelled the blank download by selecting it on my apps queue and it went away and did not come back so maybe you should try that? Anyone any idea what this is? I went on Google and it might be something to do with Windows but I don't know what
 or why it happened after I changed my GT.</p>

<p>Probably just some corrupted file that thought it needed to be installed. Since it wasn't an actual file the install failed and caused other issues with the Xbox. Usually just deleting it and powercycling the console afterwards fixes the problem.</p>

            Yes the first thing you suggested has fixed that issue, thank you.<br />
<br />
My last question is now, the system files like "System and compressed memory" are using most and at times all my "Disk" space, not even sure what that is, but that's what task manager is telling me. But I notice it happens alot, and slows my computer down when
 its doing it, sometimes freezing me up for like 20 seconds

            <p><span>Hi, </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try these following steps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1</span></b><span>: Using Windows <b>Sound Recorder</b> to test the microphone.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You can use this section to find out if the computer can record a signal from the</span></p>
<p><span>Microphone and play it back. Use Windows sound recorder to create an audio file using the following steps:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>a. Plug the <b>Microphone</b> into the computer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>b. Click Start, <b>All Programs, Accessories, and select Sound Recorder</b>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>c. Click <b>Start recording</b> and speak into the microphone.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>When finished recording, click <b>Stop Recording.</b></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>A save screen automatically opens.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Type a <b>filename</b> and click Save. A file of type <b>WAV</b> or <b>WMA</b> is created in the Documents folder.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you can record the Audio using Microphone using the above method then the Microphone is working fine.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Now it should work any application that Supports Microphone. If the computer does not record audio using the above method then it could be an issue with the settings of the Microphone. Now verify the following settings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: Enabling the Microphone.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>a. Plug the microphone into the computer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>b. Click Start, All Programs, Accessories, and select Sound Recorder.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>c. Click Start Recording and speak into the microphone.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>d. Recording tab showing a detected signal for the Microphone device</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> <b>Microphone</b> Icon should have Green check mark on it. Ifthere is no Green check mark, it means it is disabled. If there is No green mark on Microphone it never works.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To enable the Microphone Right click on Microphone and click on Enable. If you do not see the Microphone in the list, Right click on the White space and select Show disabled devices.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Then you would see the Microphone. However, if you do not see the green check mark on it, right click on it and click on Enable. And also Select Microphone and click on
<b>Set Default</b> (If Set as default button is active).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you see the Green check mark on Microphone the Microphone definitely works.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 3:</span></b><span> </span><span>Increasing Microphone Sensitivity and Un-muting the Microphone.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Select <b>Microphone</b> and click on
<b>Properties</b> button.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Adjust the slider until to <b>
100</b> % of its range.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>If Mute is on, click the mute button to un-mute the device.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>If Microphone <b>Boost</b> is available, boost the volume.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click OK to make the changes.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Now the Microphone should work. </span></p>

    <title>Numpad on sign-in screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robin846415  say:</h3>
<h2>            Numpad on sign-in screen</h2>
                    <p>I have recently bought a wireless mouse and want to be able to sign in from away from my keyboard. I have seen the feature of a keypad automatically showing up, directly under the pin-field in the sign-in screen. I want to enable this feature so I can use
 it to unlock my pc from afar, like for example using the mouse on a table from a sofa. I don't want to have to walk all the way over to my pc to sign in, after waking my pc up from sleep from my sofa.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know there is an option for an on screen keyboard, but there are several reasons that is not a viable option for me.</p>
<p>1. The keyboard sticks around after signing in, and blocks the screen</p>
<p>2. The keys are smaller and hard to click from afar</p>
<p>3. It is annoying to even get up, as I have to click on the easy-of-access button then click the on screen keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, hope someone has an answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>please read the whole thing and make sure you understand before answering.</p>
<p>I already tried looking this up, and found a 36-reply question where people just tossed generic responses at the person with the problem without ever solving it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not looking for on-screen keyboard</p>
<p>I'm not looking to enable numpad on the-screen keyboard</p>
<p>I'm not looking to enable num-lock on boot</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am looking to enable the default keypad to appear bellow my pin-field when I go to sign in.</p>
<p>Much like you wouldn't want to have to tap 3 buttons to bring up numbers when opening your phone, nor do I want to have to use a clunky on-screen keyboard to open my pc</p>
