<h2>            Windows 8.1 won&#39;t play .MOD files</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 8.1 and I can not plat .MOD files at all. It seems like Microsoft has known about this problem and fails to fix it, WHY is that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And please how do I play my .MOD files on Windows 8.1 ??</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried updating the windows codec from <a href="http://www.mediaplayercodecpack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.mediaplayercodecpack.com/</span></a>&nbsp; but when I down load it it doesn't show up on the desktop. I even tried to download it to a thumb drive and it still does not show up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please what do I have to do in order to actually be able to play .MOD files on my Windows 8.1 laptop?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have two options.</p>
<p>Try installing a different Codec Pack or use a different Media Player, VLC, etc.</p>

            <p>Funny that you say ask Microsoft. I live chatted with Microsoft and they said that I would have to call Microsoft to get help with the .Mod problem. When I called Microsoft and asked them about the .MOD problem they said they couldn't help either that they
 are not trained on that. That I would need to live chat and sent me the link right back to were I had already chated with. That's funny.</p>

            Thanks but all of these articles relate to mapped network drives. I have not mapped the drives. I used to be able to just see the other computer in Windows Explorer but now the computer does not appear. Do I need to map the drives first? I am running release
 17763.195 of Win 10 version 1809.

            Thanks for continuing to offer to help. Here's some additional information. On my computer, in Windows Explorer I can see my own computer but I cannot see my wife's computer. On my wife's computer in Windows Explorer, I can see my computer but not the
 wife's computer. On my wife's computer, I am unable to map the drive to my computer because I receive a network error saying that "Windows cannot access …". So I am baffled.

<br />
<br />In this case I'd roll back Version 1809  in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:   <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />Give it several months to mature with these problems worked out.
<br />
<br />If you want to keep it anyway, then I'd use Onedrive for sharing which many suspect is why Networking is not being fixed even though it's problems are widespread.

            If you want to report this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback. They will not even see it here. This is a tech forums staffed mostly by volunteers trying to help others with your problems.
<br />
<br />If you want to post back a Share link from your Feedback here others who see this thread can vote it up and add to it. I will also track the issue for you.

            Thanks for the suggestions. Unfortunately, I cannot roll back. I have done several clean installs thinking I had done something wrong with the install. And then, in an effort to free up disk space, I ran disk cleanup and deleted system files. So I guess
 I will have to live with it until fixed. But I do appreciate your assistance.

            Actually you could do one more reinstall using Version 1803, using the media downloaded from MS TechBench here:  <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>.
<br />
<br />Burn to DVD using WIndows Image Burner or create bootable flash using one of the options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />
<br />Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />Immediately after install, run the Hide Updates tool until it finds Version 1809 and Hide it:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>.

    <title>Urlmon.dll file missing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> james_1414  say:</h3>
<h2>            Urlmon.dll file missing</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently, I have had trouble installing the game <strong>Theme Park Inc</strong> on my Windows 8 (64-bit system). I installed the game successfully on my computer but when i came to run it an error message occurred saying the
<strong>urlmon.dll</strong> file was missing from the dynamic link library. I checked the location of the file and found it there though, concluding that file must be corrupt. Then i used
<strong>regsvr32</strong> in command prompt to re-register the file, however this did not work. Lastly, I tried a
<strong>sfc/scanow</strong> in command prompt to repair and fix the corrupted file. However, after the first stage of this process the scan stopped and said that some files had not been fixed, and that i should look in the
<strong>CBS.log</strong> for the report. After doing this i found no <strong>url.mon.dll</strong> file there, so I presumed the file had been fixed. However, when i tried again the same error came up. I have also tried for viruses but found none and internet
 explorer is fully updated as well. A <strong>response </strong>to this query would be most appreciated, as I am puzzled as to what to do next.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi James,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Urlmon.dll</strong> errors often indicate a registry problem, a virus or malware issue, or even a hardware failure. Urlmon.dll is a type of DLL file. DLL (Dynamic Link Library) files are small programs which allow multiple software programs to share
 the same functionality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Urlmon.dll errors can also be related to corrupt or outdated device drivers. Drivers may suddenly stop working for a variety of reasons. The good thing is that you can often update your device drivers to resolve the DLL problem. You may visit the PC manufacturer's
 website to download and install the latest version of your device drivers. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need further assistance, let us know. </p>

<p>Hello Rosh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We understand that your Surface Book 2's display is distorted when you start up your device. We recommend that you perform a
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">clean boot
</a></strong>on your device and observe if the display still gets distorted after you restart the Surface Book 2. On the other hand, with your concern about video streaming on your Edge browser, we recommend that you try a different browser and see if the same
 problem would occur. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

<h2>            Cannot find Teredo IP adress and NAT type is strict&#47;unavaible</h2>
                    <p>On my PS4, everything on my connection is fine, and that nat type is open. I have no trouble with any multiplayer features. I recently got an Xbox one, and when I check the multiplayer connection, it say "Teredo IP adress cannot be found." On the game Rainbow six siege, the NAT type is strict and I'm unable to join parties. I tried all the solutions on the help forums, except looking inside my router because the ps4 seems fine. Ive tried resetting my Xbox, holding the power button and restarting my router &nbsp;and modem. I called tech support and tried everything again, and at the end when nothing worked I was told to call my wifi company, I didn't because everything is fine with my ps4.</p>

    <title>Setup Launcher has stopped working - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Setup Launcher has stopped working</h2>
                    <p>A number of applications give me this error: Setup Launcher has stopped working and I have NO idea why. When I click the HP Support Assistent I get it. When I go to the HP web site and their drivers and downloads page for my computer I get them when I try
 to install the apps</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<div>
<p>When I go to&nbsp;<a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareCategory?os=4063&amp;lc=en&amp;cc=us&amp;dlc=en&amp;sw_lang=&amp;product=5155324#N1401" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareCategory?os=4063&amp;lc=en&amp;cc=us&amp;dlc=en&amp;sw_lang=&amp;product=5155324#N1401</a>&nbsp;and
 download software solutions I get "Setup Launcher has stopped working"</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I even go to&nbsp;<a href="http://www8.hp.com/us/en/drivers.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www8.hp.com/us/en/drivers.html</a><span>&nbsp;(drivers and downloads page) and I tell it to detect my product it won't.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Some programs won't even open anymore. The only thing different is my orginal Windows 7 was part of my HP discs and I had the Ultimate upgrade over it. Then a computer person came over after my hard drive failed and said that the Ultimate Upgrade would
 be a lot better to put on and it would work just fine. I found out later that wasn't the case and had to purchase a new product key because it is not considered a full version. So, I did purchase it because I just wanted my computer to work again and not have
 to reinstall everything again.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I also run Avast Internet Security all the time and then I use other things like Malwarebytes, Hitman Pro, Emsisoft Anti-malware. I don't run these all at the same time. I'm&nbsp;diligent&nbsp;about protecting myself from virus' and malware. So, that's
 why it's strange I should&nbsp;have this problem as well that I mention next:&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to Windows Help I keep getting weird things like this word that shows up:&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<p><span>__elbasuer__</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For example here is the first part of one:</span></p>
<p><span>Using ISDN</span></p>
<div>
<p>__elbasuer__</p>
<p>__elbasuer__</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the first part of another one:</p>
<div>Change default programs using Set Program Access and Computer Defaults
<p>__elbasuer__</p>
<p>__elbasuer__</p>
</div>
<p>

<p>I am NOT advanced but I'm NOT a beginner. Any instructions you give me please be simple about it.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Claudia,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community Forums. We appreciate your efforts on this issue.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>-Is this issue specific to HP drivers/software?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue can occur if antivirus/firewall is blocking the installation or due to third-party application conflict. I would suggest you try these steps and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Method 1: Run the program as an administrator and check the issue status.</span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Right click on setup installation file.</span></li><li><span>Select "Run as Administrator".</span></li><li><span>Check the issue status.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Follow the instructions below to start the Windows installer service.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Click on Start.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Type in <strong><em>services.msc</em></strong> and hit enter.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Locate Windows Installer.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Right click on it and start the service.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Change the type to Automatic from Properties.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Method 3:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Let us try to disable the antivirus/firewall and check if it is working. Refer to the help link below:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Turn-Windows-Firewall-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://Windows.microsoft.com/en-US/Windows7/Turn-Windows-Firewall-on-or-off</a></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 4:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If issue persists, place the computer in <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>clean boot</strong></a> to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: After troubleshooting, see the section “<strong>Reset the computer to start as usual</strong>” to return the computer to a
<strong>Normal startup</strong> mode.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To troubleshoot the issues with opening Windows Help and Support, try these steps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>On research, I see that this issue is caused by Bluetooth software.&nbsp;If you have Bluetooth in your pc, it is pretty much sure that it is causing the help files to be corrupted.</span></p>
<p><span>You may follow the below steps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Click on Start, type <strong><em>regedit.exe</em></strong> in the Search field, and press Enter.</span></li><li><span>Provide consent to User Account Control if prompted.</span></li><li><span>In the left hand navigation pane, expand each registry key until you are at&nbsp;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Assistance\Client\1.0\Namespaces\OEM\en-US\Topics.</span></li><li><span>Delete the "<strong><span>BCRM_Bluetooth_Help</span></strong>" string value (REG_SZ).</span></li><li><span>Close the Registry Editor and re-launch Windows Help and Support."</span></li></ol>
<strong>Important</strong> Follow the steps in this section carefully. Serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Before you modify it,
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">back up the registry for restoration
</a>in case problems occur.
<p>
</p><p><span>Let us know the status of the issue. If you need further assistance, please post back. We will be glad to help you.</span></p>

<br />Do you know the full history of your PC or version of Windows? 
<br />
<br />Is your PC second hand or was Windows reinstalled by a PC Repair Shop?
<br />
<br />2
<br />Click your Start Button, type cmd then right click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator' 
<br />
<br />Run or paste this command and hit Enter: 
<br />
<br />slmgr.vbs /dlv

<h2>            Windows Defender not working.</h2>
                    <div>I have recently up[graded a computer from Windows 7 Home Premium to Windows 8 Pro on 26/10/2012.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Windows Defender worked OK after the upgrade up until 28/10/2012 then it stopped working..&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The initial error message was that Windows Defender was turned off and couldn't be started every time I tried to start it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I went into the Group Policy editor Local Group Policy\Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Windows Defender and Disabled 'Turn Off Windows Defender'.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I could then start Windows Defender.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
When I try to start Windows Defender I now get the following errors.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Couldn't start the Windows Defender service.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I check in Services the Windows Defender Service IS running and is set to Automatic (trigger)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I also get the error message when trying to start the anti-virus protection by clicking on the red Enable button in Windows Defender home page.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The group or resource is not in the correct state to perform the requested operation.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The next error message says:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Virus and Spyware definitions are out of date.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I go to the Update tab and try to update it appears to work with the definition last update date as the current date, and has the correct virus and spyware definitions number (1.139.1454.0)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>However it says Definitions created on: 1/01/1970!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have deleted the Windows Defender folder from C:\Program Data\Microsoft\ to force a complete download of the latest definitions folder in Windows update.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Windows Update downloads and installs the latest definitions file successfully, but in Windows Defender Update it still says the File Creation Date is 1/01/1970!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can anyone help?</div>
<div><br />

    <title>How to open NAT to resolve Party and Multiplayer problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> arminatorx  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to open NAT to resolve Party and Multiplayer problems</h2>
                    
<p>Here is an update to my old NAT guide from the old forums. It is now updated for the new Metro dashboard GUI, and I added some insight gained from resolving problems in the old thread and consolidating them into this guide.</p>
<p>If you want to find stuff out for yourself, I can also recommend checking out
<a href="http://www.unofficialguidetolive.co.uk/faqs/62-my-nat-is-strict-or-moderate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Shad0wmanUK's Unofficial Guide to Xbox Live</a>, and the <a href="http://www.portforward.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Port Forward</a> website.</p>
<p>Also try the troubleshooting tips below. However, if you're just curious what NAT is, and why you need it, you can scroll down to the last chapter(or
click here) for an explanation of what NAT is, and why you currently need it to be open.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Open, moderate or strict NAT? How do I know my NAT status?
<p>Just turn on your console, go up into the ribbon to the "Settings", then select the “System” tile in the upper left. If necessary, choose your appropriate connection type (wired or wireless), and then do a network test to Xbox
 Live.</p>
<p>If your console doesn't give you an error message about NAT, you already have an open NAT. Congratulations. You are finished here. Go play! If you experience problems with some friends, ask them to do the network test for themselves,
 and if they have a strict or moderate NAT, direct them here.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>If, however, your Xbox tells you something about strict or moderate NAT, read on to hopefully resolve this.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;</p>
So how do I open my NAT?
<p>That depends on your router. Since I can't possibly know all routers, I will give general instructions on how to configure your router to get an open NAT. How you carry out these instructions on your specific router, is up to
 you. If in doubt, check your router's documentation or make a post. <b>BUT!</b> When asking here for help, please
<b>provide us the exact make <span>and</span>model of your router and modem. </b>
Just telling us you have "a Netgear WLAN router" won't help as much as telling us you have "a Netgear WGR614 v3 connected to a Motorola SB2100 cable modem". THat way we can (hopefully) find the user manual online and help you out.</p>
<p>Don't forget to check out Shad0wmanUK's&nbsp;<a href="http://www.unofficialguidetolive.co.uk/faqs/62-my-nat-is-strict-or-moderate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">page</a>, as it has lot's of router makes and models listed.</p>
<p>But first, try it yourself. It's really easy with most routers. Especially if they are capable of UPnP.</p>
Use Universal Plug and Play
<p>Look in your router's documentation to see if it is capable of UPnP (for more information on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">UPnP</a>, check the
NAT explanation below). If it is supported, enable it in the router's configuration. Just enable it, and you should be done (sometimes your router needs to be restarted. If necessary simply pull the router's powercord and replug
 it again).</p>
<p>If you continue to have a non-open NAT, look at the
troubleshooting tips below.</p>
My router can't use UPnP: Manual port forwarding
<p>If your router doesn't support UPnP, you need to manually create a port forwarding list for your router. This process is different for every router, so again: Please check your router's manual on how to do it.</p>
<p>Another great resource of information for this&nbsp;is the&nbsp;<a href="http://portforward.com/english/applications/port_forwarding/XBOX360_Call_of_Duty_-_Black_Ops/XBOX360_Call_of_Duty_-_Black_Opsindex.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Port Forward Website</a>.
 Just find your router model in that list, and you will get a guide with pictures and detailed instructions on how to forward ports on your router.</p>
<p>Go to your console, and in the "Settings" hub, select the “System” tile in the upper left, then “Network Settings.” If necessary, choose the connection type you use (wired or wireless) and take note of the current settings of
 your console.</p>
<p>For example, if your console is set to automatic, it might have an IP of 192.168.1.23, Subnet Mask 255.255.255.0, Default gateway of 192.168.1.1 (this is the internal IP address of your router), and the IP of the DNS should be
 the IP of your router as well.</p>
<p>Now set your console configuration to manual, and simply copy the settings for IP, Subnet Mask, Default Gateway and DNS into the appropriate fields. This will prevent the IP of your console changing. Otherwise the Router will
 forward the ports to the wrong IP, should the IP of the console automatically change for whatever reason.</p>
<p>Take note of the IP of your console (in this example 192.168.1.23) and go to your PC.</p>
<p>On your PC, browse to the configuration page of your router with your internet browser. Either look in the documentation of your router, or simply type in the IP of the default gateway into the browsers address bar (in our example,
 you would enter "http://192.168.1.1" in the address bar).</p>
<p>If necessary, log into the administration page of your router.</p>
<p>Depending on the router model, find the appropriate configuration page for port forwarding. Look for menu items "<b>Port Forwarding</b>", "<b>Exposed Host</b>", "<b>Virtual Server</b>", "<b>NAT</b>", "<b>DMZ</b>" or something
 like that.</p>
<p>If you find something like "Port Triggering" or "Port Mapping", this is
<b>not</b> what you're looking for. But you're very close. Instead of "Triggering" or "Mapping" look for "Forwarding".</p>
<p>You should get to a configuration page, that asks for incoming port, protocol and internal IP address.</p>
<p>You will need to forward the following ports to the static IP of your Xbox console, that you set up earlier (and made a note of. In our example this was the 192.168.1.23)</p>
<p>Now forward the following ports to that IP:</p>
<ul>
<li>UDP 53 </li><li>TCP 53 </li><li>TCP 80 </li><li>UDP 88 </li><li>UDP 3074 </li><li>TCP 3074 </li></ul>
<p>Sometimes a router allows a protocol setting for "both" TCP and UDP combined. If so, choose that to save you some work and create only a single rule for ports 53 and 3074.</p>
Whoa! Wait a minute! Opening ports! Don't all hackers use open ports to hack you?
<p>Well, yes and no. Open ports themselves are not the real danger. Vulnerable software listening on opened ports is. Let's make an analogy here. Imagine your router is a large government office building. Like the immigration office,
 or the department of motor vehicles or something like that. Each bureau has a specific number (port number) and a very specific task (i.e. you can't go into department for motorvehicles and ask for an immigration visum or something like that).</p>
<p>So imagine a hacker scanning your public IP address of the router's outside (since that is the only thing the hacker can see from the Internet), and he detects that port 3074 is open since you're playing an online multiplayer
 match on your Xbox console.</p>
<p>So he goes inside the office with the number 3074 (as all other offices are closed) and sees a clerk with Xbox uniform hard at work managing a Halo Multiplayer match.</p>
<p>The hacker opens the small window at the counter, and starts to shout exploits and throws hacking tools at the clerk. The clerk just looks at the hacker and says "Sorry kid. Wrong office. I only do Multiplayer here!" and slams
 the small window into the hackers face.</p>
<p>As long as you only open the ports necessary for the applications you use (and trust), you have nothing to fear. Just think of it that way: Even if you refuse to manually open ports, right now, when you open a web page, the router
 has already opened an incoming port to let the website data inside to forward it to your PC. Otherwise you couldn't read this text.</p>
<p>So don't be afraid of opening ports. Just be careful to open
<b>just</b> the ports you <b>really</b> need, and forward it to the correct device.</p>
But I have a strict or moderate NAT and am able to play with people. Magic?!!?
<p>Not really. The Xbox Live matchmaking service just managed to match you to a player that has an open NAT himself. And in that case it works just like
that example below with the PC actively requesting a webpage. Your Xbox console just shouted to the router "Hey router! Xbox Live told me about a Halo match at 123.45.67.89, please connect me to that." and the router will do that,
 and since he now knows, the Xbox requested that, will automatically route the incoming traffic to the Xbox.</p>
<p>However, as soon as a second player with a non-open NAT joins that game (or a Live Party), it can lead to various problems.</p>
<p>So even if you were able to play with some folks while having a non-open NAT, make sure you get your NAT opened.</p>
Okay, so I turned on UPnP. I manually forwarded ports to the correct IP. But it still doesn't work!
<p>From the insight I got from the old NAT thread, these are the most common problems you encounter when trying to open your NAT.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;</p>
Double NAT
<p>When you signed up for your Internet service, you might have gotten a cheap (or even free) modem device with basic functions from your Internet Service Provider. Now you wanted more comfort and maybe a Wireless router. So you
 buy a router, connect it to the modem you got from your ISP, and all is seemingly well.</p>
<p>You find that you have a non-open NAT, so you log in into your new WLAN router and set up everything correctly. But it still won't give you an open NAT.</p>
<p>In that case, the cheap modem you got from your ISP might be a Modem with built in NAT functionality. For example some Motorola Surfboard modems are able to simultaneously connect up to 31 devices to the Internet, despite having
 just one ethernet port (with the help of ethernet switches).</p>
<p>So while you told your WLAN router to allow Xbox Live traffic to the Xbox, the Motorola router still refuses to let anyone inside.</p>
<p>To resolve that, you need to configure your modem for "<b>bridging mode</b>" or "<b>pass through</b>" mode. In most cases, you might even need to call your Internet provider, as a lot of modems get a custom firmware specifically
 made for your Internet Service Provider.</p>
<p>If it is not possible to configure the modem for bridging mode, try to plug the cable from the modem to the router into one of the router's LAN ports instead of the router's WAN interface. This way you circumvent the NAT routing
 of the WLAN router, and just need to configure the Modem's port forwarding (if possible).</p>
<p>If everything else fails, you probably need to buy a new "stupid" (i.e. with no NAT capabilities) broadband modem.</p>
I use my Laptop as a wireless bridge to connect my Xbox to the WLAN router.
<p>See above for the Double NAT problem, as the Internet connection sharing on your Laptop is basically also an additional NAT device. In order for this to work correctly you either need to configure your router to forward the Live
 ports to your Laptops WLAN IP address, and in the advanced settings of the shared connection, you need to forward these ports again to your Xbox console connected to the Laptop.</p>
<p>Or, to make things easier, instead of using Internet Connection Sharing, bridge the connection. To do that, select both your LAN and WLAN adapters on your computer (if necessary hold CTRL while clicking on each adapter). Right
 click on the selection and choose to bridge these interfaces.</p>
<p>Now just configure your router to forward incoming Live traffic directly to the Xbox's (static) IP address.</p>
Restrictive Firewall or Intrusion Detection Systems in your router
<p>Some routers specifically have a Firewall running on them. In my (personal) opinion this is a simple marketing ploy to convince the buyer in getting this router, since it additionally has a firewall built in.</p>
<p>Because, even if you turn this firewall off (or buy a device without firewall in the first place), the router itself
<b>still is</b> a firewall. Because if you didn't specifically give the router a port forwarding list, the router will reject all unknown incoming traffic. And this is the purpose of a firewall: Deny unintended traffic into your network.</p>
<p>So having a firewall enabled on a router, is like telling one bouncer at your disco to allow your friends inside for a multiplayer match, while telling a second bouncer to make sure
<b>no one ever</b> gets past that other bouncer. Not even your friends.</p>
<p>A similar problem is with Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). These tools are there to defend your network from malicious attacks. But since attackers aren't marking their attacks as malicious (just imagine a terrorist asking
 the guard if it's OK if he just goes in there and blows up the building), IDS systems try to look for patterns, that
<b>could</b> be an attack.</p>
<p>Now if you initiate a multiplayer match, a lot of different IP adresses are suddenly asking your network if there is still room in your match for another player. The pattern of a lot of "strangers" suddenly asking for access
 into your network could be mistaken as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack#Distributed_attack" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Distributed Denial of Service</a> attack, and therefore the router will block these requests.</p>
<p>So just turn off these "security" features of your router.</p>
Two or more Xbox consoles for multiplayer at the same time
<p>If you have two or more Xbox consoles that are supposed to play online multiplayer at the same time, the router is stuck with the same dilemma as with the quiet listen server in the
"What is this NAT thing anyways" explanation below. If there are incoming Xbox Live data packets to the router, to which of the two consoles should these packets be sent? Xbox A or Xbox B?</p>
<p>Let's make an analogy: Your router's public IP address is the street address of an apartment complex. In that building you have two men named "John Smith".</p>
<p>Now if the postman comes with a packet for "John Smith" at that street address (but no apartment number), and the postman sees two Mr. Smith on the doorbells, he just throws away the packet and goes away. Both consoles have a
 strict NAT.</p>
<p>The tricky part with two consoles is: You can <b>
manually</b> only configure port forwarding rules for <b>one</b> specific port to only
<b>one</b> specific destination.</p>
<p>To keep with the analogy: This would mean that one Mr. Smith puts a sticker on his doorbell reading "All packets to John Smith to me here!"</p>
<p>This way, only that Mr. Smith with the sticker on his doorbell will get all packets (the one Xbox having an open NAT), while the other Mr. Smith still won't get any packets.</p>
<p>Placing the other Xbox into a DMZ (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMZ_%28computing%29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">De-Militarized Zone</a>) is like one of the Mr. Smiths camping outside the apartment complex near the doorbells, and grabbing every
 Packet for any Mr. Smith himself before the mailman reaches the doorbells.</p>
<p>Depending on how the router priorizes DMZ or Port Forwarding over the other, the mailman could still tell the camping Mr. Smith, that the sticker on the doorbell reads to deliver packets for Mr. Smith there instead of the camping
 Mr. Smith.</p>
<p>Either way, one of the both Xbox consoles will always have a non-open NAT.</p>
<p>The only solution to this problem is to use a router with a
<b>very good</b> implementation of UPnP.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, not all routers with UPnP are able to support two (or more) Xbox consoles. Therefore, Microsoft has tested several routers, and those that were able to support multiple Xbox consoles, got a certification and an
 official "Compatible with Windows 7/Vista" sticker.</p>
<p>On the support site there is a <a href="http://xbx.lv/pXMn6f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
list of compatible routers that support two consoles</a>.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if your router does not have UPnP, or if it has UPnP and still one or both consoles show a non-open NAT, you need to buy a new router.</p>
<p>Also keep in mind, that the Games for Windows Live Client on a PC uses the same Xbox Live ports for multiplayer. Even if you don't have two consoles, this might be the problem.</p>
I think I followed these instructions correctly, but it still won't work
<p>If you think you did everything right, and already checked for the most common problems, specifically the double NAT problem above, feel free to post here, and ask for help.</p>
<p>But <b>please</b>, in order to help you, you first need to help us, by describing your network setup as specific as possible.</p>
<p>Try to describe all devices that your Xbox needs to traverse in order to reach the internet. Please use the full model name of the device(s).</p>
<p>A <b>bad</b> request for help would be "HELP! I have that Netgear router, and I can't play multiplayer!"</p>
<p>A <b>good</b> request for help would be something like this: "Help! I have a Netgear WGR614 v3 router connected to a Motorola SB 2100 cable modem. My console can connect to Xbox Live, but complains about moderate NAT. I can't
 play Black Ops with my friends!"</p>
<p>The more we know about your network setup, the better we can help.
<b>So please help us help you! Thank you!</b></p>
What is this NAT thing anyways?
<p>NAT is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronym_and_initialism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
acronym</a> for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Network Access Translation</a>. It's purpose is to allow multiple devices in your home to access one internet line and be connected online simultaneously. Those with enough networking knowledge, please keep in mind, that this explanation is intentionally kept
 simple, and oversimplifies the whole process, so the average "I don't want to become a Cisco Certified Network Associate, I just want to play Black Ops with my friend!" can easily relate to what's happening in his home network.</p>
<p>While <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipv6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
IPv6</a> resolves most of the problems described below, keep in mind that currently nearly all Internet Service Providers (and Xbox) still only use
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipv4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">IPv4</a> for private home users, and will do so for quite some time.</p>
<p>As you might already know, each device on a TCP/IP network (and the Internet is just a very large network) needs to have its own unique
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">IP address</a>. When you sign up for Internet service with your Internet provider, you usually get one connection to the Internet, and it's only
<b>one</b> IP address. But since you want your Laptop, your PC, your Xbox 360 and many other Internet aware devices in your home to connect online, you may begin to see the problem. It's not possible for your Internet provider to give all your devices unique
 IP adresses, as you would need to tell him about each new device you buy, and IPv4 adresses are basically "sold out". All IPv4 numbers are currently given out, so your new device can't get one anyways.</p>
<p>To resolve this, you usually get a router from your Internet provider, that does NAT. The interface, that connects to the Internet (called WAN Interface, for
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_area_network" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Wide Area Network</a>) recieves this unique public IP address visible from the Internet. I's basically the "street address" of your home for the Internet.</p>
<p>On the "inside" of your home, the router gives <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
private IP adresses</a> to the devices connected to its LAN ports (for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Local Area Network</a>). So your PC, Xbox, Laptop and internet aware fridge will get an IP address from certain reserved IP ranges. Usually IP Adresses in the range of 192.168.XXX.YYY or 10.XXX.YYY.ZZZ.</p>
<p>To better explain what NAT does, let's make an example.</p>
<p>You are sitting at your PC and want to go to Xbox.com, while your sister is doing homework on her Laptop and wants to do some research on Wikipedia. Both of you type the adress of the websites into your browsers and hit Enter.</p>
<p>Your PC now shouts to the router "Hey router! I'm the PC, and I want to fetch http://www.xbox.com!". The router now takes the order, writes in a list, that the PC wanted to see Xbox.com, and relays the order to the Internet.
 The laptop shouts: "Hey router! I'm the laptop and want to go to http://en.wikipedia.org!", and the router also writes in the list, that the laptop wants to see the Wikipedia homepage. It then shouts to the Internet "Hey Wikipedia! I'm the router at the public
 IP Address 123.45.67.89 and am requesting the page for a device inside my network!".</p>
<p>Now xbox.com answers, and sends data to the public IP address of the router. The router now looks at its notes, and remembers, that the PC wanted to see Xbox.com. So the router forwards the incoming data to the PC. When Wikipedia
 answers, the data gets routed to the Laptop.</p>
<p>So far so good. But there are multiplayer games, that use so called "listen servers" (imagine an "ear" the computer uses to listen to incoming other players) to host a game.This means, that if you for example start a game of
 Counterstrike on your PC, your PC will silently listen on it's internal IP 192.168.1.20 for other players.</p>
<p>The problem is: No one knows that the PC is simply listening to incoming requests. In the previous example, the PC shouted out it's order to fetch Xbox.com. Now it's quietly sitting there, listening for other players.</p>
<p>Just imagine a router being a bouncer of a popular club with gaming consoles inside, and you, inside the club, use your cellphone to invite your friends over to the club for a gaming session.</p>
<p>When your friends arrive, they are stopped by the bouncer: "Stop! You are not on my guest list, and with these pants you don't get inside here."<br />
Your friend: "But I am invited! See? My friend sent me that message, that he's playing Halo here!"<br />
Bouncer: "I don't know you, and I don't know of any Halo match. So beat it, before I beat you!"<br />
Your friend: "Okay, calm down! I'm going already..."</p>
<p>Inside you're wondering why your friends don't show up.</p>
<p>Had you told the bouncer that you are doing a Halo match and awaiting your friends, he could write your friends on the guest list, let them inside and direct them to the gaming area where you're waiting for your buddies to arrive.</p>
<p>In router language this "guest list" would be forwarded ports. So in natural language you would tell the router: "If there is incoming traffic on port 27015, this is data for a counterstrike game on the PC, and if data arrives
 on port 3074, it's for the Xbox 360, so please forward it that way."</p>
<p>The router will then do exactly that, and your console won't know a router is there, which results in an open NAT.</p>
<p>I hope this clears up a bit about the confusion what NAT is, and why it's not in Microsoft’s hands to "get rid" of NAT. Maybe in the (not so distant) future, the use of IPv6 gets more popular. With IPv6 any IPv6 capable device
 has its own unique publicly accessible IP address, so NAT isn't necessary. Until then you need to rely on UPnP or manual port forwarding to resolve your NAT issues.<br />

<span><strong>Your Nat still Strict/Moderate? Check here.</strong></span><br />
<br />
Okay, &nbsp;there has been numerous posts about opening your Nat. Most of those posts refer to the UPNP issue where you have to have your UPNP Plug and Play connection on through your router. Though there is another hidden settings in a lot of routers that even
 with that on will still cause you some Nat issues. Well to get to the point of things, there is the Nat, which is a connection through your Gateway allowing multiple devices to connect to the internet with Open Port use. One of these devices is your Xbox 360,
 your computer, even a network compatible Blu-ray player. Though you get online with these devices and they cause some lag, or they're not getting full connection, like displayed on your console it says, "Your Nat is Strict" even Moderate. After reading a lot
 of the posts and looking through them I have noticed that there is a basic problem with peoples Nat settings, a lot of times you can turn this on in your router settings yourself (or like my ISP had them hidden).</p>
<p><span><strong>Full Cone Nat (&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_cone_NAT#Full-cone_NAT" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_cone_NAT#Full-cone_NAT</a>&nbsp;)</strong></span></p>
<p><span>This setting is a built in controller used by a lot of Internet Service Providers and this will cause restrictions to your Nat settings if these are turned off. What is going to happen is that some of your ports will be turned off automatically by
 this service only allowing a certain amount of services to be sent through your ISP's Gateway. When you want to fix this issue you'll have to change the settings in your Router or contact your ISP to change them for you. In truth I recommend contacting your
 ISP about this issue first off. Now how would you know if your Nat is Full Cone or not? Usually these can be found in your Routers information page, under my router (Yours maybe different) is Gateway Overview and in that page is the Wide Area Network overview,
 when you click the View/Properties of the your Gateway it will come up with a page and on that page it will show usually if your Nat is Full Cone, it should say if this is disabled or enabled. If you can't find it, UPNP is on and you are still having issues
 connecting to games or with friends this will show that your Full Cone Nat is disabled and you either have a closed Nat Cone or a Restricted Cone Nat, there are also Port Restricted Nat and a Symmetric Restricted Nat, which all these can cause issues to your
 Xbox Live Connection.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Have you checked the time/Date settings to make sure they are correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If after you set the correct Date/Time in Windows&nbsp;and shut down then restart your machine the date/time reverts back&nbsp;to say the year&nbsp;2012/2014 etc, you have a failed CMOS Battery in the Motherboard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They cost about $5 and are easy to replace.</p>

<p>Can someone please help me? &nbsp;I am logged onto Xbox Live but when I go to play any game, I cannot &nbsp;connect to the game server. &nbsp;I have been having this problem for 2 weeks now. &nbsp;Sometimes I get lucky and I can connect to a server but when I turn my xbox off
 for ten minutes it has the same problem. &nbsp;This is not making sense to me. &nbsp;I also know its not just the one game. &nbsp;I try Madden 13 and cannot connect to the EA servers, then I go and try and play Black Ops 2 and cannot connect to their servers either. &nbsp;If
 someone has had this problem how did you fix it?? &nbsp;I had this problem about four months ago but it suddenly stopped. &nbsp;Can someone please help??</p>

<p>Hi there xXx M3AN3R xXx!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry to hear you're having trouble with connecting to game servers. It's never a bad idea to try clearing your console's system cache and redownloading your profile. These steps can help resolve basic issues with random disconnects and trouble getting connected
 to Xbox Live. It's a fairly simple process, just follow these steps!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Clear System Cache</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Press the <b>Guide</b> button on your controller, go to <b>Settings</b>, and select
<b>System Settings</b>. </li><li>Select <b>Storage</b> or <b>Memory</b>. </li><li>Highlight any storage device, and then press <b>Y</b> on your controller. (It doesn't matter which storage device you select; the cache will be cleared for all storage devices.)
</li><li>Select <b>Clear System Cache</b>. </li><li>When prompted to confirm storage device maintenance, select <b>Yes</b>. </li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Re-Download Profile</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Tap the silver Xbox <strong>Guide</strong> button </li><li>Select<strong> Download Profile</strong> (and if you don't see it, press the blue<strong> X</strong> button to make sure you're not signed in) and proceed with Profile Download.
</li><li>Enter the <strong>Microsoft Account</strong> address for your Xbox LIVE gamertag when asked.
</li><li>Enter the <strong>password</strong> for the Microsoft Account. </li><li>If your account is an Xbox LIVE child account, the parent’s Windows Live ID &amp; password is required as well to download your profile.
</li><li>Pick the<strong> storage device</strong> for your profile (choose<strong> Hard Drive</strong> if you have one, or
<strong>Memory Unit</strong> if you don't have a Hard Drive). </li><li>When the download completes you will be asked if you want the console to <strong>
remember your password</strong>. If it's your home console, I'd say yes, otherwise I'd think carefully about leaving my profile unprotected on somebody else's Xbox!
</li><li><strong>Sign in</strong>, and retry. </li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know how that goes for you. If you are still having issues please read the
<a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/9/t/155724.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">START HERE</a>&nbsp;post and hit us with your network info. With that we can look into the problem further.</p>

<p>Hi IGArchangel123456,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry your experiencing this problem.&nbsp; The only other solution I can add is to remove and then readd your profile to your Xbox.&nbsp; If that doesnt work then you have to wait until Xbox fix this issue.&nbsp; You can check the status of Xbox Live here&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status</a>.&nbsp;
 Sorry for the inconvience and hopefully this problem get sorted soon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows Genuine Message - This copy of Windows 7 is not legal</h2>
                    <p>Despite running a perfectly legal copy of Windows 7 on my laptop for about two years, I now have a message appear on screen saying 'This copy of Windows 7 is not legal'. I know it is legal (it was on the laptop when I bought it from PC World and the message
 has only just appeared). The laptop is still functioning perfectly ok apart from this message. Any ideas on how to get rid of it (and where it came from....have I been the victim of a virus?...I am running Norton 360).</p>

<p>
<span>A)&nbsp;&nbsp; OEM SLP: This key comes pre-installed in Windows, when it comes from the Factory. This key is geared to work with the special instructions found only on that Manufacturer's
 computer hardware. So when Windows was installed using the OEM SLP key (at the factory) Windows 7 looks at the motherboard and sees the special instructions and Self-Activates. (that's why you did not need to Activate your computer after you brought it home)</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COA SLP:<b> This is the Product key that you see on the sticker on the side (or bottom,[ or inside the battery compartment]) of your computer</b>. It is a valid product key,
 but should only be used in limited situations (such as if the OEM SLP key stops self-activating for whatever reason). The key must be activated by Phone. (Note: All manufacturers that use the OEM SLP system are required by contract to include a Certificate
 of Authenticity (COA) sticker, that has a COA SLP key, on the computer)</span></p>

            <p>Hi Christopher, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for being part of Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue could be due to some third party programs. I would suggest you to boot the computer into clean boot and check if the issue persists.
 a clean boot.<br />

<br />
Note: Follow </span><strong><span>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot</span></strong><span> from article KB929135 to reset the computer to normal mode.<br />
