            Hello Janal. I'm a fellow Community member here to help. I'm sorry to hear you're having this trouble. I know that it is very frustrating.<br /><br />Unfortunately, you are not alone in this. The new version of Skype is still under development and is lacking many features and functionality that users have come to expect in the classic version. The particular issue you are describing is being faced by many users.<br /><br />While Microsoft has not yet given an ETA, it is expected that in the very near future they will rapidly begin releasing updates that will add features and functionality and fix bugs in the new version of Skype. The goal is for the new Skype to be up to par with the classic version in the very near future.<br /><br />Microsoft has dedicated the website for users to provide their feedback, make suggestions and Report bugs. It can be found here.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.skypefeedback.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.skypefeedback.com</a><br /><br />

            Hi, JanaL
<br />
<br />Since you can not see this in the new Skype, you can uninstall that version and install the Classic version, since its duration has been prolonged. I hope you can solve the problem.

    <title>Run from new smaller SSD without reinstalling Office and other - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vwfeature  say:</h3>
<h2>            Run from new smaller SSD without reinstalling Office and other programs&#63; HDD failing</h2>
                    <p>Is there any way to run Office and other programs from a new SSD without reinstalling them?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Win 10, upgraded from 7 on my 750GB HDD, which is failing.&nbsp; I use my MS account to log on to that OS.</p>
<p>I have a much smaller 128GB SSD, (where I made a new install of Win 10, which activated w the old key ,just to see if I could. No data or essential programs there. )&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Clonezilla, which can image and transfer/restore single partitions or transfer from one drive to another.</p>
<p>The old HDD has multiple partitions:</p>
<p>First is the MBR, with 110 MB,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second is OS,&nbsp; programs &nbsp;and data&nbsp; with ~720GB</p>
<p>third is HP restore partition ~19GB</p>
<p>some unassigned space 4 MB</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a new HDD the same size as the old HDD.&nbsp; Obviously, I can image the old HDD onto the new HDD and boot from that HDD, run programs from it, etc., but that doesn't get the advantages of the SSD.</p>
<p>I'd like to run the programs I use most on the SSD, but reinstalling everything, custom settings, dictionary, etc, is a nuisance.
</p>
<p>W just Win 10 on the SSD, there's about 62 of 119 GB free.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My speculations about possible ways to do this:</p>
<p>Can I just transfer the MBR from the HDD to the SSD and boot windows as if it were the old install?</p>
<p>Can I then just move the Office directory to the SSD?</p>
<p>Can I use MS office without reinstalling, if I transfer the MBR from the old&nbsp;failing HDD to the SSD, and copy the partition office is on to the new HDD?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Even if I just ran Win 10 from the SSD and kept Office and the other programs on the new HDD, that could be better than reinstalling everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            I have never read such a conveluted post as this.&nbsp; I am watching the television and it is time for 'The Bodyguard' so I am off.&nbsp; If what you are asking is can I transfer by way of an image of C Drive to another Drive SSD HDD on the same computer the answer
 is yes.&nbsp; All the programs etce will work.&nbsp; I did it with AOMEI Partition Assistant.&nbsp; Transferred HDD to SSD.

<p>I have a factory Dual drive computer, 128GB SSD and 1TB HD.&nbsp; I have most of my data files on the HD, but I did subdivide the SSD to create a 30GB partition for some data files.&nbsp; Actually, now that the prices have come down, I am seriously considering replacing
 my HD with a 250 to 500GB SSD!</p>
<p>
</p><p>128 GB is more than adequate for installing Windows and most likely all of your applications. It should also be large enough to put at least your Office applications on the SSD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have many applications other than Office? </p>
<p>
</p><p>When I had all of my Office files, applications AND all data files on the SSD, opening files was instantaneous. Really, the files opened in a snap of the fingers.&nbsp; But when I moved my data files and to the HD the "traditional" HD delay came back when opening
 files.</p>

When your PC has limited storage space, or you simply want to keep things separate, use this guide to install or move apps to a different drive on Windows 10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>**********************************</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The simplest, cleanest, best performing option is to install Windows and all of your applications on the SSD.&nbsp; Installing Windows is better because the install process will recognize that you have a SSD and optimize the installation for it.&nbsp; Once you go
 with Windows install, you have to install all of the other applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Of course, once you install your applications and do all of your customization setup on SSD, you should do an image copy backup for future restores.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You do have another option. You could move your data files from the HD, ie to your OneDrive. Then shrink your current partition to 128GB or less. Many replacement SSDs come with utilities that automate the process of migrating a partition from the HD to
 the new SSD.&nbsp; You can't simply copy the partition because there is a specific placement required for SSD partitions that may not be followed if you simply do a restore to the SSD.

                    When I save a document in Word and close it, the system takes a second to close, the little wheel spins, the document WILL CLOSE but the wheel won't stop spinning. It will spin for as long as I let it. If I leave the document area and go up to the Ribbon,
 the wheel will disappear. I can go to another app, I can close Word, I can do anything as normal, it's just the little wheel will not stop spinning. Any ideas? Thank you.

<h2>            Can&#39;t receive my mail on my Mac, only with my iPhone, what can I do &#63;</h2>
                    Hi everybody,
<div><br />
<div>First, I want to inform you that I'm french and I apologize for my beautiful english. :)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So, this afternoon, I went to an Apple Store because I have a problem with my e-mail account on my Mac.</div>
<div>The genius tries many things but it's not a problem from Apple because I receive my messages on my iPhone and -with the same settings- I can't receive them. On the mail app, there is no activities, the mail app starts to recover my messages but it stops.</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What can I do ? I don't have any solutions :(</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks a lot</div>
<div>François</div>
                </div>

I'm sorry but no, that's the problem of Hotmail.
<div>I'll to explain ...&nbsp;</div>
<div>In fact, you seem to have a new technology which is not really pop and not really imap as Microsoft Exchange. When I erase an e-mail on my iPhone, it's erased on Outlook.com as a mirror.</div>
<div>Maybe this technology is not supported by Mail.app but it's not possible because my e-mail account has worked last month.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Has Outlook.com change settings pour Apple users ?</div>
<div><br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">We appreciate your efforts in bringing this matter to our attention.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you're unable to receive emails from your Mac Mail app. <font>
<font color="#000000"><font>Let me assist you on this matter and rest assured that I will do my best to help you sort this out.</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><em><font>"</font><font><font><font color="#333333">On the mail app, there is no activities, the mail app starts to recover my messages but it stops"</font></font></font></em></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>First of all, I would like to inform you that we do not have the option to copy your Mac Mail to Outlook.com. You can move your emails from Mac Mail to MS Office Outlook but not in Outlook.com.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Outlook.com can be sync to Mac mail client if the said account is added to a <a href="https://login.live.com/login.srf?wa=wsignin1.0&amp;rpsnv=11&amp;ct=1375124732&amp;rver=6.0.5276.0&amp;wp=MCMBI&amp;wreply=https%3a%2f%2fprofile.microsoft.com%2fRegSysProfileCenter%2fwizard.aspx%3fwizid%3df4502d34-3b8f-4a04-b741-289e08aa1782%26wp%3dMCLBI%26lcid%3d1033%26fu%3dhttp%253a%252f%252fwww.microsoft.com%252fmac&amp;lc=1033&amp;cb=LCID%3d1033%26WizID%3df4502d34-3b8f-4a04-b741-289e08aa1782%26brand%3dmicrosoft%26subbrand%3dprofile%2bcenter&amp;id=74335&amp;cbid=50861&amp;mkt=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<font color="#0072c6">link</font></a> to be able to do so. If your email app supports
<span>Exchange ActiveSync</span> you may need to configure it manually. However, with OS X Mountain Lion, Apple no longer maintains active support for Sync Services.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To share additional information on this, the current design of Outlook.com does not support IMAP. It does support POP3 and/or SMTP though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you have mentioned that you're able to receive emails from your iPhone, we can then conclude that this is not account-related issue. We recommend that you
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/outlook/send-receive-from-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
reconfigure</a> your account from the said mail app and check issue if&nbsp;still persist. For further assistance on how to set up or reconfigure account, please contact Mac/Apple support. You may also refer to this
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mac"><font color="#0072c6">link</font></a> for additional information.</p>

<h2>            Ovi Maps 3.06 on Nokia C5-03</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a Nokia 5530XM (with an external GPS receiver and Ovi Maps 3.04 installed). My phone has a pretty scratched screen, the call speaker is not working well and so&nbsp;I'm thinking about buying a C5-03. I have some questions related to Ovi Maps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Which version of Ovi Maps comes pre-installed on the C5-03?</p>
<p>- Can Ovi Maps 3.06 be installed on the C5-03?</p>
<p>- What are the differences between Maps 3.04 and 3.06?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it easy to update Ovi Maps over the air and dowloading the maps? I'm asking that because maybe I'll buy the C5-03 during a vacation trip. It would nice to buy a C5-03 on a store and immediatly update it and the Maps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance, best regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes, I know that Maps 3.0 comes installed on the C5-03. What I am asking is about Maps 3.04 and 3.06. i know that Maps 3.04 can be installed on the 5530 (I have one), but 3.06 does not. Is it the same on the C5-03?</p>

<p>Technically, it should work. But what I'm wondering is that if you're getting a new phone, why not a C6-01 instead? The price range aint that TOO far away. I just feel that its not too much bang for buck to move from a 5530 to C5-03</p>

@ chanchan05,<br />
<br />
Maybe you're right, but I not willing to invest my money on a C6-01. It's a good phone, I know, but I don't like it. C6-01 is TOO heavy and the battery has short duration. Other thing is that a phone in it's price range should have a auto-focus camera, not
 a fixed focus one.<br />
<br />
The main reason why I don't want to spend much on a phone is that I simply don't believe on Symbian anymore. Symbian is already dying! What I wan't is an unexpensive decent phone to use for a year or so, until Nokia launches the Windows Phone models.<br />
<br />
I've already give up from buying the C5-03. Now I'm thinkg of getting a 5800, it costs about 190 Euros in Portugal, where I intend to buy it. Nokia 5800 is indeed a very good phone, runs Ovi Maps 3.06, has a pretty decent 3.2 Mpixels Carl Zeiss auto-focus camera,
 etc. Maybe it's a good way to have a decent not expensive phone, till the Nokia Windows Phone models are lauched.<br />
<br />
Best regards.<br />

            Symbian will continue to have OS support tl 2013-2014 if that is what you're worried about. But yeah, if you're unsure if C5-03 will support 3.06, then go for a 5800. However the C5 does have a better and faster processor at 600Mhz compared to the 5800's
 434Mhz. Its still up to you though.

<p>@chanchan5:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, I'm not worried about Nokia 'official' support to C5-03 or to any other model. As I said, I currently have a 5530, which is a model 'officially' supported by Nokia, and what do I see? A complete lack of recent firmware updates, I see
 Nokia trying to block installation of the most recent versions of Ovi Maps on the 5530.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My idea of buying a 5800, instead of a C5-03, or even instead of a C6-01 is simple: I want to spend the mininum amount in order to get a decent phone I can use for say, two years, until the new Nokia-Windows models are stable.&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>In other words, I'm looking for an unexpensive (and possible better) replacement for my damaged 5530 until that moment comes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With that on mind, C5-03 is surely in a category below the 5800. There's no way to compare both models. Sure, C5-03 has a faster processor and faster 3G connection, but that's about it. My 5530 has the same processor 5800 has, and its performance is OK for
 my use. The faster 3G connection that C5-03 has, is of no use for me, since in Brazil 3G is not THAT fast. Besides, the price is almost the same for C5-03 and 5800.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the C6-01, I don't see any reason why I should spend more money for a phone that has a dying operating system. C6-01 costs in Portugal about 60% more then the 5800. The only thing I really liked on C6-01 is it's superior screen, there's no doubt about
 that. But then again, why did Nokia make such a heavy phone? 132 g is way too heavy, for a phone that has a short running battery...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            The 5530 wouldnt receive any update anymore IMO. Once a phone hits a year and a half in model age, you won't get firmware updates anymore (there are rare instances though, but never beyond two years).<br />
<br />
Firmware updates have a schedule after a unit is released, and will only last on the given time frame I have mentioned. The C5-03 will still get updates and probably features that the 5800 will never have, like a better browser perhaps. So unless you're not
 interested anymore with that possibility, you can yes go ahead and save money by going 5800.<br />
<br />
One good catch though as I re-read your statement is that it will give you more chances to save up for the WP7 phones. I too was supposed to buy a new phone until I learned about WP7... My 5800 would thus serve me another year. :p

<p>@chanchan05,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Browser is not an issue on my 5530. I use Opera 11 and it's much, much bettter then Nokia browser. The only cavet of Opera 11 is that it doesn't have Flash. Even though, I rarelly have to use the 5530 native browser.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, speaking of saving for buying a Nokia/Windows phone next year or so, I'm am facing a dilemma:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cost for repairing my 5530 is about 75 Euros (for changing the call speaker and the touch screen). Since next month I'm travelling to Portugal, I could buy a new phone over there, since they cost less then here in Brazil (where I live). In Portugal I
 can get a brand new 5530 for about 100 Euros, or a brand new 5800 for 190 Euros. But those are prices for carrier blocked phones and I'm not sure if I could easily unblock any of those models when I'm back to Brazil... For what I know, these Nokia models can
 be unblocked in two ways: by getting the code from the carrier or by flashing the phone. I don't want to risk flashing...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I like my 5530, it fits all of my current needs. I kind of somewhat dislike the 2.9" screen, but I can live with that. Also, 5530 doesn't have internal GPS, but I'v already bought a bluetooth receiver, which I use normally with Maps 3.04. I also have a car
 holder that I can use either with the 5530 or with the 5800:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dealextreme.com/p/universal-car-windshield-holder-for-nokia-cell-phone-4-2-6-6cm-41278" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dealextreme.com/p/universal-car-windshield-holder-for-nokia-cell-phone-4-2-6-6cm-41278</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you see, I'm all set to use my 5530 as a GPS navigator on a trip, with no problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One thing that 5530 has in common with 5800 is the fragile plastic touchscreen, that can be easily scratched...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To me, the main advantages I'd get if I move into the 5800 would be: a larger screen, internal GPS. There is also the advantage of being able to use Maps 3.06, but I don't know if the price of a 5800 would justify that, since I can use Maps 3.04 on the 5530.&nbsp;Of
 course 5800 has other advantages over the 5530, but they aren't that important for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What do you think about that, keeping in mind that my goal is to wait untill Nokia launches a affordable and stable Windows model?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards.</p>

<p>@chanchan05,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An update: I've just discovered that Vodafone Portugal still sells the 5800, for 237 Euros unlocked, exactly the same price they sell the C5-03.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, the difference from a unlocked and new 5800 to the repair cost of my 5530 is 160 euros (about 240 US dollars). I think changing from a 5530 into a 5800 is worth that price, don't you agree?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would really appreciate your comment here, since you have a 5800 and as me, you intend to keep it till the 'Nokia WP' era comes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

                    <p>I am trying to figure out how to change a title in an existing powerpoint slide from a macro I am running in excel.&nbsp; The text that I want to place in the title is a variable that I get from excel.&nbsp; &nbsp;Overall the macro, pulls some data from excel, copies it
 to an existing powerpoint presentation slide then saves that powerpoint slide as a pdf.&nbsp; It is in a big while loop so it does this copying and pasting for a list in excel until the list ends.&nbsp; The macro below works except for the changing title section (I
 ran the macro without that section and it does everything I need it to do without that section).&nbsp; &nbsp;I am not sure what is wrong.&nbsp; I get a type mismatch on&nbsp; the line&nbsp;
<strong>Set shpCurrShape = .Shapes.Title.&nbsp;</strong> I tried that section of code in a powerpoint macro and it did change the title so not sure if because I am working in an excel macro things are different.&nbsp; Appreciate any help anyone is willing to give - I
 am not that good with vba code.&nbsp; Just learning and don't use it that often.</p>

<h2>            Retrieving Previous Versions of Microsoft Word Online</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Several colleagues and I have been working on a document online. While each of us made additions to the document at different times over the course of a weekend, it appears that changes two of my colleagues made did not save for the last 100 pages of the
 document.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We work remotely, so I'm not able to provide more specific information. I have already looked at the version history of the document on SharePoint and have been unable to find a version with their contributions past page 50 of the 150 page document. Is there
 another way to retrieve versions of the document, such as restore a local version on their computer?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, is there anything I can pass along for them to troubleshoot?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, does anyone know how to track who is contributing to the document? Right now, their names only say Guest Contributor, because I am sharing the document stored on SharePoint so they may contribute. I don't know if they have Microsoft 365 Office on
 their computer.&nbsp;</p>

            Hello Todd,
<br />
<br />The best way is looking the version history in the online location, but if you didn’t find there try the options to recover the unsaved word files from the following url <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Recover-an-earlier-version-of-an-Office-file-169cb166-e7e2-438e-8f39-9a8927828121" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Recove...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this work for you.
<br />
<br />Regards.

    <title>Excel has become unusable - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> timtax computer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel has become unusable</h2>
                    <p>Within the past week, Excel Mobile version was installed on my desktop computer, and ever since that happened Excel has become almost unusable.&nbsp; It constantly freezes while using and will not start again.&nbsp; I am running Office 365 and not using on a mobile
 device.&nbsp; Event ID 1002.&nbsp; Here is a description of the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"The program EXCEL.EXE version 16.0.11514.20004 stopped interacting with Windows and was closed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the last update (some time within the past 4-5 days, this problem has been persistent.&nbsp; I have tried a&nbsp; number of fixes to no avail.&nbsp; I have 4 computers and a Surface Pro on my license and everything is working fine on the other systems.&nbsp; One thing
 I noticed after the last update on the affected computer is that the Office icons on my taskbar changed.&nbsp; I don't seem to have any issues with the other applications, just Excel.&nbsp; Any thoughts are appreciated.</p>

            Jesse: thanks for getting back to me on this.&nbsp; Unfortunately it did not work.&nbsp; I opened up Excel and within a few minutes it froze up again.&nbsp; The only recourse when this happens is to go into Task Manager and shut it down.&nbsp; Very frustrating.&nbsp; I am going
 to try opening and running in safe mode to see what happens then.

            FWIW I've seen this happen when some temporary files Excel uses gets corrupted. I've fixed it using CCleaner and cleared the Office file cache. Note that MS doesn't support this product, nor endorse it, but you might give it a shot as a last resort before
 you do somethign like a full uninstall followed by an OfficeCleaner from MS and a reinstall.

<p>Thanks Ed-because Excel had become unusable, I decided I had no choice but to uninstall and reinstall.&nbsp; After doing so everything seems to be running fine.&nbsp; I didn't want to spend the time as I am an accountant and use Excel extensively for tax preparation.&nbsp;
 Since reinstalling I have not had any issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At some point during the past week, the Office icons on my desktop changed and that is when I started seeing these problems.&nbsp; I don't know why the icons changed but I believe they represented the mobile version of Office.&nbsp; Since I am on a desktop, I didn't
 need the mobile version.&nbsp; Don't know if that is what the problem is, but am running fine now.</p>

<p>No, that isn't related. Those are the new Office 365 icons. You'll get them back in another update soon enough if your reinstall didn't put them back.</p>

<p>Hi Benjamin,</p>
<p>Workbooks that are protected (encrypted with password protection) cannot be viewed in a browser window or opened via Excel Online. And to open workbooks with password protection, we need to download them to the local PC and open them with Excel.</p>
<p>Here is an article for your reference: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Differences-between-using-a-workbook-in-the-browser-and-in-Excel-f0dc28ed-b85d-4e1d-be6d-5878005db3b6#__toc347836459" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

I downloaded the new build 9879. When I hit Install Now, I got a 0x80240016 error. I restarted the laptop and the error went awa. I did Install Now again and it ran for about 30 minutes. I then got PC needs to restart to Install Windows Technical Preview, had Restart &amp; Update, option Now and then I hit OK. Restarted PC, got to log in screen, logged in and noting. Went back to PC Settings, Preview Build, Install Now and it just repeats. I tried holding the Power button down to reboot and same thing happens again. It seems I'm stuck in a loop or this install is running in the background with no evidence of such. Any ideas anyone?">
New build 9879</a> today. To my biggest surprise my system will not see the keyboard or the mouse anymore. The computer boots and the keyboard works during the&nbsp;"dos" phase, I can go to set up and modify the BIOS setting but as soon as windows appear both input
 devices are dead. My computer is useless. Did anyone experience similar issues? Is there a solution?&nbsp;

            After booting to windows, unplug kb and mouse and plug into diff usb ports. If that doesn't work, see if some other usb hardware works--thumb drive, ext hard drive, etc. to see if the usb ports are working.

<p>I had a similar problem with my laptop--keyboard did not work at all.&nbsp; Tried a couple restarts, but still now keyboard.&nbsp; Then I did a "hard" boot by pressing and holding the power button for 10 seconds.&nbsp; It rebooted and the keyboard started working.&nbsp; I think
 there is a problem with a proper shutdown/restart and the drivers were not loading.&nbsp;

<h3> lindsey mcmillen  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to return to, or upgrade from Windows 10 Final to current build of Windows 10 Individual Preview&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've been a participant in the Windows 10 Technical Evaluation and Windows 10 Individual Preview since early October of 2014. Five days ago my installation of BitLocker to my desktop computer's system partition became corrupted. &nbsp;I soon discovered that BDE-Repair
 was unable to recover any files. I then discovered that the drive, which is only 4 months old, was failing. I replaced the drive with a new one provided by the manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I've encountered the problem that I can't figure out how to install Windows 10 Insider Preview, so that I can continue in the Insider Preview program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most recent version of the installation media for the Windows 10 Individual Preview that I have is for Build 10074. But I'm unable to install that version as I'm informed by the installation that is has expired...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have a Windows 10 Pro 64-bit Final ISO, which I have used to successfully install Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the installation was complete I found that the Advance Options of the settings for Windows Update is displaying the "Get Insider Builds" settings, I changed those settings so that I am "All set to receive insider builds.".</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, after three days, Windows Update doesn't display the existence of any available updates, and I'm still running Windows 10 Final, rather than Windows 10 Individual Preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will the Individual Preview eventually installed, or have I managed to "snooker" myself from continuing in the Individual Preview program?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I haven't snookered myself, and I still have access to the Individual Preview, what do I need to do in order to install it to my computer?</p>

            <p>Did you switch the insider setting to the Fast ring &amp; are you activated &amp; signed in with a Microsoft account ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Slow ring is still on 10240 I think... as there has not been any official insider&nbsp;iso since 10240... so patience and maybe this week a new build.</p>

<p>I was running the official release of Windows 10 Pro 64 bit Build 10547 before the hard drive needed to be replaced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm puzzled as to why, after three days, with Windows Update set for the receipt of Fast Ring files, my computer still hasn't been updated with Build 10547.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once it is upgraded to full version,&nbsp;it is out of the build mode and not required any more build as build was the updated version of Windows 10. Since you have&nbsp;Windows 10 complete version, you cannot go back and install the latest or last build&nbsp;and it's
 not&nbsp;needed anymore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

</p><p>I am using bing desktop for almost 1 year but now I am facing an Issue with it for the last couple of months. I have tried every possible way explained in Microsoft Answers. But the problem is still not solved. I am Using Windows 8.1 Enterprise N, and facing
 the following problems with Bing Desktop:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Bing daily Wallpaper is not updating anymore</p>
<p>2. The Icons under the search bar are not responding.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c1117f31-eb3a-4843-8eab-efac8da42e6b" /></p>
<p>As shown in the image above, when I click on these Icons, they turn to yellow color and that's it. I have already tried everything, Uninstalling and Re-installing, Clean Boot, Force Uninstallation and then Re-Installing. Clearing the Registery Keys Before
 Installing Bing Desktop. Please Help me with this Issue. Or Give me a link to "Microsoft Fixit" for such kind of Issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h3> zanzibar bungalow  say:</h3>
<h2>            Missing tons of emails from Outlook 2010 PST file that got recovered from a broken windows account.</h2>
                    <p>I got the log on log off loop on Windows 7, and after spending countless hours on it and having MS try and remote solve it, I decided to make a sector by sector copy of the disk (a 100% copy) and set up a new instalation of Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I reinstalled Outlook 2010, I proceeded to open files from the old installation, located at users\documents\outlook documents\outlookFile.pst</p>
<p>
</p><p>After importing, there are about 4 years of missing emails, all of which were present on the previous instalation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After doing dome research, I also tried importing all the PST files from users\appdata\microsoft\office\outlook</p>
<p>with no luck. emails still missing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given that I have a 100% copy of the previous instalation, the files are not lost!</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I gain access to them?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!</p>
<p>

</p><blockquote>But please explain to me, how can data just go missing if it was there 100% right before the loop?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Unless there is hard drive corruption - answer is "it can't/doesn't". If I were a betting person, would put money on the PST file being located somewhere other than expected and would do a full search of your old C: drive for *.pst files since you said you
 did a image backup of the drive. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It's unfortunate you went that route before using the Control Panel &lt;Mail&gt;app and just get a list of the data files configured in the profile (found under the data files tab). Not sure what you're referring to in terms of the Log On/Log Off loop in Win7
 but that's irrelevant at this point since it's a none issue. Mind you, if you restore your image backup and revert back to Win7 - you can use the Control Panel &lt;Mail&gt; to get your data file locations (of course you would do this &lt;after&gt; making an image backup
 of your Win10 config so you could go back to it via a simple restore)</p>

    <title>Using a Continuum Desktop Dock alongside a laptop USB3 Display hub. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> c.bradshaw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using a Continuum Desktop Dock alongside a laptop USB3 Display hub.</h2>
                    <p>Having seen a demo of the Lumia 900 series with a Desktop Dock, this is something we're looking at for our meeting rooms. We also have a number of USB3 compatible devices (such as the Surface Pro's) where we use DisplayPort compatible hubs to turn them into
 multi-monitor desktops.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It occurred to me that it would be great if we can present the users with&nbsp;a single&nbsp;USB3 cable and they can hookup their Lumia or a Laptop. If the phone is connected then the Continuum Display Dock is used, and if the laptop is connected then the traditional
 DisplayPort is used to put the display on the screen. From the user experience&nbsp;perspective this makes connection simple, one cable regardless of device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know the current Display Dock hardware won't do this (Microsoft- can this be in a future generation of the device?!) but can anyone think of a way that this outcome could be achieved? Possibly by using a USB3 hub with a Display Dock and DisplayPort device
 attached?</p>

            <p>I am not sure, I got your feature request, yet. First of all, Microsoft-Answers is not leveraged as feedback channel. Why ever. To file a feature request, you have to go for Windows 10 Mobile, add a Microsoft account, allow (at least) enhanced diagnostic/user-data,
 and its app Windows Feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back to your meeting-room scenario:</p>
<p>What about Intel Pro WiDi for example via the <a href="http://www.actiontec.com/products/product.php?pid=323" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Actiontec ScreenBeam Pro Businees Edition</a>?&nbsp;The good part about this: It is wireless and (thanks to Miracast UIBC) works with Continuum for Phones as well. If you want to go for the wired path: The Lumia 950 uses USB-C with DisplayPort capabilities already.
 So all you need is a USB-C to DisplayPort/HDMI cable/adapter. Was that helpful?</p>

            <p>Thanks Abi99, and yes, there is a feature request in there, but I was primarily wondering if anyone could think of a workaround.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Actiontec device you mention is a WiDi receiver, so (as far as I can tell) wouldn't provide the keyboard and mouse for the phone that the Display Dock does.&nbsp;As far as I know WiDi isn't Mac compatible either unfortunately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the wired path,&nbsp;would a&nbsp;USB-C to HDMI cable on a Lumia 950 provide the continuum interface? -we don't just want to project the normal phone screen, we want the desktop environment. If it does then perhaps the solution here is to have a USB-C capable DisplayLink
 hub with that cable out the back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm still after this Utopia where all meeting rooms have a single cable on the table and any device can connect with minimal use of adapters. As it was when every capable device had a blue VGA connector on the back :)</p>

            <blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>According to my current understanding: Yes. Therefore, the Microsoft Display Dock (HD-500) is nothing else than a USB Type-C splitter which splits USB-OTG, DisplayPort, and power source. Furthermore, it offers/is a USB hub and a DisplayPort to HDMI converter.
 Or to answer your question: One day, USB Type-C might be the connector you are looking for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Actiontec Screenbeam devices do provide keyboard and mice for Continuum for Phones via their USB interface. If only one USB interface is present, you need a Y-adapter. Actually, they are the only Miracast adapters, I am aware of currently (they are
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/continuum-for-phones-faq-mobile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
mentioned by Microsoft</a>). Nevertheless, you are able to use keyboard and mice via Bluetooth, as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, neither Intel Pro WiDi nor Miracast are supported by Apple, yet.</p>

<p>Oh my god, I was recently looking for exactly this information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you can use the Display Dock (that was intended for the Lumia 950/XL), as a USB-C hub for your laptop, for&nbsp;video-out and extra USB&nbsp;Type-A&nbsp;ports?! :D</p>

<h2>            International Video Conferencing</h2>
                    Is it reasonable to use Skype for a 8 hour video conference from USA to Switzerland?&nbsp; It would include screen sharing from both ends of the call.&nbsp; Would the call last that long?&nbsp; Would there be issues with the connection being open that long?&nbsp; And, lastly,
 what kind of charge would that incur for me if I'm originating the connection OR if I'm on the receiving end of the call?&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no option to set a default device for receiving Skype calls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We highly recommend to log out from your mobile device if you wish to get calls directly to your laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Signing in to multiple devices at the same time may cause interference and the routing of calls may change from time to time.</p>

    <title>MS Access databe for windows RT - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vimr21  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Access databe for windows RT</h2>
                    <p>I have developed a database program in MS Access that works very well as stand alone database, from it I can create reports, stats. and help my customers planning their preventive&nbsp;maintenance from all the detail information I've collected from services render
 over&nbsp;a few years I've been in this business with a couple of technicians and my self,</p>
<p>My operations are increasing and I expect to need about a dozen technicians in the next year or so.&nbsp;Most of our routine&nbsp;services are in rural areas, and some times over seas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being able to have Excel, Word, and the familiarity of Windows&nbsp;on the Windows RT tablet, is very useful to what we do. My thoughts was to have a simple app that could be customized to help us collect&nbsp;field information, to later sync it to the database. Unfortunately,
 I am finding it very complex and difficult to get a simple answer on how to approach this step.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do&nbsp;not have an IT team to support me with a full integrated solution, for that, at the office we have already divided the MS Access database into a front and back end databases, and all my technicians have two ways they can&nbsp;enter the data collected:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) via a&nbsp;database&nbsp;mobile&nbsp;"DbR"&nbsp;this is a full MS Access program that they take in their laptops, with a limited amounts of data, the users can add-edit-delete some information an will sync with the&nbsp;back end&nbsp;database when they return to the office via
 an interphase routine in&nbsp;our LAN.</p>
<p>&nbsp; 2) via&nbsp;a front end database "BdFE", that we have in some of our office terminals in which&nbsp;they have&nbsp;similar functionality as&nbsp;the DbR, but directly linked to the main database.</p>
<p>Theses 2 options do work well as far as data entry is concerned, but my inspectors have to gather all the information manually and retype it all later at the office with the first option, or carry a pies of hardware not to ideal for&nbsp;the ruff&nbsp;environment
 we tend to have in the field, to which they end up doing it in paper and&nbsp;again latter into their laptops.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>My idea is to have something similar to the second option, but in the WRT tablets, which has better battery life, more&nbsp;portability,&nbsp;and affordability than&nbsp;a&nbsp;laptop has.&nbsp;Having a business that depends heavily in accurate and large&nbsp;pieces&nbsp;of detailed of information,&nbsp;would
 greatly benefit with higher accuracy and less work&nbsp;load&nbsp;by having this option available on tablets and/or WP8. Eliminating the need&nbsp;of entering the information twice.</p>
<p>Pls. Advice.</p>

            <p>I'm not sure what advice you are seeking. One thing should be clear: there is no desktop version of&nbsp;MsAccess on WinRT nor will there ever be.</p>
<p>Your alternatives include:</p>
<p>* Use a Remote Desktop program to connect to a standard Windows machine with MsAccess installed</p>
<p>* Use Access web database, which you can run from any browser.</p>

            <p>You have some good advice here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So remote desktop is a good possibility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And keep in mind if you buy windows pro (as opposed to RT), then you can install Access on those tablets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if you choose a RT tablet, you cannot install Access – so choices like a web based, or remote desktop are best.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you chose a windows pro tablet, then you can install your existing Application(s) on the tablet since windows pro tablets do in fact support running of Access.</p>

            My suggestion would be to go with the Surface Pro or equivalent. While more expensive than the RT, it is a full Windows machine and can run any Windows software. This will give you more flexibility to leverage your investment in Access as well as do other
 things with the tablet.

            Although you are right that the RT has much better battery life, weight and price, the Surface RT is not really an option. The much more expensive Surface Pro, OR any other equivalent tablet is what you are looking for.<br />
<br />
Surface RT comes bundled with Office 2013 RT Home and Student. It is EXPLICITLY NOT licensed for business use. MS has come up with a workaround where the use must have an Office 365 business license, and they allocate 1 of their 5 concurrent device installations
 to the Surface RT. But I have not seen the mechanics for doing that.<br />
<br />
Office RT does NOT run macros.<br />
<br />
Win 8 RT will NOT run "normal" / "traditional" desktop type applications. ONLY Windows 8 Metro&nbsp; Apps downloaded from the Windows Store.&nbsp; You may also have the option of "Sideloading" a custom written Metro app front end for your DB.<br />
<br />
I was going to suggest using Office Web Apps, but I checked and they do not include Access.<br />

<p>To use Office Home &amp; Student 2013 RT in a commercial setting, it must be tied to
<i>another</i> Office license that is.</p>
<p>"Organizations who purchase commercial use rights or have a commercial license to Office 2013 suites can use Office Home &amp; Student 2013 RT for commercial, nonprofit, or revenue-generating activities," Microsoft explained</p>
<p>Office 365 subscriptions aimed at businesses -- which for a flat yearly fee let a worker run Office 2013 on up to five different devices -- by purchasing a higher-priced perpetual-licensed copy of Office Standard 2013 or Office 2013 Professional Plus; or
 by having an Office volume licensing contract, such as the annuity-like Software Assurance, in place.</p>

<p>To minimize the power impact, Office on Windows RT stops blinking the cursor after a few seconds if the user stops interacting with the application. When the user is away, we just show a fixed, non-blinking cursor.</p>
<p>Office detects when the user is not actively using the system. When this occurs, Office releases these temporary caches.</p>
<p>For example, rather than including large number of templates and clipart on the drive, we opted to put frequently used templates on the drive while making the more extensive collection available via the start center in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint and also
<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">online</a> .</p>
<p>Windows RT provides APIs that allow applications including Office to understand the user’s current network state. We can identify if the cellular network is unrestricted or if usage is metered (the user is paying for their usage), if the user is approaching
 or over their limit, and whether or not they are roaming. When we detect that the cellular network is metered we throttle network traffic to reduce our impact.</p>

<br />
<p>&lt;snip&gt;<br />
</p>
Some answers to basic Win8/RT questions
<p>Here are the answers — as best I know — to those questions above and a few more. They’re certainly more accurate than what you’ll likely get at the local computer retail store.</p>
<b>Q1:</b> Is it true I have to buy all apps for my new Surface tablet from Microsoft’s Windows Store?
<p><b>A: Yes.</b> All Windows RT apps will have to be purchased through the Windows Store. But don’t feel too bad — Apple does the same thing with iPad and iPhone apps. Keep in mind that only RT apps will run on Windows RT devices. (The first MS Surface tablets
 will run only Windows RT. Surface tablets that run Win8 — and thus standard Win8 apps available everywhere — should appear in January.)</p>
<b>Q2:</b> Will all Windows Store apps work on the new Microsoft Surface tablets?
<p><b>A: No.</b> This is another one of those bizarre gotchas that really make the Windows RT situation complicated. Some of the apps in the Windows Store will work only with Win8 machines — they won’t work at all on Windows RT. Other Windows Store apps are
 designed to work with Win8 Phones, though it isn’t certain whether a Windows Phone app will work on a Windows RT machine. Check before you buy.</p>
<b>Q3:</b> I use LastPass to manage all my passwords. Will LastPass work with Lenovo’s IdeaPad tablets and notebooks?
<p><b>A: Depends.</b> If you get a Win8 IdeaPad, you can install LastPass on the Win8 Desktop and it will work with Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, or Firefox. However, if you buy a Windows RT–based IdeaPad, you’re up the ol’ creek without a paddle. Windows
 RT includes the Metro version of Internet Explorer, but that browser, by design, doesn’t support add-ons. (Now, try explaining that to your less-geeky family members.)</p>
<b>Q4:</b> Are there significant differences between Office 2013 and Office 2013 RT?
<p><b>A: Unknown.</b> Microsoft has publicly shown only preview and beta copies of both. The final versions aren’t expected until next year.</p>
<span>Q5:</span> Reportedly, new Windows tablets will come with Word 2013 preinstalled. Can I print documents from Word on my HP LaserJet?
<p><b>A: Possibly.</b> If you bought a Windows RT tablet (some tablets will run Win8), Word 2013 RT is included. But printing support depends on the model of HP LaserJet you’re using — some will work immediately with Windows RT, others won’t. HP has a lengthy
<a href="http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/Document.jsp?objectID=c03365145" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
list</a> of supported and unsupported printers on its website. (Be sure to read the footnotes at the bottom of the page.)</p>
<p>Anticipate similar problems with any peripheral you might want to use with a Windows RT machine. Although Win8 driver support is nearly universal (every Win7 driver and almost all Vista drivers will work with Win8), Windows RT–driver support will be hit-and-miss.</p>
<b>Q6:</b> Can I sync SkyDrive files with my new Surface tablet?
<p><b>A: No.</b> You can retrieve files from SkyDrive using the Metro SkyDrive app, but you can’t have the app automatically grab updated SkyDrive files and copy them onto your RT device (the way people commonly use SkyDrive on the Windows desktop). There are
 probably solid reasons why automatic sync isn’t supported — its impact on battery life could be one. That said, some future version of the Metro SkyDrive app might give you the ability to sync manually. (Battery considerations probably preclude any sort of
 automatic synching.)</p>
<b>Q7:</b> Any problem with buying a handful of Windows RT tablets and using them in my small business?
<p><b>A: That’s complicated.</b> Currently, the <strong><i>only</i></strong> version of Office announced for Windows RT is
<strong>Office Home &amp; Student 2013 RT,</strong> which <strong><i>does not</i></strong> include Outlook. The other announced versions of Office 2013 won’t run on Windows RT. The license for the standard Windows version of Office Home &amp; Student doesn’t allow
 for its use in a company, nonprofit, or organizationalof any kind. So it’s highly likely that the license for the RT version of Office won’t cover use in your business, either.</p>
<p>You can, on the other hand, purchase a tablet that runs Win8 (such as the MS Surface Pro, due out early next year) and run any standard Office version.</p>
<b>Q8:</b><b> </b>Can I run Outlook on the new Microsoft Surface tablets? How about Windows Live Mail or Windows Photo Gallery?
<p><strong>A: No, no, and no.</strong> Any Surface tablet that ships before January will be running Windows RT. As already noted, Outlook isn’t among the Office Home &amp; Student 2013 RT apps. Moreover, all Windows Essentials/Live Essentials programs are standard
 Windows apps; they won’t run on Windows RT, either (as should be clear by now).</p>
Q8a There is one Exception – Outlook Web App
<p>The one exception: You can use Internet Explorer 10, running in Windows RT, to access the Outlook Web App, assuming you’re set up with Exchange Server and have OWA available. Try explaining that to your boss.</p>
<b>Q9:</b> I own an iPad and sync it with my PC. Will I be able to sync my iPad with one of the new Windows Surface PCs from Microsoft?
<p><b>A: No.</b> At least not with the Windows RT versions of Surface. Because Windows RT doesn’t run traditional Windows programs, you can’t crank up iTunes and sync a Windows RT tablet with your iPad or PC. Apple might, however, eventually write a Metro-style
 version of iTunes (when pigs fly). Surface Pro, because it uses Win8, will run iTunes.</p>
<b>Q10:</b> What do I do if I bought the wrong kind of Windows tablet?
<p><b>A: Depends.</b> I expect to hear this question about a hundred thousand times in the next few months. I assume some of the retailers and manufacturers will be lenient and allow you to return your purchase — if you can explain why you got confused in the
 first place. But it’s going to be painful to watch buyers explaining to store clerks that “Yes, there
<strong>is</strong> a difference between Windows RT and Win8.”</p>
<p>Perhaps taking a copy of this article with you when you ask for a refund might help!</p>

            <p>Thanks,</p>
<p>I've follow reviews and blogs on WRT ever since I got my Surface RT last December, after I realized WRT isn't "Windows" or is to far of a modification that they have very little in common.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was hopping that the efforts Microsoft has incorporated into RT to support the social.com trends that other tablet OS have, it would be at least better than third parties have been offering for some time. Starting with TinyBites for Palm, Satellite forms
 for Palm and Pocket Windows, HandBase for iOS and other RADs that support odbc synchronization with Excel or Access.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per your suggestions, they both require connectivity, which is unreliable at best, and expensive in most overseas trips. A web Access or similar app, could be a very good alternative if they would support a local database functionality wile off the grid,
 to later sync the input back to the back end database.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe that at this point in time, with the technological advances in software and hardware, I should be having difficulty deciding which of hundreds of options out there is the best for my needs (including apps. for WinP 8). As a small business, I should
 be focused on how to present the information I have to be of value to my customers. The ways available to collect this information is a critical part being overlooked. Having options that are highly dependent on continuous connectivity infrastructure are not
 expanding, but narrowing our options. I'm all for that, but that should be one of many resources Microsoft&nbsp;should be&nbsp;offering us. It doesn't have to be Access, nor Outlook. But the information on my office pc needs to be portable, flexible and broad, loaded
 with tool to group and arrange my contacts, schedule, technical data, and tasks.
