<h2>            import apple mail into windows live mail, keeping the folders</h2>
                    I have a lot of mail archived on my iMac, which I'd like to move over to my Windows 7 computer. I don't have Outlook but rely on Windows Live Mail (when not just using Gmail).<br />
<br />
What is the most straightforward way of doing this — while maintaining the mail folders in the archive, not just the messages.(That last part is crucial.)
<br />
<br />
I don't actually need to import the mail into Windows Mail — I would just like to be able to search and retrieve email from various old projects, if that becomes necessary..<br />

            <p>The easiest answer is to set up an IMAP mail account (GMail does free IMAP mail) on the iMAC and drag and drop the mail folders to it.</p>
<p>Then set up the same IMAP mail account on your Windows 7 computer and synchronise!</p>
<p>If that's not an option (bandwidth restrictions etc) then you need to ascertain a) what file format Apple Mail keeps its mail in and/or b) what export options you have in Apple Mail.</p>

            I'll keep in the IMAP idea in mind, though I'd prefer a solution that doesn't require pulling the mail back into gmail.<br />

                    <p>original title - Touchpad Mouse</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi,this is the second time i am posting a complaint and here are your answers for your questions :</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Have you made any changes to the operating system that might have resulted in this isue</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ans No , nothing. As I was updating my PC an error came like this ' There were problems downloading some updates, but we'll try again later. If you keep seeing this, try searching the web or contacting support for help. This error code might help: (0x8024a10a)'.</p>
<p>I have also updated the newer version my synaptics from HP Recovery Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Is this issue confined on typing on web browsers ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ans&nbsp; Yes , but not in google search box , but in microsoft edge it is the same issue<br />
</p>
<p>3. Have you tried using external mouse and check if the issue persists ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ans . Yes, I have tried with microsoft mouse (which came with norton security ) and the issue persists.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Previous complaint :</p>
<p>Hi,I have a HP laptop and my mouse is always loading.That is not a problem but as i will type 'goo' for google it will highlight (blue color)' goo' and as i will continue typing my next letters ' gle ' , goo will disappear&nbsp; and only ' gle '&nbsp; will be there
 in the search box.I think it is replacing the previous letter or word. Please fix my Touchpad Mouse:</p>

<h2>            USB ports not working</h2>
                    <p>My computer was working just fine. I was sitting with it in my lap, and then when I moved, the computer just suddenly turned off. It didn't shut down or anything, it just went completely black. I turned it back on and thought everything was fine. Then I
 realized my phone was no longer charging. I didn't think anything of it until I went to my desk and my wireless mouse wasn't working. My Kindle won't connect, my iPod, nothing. It's like the USB ports aren't even registering anything is plugged in. It's not
 even giving me a "device not recognized" message. Nothing happens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried reinstalling drivers, I tried disabling and reenabling in the device manager. None of the USB option on the Device manager have the yellow exclamation point. I'd been using Windows 8.1 and then decided to finally upgrade to Windows 10, hoping that
 might fix the drivers or something. Nothing. I've tried a ton of solutions I've found online and nothing is working. Any other solutions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Asus x550z, now running Windows 10.</p>

</p><p>actually you can't "move" digital purchases between two or more accounts (here you can find the F.A.Q&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/games/purchasing/buying-digital-game-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/games/purchasing/buying-digital-game-faq</a>)</p>

</p><p>actually you can't "move" digital purchases between two or more accounts (here you can find the F.A.Q&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/games/purchasing/buying-digital-game-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/games/purchasing/buying-digital-game-faq</a>)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you really need to create a new gamertag or is it enough to change it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>Hi ThorX360,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate your prompt reply!</p>
<p>I am not trying to move purchases as they will/should be still related to my email account (parent) but what i am trying to do is relate his game progress (child) and introduce parental control. If i just change Games Tag that will surely mean loosing all
 of his progress. You see, i am finding it difficult even to explain what i am after. :( Apologies for those who i am frustrating and thank you for patience. Now i am going to read contents of your link sent.</p>

<p>Hello Forest Fairy,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do NOT let younger kids play on your email account! Because that will make the kids appear as an adult to the system and you can NOT restrict the kid anymore. The kid can then play as long as they want, talk to strangers on the internet, buy unlimited
 stuff with your credit card etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead, you SHOULD create a separate child account for your 7 year old, and add that account to your adult parent account at
<a href="https://account.microsoft.com/family" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com/family</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There you can then set limits and other parental settings to tell Xbox Live what your kid is allowed to do and what not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, that means he'll lose his gaming progress.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's why it's important to NEVER let your kid play on your parent email!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, you can now let the kid continue playing unrestricted on your parent account, and cause him much more grief when he gets older and wants his own account email, or you talk with your kid, and explain to him that he can now play all his games again
 from the beginning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do NOT use a Microsoft Email (like Hotmail, Live or Outlook email), and you do NOT use other Microsoft services like OneDrive, Office 365, and the likes, you can try the following:</p>
<p>You can sign in on <a href="https://account.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://account.microsoft.com</a> and add a sign in alias to your own account, that you wish to transfer to your son.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Add his own email (or if necessary create a new email for him) as a sign in alias.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make his new email the primary sign in alias for that account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you can remove your own email.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>BEWARE!!! If your own Email is a Microsoft Account email (Hotmail, Outlook etc.), then you WILL LOSE your Email!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it's a Gmail, Yahoo or other email service, then you still have your own email, but you will lose access to any Microsoft Service you used with that email.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, your kid will still be considered to be an adult, as his Gamertag was created with your adult account, and thus you can't restrict his playtime, who can talk to him via Xbox Live and so on!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So in my opinion: Creating a new account for your son, and adding that to your family account is a much more secure solution for you and your kid. Even if that means your kid has to start over playing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's "just" 7 months of playtime he's losing, compared to several years of "unprotected" gaming, if you keep him on your account.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Appreciate your passionate reply!</p>
<p>&nbsp;You are absolutely correct in being so strong in relation to children allowed to play on Parents accounts but you also have to know that i have a 21yr old another "boy" who also used this same account etc. and grew up being a responsible adult etc. with
 clear distinction of right/wrong and acceptable/unacceptable online behavior.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Place my 7yr old uses Xbox is constantly supervised and i am so happy to say all other players he has been in touch with are great and well behaved. Being a parent teaches you a lot-among others is the fact that banning will not educate your children-it
 will just make them more rebellious.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not got a solution to my problem yet but appreciate your advice in this comment and will take them on board.</p>
<p>
</p><p>THANK YOU</p>

<p>You're welcome.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But as for a solution to your problem: There is none, as you can't transfer purchases or game progress to other accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a specific reason why you let your kids play on your own account instead of getting them their own account right away?</p>
<p>As you see, letting them start on your account, and then having them transit to their own account generates problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So maybe, if you explained us your reasoning to giving your kids your adult account, instead of their own account, maybe we can find a better solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't doubt that you are a great parent, and you're raising your kids to be responsible adults.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But as you see for yourself, not separating the kids from your personal account generates unnecessary trouble. So giving kids their own accounts has nothing to do with trust or good parenting, but giving kids an account that they can build up from the ground
 up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Imagine the gaming account your kids (don't) have as the kid building up something creative on their own, like a garden you allow them to have, or a construction toy they use to build amazing stuff, only to take it away later, because the material they are
 gardening with or building with it's actually physically "yours", not your kid's. So even though they put their work and labor into the garden, they can't eat the fruits and vegetables they've grown, because it physically belongs to you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this is a bad analogy, as you, as a parent would let your kids have the fruits and veggies they grow, but since the Microsoft Account doesn't provide any means to transfer ownerships of bought games and gaming progress, it's just like that 😔</p>

<p>If you change the GamerTag as explained here<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/manage-gamertag-and-profile/change-xbox-live-gamertag" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> https://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/manage-gamertag-and-profile/change-xbox-live-gamertag</a>,
 you keep all progress and purchases ;)</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that, you can change the profile privacy and manage the parental control settings.</p>

<p>Are you just referring to a gamertag change? Or want to change your gamertag for your son? He will not lose any progress or gamerscore if he changes his GT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe you are possibly talking about changing the email associated with the gamertag? You can do this by adding an alias to your current email and then switching to the new one added.

<h2>            Trying to open Homegroup control panel, but empty window opens</h2>
                    
<p>Hello all.. i think i might have a unique problem here... When I open my control panel for my HomeGroup, the window opens.... COMPLETELY BLANK! well, maybe not completely blank.. there is the yellow yeild sign with an "!" in it... that is all.. no options
 no other icons no text.. NOTHING.. once i figure out how to upload a picture, i will!&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue is similar to the Windows Update issue we were having when we were trying to open up the windows update window, and it was coming up empty.&nbsp; i too was having this problem.. thinking they were related, i ran the Microsoft Fix it.. in default mode,
 it did nothing.. in aggressive mode, it repaired the windows update.. but not the homegroup control panel...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ANY IDEAS???? i really need my homegroup password!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>p.s. I also ran the sfc /scannow command.. came back with errors that it could not fix.. if you want to see the log file, let me know</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>What
 happens when you try to access event viewer? Do you receive any error message?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the SFC scan does not fix the issue then you will need to perform Inplace upgrade installation of Windows 7.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may reinstall your copy of Windows 7 while keeping your files, settings, and programs by performing a<strong>repair installation</strong>
 or an <strong>in-place </strong>upgrade with the following steps: (<strong>Note</strong>: &nbsp;This does not always resolve all issues, especially if the corruption was caused by a 3rd party program or service, you might need to do a clean installation if this
 is unsuccessful.)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: After performing
 In-Place Upgrade, your personal data and installed programs will not be removed but we may need to run Windows Update to install all the available updates for your system to update these system files to the current version. This troubleshooting process is

<h2>            Problems after upgrading from win 8.1 to win 10</h2>
                    <p>I have a lot of problems after this upgrading. When I start an app it often lock the PC after some time because the app is not responding. It happens with lot of different app's and also with the new Edge, so it must be a win 10 problem, as I never before
 the upgrade had any problems. When it happens I have to force a restart of the PC by closing it down on the power buttom. Aneone else have this problem and a solution??</p>
<p>Kind regards Christian.</p>

<p>
</p><p>It suggests that you may need to logon even when booting from media....</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that you may either need to try a Restore, or worse case, reinstall windows....</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are required to logon even with the media, it probably won't allow a Refresh or RESET either....</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it should come to that, there are some Linux based bootable programs that will enable you to save any important files to a external HDD or Flash drive.... hopefully that won't be necessary....</p>

            <p>The Windows system date is (more or less) correct. Since Windows 10 advances the date/time 8 hours every time it is booted, the first thing I do after boot is the correct the Windows clock. (Windows 10 is set by me not to screw with the system/hardware clock
 so it's ok).</p>

            <p>Paint could be better in this regard but it is what it is I suppose. Can't honestly say I'd have ever noticed this until I investigated as a result of your post (and probably you wouldn't have either if not for the coincidental matching of dates).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case this 'legacy' Paint is on its way out and come March with the so-called 'Creator's Update' we'll have a
<del>bloated</del> brand new 3D Paint app instead. Maybe it updates file metadata immediately, maybe it doesn't; haven't checked yet.</p>

<h2>            Want to remove Microsoft Office Component from Open with, choose another app, more apps</h2>
                    <p>When trying to find the .exe file for Excel to use the Open With right click option on a .txt file, I apparently chose the wrong Excel file. It now shows up on the More Apps option as an Excel Icon called Microsoft Office 2010 component. I was able to find
 the correct location for Excel but now both options are appearing in the More Apps menu. I have tried to figure out how to remove it with no luck. Hopefully someone can help! Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Updating Old Email Addresses with Skype Account</h2>
                    <p>Hello Skype community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday my Skype account was hacked and a link was sent to everyone in my contacts list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first thing I want to do to try and get things under control is to change my password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 2 email accounts associated with my account but for some reason when I try to access the password change site, Microsoft says it will send a verification code to an old email address that no longer exists (I most likely used it to sign up for my Skype
 account years ago).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried an ID verification form plus have spoken on the phone to Microsoft but I have not been able to find a solution for this issue which really shouldn't be so complicated for such a simple action.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>

<h2>            Audio CD Burn errors - I get loud &#34;pops&#34; </h2>
                    When I burn CDs from Media Player 11 I almost always get writing erros with loud "pops" occuring within the songs.&nbsp; Each Pop is located in one specific place in each song.&nbsp; My burner seems to work well when buring any other type of CD including standard
 "audio" files.&nbsp; The Pops only occur when buring from Media Player playlists.&nbsp; I have tried using different brand CDs and Pops still occur.&nbsp; Suggestions?

            <p>Hello Kalpana,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a couple of questions concerning the advice that you gave Charles s123 on Aug. 23, 2,015 to a question that he posted on the same date which was&nbsp;titled "power plan".</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the first,&nbsp;step two&nbsp;"2",&nbsp;of your answer, on the first blue colored&nbsp;line, could you tell me if you preceded each slash "/" in that line with a space " "? And also, in that same line, I was wondering if that hyphen "-" is actually&nbsp;supposed to represent
 the position within that command&nbsp;where I would be expected to&nbsp;place a space " ", in place of the hyphen "-"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I assume (contained within&nbsp;the first, step two "2" of your directions) that just above that first blue line, the line which reads "WSReset.exe" is not one of the four "4" commands that you wanted&nbsp;him to type because I'm assuming the four "4" commands
 refer to what I will call the four "4" blue colored paragraphs directly underneath the "WSReset.exe" line.&nbsp; In addition to typing the four "4" blue colored paragraphs, unless I am corrected, I am assuming that WSReset.exe should be typed just before the blue&nbsp;colored
 commands and right clicking on the CMD icon (to run it as administrator).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I got any of all that wrong, could you please straighten me out?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your trouble,</p>
<p>Harry Riegert</p>

<p>There is no way to change the account if he is silver already. When you make the account you put the birthday in, that is the only way. The account is not that different. Limits some xbox live communication. If you put correct birthday in when you made the
 silver account it will be a child's gold account. </p>
<p>There was a family plan that was discontinued that you had more control over it.

<p>Hi&nbsp;micromario,<br />
<br />
Apologies, but I am a bit confused.. Are you trying to create a new account with the same email address, or attach a child account?<br />
<br />
If you could elaborate a bit, that would be awesome. : ) &nbsp;</p>

<p>I hope someone may be able to enlighten me please. &nbsp; I'm a mom of a 10 yr old boy desperate for an Xbox account. &nbsp;I have been going through the steps to set up a gold account. &nbsp;I came to the bit where it said my details would be saved on said account. &nbsp;A
 username I didn't recognize, so I'm guessing you simply just get given one automatically with no choice. As always, I'm super suspicious of giving anyone my bank details so I clicked up in right hand account icon and checked. &nbsp;It seems there is already account
 activity from last month so have I just been accidentally logged into someone else's who happens to have used my son's email???? &nbsp; How can I cancel any activity or accounts linked with this email on Xbox live, to start a fresh? &nbsp;Many thanks to anyone who has
 advice. X</p>

            <p>First open TWO windows on your desktop screen (both must be visible, so they cannot fill the screen):&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. the folder where the pictures are </p>
<p>
</p><p>2. the folder on the memory stick that you wish to place them in.&nbsp; If there is no folder there, create one.</p>
<p>(create the folder by right-clicking in the window on the stick and choose New, Folder, type in a name for the folder)</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. using the RIGHT button on your mouse, click and hold on a picture (or a whole folder)&nbsp;in the source folder</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. holding that button down, drag the picture to the&nbsp;new folder on the stick, let go.&nbsp;&nbsp;A menu will pop up&nbsp;that will allow you to choose Copy or Move.&nbsp; Since you want to Move, choose Move.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>On another note.&nbsp; 46GB is a very small hard drive?????</p>

<p>2. login screen does not respond to my first bluetooth keystroke or bluetooth mouse mouse movement, but "wired" keyboard &amp; mouse pad are fine.</p>
<p>3. after 30second~ish wating ... then both my bluetooth finally respond to the computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>its super annoying.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>can anyone advise on how to make this pairing faster or on timely manner in boot up behavior?<br />
<br />

            Hi, DRACWULA
<br />
<br />My name is Mays and I am an Independent Consultant. I would love to help you today.
<br />
<br />Perform the procedure to repair the system files:
<br />Follow these instructions: press the Windows + X keys and select Command Prompt (Administrator) or Windows PowerShell (Administrator), in the window that will open, you must type the commands in their respective order:
<br />• DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth
<br />• DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />• DISM.exe /online /cleanup-image /startcomponentcleanup
<br />•  sfc /scannow 
<br />
<br />Each of these actions can take a few minutes, so it is important to execute one at a time. When finished, you must restart the PC.
<br />
<br />Let me know if the information has been useful to solve your Problem.

<p>Hi Mays, <br />
<br />
Thank you for your suggestion.&nbsp; I am still having this delayed-pairing for some odd reason even after i thought i had already removed off-line devices yesterday.. :(<br />
<br />
Today, waking up from Hibernate mode - same long delay on bluetooth pairing after powering back up.<br />
<br />
I did perform those 4 commands as you suggested, took over an hour, did not seem to have any effect, every command appears to report back with out an issue.<br />
<br />
<br />
In Event Viewer this is the only warning message i noticed, its recurring warning event:</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
The local adapter does not support an important Low Energy controller state to support peripheral mode.&nbsp; The minimum required supported state mask is 0x491f7fffff, got 0x1fffffff.&nbsp; Low Energy peripheral role functionality will not be available.<br />
</p>
<p><br />

            What I can recommend is that you completely repair the operating system, but first you must backup your files, although with this method the data is not lost but it is a good idea to backup as a security measure, third-party applications if they are uninstalled, check this link.

<h2>            Forza Motorsport 7 Crashes on Window 10</h2>
                    <p>No matter how many times I start the game it just closes. I have latest Win10 version and latest nVidia drivers.<br />
I checked some logs and this is the error I get:<br />

<p>Thank you for your response. The exception error code: 0xe06d7363 means that the application process did not start when you tried to install the game on your Windows 10 PC. To further troubleshoot your concern, we recommend that you use an antivirus software
 to scan for viruses and Malware on your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also remove temporary files on your computer. <span>Temporary files are automatically deleted after exiting an application or a game. However, restarting your computer without exiting an active Windows session won't delete temporary files. These
 files may cause issues running games on Windows 10. Here's how:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press the&nbsp;<strong>Windows key</strong>&nbsp;on your keyboard, and then click the Settings icon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Select&nbsp;<strong>System</strong>, and then select&nbsp;<strong>Storage</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Select&nbsp;<strong>This PC</strong>&nbsp;and click on&nbsp;<strong>Temporary files</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Select&nbsp;<strong>Temporary files</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Click&nbsp;<strong>Remove files</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li></ol>
&nbsp;
<p>Another solution that can help resolve your concern is to perform a clean boot.
<span>Click on this&nbsp;</span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">link</span></a><span>&nbsp;for the steps to perform a clean boot. This process will
 start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 10.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, we recommend that you uninstall and reinstall the game on your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Keep us updated with the results after performing the suggested solutions above.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>
