<h2>            Xbox home setting&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I want to know if the home setting is set automatically when a new Xbox is setup</p>
<p>
</p><p>My kids are having an Xbox One X for Christmas to replace one of their Xbox Ones. I want to get it setup and ready for them to plug it straight in when they get it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>During the initial setup will it get set as a home xbox? Or is this a manual setting? As i dont want is set as the home xbox as home sharing is done between their two current xboxs. After christmas this wont be an issue as one is getting replaced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dont want to be spending hours setting it up on Christmas day and the kids waiting around for hours</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p />

<p>The first Xbox One console that an account signs into, will automatically become that account's Home Console.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the account then signs in on another Xbox One console, you'll have to MANUALLY set that console as that account's Home Console in the Settings under "Personalization".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if you sign in with an account that already existed on any other Xbox One console and had the Home Console already set, you will NOT set that newly set up Xbox One as your account's Home Console.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you can simply set up the console for Christmas day, and make the necessary Home Console settings later, so the kids can still play on the existing Home Console until Christmas.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            All Microsoft Products can&#39;t connect to the internet on Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys</p>
<p>Today something extremely strange happend to me and i am trying to fix it since around 4 hours and without any success.</p>
<p>I normally started my pc (windows 10 clean installation was done there two months ago). The pc worked like a charm every day. Today after login i was unable to connect with the edge browser. Thought it is a normal issue with my wifi, but no. Chrome browser
 could connect, edge not.</p>
<p>So while investigating the issue i noticed that the windows store was unable as well to connect to the internet. after googling around for 1 hour i found that my network profile was set to public and this could have caused an issue. so i set it to private
 and now edge and store are working again fine. So finally i thought i can start my work, everythings fine - but no. My office 365 suite is unable to connect (outlook can't, skype for business is unable to sign in, word can't login), cortana is offline and
 groove music can't sign in to my microsoft account. Really i don't get it. All non microsoft products work like a charm, chrome, firefox, our third party crm, dropbox. everything can connect fine with the internet just not the ms products.</p>
<p>I looked at the hosts file - no entries. i scanned for malware - no entries. i checked with sfc /scannow for issues - no results. I downloaded windows 10 media creation tool and reinstalled the system (by keeping apps and settings) - no success. Still my
 microsoft products are offline. Cortana, Windows Update, Skype for Business, Word, Excel, Outlook. Really?</p>
<p>I am a quite experienced it professional but i never had an issue like this and i have no clue what it could be?</p>
<p>thank you for any help, would be really appreciated.</p>
<p>best</p>

<p><span>Please reply, have you installed any third party antivirus security software on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The above issue might occur if you have installed third party antivirus security software on the computer which may block internet connection to Microsoft apps. Check if the apps are blocked
 by the security software installed on the computer. If yes, unblock and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, remove/uninstall the third party antivirus security software on the computer and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

</span><span>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily
 disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>-What is the exact error message you get when trying to connect?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try the following troubleshooting methods before reinstalling the OS.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1</span></b></p>
<p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of
 startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span>: Follow
<b>step 3</b> to reset the computer to start as usual after the clean boot process.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Run Microsoft Online Scanner.
</span></b></p>
<p><span>The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other
 malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software. &nbsp; </span></p>

</span></p>
<p><b><span>Important:</span></b><span> While performing scanning on the hard drive if any bad sectors
 are found on the hard drive when scanning tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            Greetings,
<div><br />
<div>I appreciate your response... The only one I got. Amazing given the size of the Microsoft Community...</div>
<div><br />
<div>In any case, I just found the answer by Googling the error message... Somehow in the BIOS, the type of drive was switched from IDE, so SATA needing additional drivers. I just reset it to IDE, booted from the install menu and blew away my damaged Windows
 XP installation, just like David Bowman blew away HAL.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Regards,</div>

<h2>            How do I get the folders to show in the left column in Windows Live Mail&#63;</h2>
                    In the left-hand column of Windows Mail I had a list of all my folders.&nbsp; I could scroll down and see every one I had.&nbsp; In Windows Live Mail I can't find a way to set up a similar list.&nbsp; I can find the folders to add content, and I can create a new folder,
 but all this is done in a pop-up box.&nbsp; I can't delete, and I can't see them all to remind me which ones I can use for new emails.&nbsp; How can I get this set up, or does Windows Live Mail even have such a thing?&nbsp; Thanks.

            <p>Sorry for the poor description.&nbsp; Moving the divider did the trick, and the compact view is no longer highlighted.&nbsp; It only toggles when using the divider bar, for me.&nbsp; Clicking it again does nothing.&nbsp; Thanks for the help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Windows Live Mail the screen is basically divided into columns.&nbsp; The far left column has stuff like in box, drafts, sent items, junk email, and deleted items.&nbsp; Below that is Outbox, and then below that is a heading that says Storage Folders.&nbsp; If I click
 on that it shows drafts, sent items, and deleted items.&nbsp; Just like above.&nbsp; You obviously know all that, but now you know we're talking about the same thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After your instruction to move the divider, I began messing with the folders I created and couldn't get to appear in that far left column.&nbsp; I discovered they were there if I clicked on that little button thing beside the Inbox heading.&nbsp; Apparently I somehow
 created them under Inbox.&nbsp; I want them under Storage Folders.&nbsp; The problem is me, but at least now I know how I screwed up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next problem was how to move my folders under Storage Folders.&nbsp; In Windows Mail you could just drag stuff.&nbsp; Not in this system.&nbsp; So I had to create the same folder under Storage Folders, move the contents, and then delete that duplicate folder under Inbox.&nbsp;
 Pain in the neck.&nbsp; I just have to watch what I'm doing, because for me Windows Live Mail isn't the most intuitive system.&nbsp; But at least your instruction to just move the divider in the regular way got me pointed in the right way.&nbsp; To me that meant that it
 wasn't all completely as alien as it looks.&nbsp; Not all.&nbsp; But some of it doggone sure is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks so much for getting back to me so quickly, and putting up with my quirks.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description you are unable to connect wireless printer of your office but can connect to the office WIFI.
<span>I would appreciate if you can provide us the following information to help us understand the issue better.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Is your system connected to a domain network?</span></li><li>Are you logged in with an Administrator account?</li><li>Do you have any security software installed on your computer?</li><li>Do you have printer permission from the office?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If you could not&nbsp;connect to the printer&nbsp;then there might be a chance that the account through which you are logged in doesn't have much permission to perform these changes. It appears that the issue is caused due to some incorrect permission settings or
 some network settings. I would suggest you to try these steps and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Troubleshooter</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to run the built-in Printer troubleshooter to fix any errors with the printer settings. Refer these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Press Windows key +X, select Control panel</p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Change the view by option on the top right to Large icons</p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click on troubleshooting and click on the view all option on the left panel</p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Run the Printer troubleshooter.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Change permissions</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to check if the user account has permission to print and manage the printer. Refer these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Press Windows key +C, select control panel</p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Under Hardware and devices, select view devices and printers</p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Locate your printer and right click
</p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click on the Printer properties from the menu and select security tab</p>
<p><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Select your user account name from the list of user accounts</p>
<p><span><span>f)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Make sure that all the check boxes against the permissions are marked as “Allow”.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the permission is already set as “allow”, then this could be a network setting issue. Check if your account is configured correctly to the network and check the network options.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3: Re-install the printer</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the permission settings and the network settings are set correctly and yet you are facing this issue, I would suggest uninstall and re-install the printer and check. You can follow the steps provided below to do so:</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Note:</strong> Please make sure that you have the setup file for the driver of the printer before uninstalling the current version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) Press Windows and x key together and click on Device Manager.<br />
b) Locate the printer driver and expand the driver icon.<br />
c) Right click on the driver icon and click on Uninstall.<br />
d) Follow the onscreen instructions to uninstall the driver.<br />
e) Locate the setup file of the driver for the printer.<br />
f) Double Click on the setup file and follow the onscreen instructions to reinstall the driver.</p>
<p><br />
Check if you are able to find the printer online.</p>
<p><br />
For further reference, you can refer to the links:</p>

    <title>Purchase History Empty - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aki2403  say:</h3>
<h2>            Purchase History Empty</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;I have started re-downloading the entirey of my purchase library (or trying to) due to the purchase of an external hard drive.</p>
<p>When accessing purchase history on my 360 nearly everything is saying content not available.</p>
<p>When accessing purchase history on xbox.com (<a href="https://live.xbox.com/en-GB/download/history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://live.xbox.com/en-GB/download/history</a>) I am only able to see my Full games that I have bought and the DLC for Far Cry 4 which I purchased yesterday
 (26th January 2016).</p>
<p><br />
If I go to the individual game pages the content I have purchased shows up as "Already purchased" case in point all four DLC items from Borderlands show as purchased but do not show in purchase history.<br />
<br />
While time consuming this work-around is okay for games that I remember purchasing content for and still have their DLC listed on the Xbox Store pages. I have however purchased content that has since been delisted and can only be accessed through the purchase
 history option (Forza 2, PGR3/4 spring to mind straight away) I am left unable to download the content.</p>

<p>I have tried logging out and then back in on the site, I have tried a cache clear on my Xbox 360. I would really like to know how I can access my content.</p>

<p>And now I've gone to the purchase history page by clicking the link on this page it shows all my past purchases again, and they all appear okay on my 360. I'm guessing that there has been something wrong on the servers and it is now sorted?</p>

            <p>I cant quite understand fully what you have said..&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;first you said no sound. then you said poor sound.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If No sound perhaps from device manager uninstall it, but leave the driver if it should ask.</p>
<p>Restart your computer and its driver will automatically reinstall, hopefully correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop had low volume but from Sound in control panel I highlight my speakers and do properties&nbsp;/ enhancements &amp; choose the Loudness Equalization ... my volume is back to normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sure I could have installed the Lenovo&nbsp;win8.1 sound program from their support site and fixed it, but its huge and seems quite old fashioned so I'd prefer to have just the basic's that win10 installed.</p>

                    My computer has one administrator. My Dad was the only one with the password to it but he passed away. I can't find the disc to over ride it. How I can re-boot the computer or log in by over riding the password so I can change it?

<span>OEM computer manufacturers are required to provide at least one way for you to reinstall Windows if you buy a computer with Windows preinstalled - your computer should have included either a restore partition
 on your hard drive, or Windows install/restore disks. ﻿Most computer manufacturers also have a feature to make your own install disks.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>If the restore partition is still there and was not removed, it will reinstall Windows. There is usually a prompt when you first start the computer telling you what key to press to start the restore﻿ -
 check your manual if you're not sure how to. Or if you have install disks - insert them, restart and boot from them to start the reinstall process.
</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>If you restore it to factory condition, it will be like it was when you first bought it - all preinstalled programs will be installed. Anything you installed after buying it
 must be reinstalled. This will remove any personal files on the computer, back them up first.</span></p>
<p>
<span><br />
</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<p>

<p>
<span>Contact the OEM computer manufacturer and ask them to send you an install disk for your computer - they may charge a small fee.

<h2>            Surface Pro 3 - battery issue&#63;</h2>
                    I've recently experienced twice where my Surface Pro 3 has shut down quickly after showing a "low battery" message. The problem is my battery is at 100% charge and sits in my docking station constantly plugged in. I've unplugged the power and see the battery
 drain operate normally like this. Has anyone experienced this issue ? Is this battery memory failure, or a Windows update issue ?

            Hi Ferg, thanks for your question. I'm Graeme, a Microsoft Community expert and fellow user.
<br />
<br />Since there's been changes to how file sharing works in Windows 10 from update 1803, see if the below Microsoft Support instructions help you set up file sharing between the two PCs:
<br />

<br />
<br />If you'e still having trouble after following those instructions, please let me know! Thanks!

<p>Hey Graeme -<span>&nbsp; </span>I have been working on this connectivity issue for hours, and hours, and hours.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I followed the Microsoft instructions with no success.<span>&nbsp; </span>
I have tried 3<sup>rd</sup> party solutions to the problem with no success either.</p>
<p>Let me detail my setup… I have my primary computer CREATE connected to the same model computer RENDER, which is the secondary, via a CAT 5 crossover cable.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have a 4TB USB drive, named MEDIA, <span>&nbsp;</span>connected to CREATE.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I want to create files on CREATE and store on MEDIA.<span>&nbsp; </span>
I want RENDER to have permission to access all of the files on MEDIA.</p>
<p>At this point, using File Explorer, clicking on NETWORK, shows both computers on both devices. RENDER also shows up as a Media Device on CREATE, and I can play media from it.<span>&nbsp;
</span>What this tells me is that the network is connected properly and working. </p>
<p>I have set MEDIA up as a shared drive with all privileges for everyone. The drive shows up on CREATE as a shared Device and Drive.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The big BUT is that the shared drive MEDIA doesn’t show up on RENDER.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If I click on the CREATE computer icon on RENDER, I get the error message – Network error<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Windows cannot access \\CREATE.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You do not have permission to access \\CREATE.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">HOWEVER, on CREATE, I can click on its icon and it opens shared folders…. C, and Users.</p>
<p>I just want the two computers to have access to the MEDIA drive.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">This permission error is driving me crazy,<span>&nbsp;
</span>Is there an easy solution?</p>

<h2>            Windows failed to start. A recent hardware or software change might be the cause</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>

<p>I have a family members Dell Inspiron 1545 with the following issue:</p>
<p>&nbsp;"Windows failed to start. A recent hardware or software change might be the cause.&nbsp;<br />
To fix the problem:</p>
<p>1. Insert your Windows installation disc and restart the computer.<br />
2. Choose your language settings and click next.<br />
3. Click "repair your computer"</p>
<p>It also gives me the following options:</p>
<p>4. Safe Mode<br />
5. Safe Mode with networking<br />
6. Safe Mode with Command Prompt<br />
7. Last known good configuration<br />
8. Start Windows normally</p>
<p>The following are the steps I have undertaken to trouble shoot:</p>
<p>1. I tried the repair option when booting off the disk supplied with the laptop. It did not resolve the issue.</p>
<p>2. I ran the Dell Diagnostics, no errors detected.</p>
<p>3. Tried to reinstall Windows Vista but the error still persists. At this stage I decided to swap hard drives from a known good inspiron 1545. The new hard drive booted to the password screen in Vista but then abruptly shut down. I think this was
 due to a low battery power as it was low on charge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Inserted another known good hard to be sure and it also failed with the Windows failed to Start. A recent hardware etc. etc.</p>
<p>5. Purchased a new hard drive, reinstalled Vista on another inspiron and inserted the drive into the suspect inspiron but the error still persists. I can boot into Safe mode with no issues but I am unable to bot in to windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated. Have I missed a simple step?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p><span><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>Did
 you install any program after reinstalling Windows Vista?</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>I would suggest you to<strong>remove any additional/non essential hardware devices</strong> other then Mouse and Keyboard connected to your System and
 then try to boot your system.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>You can also try&nbsp;<strong>Clean Boot</strong> on your system as you are able to boot in safe mode. To do so boot in&nbsp;<strong>safe</strong><strong>mode</strong>
 and then follow the steps provided in the link below:</span></span></span></p>

<p>Hi Naman,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried steps 2 and 3 but unfortunately the error still occurs.</p>
<p>I enabled boot logging and found that all drivers were loaded correctly until crcdisk.sys. After this driver there are multiple failures. From a quick look at the file it seems that it is network adapter drivers and chipset drivers that are failing to load.
 The last line on the ntbtlog.txt is a successful load of the cdfs.sys driver.</p>
<p>I installed the drivers for the chipset, network adapters from the Dell support site, but Windows will not start.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if this is going to help with the problem but I am not sure how to proceed after exhausting all the above options.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

    <title>Dead by Daylight initialization error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> irishfino  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dead by Daylight initialization error</h2>
                    After the update last week or so Dead by Daylight stopped working.&nbsp; It brings up an initialization error whenever i try to start it. I've restarted my xbox numerous times like it suggests and have uninstalled all files and reinstalled them twice but with
 no success. There was an update Friday the 5th that I was hoping was a fix but it still will not let me start a game. Plus my save files appear to be missing as well. Was planning on playing and streaming this game this month for Halloween so I'm hoping for
 a solution fast. Plus I hate to think I spent money on an unplayable game and DLC. I've seen similar problems discussed online on all platforms and pc but none of the solutions seem to work.

<p>Hello irishfino,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for bringing this issue to our attention. Is the game not able to launch from the Xbox dashboard, or is the game giving the error when&nbsp;it has loaded and is at the main menu? If the issue occurs after the game is able to successfully launch, we
 recommend utilizing the <a href="https://support.deadbydaylight.com/hc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Behaviour Support Team</a> in order to resolve an in game issue. The Xbox One does have the ability to re-sync saved data. We will list the steps below. Be sure to let us know the results!</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>From the <strong>Home</strong> screen, select <strong>My games &amp; apps</strong>.
</li><li>Highlight the game title, and then press the <strong>Menu </strong>button &nbsp;on your controller.
</li><li>Select <strong>Manage game</strong>. </li><li>Scroll to the right, highlight the saved data for your gamertag under <strong>
Saved Data</strong>, and then press <strong>A</strong> &nbsp;on your controller. </li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong>Delete from Console&nbsp;</strong>to delete all saves (local and cloud) for this game.</li></ol>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            The game will launch and go through the opening cinematic and then asks you to press A to continue. It then says loading for a few minutes and then pops up with the initializing error message and will not go any further. Additional attempts just brings
 up the initialization error message again.&nbsp; The message itself reads "Initialization Error. The game has initialized incorrectly and may not save your game properly. Restarting you game may resolve the problem." and then has my player id number.&nbsp; I've quit
 the game and restarted it numerous times, restarted the console, and deleted and uninstalled the game and DLC several times and it hasn't resolved the issue yet. I'll try the Behavior Support Team and see what they can do.

            Also the saved data is gone. There are no saves listed under saved data at all for any gamertag. It just says that when i use this game or app any data it saves will appear here.&nbsp; I had about 15 hours or so invested in it unlocking character perks and
 abilities.

<p>i play this game a lot and have received this error quite often.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually this error happens when there is an issue connecting to the games servers to get your saved game data, Usually this is a temporary issue that you cannot resolve yourself if the developer of the game is performing maintenance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also if your internet is playing up a bit it can also cause this error, (best check your network stats through the console)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that does not help then the other option i have used before is to delete and redownload the game, You won't lose the save data for the game doing this either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There were issues being reported to the developer about 5 hours ago of issues logging into the game.</p>

<p>Hey there irishfino</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have already tried uninstalling the game and powercycling the console, then I'd try what we call a soft reset.

            It's been awhile since I've responded. Basically gave up on the game but the new DLC looks exciting so I thought I'd try again. Still getting then initialization error. After the third or so update after the problem started in October it would eventually
 work after trying it 4 or 5 times. Then there was another update a few weeks later and it stopped altogether. Did a soft reset and then a hard reset but to no effect. Tried unenrolling in the Insider Program but nothing happened. My NAT is set to open. I've
 redownloaded it again, tried it without DLC, tried other profiles and even tried to start it offline but nothing seems to get it to work. Not sure what else to do.

<h2>            Cmd chkdsk not running on external hard drive</h2>
                    I'm trying to convert an external hard drive without formatting it (I have way too much stuff on it), however, when i try to run the cmd to do so, it tells me to run CHKDSK. Upon attempting to run check disk, it then claims it: "cannot run because the
 volume is in use by another process". Except it isn't open in anything else as far as i can tell. Help?

<p>There are several answers to your question:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chkdsk does not perform any conversion. It only checks the integrity of the file system.</li><li>Rebooting the machine should free up the disk.</li><li>Storing files on a single medium is risky stuff. Important files must at all times be stored on two independent media. Before you run chkdsk you must copy these files to another disk. A 1000 GByte USB disk costs around $60 and it makes an excellent backup
 medium.</li></ul>

            <p>Out of curiosity, check the Dirty bit on the selected volume like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click the Start orb/button and in the box enter the following:<br />
<br />
cmd.exe<br />
<br />
Right click cmd.exe and choose to Run as Administrator: </p>
<p><br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=20382857-f809-49f2-8783-1488b77717f7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/36e28e8b-4f05-4ee0-9697-dded1e2b6b35" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>To query the dirty bit on drive C, in the Command Prompt window enter the following command:<br />
<br />
fsutil&nbsp; dirty&nbsp; query&nbsp; C:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=f67c5518-76e1-4579-9c31-45983f113f09" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ff039e28-651e-4447-9b19-39af0e486708" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Sample output should be one or the other of:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Volume C: is dirty<br />
Volume C is NOT dirty</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the volume in question (whatever the drive letter) dirty or is it not dirty?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where you not also prompted with a message to schedule the chkdsk the next time Windows restarts:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e783eae8-c2bc-4142-8ca3-c3aba74d4487" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e783eae8-c2bc-4142-8ca3-c3aba74d4487" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you respond in the affirmative will that not accomplish your mission?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Optionally you can tell Windows to force a dismount on the volume by adding the /x option to your chkdsk command such as:</p>
<p>
</p><p>chkdsk&nbsp; d:&nbsp; /r&nbsp; /x</p>

<p>Thank you XP Rocks. The model number is GN2000. Yes it is a USB headset, and the correct drivers are installed. It was previously working, but stopped about 2 weeks ago. Now it is working again. I don't know what I did to achieve that<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade crashing everything</h2>
                    <p>I installed Windows 10 upgrade from 7 professional. It has run fine for a couple of weeks. Now all of a sudden everything keeps crashing. All I can do is type. If I try to play a game on facebook or watch a video, it keeps saying plugin has stopped working.
 If I go to my yahoo.com email and click on an email, it says plugin has stopped working. Just going from one internet page to the next can get the same response.&nbsp; Any clue what's going on?&nbsp; How can I get back my Windows 7 pro back?&nbsp; Also Cortana doesn't work.
 Something about my computer being too old and not compatible. Can that be fixed.&nbsp; I'm not sure I'm ready for progress yet....</p>
<p>Also, the games on Windows 10 such as solitaire and the puzzles also won't upload to play.

            <p>This is way far too complicated for me. Two steps is about all I can handle. I have not gone to computer school. And from everyone else has said, it doesn't matter how many times you "fix" the problem...it is NEVER fixed!</p>
<p>So I have gone back to 7 pro and will stay there. </p>

<h2>            TGM Wants You</h2>
                    
<p><span><span>Are you interested in becoming something more than just an individual on Live? Are you tired of the group you already belong
 to and are looking for a change? Well, we may be the answer you have been looking for. We are TGM – Tactical Gaming Masters and we are recruiting. I believe in honesty very deeply and that is why it is at the heart of the way we run things in TGM. We are more
 relaxed type of clan and not so competitive that we make everything about winning. Don’t get me wrong we love to win and we do that quite often. We are about making friends and being a group that people want to play with so that we can make the Live experience
 more enjoyable for everyone. If you are interested in joining you can respond here, msg Stevo205128182 or myself at One Old Redneck, or visit our website @ unitinggamers.net. Either way we look forward to hearing from you. Also if you use the website please
 use the appropriate contact form.</span></span></p>
