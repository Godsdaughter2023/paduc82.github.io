<h2>            Facebook Secure Connection Failed</h2>
                    <p>When I try to open any links from within the Facebook app I'm given this:<br />
<br />
An error occurred during a connection to www.facebook.com. SSL received a record that exceeded the maximum permissible length. (Error code: ssl_error_rx_record_too_long).<br />
<br />
I thought maybe it was Mozilla specific, but it gives me the same message with Edge. I downloaded Maxthon Cloud Browser and it and Chrome give me Error 102. The resolution for that is to go into the advanced settings and enable SSL 2.0 &amp; 3.0, which I did and
 it didn't resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Someone in another thread about the FB app said it sounds like my certificates may have gotten corrupted, but I'm at a loss as to how to resolve that and didn't want to start that process in that thread.<br />
<br />
What should I do? What do you need?</p>
<p>
</p><p>[Update]</p>
<p>I've added every version of the facebook url to any trusted sites list I can find on my computer and get the same results. I've also cleared my SSL state as well.

<p>a.) Not prior to this issue, no ma'am. During the troubleshooting process for another issue I did need to enter a PowerShell command to get the App to work correctly, but this issue was present prior to the App force closing on me.<br />
<br />
b.) I am currently unable to access ANY Facebook stuff. Websites, articles, anything that has a facebook.com address. I thought maybe this was a security setting for our network, but I'm able to log into other PC's and access FB with no problem. That leads
 me to believe this may not be a FB issue, but a Windows issue.<br />
c.) I thought this was an App made by MS for FB access? In any event, is there anything you can think of for me to try on this end while I wait for their reply?</p>

<h2>            The Grumble indie supplement&#58; Summer washout special</h2>
                    
<p>For those new to the grumble supplement, or those like me who will have forgotten, all these are shamelessly unprofessional reviews based (unless stated) on the trail versions of the game alone. A game has 9 minutes maybe more if I replay the trail to convince
 me of its quality or lack of. Also due to recent things I must now say all prices listed are correct only as of the publication date and the actual price may now be subject to change.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</span></b></p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> 10 amazingly awful games vol 2</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b></p>
<p>Long ago in the Mists of time forgotten by this generation lies a very old game released here in the blighty basically for everyone to make fun of, a compilation of the worst games ever programmed at the time it was called “Five of the Worst games ever (Don’t
 buy this)” no seriously if you’ve never heard of this you need to go watch Guru Larry talk about this now, no stop reading, go to youtube and look it up.</p>
<p>This game is probably the indie game spiritual sequel to it and when I first looked at this game considering the quality of indie games I’ve reviewed in the past I expected great things from this, great and terrible things as for an indie game to now make
 me think it’s awful really will be a true effort.</p>
<p>So the only true way to judge this like with so many other games is of course for me to slog through all these games which in the end managed a respectable 27 minutes for me to do.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Viper wing</span>: So this is one of those scrolling shooter games, and what can I say it’s a pretty competent space shooter, it doesn’t excel and at points does become bullet hell but I’d probably say on its own it
 rates higher than perkuna’s dragon</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Bloody bobby: </span>Ok I don’t get this game, I really don’t you play as the red packman ghost stoping on actual ghosts while collecting baked beans and trying to avoid falling in tomato sauce, the game has very nice
 controls but its ruined by, hit detection as theres seemingly 1 pixel difference between you hit and kill an enemy and they do the same to you, add in some rather tough jumps that seemingly can only be made if the game glitches on you when you jump and you
 have something that’s quite bad.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Fruit defender</span>: Its DDR almost but with fruit and moving background that disorientate you more, it works better than most Simon says esc games and holds up better than Wacky Waving Inflatable arm flailing tubemen.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Terror Tunnel: </span>Its missile command but with faster moving everything and a moving background to add confusion, also there are sections of the tunnel ceiling that fall causing chaos and non linear enemy descents
 (ooohhhh look at me with me fancy words).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Storm Wheel: </span>Probably the strongest game of the lot here, which is something I shouldn’t be saying about any game in this collection as it’s meant to be awful games. This one could on its own if I’d been handed
 it have struggled to a 2 star. It’s a spy hunter esc game but plays far more like a twitch shooter. You simply have to run the length of the level to the goal in the time limit and it is oddly fun to play.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Seeker: </span>A sci fi procedurally generated dungeon game where you play as a robot ship trying to shut down the planets malfunctioning computers all the time trying to stop your energy being stolen by enemy ships
 or shorting out your ship with water. It plays well despite the lack of after hit invulnerability (Which I still suspect the developers actually coded the game to not have this as it seems deliberate somehow)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Nastyroids: </span>&nbsp;What can I say its Asteroids but kind of more clunky, it works</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Grid warrior: </span>&nbsp;Possibly the most imaginative, original and playable game in the collection, its like the evolution of space invaders and not into a stupid 3D shooting game. Enemies pour in from the two top corners
 and advance down the grid rows towards you sometimes shooting, you can move anywhere even up and down and have a shield. The game gets more interesting in the second level when an enemy is added existing on the left, outside the grid so you can’t kill it,
 however it can fire into the grid adding an enemy moving vertically in the game giving you a reason to leave the bottom of the screen. The enemy even seems to have some near modern level AI with the ability to follow you, pick its shots and even sometimes
 predict where you will be and fire there first. Another game which on its own could have made 2 stars.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">I Madez a clone wiv zombie innit !:</span> Not as you’d expect a direct clone of I made a game with zombie in it (I refuse to use its stupid name ok). You crawl through a sort of lab complex with a pistol shooting
 zombies trying to reach the exit, the annoying fact being theres lots of zombies, your pistol fires slow and it’s not 1 shot kill sometimes not even 2 shot kill. Meaning most of the game you are running and trying to kite zombies and get through gaps add to
 this the fact it almost looks like you can explore a bit only for this to be shown as an illusion and this is possibly the one game in this collection where the title holds true, it is an awful game.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Lame Invaders:</span> A side scrolling space shooter, a few enemy varieties, a few power ups, it works its not great but it does something.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> Possibly a triumph for ironic humour as it fails to showcase 10 awful games only managing to showcase mediocre games for the most part, this may be testament to the developers actually being ok programmers and as such having to deliberately
 sabotage their own games or it might be more of a show of how awful some indie games are managing to be so much so that it makes these look passable. Either way the game work out to be 8MSP each. It won’t hold you for long but its something I’d say people
 should look at even just on the trial where there’s 2 levels of each game to play.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
</b></p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> 1 v1 soccer</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> A long time ago in school the craze used to be to vs people at slime soccer, if that game still even exists on the internet it’s worth trying even once just to say you have. 1 v 1 soccer is an attempt to modernise the idea of slime soccer
 essentially. It’s a simple 1 vs 1 match, however with slime soccer it was about skill and timing this game however made the mistake of making the pitch longer and the game less precise. In my time vs the computer I was being consistently out run and out jumped
 with the computer being able to sort of stun lock you by jumping on your head however for you to do it to the computer seems to be a 3:4 chance it won’t work. The problems the game have would be fine if they didn’t completely break the game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>The matches turn into a first to hit the ball will get the goal for the majority of the round due to having to jump over the ball to kick it back meaning you have to have a clear lead over the opponent going for the ball to prevent a goal. Having finally
 finished the first match I tried a second, during which the computer ran twice as fast as me everywhere despite me pressing the so called sprint button. I thought something was wrong and it turns out I was right, the game lets you upgrade your which you pretty
 much need to do to stand much of a chance even against the average AI.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> Just like England will / already have crashed and burned out of Euro 2012 (depending on when you’re reading this) This game deserves to do the same. Avoid it like saying “You know what I think Tim Henman could win it this year.”</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
</b></p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Action Arcade wrestling</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> I will first say I am or at least was a fan of pro wrestling and before someone decides to make a remark about that it is pretty much the new age version of coliseum matches in Roman times (No seriously you think if every match were to
 the death they’d have been able to keep putting on so many matches ?). Back to the topic basically I did like wrestling, I had plenty of the games right up until Smackdown shut your mouth I think it was. I have dabbled with recent wrestling games but lack
 of interest in the new characters or knowledge of the storylines have put me off a lot (Hence why I hope the new attitude era WWE game does something good). For the most part though wrestling games have been crap.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>I went into this game expecting well a very poor Atari era esc wrestling game. I came out kicking myself for not knowing of this game before hand. It has a unique aesthetic, and by that I mean the characters do have that special “Just folded out of paper”
 look to them with the ring being ok and working. On a technical level its probably more simple than the N64 era of wrestling games (Excpet WWF attitude) theres no real corner move or that I could spot a finisher system. The game relies on a health system,
 however you can rest to replenish this. I was impressed by the variety of the grapple moves as there are at least two moves and irish whip for characters to use.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>The only main letdown mechanics wise for the game was the lack of corner things such as the 10 count punch or other such wrestling staple moves.</p>
<p>The game also much to my surprise had a create a wrestler system, though fairly basic pick from standard parts I really enjoyed being able to customise different aspects and should you wish you can change the wrestlers a bit from the pre-built version to
 get round the licensing stopping the game having certain superstars from the get go.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> This is a fine solid wrestling game, very fun and sitting on a technical level somewhere between the SNES and N64 eras in terms of its technical level. If there were more mechanics in the game such as running grapples and the grapple system
 made to be less temperamental I would be yelling about how this should have been 240 MSP. As is this games a real knockout......... crap thats boxing ...... um something good and wrestling related.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
</b></p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Adamant Ants</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> Remember Lemmings, remember what made it work ?</p>
<p>If you answered a mix of chaos and yet possibility then you’re right. The problem with Adamant ants is it is quite obviously a PC game, the settings and even the in game cursors, this isn’t a native XBLIG game and from the get go it shows. My time on the
 trail other than messing with the setting to try and break the game like a psychopathic school kid was spent hating the fact I failed at crashing it and ended up trying to play. I use the phrase trying to play because without the speed and precision of a mouse
 this game becomes a problem. While I’m quick with a controller often I was checking one side of the screen when on the other all my ants were killed off in one giant bird suicide bombing ...... no I’m serious. The Big issue I found in the game was having to
 be precise, something the 360 controller isn’t too great at and quick which again it’s not too great at. The Trial level puts you on level 5 and it requires some precision. The concept is you have to move forward, use the available powers to capture the flags
 and advance on worm territory guiding your ants to victor. The problem is the powers just don’t cut it. With Lemmings if you came to a drop you could bridge it or you could if there was a floor parachute down, with Adamant ants you have to build a ladder up
 at the correct spot so your ants can jump across the gap essentially abusing the physics engine. Now the issue with the powers manages to continue further by having the shield only work in a very localised area so if birds are dive bombing you have to get
 the shield up at the exact moment. But by the time you’ve seen the birds and selected the shield unless you were right over where you need it, its too late and you lose all the ants in the area around it.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> Weirdly the only good part was the music played during the intro static cinematic thing. This is less a Prince charming and more a case of Feed Me to the Lions...... what you try finding another track title to finish this poorly conceived
 joke. For this game I would refused to deliver or even stand.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
</b></p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Ambient water</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> I have no idea where to start other than. It has a picture and then plays a looped audio recording of the kind of water, that’s it. It’s billed as a relaxing game but the recordings are so poor sounding and seemingly off task its more
 annoying, with rain sounding less like falling rain and the static of a TV being left on.</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> It failed to relax me, in fact it managed to infuriate me more with its poor quality recordings and the fact someone was selling this rubbish on XBLIG. Avoid like going to a blind acupuncturist</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</b></p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> along came a spider</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> Ah I dug this one out and I remember why I have failed to manage to delete this game. You play a spider and your aim is simple, to eat all the flies on the level. The game is solid in its execution, very stylised and colourful and with
 interesting mechanics such as letting you climb threads as well as spin your own. Spinning your own is mainly used as a safety harness to be able to try possibly deadly jumps and get back up as well as swing. This game I’m about 90% sure has the same swinging
 physics as Spiderman 2&amp;3 very smooth, enjoyable and allows the maintaining (to a degree) of your momentum. The level design from what I saw was very enjoyable with the flies serving actually more as checkpoints than collectables, which added to the games fun
 factor.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> Short of being an arachnophobic there’s no reason for people to make excuses as this game is quite possibly one of the early and still very good examples of what XBLIG devs can do to make an enjoyable game that’s both simplistic yet very
 enjoyable and very nice to look at.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
</b></p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Argh Aliens</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> There’s just been something about recent aliens games rubbing me up the wrong way and it’s not the lack of blue alien Bazookas. This is a 3D moon taxi alike you take off from a sky scraper and fly your UFO in the 3D city to the roof tops
 to presumably the people you’re abducting. Some levels require you to make extra stops to pick up fuel to help you complete the level. I’ve been avoiding mentioning something here, like a shady government agency this game has one big nasty thing unfortunately
 it’s not too good at hiding it has a serious camera problem with the camera being at a very weird angle, you can change it but it seems most attempts don’t help give a better camera angle. It’s almost like the games developers know of this issue hence why
 there’s a nice visible shadow to help guide you to your landing spot.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> Avoid like Hollywood has hopefully avoid the TMNT film remake where they are teenage aliens.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
</b></p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Auxillium magi</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> It’s hard to describe Auxillium magi other than to call it a Twin stick defender game, your character remains static and it’s up to you to block them with the appropriate magic shield. The basic idea is you play as a team of mages doing
 missions. Other mages are trying to stop you so you have to shield from their magic, so fire shields block fire and ice shields block ice. It does try to add to this formula with flaming ice requiring both to block and necro which if it hits a shield it stops
 you moving it for a time leaving you more vulnerable. From what I saw of the plot it tried to have a buddy comedy esc feel between the characters, however I couldn’t enjoy this due to the really annoying cutscene music.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> Its unique ish and its trying but it’s just not that good. In magical terms this games a bit of a squib. Avoid it</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
</b></p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> avatar Fart</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> One of possibly the most fun times was watching a flatmate of mine at the time play “Try not to Fart” it’s a story based game with some very 4<sup>th</sup> wall breaking comments and dialogue, the game itself is genuinely funny as is watching
 your flatmate in desperation and confusing smack his controller into his face to press down the Y button because both his hands are in use. Then they try to add their foot to that equation. Avatar fart (and I never thought I’d say this) is puerile and stupid
 and not a patch on “Try not to Fart” which is still possibly the best game Silver Dollar have ever managed to release Avatar Fart however is just poor, it’s the same concept but the controls don’t even appear to work as while holding down right trigger at
 one point I was asked to hold down X, then let right trigger go. With my hand pressing firmy down on the X button I let go of right trigger only for X and all the other buttons I was holding to be considered released to by the game, racking up the failure
 marks.</p>
<p>When the whole game is just your avatar farting and you have to try and hold down buttons you have to wonder where the game is meant to go and what the incentive is to carry on.</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> This is proof that not all fart jokes are funny, nor can or should they be the sole source of humour in any game.</p>

<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> burning fist of rage</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> A side scrolling beat em up with quite good 3D graphics, its rather a shame the game world seems to empty with none of the normal destructible things you’d expect in a side scrolling beat em up. Most items are simply dropped by enemies
 and heath is rare, possibly too rare. The game is passable with a few moves and super moves to do, it doesn’t force you to always super move and it does seemingly have an interesting plot of some kind involving corruption.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> A Passable enough game, nothing really sensational other than fairly nice graphics but still worth a look in.</p>

<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> bytown lumberjack</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> Oh I’m an indie game reviewer ....... and I think I’ve done this joke before so I won’t recycle it. Bytown Luberjack is a side scrolling beat em up that revels in its own warped style. You play a lumber jack living in a house in the woods
 when a giant goat monster decides to do its business in front of your house, oh and it steals your favourite log. The obvious response is, pick up your axe and go on a rampage through the forest killing everything in your way. The game has some issues mechanically
 with the ability to easily stunlock most enemies even boss characters meaning most enemies pose no real risk, apart from the worryingly accurate rock throwers and near unavoidable hedgehogs.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> Still better than playing a Cabella’s game as at least in this one it knows it’s being stupid and over the top with all the butchering. Not a great game but still looks to be a fairly solid entry.</p>

<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> detect</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> You’re inserted into a street, a neighbourhood you’re given a feed of the target. It’s up to you to find them and.... I honestly don’t know as this isn’t some spy, stealth assassination game you just find the person then have to find someone
 else. The street / neighbourhood isn’t that great either its quite basic with no surrounding effects to give the illusion this is anything other than a small box plot. I can’t even say the skybox looked good.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> The game just feels slow clunky and without purpose.... very much like life does a lot of the time, I play games to the drudgery of normal life not to simply transfer it to another level of drudgery. Avoid like this game is a contract killer
 you know has been sent to get you.</p>

<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Firing Range 2</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> Firing Range 2 surprised me by being a really quite good gun game. Firing Range 2 improves upon this in nearly every way. This really is the definition of what a sequel should be. Not enough weapons before ? Fine here’s 2 more weapon types
 oh and you can unlock different weapons to use in each of the 4 classes, along with adjust their camo patterns and many other aspects of the game. The Bland grey firing range is gone switched out for an outdoor desert range. The small and large targets have
 been joined by new multi shot targets, human cut out targets, multishot targets. Secondary weapon targets and even knife targets all to test you planning and adaptability. If ever there were something designed as an FPS trainer this game is it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>The two new weapons in the sniper rifle and **** rifle work very well and the sub machine gun has received that much needed tweak to its sections with some parts creating a scenario where you can spray it as the weapon seems intended to do. The Game has
 had a overhall pretty much everything feels more refined and better even the targets now give extra score based on speed and the position you hit them. Add to all this, the multiplayer aspect and the game is a superb piece of work.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> A true show of how to make a sequel and a game I have to recommend. Honestly I don’t expect to see a Firing Range 3 but if it comes it might well be the best game ever made, if that is it steps up as much as this game has. Milkstone Studios
 have redeemed themselves with this game for Avatar Farm and then some by showing just how good a game they can make.</p>

<p><b>Review bit:</b> If you’re reading this after the Firing Range two review all I can say is oh dear.</p>
<p>Oh dear.</p>
<p>Oh dear.</p>
<p>This game advertises itself as a “Professionally used training device for FPS gaming” I hate the pro gammer wanna be culture so this game immediately managed to raise my anger levels. Then I played it and wow its quite dire, the crosshair movement feels
 stiff, the game doesn’t reward accuracy as much as speed in shooting the targets, there’s no Iron sight shooting, no different weapons, no adaptive scenarios and no recoil when you shoot. Oh and the trail limits you to a single test your skill mode and shows
 you none of its supposed exercises to help you improve and even locks of the progress graph, leaving me at least with &nbsp;no idea what the exercises might entail or if its worth it.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> If you want to train, play FPS games, if you want something to help you train play Firing range 2. This game is like most MLG wanna bees. Completely irrelevant, annoying and should be ignored.</p>

<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Jetpack rapture</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> Jetpack Rapture is almost a concept too obvious to have not been done before while also being an amazing idea. The rapture starts and you’re one of only a few people not being lifted up. However you have a jetpack and decide to take your
 revenge by flying up knocking people out of the light and preventing them being raptured (Is that even a verb ?). The game is rather simple though also rather well made with your character throwing insults, other rapturees (?) throwing out some controversial
 yet classic religion lines including “Told you Evolution was a lie”. Every so often you’ll have God yelling at you while his angels try to stop your rampage.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> A very enjoyable if shallow little game, it does get a bit boring fairly quick but it’s a nice little diversion worth a look at.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
</b></p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> old spice racers</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 240</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> Remember Uni rally on the SNES where you couldn’t name a character Sonic because Nintendo made it block the thing and come up with a stupid message. If you do then let me cut this review short for you. This game is Uni rally without the
 physics, they even rip off some parts of the old courses and the entire stunt course. This game is broken it seems at random points the forward control switches directions now you’d think this is fine as you change directions, but it’s not the game could seriously
 do with and accelerate button so you can just go and not have the forward direction work fine right up to the middle of a hill then keep switching. With uni rally the physics seemed to work, the bikes felt they had weight, momentum got conserved and look the
 loops worked. With Old Spice ripps off Uni Rally it doesn’t on one loop I died because I went airborn and the game didn’t resister me as being behind part of the track so killed me at least twice. The stunt course doesn’t work because the bikes seem to have
 issues conserving momentum so you have to rely on the turbo boost, which is the only new feature added to the game.</p>
<p>The rest of the game is a poor man’s reskinned and broken uni rally one course ws litereally me going in a straight line for 3 minutes with nothing else. The courses are simply small copied sections of uni rally tracks annoyingly repeated over and over without
 the rest of the variety from the tack.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>When I saw it was an old spice game I didn’t hold much hope it would be good as the past 2-3 games haven’t been exactly brilliant but I had hope it might manage the meh level of enjoyment gentle macho managed but no it even falls short there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> The most disgusting thing I’ve seen in indie games for a long while this is a 240 msp advert being sold to you. A 240 MSP advert that’s tacked on a brand to a clone of an old and far more functional game. If this were trying to sell a product
 it should have been free , if this was trying to be a legitimate game it should have been 80 MSP at once. If I take this game as the product it’s trying to sell then I can only say that Old Spice is an overpriced product that doesn’t work.</p>

<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Parrot paradise Lorikeets</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> So pictures of Lorikeets and info about their colouring and size. There’s 5 of them. What you think there’s much else I can say about this game ? there’s nothing in it unless you’re obsessed with Lorikeets and must own everything related
 to them there’s nothing here for you, and even so you’ve probably already got all this information and pictures in other books.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> This isn’t a game it’s a psychological experiment to see if people are stupid enough to pay for games like this, I’m sure of it, no one in their right mind could really want this game.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Penny Charade </span></p>
<p>For those who don’t know Penny Arcade on the rainslicked precipice of darkness 3 is due out soon, however as well as being an indie game its managed to cause another stir and not for a good reason. Under XBLIG policy if a game fails its peer review then
 it must wait 7 days to be resubmitted, the idea being to stop XBLIG devs using peer review to avoid doing playtesting themselves. However Penny Arcade 3 failed and re-entered peer review after only 1 day. While there been no clear response from anyone, rumours
 are than MS stepped in and broke its own rules to try to make sure the game shipped on time.</p>
<p>I’ll leave it up to you as to if you think MS were right to break their own rules to help a well known liscenced game get released on time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Achievewents</span></p>
<p>This month there was a huge amount of buzz from XBLIG devs as ms announced in 24 hours achievements carrying gamerscore would be coming to XBLIG, most devs were in shock as it was an announcement so sudden no-one was expecting it and no-one would have been
 able to implement the achievements that quick. Tales of games being pulled from playtests and chaos in the XNA forums filled the tweetwaves that was until late-ish afternoon when MS pulled a U-turn and said achievements weren’t coming.</p>
<p>So who knows what the future might hold for XBLIGs and gamerscore and who knows if this really is something that should happen, again it’s all for you to decide.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">The Price is at last right</span></p>
<p>Ms have finally done something amazing for XBLIg by finally letting people change the price of their games and not just for special sales, now games releasing at too high a price can drop it. Though it will still be after the initial high sales period so
 releasing at the wrong price is still a costly thing though if you’re game is good enough you might see more sales when you drop the price.</p>

<p>For previous reviews I'm sure you can find them </p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t turn on media streaming on Windows 7 Media Player</h2>
                    I cannot turn on streaming media on media player 12, Windows 7 64 bit. I have two other computer, one running XP and a wireless laptop running Vista. I also have directv DVR and a PS3. They can all see each other and share&nbsp;media.&nbsp;The two computers can
 see and play media from the one running Windows 7, but neither the DVR or PS3 can see the computer with Windows 7. I have turned&nbsp;WMP off and rebooted, then turned&nbsp;WMP on again to try to reset, but no change.&nbsp;When I click to turn on, the OK button stays grayed
 out.<br />
Help!!<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help<br />

            Hi djwill58,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<ul>
<li>When is the Ok button grayed out? Is it when you try to Turn on the Windows Media Player?
</li></ul>
&nbsp;<br />
If this is the case I would recommend you to run the SFC scan and check for any corrupted system files.<br />
Use <strong>the System File Checker</strong> tool (SFC.exe) to determine which file is causing the issue, and then replace the file.
<br />
To do this, follow these steps:&nbsp; <br />
1. Open an elevated command prompt. To do this, click Start, click All Programs, click Accessories, right-click Command Prompt, and then click Run as administrator. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password,
 or click Allow.<br />
2.&nbsp;Type the following command, and then press ENTER: <br />
sfc /scannow<br />
The sfc /scannow command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.&nbsp;<br />
More Infoermation about SFC scan can be found in this document:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</span>
</a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Try enabling the Windows Media Player again verify if it enables.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Once it is enabled, verify the settings to share the media by following the document below:<br />

<br />

<li>How have you connected the DVR and PS3? </li><li>Are you&nbsp;using any extender to connect t hese devices? For more information about extenders refer to the srticle below:<br />

                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Okay I'm having a **** of a time trying to transfer pictures from my Andriod phone to my laptop (windows 10 was installed when i got it)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I found Autoplay under the control panel settings and changed my "device" (aka my phone) to "import videos and photos automatically. Thought i fixed my problem with that. Except every time i plug in my phone nothing shows up.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Played around with Autoplays settings once more. Nothing. Its such a little task. Windows 10 is bull crap and i wish i was smart enough to change it back windows 7 or even 8.<br />

            <p>Here's what most people do, and it's quick and easy:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upload the pictures from your phone to the cloud - e.g., Google Photos, OneDrive, Dropbox, etc. - then download them from the cloud to your computer. Why mess with wires and adapters and software when modern technology does the work for you?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can even arrange to have your phone automatically upload your pictures, so you don't even have to think about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On top of everything else, you have backup copies of your pictures in the cloud, which also makes sharing a cinch. Pick through them at your leisure and toss the pictures you don't like.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I reinstalled Live Mail after my computer repair. Live Mail works until I try to send an attachment, then it goes into error and I lose internet connection. I have tried this many times and always same result. I have uninstalled Live mail several times and
 still same. Each time I try to send attachment, I then have to restart computer to get back online. My live Mail works fine on my laptop and my spare older computer.</p>

            <p>by that I meant that at the bottom right of my screen on live mail page, it shows 'error' and then I lose my internet connection completely. I do not receive any 'error message' at that stage.</p>
<p>When I retry to send I receive message 'windows live mail error ID 0x080072EE7'</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem only occurs on one of my computers on Live Mail and I can send the same attachments using the new Outlook version.</p>

            <p>OK, thanks. It would have helped to see the entire error message. The error code means NAME_NOT_RESOLVED; in other words, your computer couldn't find the IP address for the server you were trying to connect to. You seem to have a DNS problem, along with
 several other people in the past few days. Who's your ISP? <br />
<br />
This sort of error will usually right itself in a few hours or a couple of days, once the sysadmins for the server concerned discover that something's wrong.&nbsp;If it doesn't, contact your ISP for assistance.<br />
<br />

            Hi again. Virgin is my provider....... But why does another computer when connected to the same modem, and also my laptop receiving it's wifi signal from the same modem work ok .... &nbsp;then when I reconnect the problem computer, it doesn't work ok ? As I
 said, this only occurs when trying to send an attachment ... everything else is ok, basic emails and intermet. As soon as I try to send the attachment, it goes into error.

            Hi 'Firedog'.
<div>OK, I have just reverted back to the problem LM account on my problem computer. I sent a test email with no problem. I then tried to send a 700 KB photo to myself .... LM page went from 'connecting/working online' to 'error/working online' and yellow triangle
 symbol. Outbox showed (1). then some seconds later, internet connection was lost and again yellow triangle on the internet symbol. No 'error messages at this stage. When I try to close LM page, then I see the box with the previously stated error message and
 the explanation about being unable perform the tasks. Unable to access any internet at this point. After closing LM and using the troubleshoot option, then internet was restored.</div>
<div>Have sent this from Outlook as the failed message is still on the LM account and will prevent me from using LM until I cancel it.</div>
<div>Hope you understand all of that !</div>

            I now have photos of the error messages if you feel that they'll help (can send on Outlook)... but as I have said ... I think that the error messages relates more to the loss of internet than the original problem of trying to send the attachment.

            <p>OK, thanks. Next time you have to do this sort of thing, use <em>Snipping Tool</em>. It's easy and produces good results. You'd end up with perfect PNGs occupying perhaps 50KB instead of the 2MB each of your JPGs does. This one is only 40KB:</p>

I suppose you've done this, but if not, the first action to take when you see a networking error like that is to reset the router and/or modem. Turn off the power to it and pull the phone jack out of the wall socket. Leave everything disconnected for a full
 minute at least, then re-connect in the reverse order (plug in the phone, then power up the modem/router). On your computer, right-click on the networking icon and open
<em>Network and Sharing Center</em>. Click <em>Change adapter settings, </em>select the connection that's not working and click
<em>Disable this network device</em>. Then enable it again and watch the networking icon to see that it re-connects properly. It might take a couple of minutes to re-establish the connection.<br />
<br />
You might get better results if you lower the MTU on the connection between your computer and the modem. It's set at 1500 by default, but if the connection from your modem to the ISP's server has a lower MTU, you're doubling the effort your equipment has to
 make to break up your transmissions into packets. The instructions on <a href="http://www.richard-slater.co.uk/archives/2009/10/23/change-your-mtu-under-vista-windows-7-or-windows-8/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this page</a> look a bit hairy, but if you follow them religiously starting at Step 1, you may find that your Internet connection improves dramatically.<br />
<br />
I don't know why a particular transmission (sending an email with an attachment) would cause your router/modem to throw a wobbly, but that's apparently what's happening.</p>

            Yes, I realize that's what is happening, but why on only one computer ? My laptop sends attachments ok, my other computer also ... but this computer will not. Even a small picture causes this computer to stall but I can send larger attachments without
 any problems on the others. All have LM installed exactly the same. The only difference that I know of is that this computer after being 'cleaned' had Microsoft security installed whereas the other 2 are running AVG .... could this account for the problem
 ?

<h2>            System Restore-System Volume Information question</h2>
                    <p>A question that I've been unsuccessfully tackling the past few days concerns System Restore points:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1). Assume someone or something deletes all System restore points</p>
<p>2). Assume also that the user has retrieved all of the Deleted Restore Points, as well as the syscache.hve and the LOG1 file, and placed them back into the System Volume Information directory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Needless to say System restore still cannot detect the Restore Points that were undeleted and replaced. Question is: Is there any way to "Refresh" System Restore so that it will look for and detect these re-established Restore points?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for any assistance.</p>

            <blockquote>Is there any way to "Refresh" System Restore so that it will look for and detect these re-established Restore points?</blockquote>
<p>System Restore is a heavily protected folder. Its operation relies on several files and registry entries being arranged in a certain way which is why it has a big sign saying "Keep out!". If you hack your way through the protection then you lose the functionality
 of System Restore.<br />
</p>
<p>There is a remote chance that <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><a href="http://nicbedford.co.uk/software/systemrestoreexplorer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">System Restore Explorer</a></span> is less sensitive and lets you mount selected restore points as VHDs.</p>

            <p>Although the hve files are difficult to manipulate, sadly the Restore points themselves are not and can be readily deleted by certain malware types. As applications like System Restore Explorer and Shadow Explorer will read off of the Syscache.hve file,
 if System restore itself (<span>rstrui.exe) can't detect Restore Points neither could any 3rd party applications.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Once again, is it at all possible for System restore to re-establish associations with previous deleted and then undeleted restore Points?</span></p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for keeping us updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The component which creates System Restore points on your computer is called System Protection. System Protection
<em><strong>automatically</strong></em> creates Restore points before uninstalling, installing, restoring or updating things on to your computer. If you didn’t uninstall, install, restore or update anything on your computer, System Protection automatically
 makes a System Restore point every seven days if there were no other restore points that needed to be created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time you use System Restore, a restore point is created before proceeding, so you can undo the changes if they don't fix your problem. If you use System Restore when the computer is in safe mode or using the System Recovery Options, you cannot undo
 the restore operation. However, you can run System Restore again and choose a different restore point, if one exists.
</p>
<div>To undo the changes System Restore makes
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Open System Restore by clicking the <span><strong>Start</strong></span> button
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres2.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2fwindows%25207%2fmain%2f4f6cbd09-148c-4dd8-b1f2-48f232a2fd33_818.jpg" />. In the search box, type

 the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p>Click <strong><span>Undo System Restore</span></strong>, and then click <span>
<strong>Next</strong></span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Review your choices, and then click <span><strong>Finish</strong></span>.</p>
</li></ol>
<p><strong>How long are restore points saved?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Restore points are saved until the disk space System Restore reserves is filled up. As new restore points are created, old ones are deleted. If you turn off system protection (the feature that creates restore points) on a disk, all restore points are deleted
 from that disk. When you turn system protection back on, new restore points are created. For more information about system protection, see
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/what-is-system-protection" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p><strong>What files are changed during s system restore?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>System Restore affects Windows system files, programs, and registry settings. It can also make changes to scripts, batch files, and other types of executable files created under any user account on your computer. System Restore does not affect personal files,
 such as e-mail, documents, or photos, so it cannot help you restore a deleted file. If you have backups of your files, you can restore the files from a backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Incase if you think there's a restore point to which the computer was working fine, you may
<em><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">start the computer in safe mode</a></em> and then perform system restore choosing the same restore point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Important: <span>When you use System Restore to restore the computer to a previous state, programs and updates that you have installed after that date are removed.<br />
<br />
</span>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Just need to update or re-install the sound drivers.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - SOUNDS - look for HD Audio - Mine says RealTek High Definition Audio&nbsp; (that is an example and yours may have an entirely different name/maker).<br />
<br />
Write down description make and model - double click on it - drivers tab - write down version. Now Click UPdate Drivers which may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers. Then RIGHT CLICK on it and UNINSTALL&nbsp;- REBOOT - this will rebuild the driver
 stack.<br />
<br />
1st go to system maker's site and look for latest driver Download - SAVE - go to right click on and RUN AS ADMIN (This is your fallback.) REBOOT after each driver installation.<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE : Sound drivers often rollback so check the version after installation and the reboot to see if the version you installed is there, if not repeat the install&nbsp;- reboot until it is. It can take several tries depending on how many rollbacks it does.</strong><br />
<br />
Then do same for Device Maker's site.<br />
<span><br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<h2>            Can The Keystroke Highlight Be Disabled On The Touch Keyboard&#63;</h2>
                    <p>On my Surface Pro 2, when I typed on the on-screen keyboard, the touched key did
<strong>not</strong> get highlighted.&nbsp; It wasn't always that way and I can't remember when and how it changed, but it is something that I prefer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I have a Surface Book and I'm trying to find a way to configure the on-screen keyboard to also behave like my SP2.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I have had no luck finding any option or registry settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to make such a setting in Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand you requirement in this regard.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Usually when you type or press a key using On-screen keyboard, then it will get highlighted by default. This is to make sure which key has been selected or pressed. This is a common behavior of On-screen keyboard.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>However we don't have any option to force this behavior. I wonder how you managed to do this on Surface Pro 2. Moreover it’s not a good idea to make changes for this through registry.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Keep us posted if you require further assistance.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You are 100% incorrect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found the solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The option is on the on-screen keyboard (not all keyboards layout have it).&nbsp; There is a "highlight" key that, when pressed, toggles between highlight and no-highlight.&nbsp; Though it is not on all keyboard layouts, once activated, it applies to all layouts.</p>

 I have no idea what is happening.</p>

<p>Either it really is the wrong email (.com vs .co.uk happens often, for example) or the Microsoft account/email has become disassociated from lemons1240 (which is quite rare). Contact chat/phone support and they may be able to help find the original email.
 Hopefully, an email or phone number is on your acount to use as verification.</p>

<p>G'day Tadpole! If your lemons1240 Gamertag is still saved on the console, then the email field should already be filled in when you try to sign into it. Use that email address.<br />

<p>That error code means you need to update proofs, but since the proofs weren't updated for a certain period of time there is now a temporary block on the account. You need to do a password reset or unblock the microsoft account and update proofs to get back
 online.</p>

<p>ThaHelix: He's already tried updating the security on the account. It has come to be that the email was incorrect.</p>
<p>Tadpole: Try going to account.live.com/passwordreset and see if you can reset the password for the .co.uk version. If the online recovery options are not accessible, use the recovery questionnaire. If that, too, is unsuccessful, keep that email response
 and get in touch with chat/phone support.</p>
<p>Microsoft and Xbox have the best support you will find in helping to recover an account. Just remember that everything is based on information we as customer's input.</p>

    <title>Quickbooks cannot connect to the company file on another computer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ageektragedy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Quickbooks cannot connect to the company file on another computer</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded my hard drive from a 250gb to a 1000gb recently cloning the disk using Macrium Reflect. Everything works fine but my Quickbooks cannot connect to the company file on another computer. When I ran all the diagnostics it told me that ports were not
 open on 198.105.254.130. This IP is not associated with my system and is actually a public IP. All my network adapter settings and router settings seem fine. When I try to ping the computer with the file from the command prompt it fails and gives me statistics
 for 198.105.254.130.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I stop this IP address from associating with my network adapter?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried:</p>
<p>ipconfig/release</p>
<p>ipconfig/flushdns</p>
<p>ipconfig/renew</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I do ipcinfig/all it shows all the right IP addresses, DNS, DHCP, and WINS but that other IP address still comes up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am marginally computer savvy so step by step help is necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

                    <p>Hello, I am getting the DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL error. &nbsp;No driver is specified after the error message. &nbsp; I have a Surface Pro3 and Windows 10, which is completely up to date. &nbsp; I have been getting the error for about a week. &nbsp; In addition,
 my SP3 wifi will not stay connected -- connected to the IRQL error, I'm sure. &nbsp;I tried resetting (reinstalling) Windows 10, and still get the error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have zipped up my DMP files and my system info and put them in the following OneDrive folder. &nbsp; Could you please help me diagnose the problem?</p>

<p>===================================<br />
Maybe you could find the photos with a search for .jpg.</p>
<p>Also you may be able to recover the files from your <br />
camera's memory card with the following freeware:</p>
<p>(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System <br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)</p>

<p>The 1.006 photos that I have lost were all the photos that I took with my Canon camera during my trip last month to France and Italy.&nbsp;This has not happened before so I thought I was safe.&nbsp; They showed up briefly, so I believe something must have been downloaded,
 but they are nowhere to be seen now and were deleted from my camera after "downloading".&nbsp; I REALLY hope there is a solution.&nbsp; And this has happened to other people, too, I gather.&nbsp;

<em>APC_INDEX_MISMATCH (1)</em><br />
<em>This is a kernel internal error. The most common reason to see this</em><br />
<em>bugcheck is when a filesystem or a driver has a mismatched number of</em><br />
<em>calls to disable and re-enable APCs. The key data item is the</em><br />
<em>Thread-&gt;CombinedApcDisable field. This consists of two separate 16-bit</em><br />
<em>fields, the SpecialApcDisable and the KernelApcDisable. A negative value</em><br />
<em>of either indicates that a driver has disabled special or normal APCs</em><br />
<em>(respectively) without re-enabling them; a positive value indicates that</em><br />
<em>a driver has enabled special or normal APCs (respectively) too many times.</em><br />
<em>Arguments:</em><br />
<em>Arg1: 00007ff9fba761b4, Address of system call function or worker routine</em><br />
<em>Arg2: 0000000000000000, Thread-&gt;ApcStateIndex</em><br />
<em>Arg3: 000000000000fffe, (Thread-&gt;SpecialApcDisable &lt;&lt; 16) | Thread-&gt;KernelApcDisable</em><br />
<em>Arg4: ffffd000d1b08b80, Call type (0 - system call, 1 - worker routine)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>There was nothing particularly helpful in these three dumps, although I have a hunch that this may be related to focusrite USB 2.O Audio driver. Running Driver Verifier may help us narrow down the cause, and identify which driver/s were involved.</p>

<p>Salut,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Il faut d'abord attribuer une adresse IP fixe à la console depuis les paramètres réseau, ensuite il faut déclarer les ports 3074 et 88 sur la Livebox.</p>

    <title>Windows licensing after hard disk change - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nishantkalita  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows licensing after hard disk change</h2>
                    <p>Due to some technical problem, I have to change my Hard disk of my HP Notebook. When I bought the laptop windows 8.1 was preinstalled in it, and then I upgraded to windows 10 while the free upgradation&nbsp;period. Now I have the question that after changing
 the harddisk, How am I suppose to get the genuine operating system back. (I don't have any system recovery)</p>
<p>I just have the ISO file of Windows 10 which I have put into a DVD. So, after the change of hard disk if I try to install Windows 10 from the DVD, will I be able to get the genuine version automatically when I sign in with my&nbsp;microsoft account to which it
 is currently being linked? Or else how can I license it?</p>

            Hi Nishant.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />When you upgraded the PC was assigned a permanent Digital License to reinstall Windows 10 as often as you want.  
<br />
<br />Just skip the Product Key and follow these illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />It will activate after connecting to the internet.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.       
        </p>

            Hard disk change will not have any impact on your Windows license.
<br />
<br />Since you had upgraded from 7 to 10 and your Windows was activated, it meant that Microsoft activation server has registered your license (actually a key in digital format) corresponding to your machine. Hence, you can go ahead and update. The Windows will pick up your key from Microsoft activation server and will activate your Windows license.
<br />
<br />In case you are thrown a screen to enter your product key, just press I don't have the product key and do this later.  Windows will automatically be reactivated. Make sure that you stay connected to internet.
<br />
<br />You can also refer to following Microsoft Help -
