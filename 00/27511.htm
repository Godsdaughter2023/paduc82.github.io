<h2>            merge accounts</h2>
                    I have two skype accounts each with different credits last I knew. Since Microsoft now owns Skype I can only access the one with MS password. How do get to the other and merge them? The category "topics" don't seem to address my question.

            <p>I respectuflly disagree with many of my collegues here with the term that things get "corrupted" when importing data. A more accurate description would be that not everything works as expected especially when using the Outlook Import wizard.&nbsp;In short - the
 Outlook import process follows its own set of rules and not everything can be imported. In addition, when importing data you create new items which results in a new creation date value, last modified value and breaks any links that may have been originally
 associated.</p>
<p>The first thing that&nbsp;other forum members will advise (and which I wholeheartedly agree with) is that importing infomation for the pure purpose of moving infomation from one Outlook contiguration to another is the wrong approach to use. You only need to open
 the PST files from O'2003 in&nbsp;O'2007. There are endless posts on this forunm with links describing the steps that should be followed. Two such links to get you started are:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue you describe regarding the FullName&nbsp;most likely has&nbsp;to do with the Outlook import wizard not following Outlook UI global settings for such things as FullName as FileAs. The rest of your response was far too broad to pinpoint the exact cause of
 a given issue (i.e. if categories were not imported - most likely cause of that problem has to do with how the info was imported in terms of mappings etc).</p>

            <p>Firstly you did not need to do any sort of export/import in moving Outlook data from one version to another. Why would you?</p>
<p>All you needed to do was to copy your pst file and open it in the new instance of Outlook.</p>
<p>If you still have access to the old Outlook pst file, then create a new Outlook Mail profile inn Outlook 2007 (Control Panel-Mail-Show Profiles-Add) and attach the old pst file to it.</p>

<h2>            Update Windows&#58; TP to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am thinking about installing Windows Technical Preview on my laptop. All my spare laptops and desktops all run it (But don't use it for much more then streaming and testing apps).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has Microsoft said anything about whether Windows: TP will be upgradable to Windows 10? Or will I have to do it as a clean install as I did from Windows 8.1 Beta to Windows 8.1?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

    <title>Beat this... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> silvester---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Beat this...</h2>
                    1) wc 9th October, send brand new N93 to Nokia Repair Centre. Phone crashes several times a day and fed up with waiting for software update.<br />
<br />
2) 20th October, take delivery of UPS package. Excitedly open package to discover it contains and empty Nokia box and delivery note.<br />
<br />
3) Telephone local police who tell me to report it to the carrier. Telephone UPS who log the call but tell me I need to claim via the sender, CRC Ltd (apparently it isn't Nokia who repair their own phones but CRC).<br />
<br />
4) 23rd October. Unable to raise CRC Ltd on the phone until today. Instructed to fax a photograph of the package to them. I noted the UPS package had a 17cm tear in it that had been sealed with clear tape. Fxed CRC without delay and was telephoned to be advised
 to keep packaging as UPS will want to collect it. UPS phoned to arrange to collect it from my workplace the next day.<br />
<br />
5) 24th October. I work without any breaks throughout the day so that I don't miss UPS. By 16.30hrs they still haven't been. I phone UPS head office who then e-mail the Exeter depot asking them to phone me. UPS Exeter telephonist phones to say one of the staff
 was off sick. When I asked why no one had even botherd phoning to tell me this earlier in the day, I was told 'because we didn't know'.<br />
<br />
6) 25th October. UPS collect packaging at about 13.00hrs after their Exeter depot telephonist had promised me yesterday that they would 'definately' be collecting before midday.<br />
<br />
7) 3rd November. Despite a few phone calls to CRC, I was still none the wise as to what was happening. I was assured I would be waiting only a few days for a 'new handset'. I telephoned and spoke to someone called 'Margaret'. I complained that every time I
 phoned CRC, I had to run through the entire story again. She said that it was 'just the way it is'. Thanks. She said she had to e-mail an office overseas but that she would definately phone me Monday morning (6th Nov) with an update.<br />
<br />
8) 6th November. 14.30hrs. Still no phone call. Telephoned CRC, was on hold (as usual) for a good 10-15 mins and then repeated the whole story again. Was told that Margaret 'was busy'. I explained that I was quite exasperated, paying £40 per month on an 18
 month contract and no phone to put my SIM card into. Guy at CRC said he was sorry but that 'Margaret didn't know that she was going to be busy'. Oh that's OK then...to make lie to a customer who's already been stolen from. Talk about sticking the knife in
 and twisting it.<br />
<br />
9) 6th November. 16.30hrs. Despite being told that Margaret at CRC would phone me, still no phone call. Another 15 mins or so on hold, listening to dull music and running up a bigger phone bill for nothing, I get through to Margaret. By this stage, I am angry
 but I never shout, certainly am not abusive but make no secret that I will not tolerate being lied to and being given false promises. Marget gets personal and says she takes exception to what I've said. I tell her that I sent my phone away in good faith and
 get an empty package back and no one is taking it seriously. I sent I think I needed to call the police as either CRC or UPS appear to have stolen from me. Margaret laughs and hangs up the phone. I phone back, tell Margaret I am going to make a formal complaint,
 that she had been no help and then hang up on her as she starts getting abusive again.<br />
<br />
10) 6th November. 19.00hrs. Write to Andrew Sheard, General Manager of CRC in Huntingdon to complain about Margaret and ask if there's anything he can do. Sent a copy of the letter to Mr Cameron Radford, MD of CRC and to Nokia UK Head Office in Huntingdon.
 Notice that I had received an e-mail from Nokia helpline following an earlier request for help telling me that the delay was because they were awaiting a handset that matched the original spec. Odd how they could update me whilst Margaret told me she was still
 waiting to hear from this mystery office overseas.<br />
<br />
11) 7th November. 9.15am. Nokia phone and say they are really sorry that I had been treated so badly. Yippee I thought, they are about to tell me a new handset is on the way. But alas, they offer me a silver handset which 'might be a reconditioned one'. I decline.
 Why would I want a secondhand handset when I sent a new one away for repair?<br />
<br />
I thought more about this. I paid £4.50 for Special Delivery when I sent my phone away. It covered the phone for up to £500 so would have covered replacement with a new handset in the event of loss. What cover did CRC arrange with UPS when returning the phone?
 Less than the retail value? Why? The same as the retail value? Why are they only offering me a reconditioned handset? Why doesn't their claim cover a brand new one?<br />
<br />
This whole thing stinks. I shall see if anyone at CRC or Nokia responds to my letters. If they don't, I'll escalate it to the Board at Nokia and copy BBC Watchdog and any other media who might be interested in. I don't want any compensation. All I want is a
 new handset to give me what I would have had if CRC/Nokia/UPS hadn't stolen my phone in the first place. It's funny how we're all made to think Nokia repair their own phones but then reminded that repairs are nothing to do with them when something goes wrong.
 How convenient.

            I had a problem like yours, with one 7710. I don´t know the kind of law of your region and what kind of consumer protection. On my case, the seller of the phone was, by law, responsible for the damaged thing he sell to me, and the shop (the seller) give
 me my money back. After that, is a problem between shop and retailer of Nokia products.

            I had a completely unhelpful e-mail today. It was only in response to one I had sent pleading to be treated fairly.<br />
<br />
The sender refused to pass my comments on, saying it had already been escalated. They said Nokia regarded the delays as 'unacceptable' yet the e-mail fails to give me any kind of deadline nor make any promises. In other words, the e-mail told me nothing of
 any value whatsoever.<br />
<br />
Oh...I forgot to mention. It did remind me that they are only obliged to send me a reconditioned handset if they wish. It's nice when a company accepts that one of it's customers has been treated badly and goes on to remind them of the terms and conditions
 they are obliged to accept.<br />
<br />
I'm afraid whilst the theft of my phone isn't Nokia's fault, I think it is a disgrace that they should hide behind their own buraucracy when things go wrong to deflect having to take any responsibility.<br />
<br />
Let me quote from one of their 'repair service' webpages...<br />
<br />
"Nokia Connecting People....<br />
<br />
If you wish to send your mobile phone to our Freepost address for repair..."<br />
<br />
How odd that suddenly, it's not OUR (Nokia's) fault when something goes wrong.<br />
<br />
They said that they aim to replace a handset 'like for like'. Well the handset that was lost or stolen was 3 weeks old. If they will send me a handset no older than 3 weeks, fine. Otherwise, it ain't like for like.<br />
<br />
I'm not going to accept secondhand good. Certainly not when the repair company will have claimed for the lost or stolen handset from the carriers, UPS. I insured the carriage of my phone to Nokia's repairers for £500. Assuming the handset was similarly insured
 on it's return leg, they can damn well pay for a new one. If they only supply secondhand, I'd like to know who at Nokia/the repairers pockets the difference.<br />
<br />
My next step...the Nokia Board at PO Box 226 in Finland...and the various consumer media here in the UK. I won't be treated like this by this digusting company.

            Oh..and be warned folks. If you too need a phone repaired, you better just hope and pray that Nokia and the various third parties they elect to deal with don't lose or steal your phone. Unless you like having to make dozens of phone calls, send faxes,
 e-mails and letters and you don't mind being completely ignored like you don't exist.

            Hi to all,<br />
<br />
Ok, I can fully understand your frustrations, but please note there is no one on this discussion board who can help with consumer issues. I can only suggest you keep in contact with the parties that are involved. A solution to your issue is not going to be
 found here. <br />
<br />
I hope a satisfactory solution is found, and soon.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
<br />

            I don't expect to find a solution here.<br />
<br />
I do think it's very important that others know of the way I've been treated.<br />
<br />
I realise Nokia would probably like to quietly treat people how they like without there being any consequence.<br />
<br />
It's often said that a many organisations in terms of their customer service appear outwardly very much the same. However, it's when things go wrong that a business has a real opportunity to shine or thoroughly screw things up.<br />
<br />
I'm afraid Nokia have thoroughly screwed up.<br />
<br />
I'm STILL waiting for a resolution. So far, every single time I've spoken to someone at Nokia or exchanged e-mails, they've been quick to tell me about what I am obliged to accept under the warranty or to tell me they can't do anything because they are waiting
 for a reply. That and telling me I must contact CRC or UPS. Why doesn't anyone take any responsibility for this? Let's not forget that someone somewhere (CRC?) has claimed for my lost or stolen handset. Well...what's the problem Nokia?

            Oh..and someone from CRC Head Office was rather disappointed to hear that Nokia was telling me to contact them or UPS all the time. They tell me Nokia tell them (CRC) that they must use UPS as a carrier. And of course Nokia talk about CRC as if they are
 part of Nokia.<br />
<br />
It's been weeks and weeks now.<br />
<br />
I JUST WANT A NEW PHONE<br />
<br />
Not some secondhand goods. I've already been told that had I been offered a new handset in the first place, I probably would have had it within days. Instead, Nokia and CRC have together kept me waiting weeks for a secondhand handset to turn up that they can
 fob me off with.<br />
<br />
I really don't know who else to contact now. I've written to Nokia Head Office. I've not even had an acknowledgement. I had a phone call from the CEO of CRC today. He was very pleasant but he can't get me a new N93. All he can do is look into why one of his
 staff was so ill-mannered. Do I write to the board of Nokia? I honestly think this company is just taking the mickey.

            Does anyone know the name and postal address of Nokia UK's most senior member of staff?<br />
<br />
I want to write to them about this and copy them into all the various correspondance I've had.<br />

I'm not prepared to wait any longer for my phone. It's been something like 4 weeks now.

<h2>            Factory Unlocked Lumia 925 4G Disabled</h2>
                    
<p>I was very excited to finally use LTE with my new Lumia 925 but found out that for some reason there is only an option for 2G or 3G.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The phone was purchased in the US as a GSM (UK) version (carrier version CV GBIE) and I live in Ontario. At the moment I have it on 3g and it's picking up H+.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've looked all over the internet and have found several possible solutions: some say it is because the global versions come with firmware that locks 4G/LTE and an eventual update will fix this in the future; some say it is because the frequencies of the
 this version do not match that of bell.</p>
<p>Although I mostly would be using and downloading via WIFI, it would still be great if I could use my phone to its' full potential!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If someone has a solution or answer to this, please let me know!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            It does matter because the network frequency of my version of Lumia is different then that of bell. This phone support the 1900 band for 4G whereas bell uses 1700

<p>It still does not matter. When the update is released, you will still only be able to use the LTE bands for the CV GB. Your phone will never be able to connect to the 1700 4G band regardless of updates. The hardware is incompatible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only 4G bands supported by your phone variant are&nbsp;<span>LTE band 1 (2100), 3 (1800), 7 (2600), 8 (900) &amp; 20 (800)</span></p>

<p>That is correct. The RM-892 is the Global variant as opposed to RM-893, which is the US variant. RM-892 only supports the following 4G bands&nbsp;<span>LTE band 1 (2100), 3 (1800), 7 (2600), 8 (900) &amp; 20 (800). This is a hardware constraint and cannot be changed

<h2>            I need help with an annoying Excel scroll bug</h2>
                    <p>Before anyone tells me this is by design,&nbsp; they better explain why this behavior was intentional or by design to act so counterintuitively&nbsp; compared to&nbsp; prior versions of Excel</p>
<p>
</p><p>This bug exists with freeze panes turned on ( in this case, locking the first 5 columns to the left and the top 6 rows at the top) so the scrollable range is from cell column F, row 7</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not a case of large cells.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The top row, has titles that are perpendicular to the viewer to keep column width narrow, so I am scrolling left to right inside the frozen row, going column by column to read the names horizontally .</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>While scrolling the mouse in the frozen row region left to right (moving&nbsp;from column to column heading) when the cursor gets to the end of the viewable range of the program display window, instead of&nbsp;moving&nbsp; the unfrozen pane view to&nbsp;include one more column
 in view (ie just moving the view one column over towards the left), instead it re-orients&nbsp; display&nbsp; at the top row (expecting no row changes while scrolling through columns, &nbsp;but moving everything over one column to the left, but instead it reorients the entire
 display to a new region with the origin row, yet keeping the column display scrolled properly.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>it is annoying to have row jump back to the origin every time I get to the end of the visible window&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously there is a refresh routine that is changing the display row in addition to inserting the new column</p>
<p>Please note that this bug occurs when the screen needs to refresh when scrolling columns either left or right.&nbsp; In each case, it jumps back to the first unfrozen row.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not due to the column text being displayed horizontally.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>It does not happen when the cursor is within the unfrozen region, but I need to&nbsp; be able to keep my cursor within the frozen pane section so I can read the value in the cell display field.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there&nbsp;a fix for this?&nbsp; I did not see anything related to this on the internet nor within the community.</p>

            <p>Hi&nbsp;pekyleca,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried replicating the same on my Excel 2013, but didn't come across the issue you raised.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I'm a little confused by your statement on scrolling left to right with the mouse. I'm thinking you mean scrolling with the keyboard arrow keys. Even the mouse that's got a scroll button only scroll up and down, not left to right. I might be wrong; I
 just find it a little above my head.</p>
<p>

            <p>yes, you are correct,&nbsp; brain is engaged, but not my fingers.&nbsp; scrolling with keyboard arrow keys.&nbsp; Its a spreadsheet created in 2003, ported over to 2013, so my next step was to recreate&nbsp; or resave as xlsx to see if that takes care of it,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no large data fields, however there are many columns and many rows, but the size of the frozen pane does not move, so I am puzzled as to why this subroutine keeps kicking in to refresh in a different region when I scroll to where I need a screen
 refresh.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Is it possible to export a report on Visio Pro and Project Pro licensing</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I require the ability to create and export a report that displays current license count and usage for Visio Pro and Project Pro.</p>
<p>Is this possible in Office 365?</p>
<p>I am able to create a new view which displays all users with either Visio Pro or Project Pro but this does not suit as I cannot export the list to my colleagues plus I really only require the total number of assigned users to analyse trends.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>hi benjaminsheargold,</p>
<p>you may refer to the following steps for a check:<br />
1. <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj151815.aspx#bkmk_installmodule" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
install windows azure ad module</a><br />
<br />
2. download and get the script from this blog:<br />
<a href="https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/export-a-licence-b200ca2a#content" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/export-a-licence-b200ca2a#content
</a><br />
<br />
3. run the command as below:<br />
&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6a365fef-2e25-45ac-a5c4-991fafabedc8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6a365fef-2e25-45ac-a5c4-991fafabedc8" /></a><br />

&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>note:</strong> ul is the folder which used to store the script file.<br />
<br />
4. after that, you will see the<strong> csv file</strong> in the folder you used to store script file to see the visio pro and project pro licensing status.<br />

</p><p>We understand how important this is for you. All Skype accounts have been migrated to Microsoft, and in this I just want to inform you that&nbsp;deleting the Skype account will&nbsp;also close the&nbsp;email address associated to it. If the accounts
 you want to delete are not completely link to your Microsoft account, your best option is to link each of the Skype&nbsp;account to a different Microsoft account so you will be able to delete it without affecting the Microsoft account you want to keep.</p>

<h2>            NVidia Geforce GT430 Windows 10 incompatible</h2>
                    <p>Using NVidia Geforce GT430 which appears to be Windows 10 incompatible . Tech support from Nvidia says that the graphics card hardware is not compatible and so no driver updates can be released to solve the issue. Are there a lot of incompatibility issues
 with graphics cards out there?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: After deleting Windows 10 and returning to 8.1, waited 1 week, retried the update and now it works fine. Also finally found the website for downloading the graphics update (it wasn't easy). Everything is great now&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-win_upgrade/graphics-card-not-compatible-with-windows-10/5e3fcc1a-9654-42ac-8bd8-28c3749f94eb?auth=1"><strong>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-win_upgrade/graphics-card-not-compatible-with-windows-10/5e3fcc1a-9654-42ac-8bd8-28c3749f94eb?auth=1</strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 2: </strong>If the issue persist, install the device drivers in
<strong>compatibility mode </strong>from the steps below, and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Compatibility mode runs the program using settings from a previous version of Windows.</span></p>
<p>

<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span> Right-click on the driver setup file, and click on
<strong>properties</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 3:</span></strong><span> Click on the <strong>compatibility</strong> tab, check the box
<strong>Run this program in compatibility mode </strong><span>for, </span>and select Windows&nbsp;10 operating system from the drop down menu. Proceed with the installation.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 4: Restart </span></strong><span>the computer once the installation is complete.</span></p>

            Hi SpringParks 
<br />
<br />My name is Sarah Kong and I am an independent adviser that is here to try and help you with your issue.
<br />
<br />What errors are you getting?
<br />Can you right click your start button and go to event viewer.
<br />Expand apps and service logs
<br />Expand Microsoft
<br />Expand Windows
<br />Expand Windows Defender
<br />Go to Operational then see if there are any error logs and let us know what they say.
<br />
<br />Also make sure you are NOT running any other antivirus or firewall program other than Defender.       
        </p>

<p>I am having the same problem with any antivirus programs.&nbsp; I went into the task managers, details, found folder, but had a drop down.&nbsp; Low and behold the program line was disabled.&nbsp; So while I had viruses like crazy that portion of the program was disabled
 giving the user from any alerts.</p>

<h2>            Incoming emails coming in Plain Text Format Instead of HTML</h2>
                    Lately many of my incoming emails are in Plain Text format instead of HTML, despite the fact that I am set up to receive in HTML.&nbsp; Some emails do come in HTML, but many are in Plain Text, with an endless string of URLs instead of pictures, etc.&nbsp; I have
 made no changes to my set up, and I am using the same anti virus software for a long time (AVG) with the problems happening only in the last month or so.&nbsp; Any ideas?

            AVG has gotten more disruptive of the incoming data stream.&nbsp; Uninstall it and reinstall it without the mail scaning plug-ins.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You need to click any email and primary icons (Reply, Delete, Archive, Junk, Sweep, Move to and Categories)&nbsp;will automatically appear to your mailbox. Click the "<strong>...</strong>" (three dots) symbol and you will see the Mark unread, Mark read,

<p>
</p><p><span><span>A quick question before we proceed.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>-Does this issue only occurs with Outlook?</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Run Outlook as administrator: Right click on Outlook and select<strong> Run as Administrator</strong>. If issue still persists let's try following methods and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If the issue still persist you may </span></span><span><span>start Outlook in Safe Mode following steps mentioned below and verify the result.<br />
<br />
* Hold <strong>Windows </strong>key + <strong>R</strong>.<br />
* Copy and paste, or type the following command in the Open box, and then press Enter<br />
<br />
<strong>Outlook /safe </strong><br />
<br />
Note: There is a space between Outlook and '/'<br />
<br />
If Outlook works as expected in Safe Mode, disable the add-ins by following steps mentioned below and determine the problem causing add-in.<br />
<br />
a) Click on File menu, click Options, <strong>Add</strong>-<strong>ins</strong>, Go button besides Manage:
<strong>Com-in Add.</strong><br />
b) Check if there are add-ins listed, clear the checkbox. <br />
c) Close the Office program and restart it. <br />
d) Disable each add-in one at a time, restart the Outlook, and repeat the above procedure. If the issue reappears again, it will help you to determine which add-in is causing this issue.</span></span></p>

<h2>            VBA Project - Prior modules Not cleared&#47;still in Memory</h2>
                    
<p>After opening and closing a workbook with macros, the macros/modules are not cleared from memory.&nbsp; Looking at the Editor Project Explorer, the modules of the closed workbook are still present and executable, including event macros that reside in the sheets
 of the closed book.</p>
<p>This is causing problems when individual subs or functions that have the same name.&nbsp; Often causing errors at run time.&nbsp; Changing the names of the subs in the closed book eliminates the run time problems.</p>
<p>Is there a method of flushing projects in closed workbooks short of closing the Excel application?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have noticed sometimes after a 20 or 30 second delay after the workbook is closed, the modules will clear, other times they remain indefinitely.</p>

            The only time I recall encoutering this kind of problem and reading about it was in the initial release of some version of Office (probably 2003 given your experience {grin}).&nbsp; Check if you have all the service packs installed and if not consider installing
 them.

<p>No, except to close the application and open it again.</p>
<p>But this behavior is not always the same, it depends on the computer and the application.</p>
<p>Did this behavior occure every time? Can you upload the file? I'm interested to have a look at it.</p>

<p>The problem happens on all our computers at the office - various vintages of Dell's (mine is a 3GHZ P4).&nbsp; Excel is up to date with SP3.&nbsp; I was unable to reproduce the problem on a Excel 2007/XP machine.</p>
<p>I can reproduce the problem even with empty workbooks. (no other apps running, fresh boot)&nbsp; Simply pull up the VBA Editor in a non maximized window so that the worksheet and the Editor are both visible (non overlapping is better for illustration, but not
 necessary).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open a new book (i.e. book2).&nbsp; Listed in the Project Explorer of my Editor is Solver(Solver.xla), VBAProject(Book1), VBAProject(Book2), VBAProject(Personal.xls), XPRESSeng(XPRESSEng.xla) [This is a Frontline custom engine for solver].&nbsp;</p>
<p>Close book2.&nbsp; VBAProject(Book2) with its sheets and Thisworkbook continue to be listed.</p>
<p>FYI- I just tried to add a module to the closed book2 and got an I/O error.&nbsp;&nbsp; But, if a subroutine is created normally, then the book closed,&nbsp; I can edit the sub, invoke context sensitive help, cause the compiler to issue syntax errors (i.e. ans = ) [then
 hit enter generating the compile error "expected expression"], etc.&nbsp; The behavior is essentially normal, as if the book was open.&nbsp; Sometimes it will persist indefinitely, other times after some delay (approx. 20-30 seconds) it will close.</p>

<p>First try to disable all addins, remove your personl.xls and try again. If the problem is solved, add the addins step by step and look when it came back.</p>
<p>If&nbsp;not, talk to your admin of the security settings of given rights.</p>
<p>IMHO this has nothing to do with excel or VBA...</p>

            <p>I've never seen the issue reported by Fred K. but I know that there is something in the background that can cause this.</p>
<p>I've seen (very rarely) that a VBA project is still in memory after the main file is closed and the only solution that I've found is to close the whole application and open it again.</p>
<p>What ever the reason is, I could never reproduce the situation after I've closed the application.</p>

            <p>I have seen this issue myself (Office 2007, Windows 7).&nbsp; In fact, sometimes in the VBE I will see multiple listings of the same VB Project, even though the file is closed.&nbsp; I have not tried to figure out why it is happening, or how I can "flush" those projects.&nbsp;
 I just ignore it as another MS bug that has a workaround.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you say, Andreas, quitting the application is the best way to get rid of the orphaned VB Projects.</p>

            This has always been the case for me.&nbsp; It's been happening for a decade, whether it's Excel 2003, 2007, or 2010.&nbsp; I can't beleive so many people haven't experienced this.&nbsp; I've never had a VBE project that DID go away until Excel was fully closed. As one
 user noted, I regularly get several instances of the same project so I have to be careful that I'm working with the one that is actually open in Excel.&nbsp; Please let us know if anyone has more info on this.

            <p>Yep, here it is late 2013, and I've gotten this all the time, as in DAILY,&nbsp;for years, with Excel 2003, 2007 and 2010 (haven't tried Word, Access, etc.).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The real solution I've found is to ream out your TEMP folder, and there's a great utility, WAY better than Disk Cleanup, which does just that.&nbsp; And Dell recommends it!&nbsp; It's call ATF-Cleaner -- as in All Temp Files -- and it's at
<a href="http://www.atribune.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.atribune.org/</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Close Excel, run ATF-Cleaner -- with admin privileges if possible -- and try again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, FYI there's Rob Bovey's Code Cleaner at <a href="http://www.appspro.com/Utilities/CodeCleaner.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.appspro.com/Utilities/CodeCleaner.htm</a>, a utility that removes all code objects and replaces them, sort of like compacting an Access database.&nbsp; It makes workbooks with macros not only smaller but more reliable; I use it every day.</p>

<p>It's not necessarily recommended. You had better make sure that the dimensions of the battery and the power ratings are identical.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even if they appear the same, a Nokia service point could refuse warranty service if the phone has a battery that isn't the manufacturer's recommended one.</p>

            Hello CMiiiitch
<br />
<br />Thanks for posting Microsoft Comunnity. I'm Marcos Independent Advisor.
<br />
<br />I suggest  you can open PowerPoint in compatibility mode and then disable the hardware hashing to verify that the application is working fine.
<br />
<br />&nbsp; Follow the next steps:
<br />
<br />Open Powerpoint in Safe Mode
<br />
<br />Press the Windows logo key and the R key on the keyboard.
<br />In the Run box, type this command for PowerPoint:
<br />Enter powerpoint / safe and click OK.
<br />
<br />
<br />Then with the App is open
<br />
<br />Click on the File tab&gt; Options&gt; click on the Advanced tab.
<br />
<br />On screen, select the Disable hardware graphics acceleration check box.
<br />
<br />Click on OK and verify the results.
<br />
<br />You can also update the drivers of your graphic card and screen and check if it helps.

<br />
<br />If that does not working then try to do Repair Office Online:
<br />
<br />Open Control Panel - Programs and Features 
<br />Click Microsoft Office in the list of installed applications 
<br />At the top, click 'Change' 
<br />On the resulting dialog, click 'Repair' - choose the online repair.
<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
I have a Sprint HTC Touch w/ WinMobile 6. I previously had problems syncing my phone w/ both XP and Vista laptops. but that was resolved. Sprint tech hard reset my phone since incoming calls and reminders would lock up my phone.&nbsp;I can sync my
 phone to the XP laptop (new doc file created since my phone has a new/diff device name), but WMDC would not sync when I connected it; only options I had were to change the connections or end partnership. Thought if I ended the partnership, the next time I
 connected via USB I'd be able to sync my phone, but that did not happen.&nbsp; Do I need to delete WMDC then reinstall, or am I missing a step here?&nbsp; Any suggestions?

    <title>Problem with running excel - need it to finish taxes - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problem with running excel - need it to finish taxes</h2>
                    <p>'ve purchased the 2016 Office, and it was working fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But now when trying to use Excel or Word, I keep getting the error message stating "We're sorry, Word (or Excel, depending on which one I've opened) has run into an error that is preventing it from working properly.</p>
<p>Word (or Excel) will need to be closed. Would you like us to repair it now?"</p>
<p>and it gives 3 options: repair/help/close.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No matter what I do next or which option I choose, the program closes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open it back up and the whole scenario repeats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated...</p>

            Try following one by one and see after every step whether it resolves the issue (The first option should close your issue) -
<br />
<br />1. Try repairing your office installation (Quick repair is good enough). Try repairing your Office installation. First try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start your application in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. 
<br />
<br />To start in Safe Mode -
<br />
<br />Hold CTRL key and click on application icon and don't release the CTRL key till it asks you for Safe mode confirmation.
<br />
<br />If yes, then start application normally and disable add-ins one by one and start application again every time you disable an add-in to determine the culprit add-in.
<br />To disable add-in &gt; File &gt; Options &gt; Add-ins &gt; Down below you have Manage: Com Add-in : Press Go &gt; Untick the Add-ins to disable and tick to enable them
<br />
<br />3. Login to Windows with a new user profile and see if problem is resolved.
<br />
<br />4. Sometimes, this is caused due to application not being able to access the default printer. Close all office applications and change your default printer through Start &gt; Devices and Printers to another printer. It may be some physical one or One Note or XPS or PDF or anything else. If this is the problem, then you will need to update your printer driver for default printer.
