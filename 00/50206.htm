<h2>            Do parental controls detect history on inprivate browsing&#63;</h2>
                    I sometimes use inprivate browsing on the internet, and i was wondering if the parental controls still pick up on the sites that i've been looking at.

<h3> karenkearney  say:</h3>
<h2>            printer&#47;scanner not connecting wireless</h2>
                    <p>I have HP Photosmart C4580 printer and HP Laptop running Windows 7.&nbsp; A few days ago the printer/scanner stopped working.&nbsp; Printer does print, just not from the computer.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I ran a Wireless Network Test Report and it's telling me that "HP printer cannot find access point" and printer SSID does not match access point.</p>
<p>I ran the wireless network setup and it cannot find my printer.</p>
<p>Is it possible that the usb port on my printer is broken?&nbsp; Would this cause this type of problem?</p>
<p>Please help.... and explain as if your talking to a 4yr old because i'm not computer savvy at all.</p>

<p>I&nbsp;want a wireless connection.&nbsp; But, don't i&nbsp;need the usb cable to achieve this?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>If i do then i'm screwed&nbsp;because i am sure the printer&nbsp;port is broken.</p>

<p>I have tried all the links you recommended (each about 10 times) before discovering the broken port.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Devesh,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. Let me help you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This issue might appear due to some corrupted system files. I suggest you to run SFC scan and check if it helps.</span></p>

<p>Hi there, the bad news is that .NET Framework is corrupted and you will have to reinstall it.</p>
<p>Use this as a guide:</p>
<p>When you try to install an update for the .NET Framework 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 3.0, or 3.5, you may receive Windows Update error code "0x643" or Windows Installer error code "1603"<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923100" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923100</a></p>
<p>When installing updates using Windows update or Microsoft Update you may receive Error 0x643 or 0x80070643<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/976982" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/976982</a></p>
<p>As for the cleanup tool, get it from here, use the 2nd link on the download page:<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/astebner/archive/2008/08/28/8904493.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/astebner/archive/2008/08/28/8904493.aspx</a><br />
namely: <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer-Components-PostAttachments/00-08-90-44-93/dotnetfx_5F00_cleanup_5F00_tool.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>When I had problems with .NET Framework and had to reinstall, used the cleanup tool to remove all Frameworks on my computer.</p>
<p>Using WU (Automatic) I then installed .NET Framework 3.5 and then went back for 1.1 and 1.1 SP. The let AU update those and if any optional ones went for them.</p>
<p>After all that, I even threw in .NET Framework 4.</p>
<p>It was boring and time consuming but now .NET Framework is up to date and working well.</p>
<p>As to why it became corrupted, who knows.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Does Not Download</h2>
                    I upgrade my Windows 7 Dell XPS to Windows 8 using a DVD. No problems. I was using a Windows 8 Pro from my company. I was then told I could not upgrade to Windows 8.1 without first paying $199 for a new license. Ok. Done. When I went to the Store, 8.1
 upgrade is available. When I click on Upgrade, it takes me to the Download and says DOWNLOADING.&nbsp;But it does not download. I did an upgrade on another machine I have to 8.1 and it went perfect.&nbsp; I have looked over the help content here and tried some things
 like use SFC to see if anything needs to be repaired - and I get the error message from the command prompt that&nbsp;I need an administrator console!! If I can't get this to run, I am ready to wipe it clean and go back to WIndows 7 and then spend probably weeks
 trying to get a refund back on a product that does not work.

    <title>setup.exe doesn&#39;t open - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> arun suthar  say:</h3>
<h2>            setup.exe doesn&#39;t open</h2>
                    I have windows 8.1. I am trying to install Ansys. Whenever I run the setup.exe application, the system asks me the permission and then does nothing, but other .exe files run properly. The same setup.exe runs on other system with same configurations but
 not on my system. This problem did not occur when I just bought the laptop, but after some months when I tried again installing Ansys, it is not working. Then I tried some solutions provided on the internet by copying some data in notepad and saving as Exe.reg
 and doing something in cmd etc, etc.. but could not find appropriate solution. Please help me out of this situation.

<p><span>a. Press <strong>windows key + R </strong>and type "<strong>services.msc</strong>" in the run box and press enter.</span></p>

            I am sorry to say that the above mentioned solutions did not work. One thing I saw was, in order to perform clean boot when I disable all non microsoft services in the system configuration box, the services of the antivirus don't get disabled. I have Mcafee
 antivirus. Does this antivirus hinders in running the setup.exe application?

            <p>Hi Arun,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, you are right that if some security software is running then that might restrict the setup.exe to run. So, try to
<strong>disable security software temporarily</strong> and then try to run the setup.exe and see if it helps you to run it successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">:&nbsp;<em><span>Antivirus
 software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done.
 If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Do keep us updated.</p>

            <p>My experience in helping tens of thousands of consumers in Windows forums since Windows 7 release is that if McAfee is installed the OS is pretty much ruined.&nbsp;

<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Hey guys, I'm looking for some clarification on the party chat. I play with a few mates(Usually cod) and we're struggling to even get a party together to play in the same lobby/match!! We invite to party.... The person
 that has sent the invite has party chat turned on but no one else is allowed to... IE when you try to turn party chat on it says its not allowed on try again later or something to that effect. We have to search for matches then try join his game, Last night
 we resorted to a skype call to chat! </span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Thanks guys. Peace</span></strong></p>

<p>Edit: How did I literally miss the last line? FACEPALM</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you and your friends are having issues with party chat might I advise you to use Skype? You can be in a group Skype call with your friends while playing the same or different games (Skype does not need to be snapped, it will work in the background). That
 way you don't have to worry about different NAT types or fear of party chat randomly turning itself off.</p>

<p>I am not really sure what Microsoft have done to the party chat and game invite system but it is a bit of a mess.<br />
<br />
I was in a party with the 3 other friends the other night, 2 of which were playing Dead Rising 3 together, they had some issues and one of them got booted out but in order to be able to invite each other to play DR3 again they had to leave our party and form
 a new one with just the two of them. <br />
<br />
Same happened when my friend tried to invite me to play Halo: Spartan Assault, he was told he had to create a party with just two of us before he could invite anyone to play.
<br />
<br />
Not sure how Microsoft can take a system that worked so well on the 360 and make such a mess of it. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Second activation of Windows 7 after formatting hard disk</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>I have recently installed Windows 7 on my desktop PC and activated it. &nbsp;However, due to display problems (happened due to lightening), the computer technician who supplied the Windows 7 suggested reformatting the hard disk and I agreed. &nbsp;After formatting,
 Windows 7 was installed from the same original disk. &nbsp;I am not able to activate it now even after providing the correct product id. &nbsp;The message suggests that I should buy a new licence!
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Another curious aspect: &nbsp;I tried a activation a day before, which asked me to download a software (from Microsoft of course). &nbsp;I followed the instructions and after many screens, I thought I found 'activation successful'. &nbsp;However, booting my PC
 this morning, I find that I have 0 days for activation and chose the 'activate now' option with the same result (after providing the correct product id).</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Adding to my&nbsp;surprise, after rebooting the PC, it now says "27 days to activate. Activate Windows now".</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Would someone please guide me how to actually activate my Windows 7 now? &nbsp;(Incidentally, I had also installed MS Office 2007 prior to the reformatting and activated it. &nbsp;After reformatting, Office was installed again
 from the same disk and I had no problems activating the Office...)&nbsp;</span></strong></p>

<h2>            Reluctant Return of Surface Book</h2>
                    <p>A sad day for me today… I’ve just ended a turbulent relationship with my Surface Book and returned it to Microsoft for a refund. A big part of me really loved this beautiful machine and I’ve spent literally days and days troubleshooting/experimenting/testing,
 trying to get it to work well for me, but it’s just been too unreliable and unpredictable to use as my everyday work computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My job as a home technology specialist requires me to have a machine that wakes and sleeps quickly and reliably as I move around the house commissioning and programming various elements of a system. The Surface Book has been nothing but disastrous for this
 purpose for the well-documented reasons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The tablet mode was a bonus feature that I thought would be great for presenting to clients, meeting notes, marking up floorplans and schematic drawings, evening sofa web browsing, etc. The reality has been that I’ve barely used it for any of these activities
 because seemingly every time I go to use it, something doesn’t work. Either the screen won’t detach, or it’s ran out of batteries due to ‘hot bagging’, or I get a BSOD, or the pen won’t work, or some other random issue. I’ve had a couple of particularly embarrassing
 meetings in which the most technically able guy around the table (me) was unable to get his laptop working and resorted to pulling out a paper notepad. Not ideal when my soul purpose of being at the meeting was to be the technical advisor to the client (luckily
 in both cases I’d known the client for a long time and we laughed it off!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I’m on my second machine as I had to return the first one due to a faulty power connector on the keyboard part. One of the pins bent inside the machine when I connected the charger once. I’m very careful with my machine and carry the Surface Book in its
 own custom made bag, within another specialist laptop rucksack, so it absolutely wasn’t through misuse – the design just looks poor to me, it’s very easy to catch the edge of the pin as you insert the charger into the slot. (pic attached below)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to say that my second machine (whilst it hasn’t been without it’s issues) has been 10x more reliable that the first. I did notice that the replacement unit has a much later serial number, I’m not sure if that might be anything to do with the vastly
 improved reliability. Anyway, I was really starting to trust it again and enjoy using it… until yesterday morning when the same thing happened with the charging connector and that was the final straw for me. I’ve already spent 2 days installing files, software,
 email, etc on two machines and I just don’t have the time to play the Surface Book lottery again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I’m either going to go back to my old 13” Retina Macbook Pro while I wait for the Skylake MBP, or I’m going to buy a Dell XPS 13. (in case you’re wondering, there’s nothing wrong with a 13” Retina Macbook Pro, I just have a member of staff that could use
 a hand-me-down laptop upgrade!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I purchased this Microsoft laptop, I’d owned 3 Apple Macbook’s in a row (running Boot Camp, I never booted into OSX). The irony that my Apple laptops were infinitely more robust and reliable to use as Windows laptops than the Microsoft laptop I’m
 about to return would normally be hilarious to me… if I wasn’t so sad to see my Surface Book go back in its box.</p>

            <p>Sorry for your trouble but i think the problem is how you need to use the windows laptop. I've been using windows computers at a techology consultant and IT Director for more than 20 years and there's one thing windows has never, ever gotten to work correctly.
 Its hibernation/Sleep. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have owned at least a hundred different windows laptops. Not one of them ever worked consistently with a sleep/wake cycle. not one. No dell, no surface pro 1, 2 or 3, no alienware, no HP, No compaq, no asus. Its just bad software from MS.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just picked up a surface book 17/256/dgpu the other day. I'm using it now. I do see the glitches so far. the DTX app is worthless. but the button always works. maybe ms will fix. however every surface i've used has been half baked in some way. I think
 these all have been prematurely released. Its only hurting MS in the long run because folks have experiences like you are having will never give ms a chance again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I learned a long time ago to set my laptop to shut off when i hit the power or close the lid. That avoids the sleep/hibernate/wake issue completely and it's not something i really need to rely on so its a defacto fix for me.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>On another note, I have been using macbooks as well for the last 3 years and they all, every single one worked perfectly when sleeping/waking. maybe its because Apple controls the hardware and software or maybe its because they typically release more mature
 products. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd go back to a mac if i were you. I love my 12'retina mb. </p>

            Also my experience.&nbsp;&nbsp; For the machine vendors I've worked with primarily over the past 20 years, Dell and HP, Microsoft OS has never handled sleep/hibernate well.&nbsp; Sad but true.&nbsp; So I always just completely shutdown.&nbsp; Startup on machines with solid state
 drives is quick enough that sleep mode doesn't seem necessary but, it would be nice if I could wake the machine and have all my apps open and stable.&nbsp; Maybe someday.&nbsp; Still waiting after all this time.&nbsp; For my Mac Book, I don't recall sleep mode ever being
 a problem. <br />

            <p>My experience has been quite different. I have been a long time Thinkpad user having had pretty much every other generations over the last 20 years. I can't recall any issues with sleep or hibernation. There may have been some but nothing that stands out
 in my memory. I also can't recall ever having significant problems with the Thinkpad's docking stations. I clicked it in and the external monitors came on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft's issues with their own machine and their own OS are just astounding to me.</p>

            <p>Not to make this a rant about satya n. but MS has changed in its view of its customers and their rights since satya took over.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS no longer respects my choices. They force their choices about how the os should work. Often overriding preferences chosen by me, their customer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS no longer respects my privacy. w10 is prematurely released spyware masquerading as an OS. They lie, cheat and claim oops to get w10 installed on as many computers as possible because, i read on a number of tech news sites,&nbsp; it will allow MS to auto load
 our docs into their cloud drive so they can scour them for info they can profit from. w10 has a keylogger? really? why MS? And the telemetry deal. WHy cant i turn that off completely?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do realize that MS is granting me a license to the OS. That i don't own it. However I did pay for something. That something is an RTU. Right to Use and because i paid for it at some level, whether 8.1 that got upgraded or otherwise paid for it, it comes
 with an expectation of privacy. Its not freeware. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally i'm an MCSE. I've made my living using MS corporate products but that doesnt make me an apologist for MS and their new way of thinking.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I voted with my checkbook. Every pc in my house will not be upgraded to w10 and every one that's used for more than gaming has been replaced with a Mac. I've taken the effort to retrain my wife and kids on Mac.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>to sum it up TimCook/Apple = Good for my privacy, Satya N/MS= bad for my privacy.

<p>
</p><p>This has been my experience as well. It sounded so promising, and after a positive experience with my Surface Pro 3, I thought the Surface Book would be great (GPU!). I wish I had returned it before the 30 days were up, but I foolishly believed MS would
 fix the issues. For me it has only gotten worse with each update, as well. MS has been far too silent since the 2/17 update, which suggests to me that they aren't interested in solving the problems of early adopters beyond that update, but only in getting
 good press from reviewers who are strangely, just now (for the most part) writing full reviews of the Surface Book. And go figure, those reviews are mostly glowingly positive, despite many owners still being utterly frustrated by issues (and being instructed
 repeatedly to reset/refresh windows or worse, load from a recovery image on USB).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a long time Windows/Microsoft/PC person with a lot of technical knowledge and experience, and this machine is just a nightmare in a gorgeous package.

            Up until the last update I wasn't using sleep or hibernate either because it just didn't work. &nbsp;But after the last update sleep/hibernate is working and I'm using it with no problems. &nbsp;When it works it really is quite nice to have. My Surface Book is working
 reliably for me and I have no issues.

<p>I know I sound really pessimistic, but I really do hope that MS manages to find and fix all of the bugs with the Surface Book. At this point, I have to hope for the best, as my money's been spent and I cannot return it -- but I've given up totally relying
 on the SB for work. It's a fun toy for me now, which is so sad (and kind of feels really wrong, but what can I do? BSODs, graphics driver issues, wake from sleep issues, unexpected shutdowns while sleeping, etc, etc. just prevent me from feeling like I can
 trust it). I actually built a new desktop machine using a new Intel skylake CPU, loaded Windows 10 and the stability difference between this new machine and the SB is night and day.&nbsp; Using hibernation on the SB for me, results in the best compromise for stability
 and usefulness overall, though it also results in my loss of use of Windows Hello because the camera does not turn on after charging while in hibernation. That's been the story with the SB for me -- something gets fixed, but I lose something else in the process.
 "Always compromising" should be the slogan for it, as it feels like an endless string of compromises with each "fix". I'm quitting the SB for good when I have to stand on my head and bark like a dog just to get it to do something, though ... =P</p>

</p>
<p>Why some people are having such trouble is very strange.</p>
<p>I concur that there seems to be problems with 'Hello' after Hibernating (after the latest updates).....my solution.....don't use it. (not a problem for me to use PIN or password, like I've been doing for the past 30 years or so).</p>
<p>I'll wait for the next series of updates to see if it gets fixed.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 Freezes Soon After Boot &#47; Colored Blocks Fill Screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mysteriork  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Freezes Soon After Boot &#47; Colored Blocks Fill Screen</h2>
                    
<p>I recently got a brand new Lenovo laptop and it was working smoothly for a couple of weeks.&nbsp; Recently, it will just freeze soon after start up or after coming back from sleep.&nbsp; Sometimes "colored blocks" will fill the screen completely and then it will go
 black.&nbsp; Other times it will just go directly black and I am forced to restart.&nbsp; I initially thought it was an issue with a recent Windows Update so I did a system restore and then tried to reinstall all of the updates, but to no avail.&nbsp; Sometimes it will last
 30 minutes or so without freezing, but other times it only takes a couple of minutes.</p>
<p>Any help would be much appreciated!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Since its a new laptop you should get Lenovo and the seller involved for a replacement or warranty<br />
claim/repair. This sounds very much like a video hardware issue that is not 100%. The more you do<br />
to fix it the faster they will claim it is something you have done.<br />
<br />
One quick check would be to revert the operating system to factory fresh to see if that has the same<br />
issues.<br />

To see all that is loading bootup - wait a few minutes without doing anything - then Right Click<br />
TaskBar - Task Manager - take a look at Appplications - Processes - Services - this is a quick<br />

<br />
===========================================<br />
<br />
<strong>Consider this an absolute must - manually updating your drivers.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above<br />
is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html</span></a><br />
<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

<br />
Refer to these threads for many more excellent tips however be sure to check your antivirus<br />
programs, update major drivers and BIOS, and also troubleshoot with the cleanboot method<br />
first.<br />

            <p>I have the same issue and have tried the above steps. &nbsp;Issue is not solved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It started with the CryptoWall virus. &nbsp;Using Malwarebytes, TDSSKiller and Security Essentials I was able to find and delete most of the stuff causing problems with minimal loss to the virus (some mp3's and a few pdf's).</p>
<p>
</p><p>However there is still something remaining that no program I have tried, including all the steps in post #2, have resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found the following:</p>
<p>- For some reason dllhost.exe will start.</p>
<p>- Shortly thereafter a second instance of dllhost.exe will start. &nbsp;If I stop the processes at this time, I will find that my Internet Explorer Security settings are now "Custom" instead of "Default". &nbsp;If I don't kill the processes, then another instance
 will start.</p>
<p>- If I allow a 3rd instance to of dllhost.exe to start, it creates an empty randomly named folder in&nbsp;C:\Users\jpbearcat\AppData\Local\Temp.</p>
<p>- From that point forward, if the process are not stopped, new instances will open until all memory is consumed. &nbsp;Each new instance will create another random folder as above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Eventually, after killing dllhost.exe numerous times, for some unknown reason it will stop trying to load .... until it decides to come back, maybe hours later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It always comes back after a reboot. </p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I find the file/program that is launching dllhost.exe in the first place? &nbsp;How can I clean once and for all the remnants that are causing this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>TIA</p>

<h2>            Unable to login to Windows 10 after the upgrade&#59; Error&#58; Password incorrect</h2>
                    <p>*Original Title: Windows 10 password</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi, I got a new Dell laptop. It came with Windows 7 professional. I powered it on and typed in my username and password for the PC. I wasn't aware of making a password reset disk cos I know my password. So I went and upgraded to Windows 10. It downloaded
 and checked for updates and installed and everything. Now when I try typing in my password at the beginning where it shows my username, it says password incorrect. Is there any way to reset my password or something? I can't even get into Windows&nbsp;</p>

            Is this a local user or are you using a MS account. Windows 7 only have a local account so is the user name the same as it was in Windows 7.

            One other thing would be is the CAPS lock on. Is the keyboard wired or wireless, are you able to try the onscreen keyboard. Do you use any unusual characters in your password.?

            The keyboard is attached to the laptop and no I don't use any unusual characters in my password. Maybe I could be typing the password in incorrectly or worst thing I entered the password in the first place incorrectly and now when I am typing in the password
 correctly, it's saying wrong password. Is there any way to reset the password if it must come to that?

            When I upgraded from 7 to 10 windows automatically changed my windows password from the computer to the password of my live account. Very annoying. Maybe try your live account / hotmail whatever password in case you used the windows mail.

            Thanks, I'll try my gmail account password. I downloaded Google chrome on Windows 7 before I upgraded to 10. So it synced with my gmail account. So maybe Windows changed my username password to my gmail password&nbsp;

            My issue has been resolved, thank you for the assistance. It turned out that somehow Windows used my gmail password as my login password, I don't know how that is possible but that was the password I used to login. I immediately changed it on Windows 10
 and now normal parity has been restored lol

<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the delayed response and glad to hear that you were able to fix the issue. We appreciate your efforts on this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The possible reason could be if you had used/converted&nbsp;the Gmail account into Microsoft account. The computer had already been in Microsoft account mode after Windows 10 upgrade. Using its password had solved the issue.</p>
<p>

            <p>I have this problem too. &nbsp;Here, I copy text I've already placed, elsewhere:</p>
<p>&nbsp; "Now the problem is happening to me, too. &nbsp;I was apparently forced to upgrade from Windows 7 to 10, on ajn HP laptop. &nbsp;For a few days, the thing SEEMED to boot. &nbsp;Today, &nbsp;now, it FIRST shows a screen with a beach, and when my mouse wheel brings down the
 other screen, I see my name, "Jim Bell", in large letters, as well as my direct email address in smaller letters below. &nbsp;A box appears below that, saying "Password". &nbsp;Problem is, I don't have a password, &nbsp;I've never had a password. &nbsp;So, I don't type anything,
 except hitting the "Enter" key. &nbsp;"Please enter your sign-in information and try again". &nbsp;But I have no "sign-in information" to provide. &nbsp;Thus, I cannot log in. &nbsp;I cannot use that computer. &nbsp;The only reason I can access this is that I have a SECOND computer
 that isn't YET screwed up. &nbsp;As far as I can tell, I am completely locked out of my computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is OBVIOUSLY a major problem with Microsoft and Windows 10. &nbsp;Many other people have the same problem. &nbsp;When I see other questions which seem to be related to the same problem, I often see the answerer suggesting that people do things, things that I
 cannot possibly do, in large part because I simply CANNOT log on to my computer. &nbsp;I cannot EVEN BEGIN to solve the problem, because your brain-dead software DOES NOT ALLOW ME to do so.</p>
<p>Please note: &nbsp;I did NOT "forget" my password(s). &nbsp;I NEVER HAD such passwords, period. &nbsp;It is clear from other questions here that this very serious bug doesn't occur simply because somebody "forgot" their password, but because there is a problem inherent
 with Windows 10. &nbsp;It clearly wasn't debugged well. &nbsp;I was happy with Windows 7. &nbsp;I could tell that many or most people hated Windows 8. &nbsp;SO I was smart and never tried Windows 8. &nbsp;Little did I know that Windows 10 would be the disaster that it has become.</p>

<h2>            Blank Screen on Surface Pro</h2>
                    <p>When I open the Surface and push the start button, the word Surface appears on the screen and then it goes black. &nbsp;I cannot get it to go to the page where I can log in. &nbsp;The screen is just black.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happened suddenly. &nbsp;</p>
<p>

    <title>Windows 10 Upgrade and Registry - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> etechmaster  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Upgrade and Registry</h2>
                    Anyone know if registry problems will affect upgrade performance? I was informed that these registry cleaners are more harmful than good and from past experiences ring true. And they don't guarantee that your programs being affected by it will work again
 after. Is there a program from MS that I can utilize for this?

<p>You are absolutely right: registry cleaners do far more harm than good.&nbsp; The registry is just a simple database of reference. For example, in your registry you'll find something like this example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>WallpaperPicture&nbsp;= "C:\Users\Shawn\Pictures\Motorcycle.jpg"</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you see, it's just a reference that specifies which picture file I want to use as my wallpaper.&nbsp; There is no "cleaning" that needs to be done to the registry.&nbsp; Even if there were extra entries, it doesn't matter unless some other program looks up and
 asks for that entry.&nbsp; It's much like the reference desk at the library.&nbsp; Just because they have extra copies of the encyclopedia set, doesn't make them any slower.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's no blanket "registry repair" that ever needs to happen.</p>
