<h2>            First name change, being charged &#36;10.</h2>
                    <p>I got a new Xbox, I set my account up with no issue and renamed myself just fine.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>My girlfriend wanted an account, but she can't rename herself at all because it tells her she needs to pay to change it. She hasn't changed it before. So she's stuck with the random TerrificHarp670, which is an awful name... I just put $500 into a new Xbox, and then she can't even name herself?&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>

<h2>            &#38;quot&#59;Some content is currently unavailable&#38;quot&#59;</h2>
                    
<p>Okay, so this is sort of a multi step problem. &nbsp;It all started when I turned on my Xbox 3 days ago and it decided to give me the message "some content is currently unavailable" and give me error code "80072EE2". &nbsp;Well I searched that in Google and came to
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live/marketplace-and-purchasing/download-xbox-live-content#1aab6b1c58ac4efa829d9e927328e8fb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this</a>&nbsp;page, which I found odd, since the code seems to apply when you are unable to download something, not opening the dashboard. &nbsp;I figured that it may just be a temporary problem, so I just turned it off for the night and hoped it would resolve itself
 in the morning, since Xbox 360s are notoriously inconsistent. &nbsp;Unfortunately this didn't work, so I did a little more research. &nbsp;I ended up opening the suggested ports for Xbox on my router, which didn't work either. &nbsp;Another solution I found was to set the
 default gateway on my computer as the primary DNS server on my Xbox. &nbsp;This didn't work either. &nbsp;The thing is, after trying one of these solutions (I don't remember which) I got a stream of three different error codes "8007274c-00b96084-1ed9e66e". &nbsp;I decided
 to search them and see if they had more helpful solutions. &nbsp;After searching for&nbsp;00b96084, I came across this<a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/9/p/177533/983166.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> thread</a>, and tried the suggestions,
 mainly re-downloading my Xbox live profile. &nbsp;While trying to download my profile, a message popped up saying that "profiles can not be downloaded at this time" and it kicked me out of the process. &nbsp;Since attempting this deletes the current version of the account
 stored on my hard drive, I'm left with an Xbox that doesn't have, and is unable to download my Xbox live profile. &nbsp;I also tried to re-download the latest system update, but big surprise, I get "Can't download the update". &nbsp;and "status code: 3CD6-0000-3080-0300-8007-274C"
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>Before this problem happened I had open NAT, a DMZ set up, and UPnP enabled. &nbsp;I still have the DMZ and UPnP, but I don't have any way of knowing if the Xbox registers the NAT as open because whenever I try to test my connection it tells me to install the
 latest update which it refuses to download. &nbsp;This problem is unique to this Xbox - all the other devices on my network are working perfectly and at normal speeds. &nbsp;As far as I'm aware there was no setting that was changed that could have brought on this issue.</p>
<p>I'm basically left with an Xbox that is incapable of doing anything involving the internet, which since I've been primarily using it to watch Netflix on my TV, isn't much.</p>

<p>Yes, I tried that, but all that happened was it said "extracting files" and then closed the window. &nbsp;Now whenever I turn on the console and try to download my profile it just reads "a system update is required to sign into Xbox LIVE, but the update is currently
 unavailable." &nbsp;with no error or status codes.</p>
<p>Keep in mind if I am ever able to get this update installed and sign into my profile that may not solve the unavailable content issue.</p>

<p>Well, it fixed itself. &nbsp;Seems that's the only thing that ever happens in weird cases like this. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I am rather disappointed in the poor quality of the support staff on these forums, however. &nbsp;The suggestion I got was something that I had already tried, and when I said that they refused to respond at all. &nbsp;Quite useless.</p>

<h2>            Perfect Dark Zero not launching</h2>
                    
<p>I have just purchased the Rare Replay digital download bundle and installed the content however I cannot get Perfect Dark Zero to start, the console simply asks me to insert a disc which I obviously do no have because it is a digital download. What is the
 issue here? Surely I have the license to play the game I just bought!?</p>

<p>Further to this I have now discovered the original Perfect Dark, which I also own on download, will not run and gives the same error code of 0x87de07d1. I have looked into this code and this is apparently to do with the games being region locked. Is this
 the case? If so I believe the bundle was falsely advertised. I bought the pack because I wanted to play the games again and now find I cannot play the content....</p>

<p>Hey there. I would first try a full reboot. Go into Settings, Power, Restart console and try it again after it restarts. If that doesn't work, from Power, go to Turn console off and when it shuts down, unplug the power cord from the back for 5 minutes and
 then try again.</p>

    <title>what is the Cortana live tile SUPPOSED to show &#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            what is the Cortana live tile SUPPOSED to show &#63;</h2>
                    <p>1703 - 15063.632 with all available updates applied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently reinstalled windows 10 home on my laptop. (From the recovery partition that came with my laptop.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything seems to work fine except for some of the live tile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specifically ....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cortana</p>
<p>Store</p>
<p>emails</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I do see with the Cortana tile, is a headline, that really never changes.<br />
</p>
<p>I had expected things to change on the live tile, but nothing does.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I click on the Cortana live tile, it opens Cortana and shows me what is titled "Top News".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regards to the Cortana live tile.</p>
<p>Is that all there is ?</p>
<p>It's okay if it is.</p>
<p>I would just like to know that the live tile is working as it should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to "test" what should appear on the live tile ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not a bog Cortana user and I am unable to find documentation about how the Cortana live tile should work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>

    <title>Remove refunded games from Microsoft Store account - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Remove refunded games from Microsoft Store account</h2>
                    <p>Monday I accidentally bought Minecraft windows 10 edition, not realizing buying the Java edition gives a free code so you can own both editions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I refunded Minecraft windows 10 edition on Monday, the bank processed my refund and the money is in my bank account.&nbsp; However, Microsoft store still shows I own Minecraft, which means my code to get the windows 10 edition is not working because the store
 mistakenly believes I own the game, when I in fact do not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did some research and found that others have the issue of refunded games remaining in the library and it persists for months, which is too long.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got my money back, so please remove the game from my store library so I can use the Java edition code to unlock windows 10 edition.</p>
<p><br />

<p>I must not be communicating correctly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not need to reinstall the Microsoft store, I need the store to reflect that I do not own Minecraft.&nbsp; It is not a software or hardware issue, it is a network or record-keeping issue.&nbsp; Despite my game being refunded, the store still shows a record of
 me owning the game.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>My store account information is incorrect, because it tells me I own a game that I do not own.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, my issue has nothing to do with the Xbox App, I have never even used it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did what you said, here is the error that resulted:</p>

<h2>            COA product key has rubbed off - what do I do&#63;</h2>
                    I just had to buy a new hard drive for my Lenovo laptop, as my old one crashed. When installing Windows on my new drive, I had to use the OEM key to install windows as the COA product key underneath my laptop has partially rubbed off. Windows activation
 is saying that I can't use this key to activate my product. It also won't give me a phone number to call and activate by phone.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Do you have access to the restore discs? If so, those restore discs install the key and will be pre-activated. However, if this machine is OEM, since you replaced the HDD it may not work. If that's the case, you'll need to contact your manufacturer.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />
Patrick<br />

<p>Option 1:</p>
<p>If the COA sticker is damaged, then you would need to use the recovery partition to reinstall Windows 7, this will exempt the need to use the product key to activate your Windows 7 installation.</p>
<p>Option 2:</p>
<p>If your recovery partition is not available or damaged, you should contact the manufacturer of your computer and request a recovery disc set you can use to reinstall Windows 7. They might charge a small shipping and handling fee. This will exempt the need
 to use the product key also.</p>
<p>Option 3:</p>
<p>If the neither options 1 or 2 is possible, then you need to invest in a new retail full version license.</p>

            I've seen your replies on multiple similar questions, thanks for all your help! I think you missed my question though - I can make a restore disc, but I'm wondering if they will work if I'm not using the same hardware anymore, as I've now replaced my hard
 drive.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Of course to make a restore disc I'll have to swap out my old hard drive again, and try to bang it enough to get the reader head to hopefully work so I can start it up and burn the DVDs. Not sure if it's worth going through all that hassle and then reformatting
 my laptop again onyl to find out the key won't work because the hardware is different now.&nbsp;

    <title>I accidentally download the Windows 7 SP1 Debug&#47;Check Build - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jmrtlara  say:</h3>
<h2>            I accidentally download the Windows 7 SP1 Debug&#47;Check Build version</h2>
                    I downloaded from my school's MSDN.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I figured out that I was downloading the debug/check build version, it was already added in my cart. The problem is -- I can't install it on a new laptop. For unknown reasons. It gives me a blue screen. Nor do I wish to run my laptop even slower than
 it already is by using this developer OS. It's my fault for not reading properly.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've already contact MSDN support if they could find a way to let me download the normal version by revoking my license from the debug/check build version. But I don't feel optimistic since they've never really responded to any of my tickets. I really
 hope they do now. I purchased this new laptop for school works, but it appears I can't even use it because I can't install a new OS. Sadly.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please help. Thanks in advance!</div>

            Start your PC then just as Windows loads - press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a shut down. Do it 3 times. You may only need to do it twice, but on the third start Windows will boot into the recovery environment.
<br />
<br />You can also hold shift &gt; press restart in the start menu to do the same
<br />
<br />1:
<br />go to Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Option &gt; System Restore
<br />You can check to see if you have a restore point here where you can go back to before the issue started.
<br />
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work, you can go into restore settings by typing "Create a restore point" in search and clicking the top result. After clicking this result, click "restore..." and start the restore.

            Hi Charles
<br />
<br />Restoring Windows will not bring your files back, it is a waste of you time . .. 
<br />
<br />System Restore will just repair Windows and replace corrupt Windows Files and Registry Entries, that is all it does . . .
<br />
<br />Please explain more about the file(s) you have lost, what application you were working in, whether you save to your PC or OneDrive and if you saved that document before closing it . . .       
        </p>

    <title>Xbox Power Supply - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> arnyftw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Power Supply</h2>
                    
<p>Hey guys, I think my power supply's messed up. Yesterday I was playing some games and my console just turned off and I noticed that the power supply light was red, I reconnected and restarted, it worked and then went red again after 5 mins. I then went through
 all the steps here, nothing worked, it turned on for a couple of minutes and then went red. I also noticed that whenever I plug it into the original plug point it always starts off red while on the others it starts out orange. Is the problem my power or my
 power cable? I've always had problems with it because I bought my xbox in the uk and I live in the EU now so I have to use an adapter. Do I have to replace my power supply, or is my adapter messed up, or is it my console?</p>

<p><strong>Hello There,</strong></p>
<p><strong>The external power supply has detected a fault. The power supply has several built-in safeguards to help prevent damage to either the console or to the power supply itself. The power supply will turn itself off under the following conditions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>When there is too much current</strong> </li><li><strong>When the voltage is too high</strong> </li><li><strong>When the temperature is too high</strong> </li></ul>
<p><strong>Under these conditions, the light on the power supply will turn from green to orange or to red. Or, the light will turn off. When the power supply light is green or orange when it is connected to the wall outlet, the power supply is functioning correctly.</strong></p>
<strong>Make sure that the power supply is cool</strong>
<p><strong>The red light may indicate that the power supply is too hot or is overheated. Therefore, you should let the power supply cool for several hours in a well-ventilated space. During this time, you should not try to turn the console back on to allow
 the power supply sufficient time to cool. As soon as the power supply has cooled off, the power supply light will change from red to orange, and you can turn the console back on.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>If the power supply light is still red after you have let the power supply unit cool in a well-ventilated space, the power supply unit may require replacement.
</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do not block any ventilation openings in the power supply.</strong> </li><li><strong>Do not put the power supply on a bed, on a sofa, or on any other soft surface that may block ventilation openings.</strong>
</li><li><strong>Do not put the power supply in a confined space, such as a bookcase, a rack, or a stereo cabinet, unless the space is well ventilated.</strong>
</li><li><strong>Do not put the power supply on a stereo speaker, an amplifier, or a heat source such as a radiator or a heat register.</strong>
</li><li><strong>Plug the power supply directly into a working wall outlet. You may experience problems if you use an extension cord or a power strip if the extension cord or the power strip is faulty or cannot supply the required power to the console.</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><span><strong>If you need further support contact Xbox</strong></span></p>

            <p>Hi Crissy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that your mail app is not syncing and really appreciate your efforts taken to resolve the issue. Please answer a few questions to help us narrow down the issue and provide you with better assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) Has the issue started to occur recently?</p>
<p>b) Did you make any significant changes to the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>c) Which security software is installed in the system (if any)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue might arise due to various reasons including misconfigured sync settings, slow or intermittent internet connection, firewall from the security software blocking the connection etc. In order to diagnose the root cause of the issue, I would suggest
 you to f<span>ollow these steps to check&nbsp;the following specific sync&nbsp;setting <em>
as of now</em>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a) Open the Mail App from the Start Screen.</span></p>
<p><span>b) Press “<strong><em>Windows Logo</em></strong>” + “<strong><em>C</em></strong>” keys on the keyboard to display the charms bar.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Now, click on “<strong><em>Settings</em></strong>” and then click on “<strong><em>Accounts</em></strong>”.</span></p>
<p><span>d) Now, click on the “<strong><em>Outlook.com</em></strong>” account with which you face this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>e) Select “<strong><em>Email</em></strong>” under the section “<strong><em>Content to Sync</em></strong>”.</span></p>
<p><span>f) Select “<strong><em>As items arrive</em></strong>” and “<strong><em>Any time</em></strong>” for the options “<strong><em>Download new email</em></strong>” and “<strong><em>Download email from</em></strong>” respectively.</span></p>
<p><span>g) Now, check if the issue still persists.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may also refer to the section “<strong><em>Account-specific settings</em></strong>” from the article given below:</span></p>
<p><strong><em><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/changing-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Mail app for Windows</span></a></em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue still persists, then I would suggest you to uninstall and reinstall the Mail App on the computer and check if that resolves the issue. For this please refer to this article:
<strong><em><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/what-troubleshoot-problems-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Troubleshoot problems with an app</span></a></em></strong>.</span></p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t open playback or recording devices in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello, for quite a few months now I have been unable to open the playback or recording devices on my windows 10 PC. Whenever I right click on my audio and press sound, the settings will pop up for a brief moment and then immediately disappear, no matter
 what I do to open the settings, they always close down immediately after.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not remember when this first started happening but now it has become more of a problem so I am now trying to fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is appreciated, thank you.</p>

            Hi Lachieblue, does your PC actually play sound?
<br />
<br />Please try this:
<br />
<br />Right click Your Sound Icon
<br />
<br />Choose 'Playback Devices'
<br />
<br />Clikc your Playback Device in the resulting Dialog and click Properties
<br />
<br />On the second dialog, click on the Enhancements
<br />
<br />Disable all enhancements
<br />
<br />Save and close those dialogs
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App
<br />
<br />Go to Update &amp; Security - Troubleshoot - Playing Audio
<br />
<br />Run that troubleshooter to see if it resolves this issue . . .

<p>Thank you for your quick response</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer is completely fine with playing audio, and I can change the speaker by just clicking on the sound icon. The problem is that when I right click on the sound icon and press 'Sounds' which is what I want to access, it will open for half a second
 and then disappear.</p>

    <title>Windows 8.1 Regular Maintenance. The Operator or Administrator has - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> grahaminnes  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 Regular Maintenance. The Operator or Administrator has refused the request &#40;0x800710E0&#41;</h2>
                    <div>I am running Windows 8.1 Pro on a Pentium 4 CPU 3.00Ghz, 1 core, 2 logical processors, 2GB memory. After manually waking my PC from sleep it starts grinding away doing all sorts of maintenance ie, windows defender,general maintenance and a bank security
 program called Trusteer Rapport, between them they use 100% of my cpu for at least 10/15 minutes if left to their own devices. If I have any input during this initial period these processes reluctantly it seems slow down and allow other processes to start,
 but of course they are just waiting the opportunity to restart given half a chance. The default setting for maintenance to run is at 03.00 but this does'nt happen, I have tried changing this time but it does not help.</div>
<div>I can run Maintenance manually. &nbsp;My question ! Is there any way to force these tasks to run when the PC is not being used ie at 03.00 and to prevent them running at any other time. I am aware that a Pentium 4 is probably a little short on resources, but
 without all these competing tasks Windows 8.1 runs extremely well. I have googled this problem and tried lots of remedies without success, the Task sheduler maintenance tasks seem to be set up OK . Any input would be welcome.</div>

            <p>Hi Rahul</p>
<p>My apologies for the delay in replying. I have been trying your clean boot suggestions which are easily done with the non microsoft list but more complicated with all the others, for instance at least 5 MS items
 cannot be disabled and many of the others when disabled cause lots of other problems when the system is rebooted without them. However I eventually managed this and it has not helped my problem.</p>
<p>I have not tried recreating the task because I am not sure I could.</p>
<p>It does not seem to matter what time maintenance is set to run it tries and fails at odd times and the message is always the same "The Operator or Administrator has refused the request (0x800710E0)" and sets a
 time for the next attempt which is totally at odds with the time I have set.</p>
<p>I run this task manually last thing at night and I have stopped the task running if a scheduled run is missed. this basically solves my problem of 100% CPU usage when I wake the PC at the start of the day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However I am certain there must be way for this task to wake the PC and run in auto mode.</p>
<p>I have updated all drivers and the system sleeps at the set time and wakes at the touch of a key or movement of the mouse.</p>

<p><span><span>Most likely, the computer is going to hibernation mode. Hibernation puts your open documents and programs on your hard disk, and then

            Hi <span>Happy_homemaker,<br />
</span><br />
The issue is usually caused by corrupt or missing codecs, or by an outdated video card driver.&nbsp;<span>To troubleshoot your issue, please follow these steps:<br />
<br />
1. Ensure that you have the latest version for Windows Live Movie Maker. You download the latest version
</span><a href="http://explore.live.com/windows-live-essentials-movie-maker-get-started" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><strong>here</strong></span></a><span>.<br />
2. Ensure that you have the proper codecs to play your videos and audio files. Audio and Video require codecs to play the file and it’s important to have the right codecs installed or updated in your PC.&nbsp;
</span>
<ul>
<li><span>Try running the
</span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/video_freezes_or_crashes/%20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><strong>Microsoft FixIt tool for codecs</strong></span></a></span><span>.
</span></li><li><span>MediaInfo will be able to identify any issues with missing or faulty codecs and whether it’s already installed in
 your computer or not. You can get it </span><span><a href="http://mediainfo.sourceforge.net/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><strong>here</strong></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p><span>3.&nbsp;Ensure that your video card drivers are up to date. Movie Maker makes extensive use of the video card GPU (graphics processing unit).
 The display driver affects the reliability, performance, and compatibility of the video card with various software.
<br />
<br />
To determine the version and video card driver date, run the DirectX Diagnostic Tool (dxdiag):&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Click on <strong><span>Start</span></strong> button and type
<strong><span>dxdiag</span></strong>” in the Search programs and files box and press
<strong><span>Enter</span></strong> key on the keyboard.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Click on the <strong><span>Display</span></strong> tab and you will see the driver details including the driver version.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;If your video card driver seems outdated please go to the video card driver manufacturer and see if a newer version is available.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<span>Thanks,
<br />

Download Freemake Video Converter (&nbsp; http://www.freemake.com&nbsp; ).&nbsp; I use it to <strong>
edit</strong> .mov files from a Kodak camera.&nbsp; It lacks WLMM's whistles and bells, but, if that is important, the saved .wmv file(s) can be imported to WLMM to add the frills.

<p><span><span><span>Hi Carsonian,</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Unlike the other categories under Disk Clean Up, Compress Old Files doesn't delete any files from the drive. It compresses
 files that Windows hasn't accessed for a specified period of time. The files are still available, but there will be a slight increase in access times because the files will be decompressed the next time they are accessed.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>When we set to compress old files automatically by windows disk cleanup, it might compress some system files which are
 not accessed for certain period of time and deleting that might cause issues if not immediately.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Note that when Compress Old Files is highlighted an Options button appears.</span></span><span><span>Clicking
 options will allow you to set the number of days to wait before an old file is compressed.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>This feature was there in Windows XP, the newer version of Windows like Windows Vista or Windows 7 does not have this
 option under Disk Clean Up.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>I personally do not compress files and probably never will - if necessary, I'll just get a larger hard drive (or another hard drive or an external hard drive).&nbsp; As long as you compress only the correct files (not your boot files or anything like that), I
 suppose it's safe enough - but they take longer to open - not a lot but some and it depends on the size&nbsp;(they need to decompress) and<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">there's always a risk when doing something like that that some form of corruption will
 occur</span> (which gets us back to the old mythology but the risk is generally considered minimal and I don't mean to overstate it - but it does exist).</p>
<p>Opinions vary between the experts and you'll get them from either end of the spectrum.&nbsp; Some will tell you it is perfectly safe and a good way to save space on your hard drive.&nbsp; Others will take a middle road and say they aren't positive but think it is
 safe but recognize that there are exceptions.&nbsp; You may see some responses like that posted here.&nbsp; As I said, I personally will<strong>never</strong> do it (except for certain files which I may compress for e-mailing or because it's large and I never expect
 to need it again or for other reasons - but they would be individually selected and done for a purpose {and using a different program]).&nbsp; I mean I would never use the generic disk cleanup compress old files option to do it on a somewhat global basis with no
 individual selection (and when I do do it with an individual file, it is quite rare - I probably haven't done so in over a month - and to be perfectly honest, when I do compress a file for e-mailing, I first make a copy and compress the copy and retain the
 original uncompressed).&nbsp; I've also seen situations here where people have compressed their boot files along with pretty much everything else and this has caused them a lot of grief - it's not an easy process to repair and the system won't boot with those files
 compressed (I'm not sure how they did it - I just saw the posts but didn't read the threads - but if there's any chance that the Disk Cleanup compression was involved (and I don't think so but I didn't read how it happened and so I suppose it is possible),
 then that's just another reason for me to stay away).&nbsp; As you can probably tell by now, I don't really trust the process (perhaps I still have some of that old office folklore in me as I was around when it first came out and had all those problems) and would
 rather spend money on a bigger or second hard drive than to compress my old files.&nbsp; I'd rather take no chances I don't have to concerning my data which is precious to me.</p>
<p>The process is availalble and is generally considered reasonably safe when used correctly - but not a lot of the experts I know do so.&nbsp; It's MUCH safer than when it was first released.&nbsp; When we suggest ways to save space&nbsp;on hard drives for people who are
 short on space and don't want to upgrade or get another one, it is rare to see anyone suggest compression as one of the options (I never do).&nbsp; We suggest many other alternatives, but I never see this option emphasized or specifically suggested (though it may
 be included as an option in processes we do suggest like Disk Cleanup - and I don't specifically discourage its use either though you've heard what I'd say if specifically asked).</p>
<p>Ultimately, the decision is yours.</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<h2>            Games on demand problem</h2>
                    
<p>I have purchased the games on demand on my xbox 360. They are installed on my 250gb HDD. They seem to work with any account without having to sign into my main account. I took the xbox and hdd to my friends house and its asking me to do a license transfer.
 Why is it asking me to do this when its still on the same xbox and also same HDD? Why does MS have to over complicate things for stuff i have bought and own?</p>

<p>It's to stop theft, ie you buy it then put it on your friends HDD so they don't have to pay for the full game on their account.</p>

<p>So, next question is - did you purchase this item on THIS console, or on another one and transfer it over?</p>
<p>And, if so, were you connected to XBL while at your friend's house, or were you playing offline?</p>

<p>All items where purchased on this console. No licenses have been transferred as this is the original console that bought the items. Also ive tried the console online and offline and it states i do not own the licenses even though its my xbox and hdd which
 the console has the licenses to</p>

<p>In your original post, you said the console is telling you to do a license transfer. What exactly does this error message say? When does it show this message?</p>
