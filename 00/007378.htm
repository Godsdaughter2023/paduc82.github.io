<h2>            How to make Windows Mobile 6.1 professional &#40;English version&#41; recognize Chinese Simplified characters</h2>
                    Hey guys,<br />
<br />
I just bought Sony Ericsson X1 model with Windows Mobile 6.1 professional (English Version).&nbsp; I found that it can not recognize any language other than English. Any non-english characters will just appear as cubic boxes on my phone. I am just wondering where
 I can find application or software to power my english version windows mobile to read characters of other languages?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance

<h2>            File &#62; Share &#62; Email &#40;as attachment&#41; is not working after upgrading to Mavericks</h2>
                    I just started having the same issue. When I am working on a Word Document and try to "share" it as an attachment, I get an error message saying, "Word is unable to mail your document. Please make sure your mail program is configured correctly and that
 you can send mail with it."&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This began after the upgrade. At first if I logged out and came back in it was ok again, but no longer. Now I have to go through the extra step of saving it to the desktop and attaching it.&nbsp;</div>

            Have you verified that Outlook is still set as your default email program since swapping out the previous OS for the new one? It's quite possible that Mavericks restored Apple Mail as the default. That shouldn't make any difference, though.<br />

Have you tried running Disk Utility to repair disk permissions followed by a restart of your Mac?<br />

            To add addition to Bob's Correct answer:<br />
<br />
To set the default Mail Program<br />
Go to Apple Mail (yes you heard right) and go to Preferences.<br />
Locate setting for default Mail Client.<br />
Click on the button that says mail and pick from popup list Outlook.<br />
Quit Preferences<br />
Quit Mail.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ancient history ago (back in the 80's and 90's) back when I was a young buck. (I'm an old Geezer now). OS before X , OS9.2.2 and lower used Control Panels, one of the Control panels were devoted strictly to setting default Mail and Browser Clients. Apple Got
 the Bright idea (??) to build this control Panel feature in to Apple mail for mail and newsgroups, and Safari for Web Browser.
<br />
<br />
It will be okay to set default Mail as Outlook and still use say, Thunderbird or SeaMonkey for Mail. Just open them first before reading mail or newsgroups. And yes sometimes a new OS install will rest default to Mail and Safari.<br />

            Sorry for the delay. I did all of those things and it still will not attach. Happened after the X upgrade. It makes things very time consuming. &nbsp;Not sure what else to do. Is someone working on this? I have seen others on the internet complaining about
 the same issue.&nbsp;

<div><br />
<div>After choosing Outlook as the default email client for your Mac, restart your Mac. Does that make the new setting work?</div>

    <title>Poor performance, crashing and freezes. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Poor performance, crashing and freezes.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been experiencing a number of problems with Internet Explorer 10 (desktop) after my recent upgrade to Windows 8. These problems seem to be a continuation of problems I was experiencing on IE9 on Windows 7 prior to the upgrade, but they have become more
 severe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I randomly experience poor performance of the browser itself. For example, when I click the button to open a new tab, the tab at the top of the browser window appears almost immediately, but&nbsp;it can take 2 to 5 seconds before the "blank page" loads and I
 am finally able to type a new URL. If I middle click on a link to open that link in a new tab there is a considerable delay between the tab appearing at the top of the window and the title/page loading to a usable state. Along the same vein, when I open a
 new page in the current tab the content of that page appears almost immediately but it is several seconds before I am able to scroll or otherwise interact with the page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, I have been noticing some relatively severe problems after extending browsing sessions. With a few (3 to 4)&nbsp;tabs open and after I have loaded several pages in those tabs over the course of some time the browser becomes slow and responds poorly
 to changing tabs or switching to other programs and then back to IE10. The browser will often freeze for prolonged periods when this occurs and then return a poor performing state. Once this continues&nbsp;the browser will ultimately freeze and require me to "End
 Task" with task manager. However, just killing the instances of IE that appear in the "Apps" section of the task manager will not resolve the problem. I will have to scroll to the "Background Processes" section and End Task any instances of IE that appear
 in that section. Once I open IE10 again it will respond "normally" but often with the sluggishness of opening new tabs and pages as described above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I mentioned, I was experiencing some of these symptoms with IE9 under Win7 prior to the upgrade. It was a fresh install of Windows 7 (64-bit), but IE9 had issues from day one of that install. Because of the relatively fresh state of the install I did
 a "keep my programs and files" upgrade to Windows 8 (64-bit) and it appears the problems have followed and gotten worse. There is active antivirus/antimalware on the system (MS Forefront CS) and scans show no malware. Additional online virus scan tools have
 also failed to locate any issues. In an attempt to correct the problem myself, I have disabled nearly all plugins/add-ons and I have turned off IE features such as Tracking Protection, Suggested Sites, and every other feature I could imagine would cause poor
 performance. (For the record, my original install of Windows 7/IE 9&nbsp;on this same computer was absolutely flawless and fast with all of the above features turned on and only some annoying add-ons disabled.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One interesting issue I have experienced in a few instances were cases where I was watching flash videos on YouTube, and upon closing the browser tab the audio would continue playing until the video ended or I closed the whole browser window. I will also
 add that most of the problems I've described above, where the browser loses performance over time seem to occur much more quickly and frequently when I watch several Flash videos back to back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm really at a loss. I have attempted to remove IE from the system and then add the feature back, but all of the installed add-ons and similar junk appear to be retained even after IE is completely removed as they appear once IE is installed again. I have
 never had these types of problems with IE, and I would seriously like to resolve them. I have been a loyal IE user since IE3 and until recently I never had any alternate browsers installed on my system, sadly I've had to install Chrome to perform those tasks
 that I know will bring IE to its knees on a computer that greatly&nbsp;exceeded Windows 8 sysreqs (Core i7 2600, 8GB RAM, SSD system disc).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help that anyone could suggest would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <div>Hi,</div>
<div>Thank you for the post on Microsoft Answer.</div>
<div>I understand that you have difficulty in using Internet Explorer as it crashes and freezes.</div>
<div>I would like to request you to please try the following troubleshooting methods.
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
<br />
You may try to running the Internet Performance troubleshooter and check for the issue.<br />
<div>a) Press Windows Key +R, type Control Panel.<br />
b) Type troubleshooting in the search bar, click on troubleshooting.<br />
c) Select the view all option on the left side, Click on programs, click on Internet performance Troubleshooter.<br />
d) Follow the steps from the wizard to run the troubleshooter.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you are using Desktop Internet Explorer, then try disabling Add-ons and check.<br />
Follow the steps to disable add-ons:<br />
a. Open Internet Explorer in the classic view.<br />
b. Click on tools, Internet Options and Programs tab.<br />
c. Click on Manage add-ons and disable them. Click OK.<br />
d. Now check the issue.<br />
<br />
For troubleshooting steps on Manage add-ons please refer to the following link.</div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/internet-explorer/manage-add-ons#ie=ie-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/internet-explorer/manage-add-ons#ie=ie-10</a>
<br />
<br />
I would also suggest you to scan your computer with Microsoft Safety Scanner, which would help us to get rid of viruses, spyware, and other malicious software.<br />
<br />
The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a><br />
<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.<br />
<br />
<strong>Important</strong>: While scanning the hard drive if any bad sectors are found, the scanner tries to repair that sector, any data available on that might be lost.<br />
<br />
Internet Explorer (and other browsers) uses flash player to stream videos, I would suggest you to update flash player. To do this follow the steps mentioned in the article below Troubleshoot Flash Player installation</div>
<div><a href="http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/191/tn_19166.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/191/tn_19166.html</a>

            <p>Thank you for taking the time to reply. Unfortunately your suggestions did not resolve this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The internet troubleshooter failed to find any problems to fix. I had also tried with under Windows 7 with IE9 and it also failed to find any problems. In Windows 8/IE10 is also searched and immediately stated it could not find any problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Disabling all plug ins was fairly redundant as nearly all of the plugins were already disabled. When I did disable all add-ons the performance issues were still present, and although some issues (such as videos continuing to play after their tab was closed)
 did not present themselves that was merely because I was not able to do them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, the malware scanner did not find any issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where I stand now is that I continue to experience all of the issues I've mentioned in my original post. In some of my more controlled testing I have noticed that the performance, freezing and non-responsiveness problems seem to occur most often when using
 sites that are very heavy in javascript (such as Facebook). I have also noticed numerous problems with Engadget&nbsp;and its comment system&nbsp;(massive page loading delays, pages load but are not usable for several seconds). And I still continue to experience problems
 where flash videos will continue playing even after the tab they were loaded in has been closed. Once the performance problems begin I am still forced to close all IE windows and use task manager to kill all instances of IE under the "Apps" and "Background
 Tasks" sections.</p>

            <p>I would also like to add an additional problem that is related to all of these.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I continue browsing after the performance issues begin, but IE10 does not completely freeze, it will instead begin fully loading pages but never display them instead showing&nbsp;a completely white window. I know the page is fully loaded because there are
 scroll bars and I still get mouse-over tooltips from content in the page, but the information is invisible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only way to recover is to close Internet Explorer 10, "End Task" all IE instances in Task Manager and load the browser again.</p>

            <p>I have similar frequent issues with IE10 on Windows 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My impression is that it often happens when sites pop up overlay windows or the browser shows a warning message at the bottom of one of the pages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My habit of reading news summary emails and sites and opening new IE tabs from links as I go to read later seems to aggravate the problem.&nbsp; With a dozen or more of those tabs open until I get around to them I almost inevitably experience lockups on every
 browsing session.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This would occur occasionally with IE9 on Windows 7 but is at least an order of magnitude worse on IE10/Windows 8.&nbsp; I also experience page rendering anomalies but I figure&nbsp;sites will adjust to IE10 eventually as they have to previous versions.&nbsp; Many sites&nbsp;warn
 me that IE10 is an obsolete version LOL.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I am having a similar set of issues with IE 10 on Windows 8 Pro. The audio from videos sometimes continues to play after the tab they are is closed and only stops when the video ends&nbsp;or I completely close IE. Also, when I close a tab, that page will sometimes
 spontaneously open in a new window or multiple new windows. This seems to only happen if I close a tab while the page is still loading. For example, closing a single tab may generate several new windows that all load the page that was loading in the tab that
 was closed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you end up solving this issue? I'm thinking about refreshing or reinstalling Windows, but I don't want to go through the hassle if it isn't going to fix things.&nbsp;I'm guessing this could just be a&nbsp;that will hopefully get fixed in an update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>I just experienced the issues with closing tabs and having the page re-open in multiple browser windows for the first time today. It's happened a few times and as you mentioned, it seems to happen most when I close a tab while the page is loading.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have not found an solution at this point, but it basically seems that doing the refresh is probably going to be the solution. I've held off doing it since it will erase all of my software and pulling that all together and getting it all set up is going
 to be a pain. However, if I end up doing it, I will certainly post back my results.</p>

            <p>Since I didn't have many things to reinstall, mostly because all my large data stuff was in a separate drive than the one with the OS, I tried out the system refresh.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bottom line:&nbsp; I believe it helped to a degree.&nbsp; Things like downloading streamplay videos became faster but it still seems as though there's some kind of downloading restriction in place.&nbsp; I don't know if it has to do with what is being streamplayed or not,
 but I do know that the video platform is sometimes faster with one video than a different one.&nbsp; It could be on the&nbsp; website's end but one platform shouldn't have varied downloading speeds with different videos that are basically showing similar content.</p>

    <title>HTC Diamond and Active Sync - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pcedge  say:</h3>
<h2>            HTC Diamond and Active Sync</h2>
                    This appears to be a common problem from the user forums, and nobody seems to have found a solution, yet.<br />
<br />
Both my wife and I have HTC Diamond Touch CDMA phones. She runs Vista and I run XP Pro 5.1.2600.&nbsp; We have separate cables, and so our systems are completely independent.<br />
<br />
Last month when I first got my phone, I was able to Sync with Outlook a couple of times. This halted and I had to reinstall ActiveSync and Outlook until I could sync again - of course all my data was duplicated. Now, I cannot even get the compluter to recognize
 that my phone is connected. I've tried all the basics, so please don't run me through your flowchart.&nbsp; I've changed USB port, rebooted phone and computer, reinstalled software, removed all added hardware on the phone, tried different cables, etc.... I can
 not connect my phone to my computers [desktop and laptop] for ActiveSync or for Data.<br />
<br />
My wife, with Vista, cannot get her system to complete a synchronization - it runs for hours than indicates that it cannot continue. I am not sure of the exact message.<br />
<br />
The ONLY reason we purchased another Win Mobile OS phone is for Active Sync. After years of nothing bu problems with our Treos, we imagined the HTC would work better - clearly it has more to do with the OS.<br />
<br />
HELP!<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

            For your wife's issue, verify that "Advanced network functionality" is disabled on her phone. You will find this under Start &gt; Settings &gt; Connections &gt; USB to PC. Connect her phone again to sync.

            Thanks, Linley. I'll try that next and let you know.
<p>I can't imagine what the trouble is with my unit, though. Problem is, now I can't download music, upload photos, etc. . .&nbsp; I'll have to do all that with e-mail, but even then, my notes, calendar and contacts won't be backed-up or synchronized. I hope someone
 has a fix, or other software to use, even if I have to go to my Ubuntu partition. From what I've read, though, Microsoft isn't opening up this conduit for anyone else to develop.

            You will find a free backup utility from www.dotfred.net. It's called PIM BAckup. It lets you backup your contyacts, Calendar, Tasks, Email, SMS/MMS, Call history etc. Download a copy directly to your device.&nbsp;

            Linley,
<p>I appreciate your interest, and your effort in helping me resolve my HTC issues. PIM Backup looks like a good utility - I will give it a try, but... since I cannot connect my HTC Diamond to my PC any longer, I am not sure how I might use such a program.
 I am interested in&nbsp; trying to make a network connection that will allow me to share folders on PC with my Diamond, so that I can copy files between the two. Seems like a pain-in-the-butt to me, but I don't know another way to accomplish this. Any advice how
 to do this?<br />
</p>
<p>I had read, at PPC Geeks, of users claiming that the quality of the provided cable is the problem. They suggested using a "high-quality" cable. I have tried my wife's cable on my system, and I get the same results. I have other mini-usb cables, but they
 are different connectors - they will power my device, but I don't believe they have the correct pins to communicate with it. I would not know where to get a "high-quality", proprietary HTC cable.<br />
</p>
<p>My wife tells me that she was able to get her Vista machine to complete a sync with her phone. I don't use Vista [have no plans to] and so I am not familiar enough with how it handles these things, but her issue seems completely different from mine. She
 said that "Advanced network functionality" was already disabled on her phone.</p>
<p>I don't know if you work for MS, so please don't be offended... I tossed my Treo believing that it was a piece of junk. I have several hardware problems with it, but the biggest problem was that the phone would not answer when I tried; software kept locking
 up; etc... I was convinced it was the phone. I now realize that Windows Mobile is not ready for market. Seems to be in perpetual Beta. My HTC won't answer [I've tried the recommended workarounds like disabling the TF phone and using the WM phone - turning
 off my Data connection - unloading all added software - etc...&nbsp; It, too, keeps needing a reboot, and other problems, not to mention it will no longer connect to my PC. Seems I am not the only one with such problems.</p>
<p>Bill Gates explained, on NPR yesterday, that Microsoft has its best days ahead. If Microsoft would work on fixes to their own product, I think they could make a killing! First you buy the OS from them, then you buy the plug-in to make it work! Sorry, but
 I'm a bit frustrated after years of releases like ME, and XP SR1, and now Vista and WM 6.1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Sorry if I vented too much.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Thanks again for your help.<br />
</p>

            Sorry... That's not what I meant. I meant that I won't be able to copy the backup to my pc. Maybe I could e-mail it, but I thought the idea of a portable PIM was to make my life simpler. I've been using these since the first generation of Palms, but it
 seems to get more difficult with every release.
<p>BTW - just did a hard reset, using the PIM Backup utility you recommended [thanks], but still can't connect to the pc.</p>
<p>I used to do other things on my days off, but since Windows, I don't have to worry about planning my weekends! I've got a Ubuntu partition, but there are still a few things it can't do that I need. My next phone will be linux-based, but since this is new,
 I'll have to wait a couple of years.<br />

            I've done everything I thought of, until it occurred to me to plug my wife's Diamond into my computer to see if it would recognize it. It did. I figure this means it must be a hardware failure, and so I returned it to the Sprint Store. Unfortunately, since
 my phone is over 30-days old [I've had it for 34 days] they won't replace it in the store, but have to order a replacement, and I'll have to go back to get it. I'll let you know if that was the problem.

<p>It does use the Active Sync connection on the phone, but I bought "Sprite Backup" from
<a href="http://www.spritesoftware.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.spritesoftware.com</a> which was recommended for HTC phones.&nbsp; It&nbsp;works nicely with my Diamond, even with Vista on the desktop.&nbsp; There is a special price (including Sprite Terminator if you ever need it - if stolen,
 GPS locator , send silent message to lock phone, etc)&nbsp;for HTC phones and it appeared to me that particular Sprite program may come preloaded on some HTC models.&nbsp; I think the company may be in Australia?&nbsp; Mine takes about 2 minutes to backup everything on my
 phone and is supposed to be able to restore to another&nbsp;(like a new or replacement unit) device.</p>

Hi,

<div>It does indeed seem that there is an issue with the device itself. &nbsp;Let us know when you get a replacement.</div>

            I did get a replacement - a refurbished unit :( . <br />
<br />
While I can now connect to my computer via cable, and Active Sync, I am really tired of the duplicate entries; it takes hours to remove these from my contacts and calendar.<br />
<br />
Now I have to return the replacement phone... I knew that it would be a problem. I think "Refurbished" means "Let's send it back out and see if anyone notices that it is defective." This time the problem is not related to Active Sync or cable connection; rather,
 the unit will not fully charge, and when the charge indicator does stop, I have to reboot.<br />
<br />
Well, that's for a different forum.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your time.<br />

Thank you team. Based on your hint to use Update advisor, i again downloaded Win 10 on my Lumia 730 and is working fine. This was against theadvice of their service centre.

            I have never seen a LinkedIn contact without an email address, so that is not the issue. &nbsp;Also, if I add the same email address manually, sending the email via Outlook works fine.
<div><br />
<div>Steps are:</div>
<div><br />
<div>1. New email</div>
<div>2. Type a person's name in To box who is not in my main Outlook address book, but who is in my LinkedIn contacts.</div>
<div>3. Press Alt-K to search for name match. As long as the name is spelled right, the contact is found in my LinkedIn contacts and the full name and email address show in the To box as in this example:</div>
<div>Nancy Lastname (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***). When I double-click on the name, the contact details show in a popup with "LinkedIn" showing just below the "View Source" label on the right.</div>
<div>4. Type Subject and Body text.</div>
<div>5. Click Send button.</div>
<div><br />
<div>When I get some time, I will try the clean boot, but I am very doubtful that has anything to do with this.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you.</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm having this same issue - was there a resolution to this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When selecting a person with an email that comes from the linkedin social connector - the name and email comes up like: John Brown (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***) - this will result in&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 72pt"><span>"Your message did not reach some or all of the intended recipients."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>When I pick a person from my main address book - the name and email comes up like: Tom Jones &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt; - this then works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The current workaround is for me to copy the email address and put it in - ie: copy *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and then paste it into the To: box,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is crazy!</p>
<p>Would love to get this fixed. please.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thankss</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I enter an email address. xxx@xxxxx(dot)com for example - no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only when I search for a name like John Brown, and it can find that person from the linkedin connector address book and shows up the John Brown (email@email(dot).com) - then this returns the sending error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is like that email address is only for info, but not actually there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>if you double click on that person's name - it shows all the information in each of the fields (so it seems very normal).</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it is like outlook cannot access the email address for sending purposes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I search for a name where I have in my own address book (ie: not a connection from linkedin), the name shows up, and it sends all fine - eg: Tom Brown &lt;tom@email(dot)com&gt;.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The difference that outlook shows whether it will work or not is represented in the brackets &nbsp;&lt; xxxx email &gt; &nbsp;or ( xxxxx email )</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Hope this makes sense.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks</p>

            <p>I have the exact same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Type in an email address it works.......use CRTL-K (display name from a social connector) does not work and the email just sits in the outbox doing nothing.&nbsp; If I go back into the email and change all recipients to an actual email address, then I can hit
 re-send and it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>New troubleshooting:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Creating calendar invite</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;1 name from&nbsp;local address&nbsp;book (use CTRL-K)</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; 1&nbsp;name from social/LinkedIn (use CTRL-K)</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Hit send</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Message gets stuck in outbox</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Edit message.......ONLY change the LinkedIn address to an actual email address</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; Hit re-send</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; Works</p>
<p>
</p><p>So why the social connector understands CTRL-K but not able to change the display name into an email name is beyond me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No doubt a bug and probably something to do with it needing to re-login to LinkedIn account to retrieve the real address.....and its not.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Excel Decimal error bug in Mac OSX update 16.16.0 dated 6&#47;30&#47;18</h2>
                    <p>Well?&nbsp; Yesterday, Microsoft issues 16.16 update for Mac OSX High Sierra and all worksheets crashed that had Office sounds marked.&nbsp; So, I had to un-mark my Office sounds.&nbsp; Today, (6/30/18) Microsoft issued a update 16.16.0.&nbsp; Guess what now???&nbsp; They fixed
 the Office sounds, but now you can NOT enter the comma in Numbers or change any numbers you have input.&nbsp; As an example...I put in number 231.&nbsp; It came up on the spread sheet as 2. SO I checked the format "Cells" and it was on Number, and decimal zero and with
 commas...BUT, it doesn't change anything to how the format is checked.&nbsp; 231 still comes up 2.&nbsp; Now, if you want 231 to show up, you have to enter 23100.&nbsp; Which is screwball because if you add up a bunch of numbers, it adds 23100 instead of 231?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again, it shows whoever the coders are for Microsoft, no doubt cheap offshore people in India, have no clue how to program for Mac OSX and don't care.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft has now made excel a horrible business accounting tool horrible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So Microsoft, when will you fix this new bug?</p>

<p>George, Mac Office 16.16 is an insider fast build. It is essentially a beta. If you need to have a stable version, you should opt out of the insider builds by going to the link below and unchecking any insider options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://products.office.com/en-us/office-insider?tab=Mac#Tabs_section</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you remain on the insider builds, expect problems and issues to pop up. That is the point of the insider builds - to get feedback on features and issues before it rolls out to the monthly builds.</p>

                    I'm using a Microsoft Lumia 640 XL Dual-SIM phone and have upgraded from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10. &nbsp;I can no longer reach the Store. &nbsp;I get the message "Try that again" and "The error code is 1, in case you need it.". &nbsp;I've waited, reviewed all settings,

            <p>It's a bug in Windows 10 Mobile.</p>
<p>When the Settings &gt; Region is set to Guernsey or Jersey, a visit to the Store produces the error.</p>
<p>Windows 10 PC produces a message saying "region not supported".</p>
<p>similarly, setting the location in the Microsoft website to Guernsey takes me to the International Europe page, which is in Ireland with a currency in Euros.</p>

I expect similar issues on the Isle of Man, based on information from&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/10648/windows-phone-feature-and-service-availability" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">the feature and service&nbsp;availability page ...</a></p>

            <p>The region was added to Windows 10 but none of the infrastructure. Simply sloppy implementation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win10 PC does produce an intelligible message while Win10 Mobile does not. The Store and Microsoft website are similarly sloppily implemented.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A similar but different failure is with Win10 Mobile &gt; Contact Microsoft, which leads only to the Win10 PC support pages. Nobody there can support you.</p>

<h2>            Lost Contacts.</h2>
                    My Skype has been updated. Since then I only have 4 of my original contacts. I have tried signing out, restarting my laptop nothing works! I am not getting messages from original contacts and my credit is missing. I seem to be going round in circles. I
 need to get my Skype back in working order and trying to actually speak to a human being seems impossible. I tried Live Chat - that allegedly was transferring me to a person and just ended up back to "questions &amp; answers!!!" Help!

<p><span>The most common reason for this problem is that you’re signed in to a different Skype account on your Skype app.
</span></p>
<p><span>If you created your Skype account with a unique or personalized Skype Name, sign in to Skype using the Skype Name and not the email address.</span></p>

<p>Hi Dave,&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>I have Office 365 Personal which can be installed on one PC + one tablet plus one phone.</p>
<p>I have installed it on the PC and now wanted to install on the IPad.</p>
<p>In the meantime I have followed the Office.com/myAccount and received the email link for the different Office Apps and have managed to install Excel and Word thus far so I think I have solved it myself!</p>
<p>I will now try Outlook and Onedrive and that will be all that I require!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was expecting the Whole Office Package to be available as one package I did not want to use the Apple istore to download the individual apps, since I assume that would not be part of the MS Office 365 which I purchased.</p>
<p>So thanks again for your response and support. Good to see that it works!</p>
<p>Regards Neville</p>
<blockquote>Hi Neville, <br />
<br />
Do you have Office 365 Personal or Office 365 Home <br />
<br />
The Home version can be installed on up to 5 devices, the personal edition cannot
<br />
<br />
Click the link below to get the Office Apps for iPad: <br />

<br />
<br />
Or, do you want to transfer your Office installation onto your iPad? <br />
<br />
If so, you need to deactivate your previous Installation and then re-install Office 2016
<br />
<br />
Go to <a href="https://office.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://office.com/myaccount</a> and sign in using your Microsoft account, if prompted
<br />
<br />
Select Install <br />
<br />
Under Install information, locate the Desktop PC which Office was installed on <br />
<br />
Select Deactivate Install to deactivate the Office installation <br />
<br />
Then, click Install to install Office </blockquote>

            Seems like you downloaded a .cab file and tried to extract. If I'm right, you must copy&nbsp;the cab file&nbsp;to your device and click on it to run setup.

                    <p>Hi, I have installed Office 2016.</p>
<p>I was able to associate Word 2016 with .docx files - so the icon has changed in all the windows folders.</p>
<p>but I am unable to associate Excel 2016 with .xlsx files.</p>
<p>How many ever times I do it, whenever I open excel, I always get the below message only.</p>
<p>Because of this, I am unable to directly open excel files from within a windows folder into excel.</p>
<p>I am also unable to view previews of excel attachments within Outlook mails.</p>

            <p>Considering the phone doesn't have any sort of tuner for video, the only option is to watch what is being streamed over an internet connection. Don't know where you live, so don't know if that is even done there. A couple of options exist. There are some
 apps that provide streaming of TV channels, like Mundu TV, World TV, SPB TV. I have no way of knowing if any of these support stations that may broadcast criket.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best way most likely is to provide that stream yourself, using a Slingbox and the associated app.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/apps/5e8b8122-49e4-df11-a844-00237de2db9e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/apps/5e8b8122-49e4-df11-a844-00237de2db9e</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.slingbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.slingbox.com/</a></p>
<p>Then if you could get it at home, you can send it to your phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a last resort you could have someone go to the match and open up a Skype session with you. Not having a front facing camera is not a drawback in this case ;)</p>

<h2>            Nokia 700 signal level drops massively when hand held</h2>
                    There was me thinking only the Iphone 4 had this issue! It drops from say 4 bars to about 1. Holding the top end seems OK. It is holding the phone "normally" or holding the bottom end which almost kills the signal.

<p>The Nokia 700 main antenna is placed on the bottom side of the phone so covering it with your hand can have some effect to the signal level. But I just tested with my own Nokia 700, and weren't able to drop any nw bars no matter how well I tried to cover
 the antenna with my (both) hands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've not heard otherfeedback of this issue with Nokia 700, so if it's really causing problems in your phone (e.g. call drops in good nw-coverage)&nbsp;I suggest to have your device checked by Nokia Care for any HW faults in RF area.</p>

            That's interesting... The bottom of the 700 looks like it is all-metal, which is why I was suprised to see this. On the Iphone4 it is obvious why it does it. Further tests show that it is evident only in an area where the signal is normally very low. In
 fact this was one of the reasons I moved from T-M to Vodafone; they have a slightly better signal here in the countryside. The puzzling thing is that the phone sometimes shows 4-5 bars, and drops to 1-2 bars when handheld, whereas in areas of good coverage
 it shows say 5 bars and doesn't drop at all when handheld. The only phone on which I have seen the signal level varying like that was a Thuraya satellite phone, but Thuraya do beam steering and use variable beam power. GSM doesn't do that.

            <p>Hello William</p>
<p>I think all you need to do is select View - Arrange by - Select "Show in Groups". Then select Arrange By and change to Flagged status or whatever other means needed.</p>
<p>Hope that helps</p>
<p>Thanks...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>hi. I just upgraded to vista.. I think its an upgrade! ok so yanked out Activesync as it doesn't work anymore. Installed WM6.
</p>
<p>THe WM6 does detect my WMobile5 PPC. However it will not sync any contacts, email or anything. I use outlook 2003 only. I have done the following things.
</p>
<p>Soft resets.. multiple</p>
<p>On the PPC goto Active sync &gt; delete the different profiles. &gt; deleted windows PC&nbsp; and Windows PC 2</p>
<p>soft reset</p>
<p>Resync.</p>
<p>NOw apparently I have a good connection, as I don't have the option to select which WIndows PC to use.. neither ever worked btw.. but now I cannot sync anything at all and the only option to attempt to sync is the email. I have tried reseting
 the device, but only the email option is available to sync.. Thoughts?? </p>

<p>&nbsp;macaroo, it is just a little confusing on what you did and is happening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You upgraded to Vista</p>
<p>You removed Active sync</p>
<p>Installed WMDC?&nbsp; (Windows Mobile Device Center)</p>
<p>If you have the "new" activesync installed, were you able to create a partnership?&nbsp; I'm assuming yes</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So when you say "cannot sync anything at all and the only option to attempt to sync is the email", can you explain that a bit more?</p>

<p>hello... I got so frustrated with this that I have now done a hard reset of the PPC 6700. Thinking that would be the ultimate last thing and then it 'had' to work. Alas.. no luck. So this is my situation as it sits
 right now. </p>
<p>PROFILE</p>
<p>I have Vista Ultimate installed </p>
<p>I have Windows mobile 6 installed</p>
<p>I have Outlook 2003 installed. I ran the repair tool as well. (note: after reinstalling Outlook 2003 on the new PC, I just overwrote the default 200kb PST with my 150mb current PST. )</p>
<p>I have WM5 installed on my PPC 6700</p>
<p>It has now had 2 hard resets. IT is now factory default</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ISSUE:</p>
<p>Without even connecting PPC to PC, I goto Active Sync, selection Options (now a screen comes up saying if i want to sync with a Desktop PC, to install Active sync and then connect the device. )</p>
<p>AFTER conecting the device, I get a Windows PC handshake that 'finds' my device, so i can browse folders etc. HOwever.. only EMAIL sync option is available.. this is on both the WM6 and PPC when i goto option after undock.
<br />
<br />
ARGHHHHHHH.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have confirmed that the device will sync correctly with AS 4.05 on my WInXP pc, but it just sets up another profile.. this Vista however won't sync.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>any ideas.. This is really 
p@#$#@ing me off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I would like to note that at this time.. I have successfully synced my items using V6.0 instead of 6.1. Can someone indicate if there are any risks/benefits to upgrading to 6.1?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This was such a rash. I must have spent better than 5 hours on this.

<p>There should not be any risks.&nbsp; There are some improvements but if all is working now, maybe you should leave it to make sure all is OK.before you upgrade to 6.1</p>

<p>I took a supper break and was coming back to offer some assistance...this was good news!!</p>

<p>I'm running Windows 7 and Office 2007. I use the sync center to have access to my files when I'm away from the office. About a week ago after a Windows update I lost the ability to save offline files back to the synced source drive. I can save to my laptop
 local drive only.</p>
<p>Any suggested fixes&nbsp;would be greatly appreciated!</p>

            The problem has been resolved. It seems that Windows had become corrupted and had to be fully reloaded. Weather tool bar now shows required information.
