<h2>            VIDEO_DXGKRNL_FATAL_ERROR</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I am using dell inspiron 3537 laptop and using windows 8.1 Enterprise edition. When I hibernate, every time I want to get the laptop up again, I get &nbsp;"VIDEO_DXGKRNL_FATAL_ERROR". The system restarts and I lose the previous state.<br />
Sometime the error also occurs when I shutdown and want to the get the system up again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Please note that after facing this issue I have installed the latest driver available on dell website, but it has proved to be futile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help<br />
<br />
Following is the latest dump when this issue occured.<br />

<h2>            TPM...Thermal Power Management, Battery, and Performance</h2>
                    <strong><em>Hi, i am damselnsos............( I have enclosed pics of my Bios menu ,&nbsp; Just keep scrolling after reading&nbsp; ),&nbsp; My Insignia Flex puter&nbsp; constantly just shuts off.&nbsp; In my Device Manager , I look to update my battery and&nbsp; its not there. The AC
 power is cord is the only device in the&nbsp; battery menu.in my device manager&nbsp; I noticed this after I downloaded a Free&nbsp; and corrupt version of Windows 10.&nbsp; So trying to find out what happened is challenging ,&nbsp; I do not want to make matters any worse by enabling
 or disabling anything , even if I know what it is and suppose to do. , This is the strangest, in-depth Bios menu I ever&nbsp; seen or experienced...Just so much in this&nbsp; &nbsp;Insignia Flex. .&nbsp; &nbsp;. I may not even be looking at the problem of the battery keeping the charge,
 But I think the sensors and thermal circuits are needed and should be enabled , cooling the device ,components , battery and other things needed. for the power management&nbsp; &nbsp;. Insignia&nbsp; support is the Geek quad in Circuit City or wherever. I thought they had
 a lot of experience in troubleshooting , understanding&nbsp; circuits .&nbsp; but they are more a quick fix&nbsp; &nbsp;I don't think they would touch this problem with the battery.&nbsp; &nbsp;.I retired as&nbsp; a level A electrical electronic tech in Communications/ satellites/&nbsp; and medical
 devices, programmed some equipment we manufactured.&nbsp; I just do not or cannot afford another computer&nbsp; . Not until a better company than Microsoft comes along.&nbsp; I am not fully understanding why Microsoft has and doesn't care about the problems people have after
 they are bullied into downloading corrupt programs and OS. It's&nbsp; a company which has to have a 10,000 % profit every year.&nbsp; And the only way to get that is screwing computers up so innocently while the whole time they want you to buy a new computer or a new
 OS system&nbsp; disk.&nbsp; I almost giving up on fixing these things. or trying to enjoy them.Its not worth all this..&nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks so much to anyone who is trying to help me... I have read some Microsoft users problems in the support community,&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>this

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I appreciate your effort on this. As you have mentioned that you have downloaded a free version of Windows 10. May I know where you downloaded the Windows 10 from?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We recommend you to download any Windows software from official Microsoft website. As you have mentioned that, you are using a free copy of Windows 10, you will not be able to avail certain features in the free copy of Windows. We recommend using a
 Genuine version of Windows, which allows you to avail all the features and help you keep the computer safe and secure.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I also see that you are unable to find the Battery drivers in Device Manager. A device driver is a software that tells the operating system and other software how to communicate with the respective hardware. The driver that is responsible for the Battery
 to be detected is <strong>Microsoft ACPI-Compliant Control Method Battery.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Ideally this driver is present by default, as the driver is not present and as you have mentioned that most of the sensors are disabled in the BIOS, I suggest you to try resetting the BIOS to defaults and check if that helps.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Note: <em>Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring
 of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.&nbsp;</em></span><em><span>I would recommend you to contact the manufacturer of the system to get you through this process.</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please reply with the status of the issue, we will be glad to help you further.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regards,</span></p>

            Hi, TY for your time. Yes I downloaded Windows 10 from the Microsoft site. I had an 8.1 program from cd , but Microsoft&nbsp; was saying how much better Win10&nbsp; all over my email and each time I signed in to my account&nbsp; , i decided to try it. .&nbsp; As soon as I
 downloaded i had an error stating my update and a few other things were corrupt. I went and downloaded an OS system image and have had nothing but trouble with corrupt file I DOWNLOADED from Microsoft.. Cannot figure that one out!&nbsp; &nbsp; But I bought this computer
 refurbished and ask the seller what to do. He said all his refurbished computers were experiencing the same problem after he downloaded Win 10. I should send it back . But I got a good deal and figured I can troubleshoot it myself. I tried going to the Insignia&nbsp;
 support site , but didn;'t find the Bios update. i figured since Microsoft hounded everyone to get Win 10, even giving it away , they would know&nbsp; ( the program Engineers ) would know what to d

            <p>This is <em>not</em> a file that you should simply delete.</p>
<p>If System File Checker does not fix it ( assuming it is in fact corrupt) then it would be better to
</p>

<h2>            1.800.642.7676 Phishing Attack&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My wife received a call from a *foreigner* who indicated that they worked for Microsoft Support.&nbsp; The phone call went to her cell phone (flag #1) and the phone call came from&nbsp;&lt;&lt;PII removed&gt;&gt; The lady individual indicated that our Windows systems were under
 attack and being hacked.&nbsp; My wife called me and put me on 3-way. Unbeknownst to the individual on the other line that I am a Software/Network engineer and I setup my network lab at home so I'm pretty familiar with every aspect and configuration..she is/was
 at a great disadvantage. I asked her which system was being *attacked*..she hesistated...I drilled a little further and asked what is the hostname/IP of the system that you are seeing being *attacked*.&nbsp; She hesitated and then said "All of them" (flag #3).&nbsp;
 I informed her that I have several Linux servers and hardware firewall which I have configured on our internet services which are provided by COMCAST.&nbsp; The CASPORT router is also providing software firewall services so our network is encapsulated by&nbsp; many
 layers of protection.&nbsp; I had already pulled up WireShark and initiated a VPN session back to my network before we started the dialogue.&nbsp; The network traffic looked okay..log files looked okay no red flags. I told my wife to hangup the call.&nbsp; My wife called
 me back afterwards and I explained *phishing* to her and told her to be vigilante and be on the lookout for possible *scams*.&nbsp; The only thing that puzzles me is that the phone number was *legit*??&nbsp; I would recommend that if this call was perhaps *legit* that
 Microsoft implements a better protocol by having some kind of metadata verification and have representatives validate product licenses numbers for Windows + Windows products. Much better validation is DEFINITELY needed.&nbsp; With the prospects and threats in CyberSecurity
 more security and verification/validation is needed within the customer support area.</p>

<h2>            Kein Partychat &#47; Support kann nicht helfen</h2>
                    
<p>Hallo,</p>
<p>ich habe das Problem das ich kein Partychat auf der Xbox One funktioniert. (Ich kann den Partys beitreten aber niemand hört mich oder ich sie)</p>
<p>Daten:</p>
<p>Fritz!Box 6360</p>
<p>Ports sind Freigegeben und exposed Host auch. (NAT wird ander Konsole als offen betitelt)</p>
<p>Teredo-Filter ist deaktiviert</p>
<p>Internet IPv4: Fritz!Box verwendet einen DS-Lite-Tunnel, IPv4 über DS-Lite</p>
<p>Internet IPv6: verbunden seit DATUM UHRZEIT, IPv6-Präfix: 1x12:123:x...</p>
<p><br />
Multiplayer Spiel getestet: Plants vs Zombie geht! CoD Ghosts geht nicht!</p>
<p>Halo MC Collection geht bedingt liegt aber vermtl. am Spiel da es noch sehr fehlerhaft ist!</p>

<p>Ich bin sehr wütend langsam und hab auch keine Lust/Zeit mehr für das Thema, hatte damals das IPv6 Problem an der Xbox360 habe unter "kämpfen" von meinem Anbieter eine IPv4 Adresse bekommen. Jetzt hab ich diese leider auch nur noch mit "DS-Lite", jedoch
 kann es nicht sein das NextGen Xbox One wieder IPv6 Probleme hat! Konkurrenzkonsole funktioniert ohne Probleme!</p>
<p>ABER ICH WILL HALO ^^</p>

<p>[quote user="Harlekin SmileZ"]Internet IPv4: Fritz!Box verwendet einen DS-Lite-Tunnel, IPv4 über DS-Lite[/quote]</p>
<p>Daran liegt es. Dein Provider hat quasi in seinem Rechenzentrum eine "große FritzBox" bei der theoretisch auch eine Portweiterleitung bzw. Exposed Host gemacht werden müsste.</p>
<p>Geht aber nicht, weil der Router eben bei Deinem Provider steht.</p>
<p><br />
Du musst daher Deinen Provider anrufen, und dem bescheidsagen, dass Du eine öffentliche IPv4 Adresse brauchst (eventuell kostet das bei einigen Providern mehr).</p>
<p>Mit DS-Lite wirst Du immer Deine Probleme haben. Auch bei der Konkurrenzkonsole je nachdem welche Anwendung Du benutzt.</p>

<p>Weil noch nicht jeder Internetprovider IPv6 unterstützt, was eigentlich über die Teredo Server geregelt werden sollte, aber warum die One auch bei mir nicht nativ mit IPv6 funktioniert weiß nur Microsoft.</p>

    <title>WINDOWS 10 Shut down problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shobanaml  say:</h3>
<h2>            WINDOWS 10 Shut down problem</h2>
                    <p>hey&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Got my update yesteray. Everything is fine except for the BIG PROBLEM in shutting down my laptop. &nbsp;</p>
<p>After i've shut it down, the power button stays on and lit, though the screen is off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Weird enough my WIFI button stays lit as well, but in the off mode ( when the WIFI is pressed, the white light on the key lights up and press it again, it turns orange, indicating the WIFI)</p>
<p>And when I press the power button to switch on the laptop, there's completely no response.</p>
<p>So each time I have turn my lappy upside down, remove the battery to make the power button light to go off and then reinsert the battery.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And only then, am able to switch on my laptop.</p>
<p>This is a serious problem, because I've never had any problems with my laptop from the day I bought it and right after the windows 10 update, this new problem has started.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help me out</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S- No! I didn't put it on sleep mode, I know the difference between a proper "shut down " and "sleep " function.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you&nbsp;</p>

This doesnt solve your issue, but as a temp work around for having to remove your battery each time have you tried holding in the power button for 10 seconds to force power off?

            yup. I've tried that, no use.There's no way out as of now. I gotta pull out the battery each time for a hard reset to switch on my lappy.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>Update: I noticed in power settings hibernate was disabled and did not show on the power options menu where I go to shut down. &nbsp;After I selected it, it now shows as an option and the following shutdowns where normal and power button light went out.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>CPing my reply from another thread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I seem to have found a solution. Sleep and shutdown have been working for me since I've done this. I should have known to check this earlier but it didn't cross my mind. I'm surprised Microsoft Support is not recommending this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right click start menu and enter admin command prompt</p>
<p>Run the command 'powercfg /energy' without the quotes</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will take 60 seconds and generate a report for you, likely under c:\Windows\system32</p>
<p>
</p><p>Navigate to that directory and drag the HTML file to your desktop. Open the file there and take notice of the errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any error you see referencing a specific device, i.e NIC, sound card, etc likely needs their drivers updated. Right click the start menu and enter device manager. Search automatically for updated drivers of the devices listed in your energy report.
 You may also need to head to the device manufacturers website for drivers if Windows can't automatically find them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My issue seemed to be my sound card as once I updated that I was able to enter sleep mode and shutdown without issue. Please let me know if this works for you guys.&nbsp;</p>

            Ok. I can try all these things. But wont this be interfering with the core system files. I mean if an update comes for the same problem, it wont affect the OS right<span style="color: rgba(84, 84, 84, 1)">?
 Like both the things clash right</span><span style="color: rgba(84, 84, 84, 1)">?</span>

            <p>Thank you so much! &nbsp;I tried this and it worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For anyone else reading, put your computer to "sleep" one time and then turn it back on. &nbsp;After that, the problem is solved. &nbsp;You will be able to shutdown as you normally would. &nbsp;I shut down 3 times in a row just to be sure prior to posting and agreeing
 this was a good fix. &nbsp;Each time my computer shuts down like normal and the light goes out completely and I can come back and turn the computer on. Previously, I had the same issues everyone else seems to have with the laptop shutting down, but the power light
 remaining on and then having to do a hard reset.</p>

            actually the sooner you will shut down again after a shut down it will easily happen. but if you run your system for long duration say 2-3 hours continuously, you will face the same problem coz i believe that in the long run some background app or software
 runs which do not stop or close after we shut down and hence power and fan still run. So, I m pretty much sure your problem will resurface after continuous run. I hv tried numerous methods found here as well as at google but none of them seems to work and
 I guess only Microsoft or the pc manufacturer(in my case HP) can solve this.

            Ok thank you for all the responses to my shutdown problem .&nbsp; I did not try the sleep mode thing but I did do the disk clean-up thing.&nbsp; Seems to working OK now, but I also have a different problem every other day.&nbsp; I also deleted Old windows and did another
 disk clean=up and manually checked every driver on the computer. Thanks again for all the help.<br />

            <p>Thanks for you help.&nbsp; I agree that there has to be something running.&nbsp; I believe my avast is part of the problem and some of the "snoopy" stuff Microsoft has imbedded.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>However, what I did was run a system clean up, deleted windows old, and checked all of the drivers on the computer.&nbsp; Seems to be OK now, but every time I use the computer I have a new problem.&nbsp; This happens when you install a new operating system without
 doing a clean install.&nbsp; I really should have know better.&nbsp; However, be that as it may I like window 10, but don't like the control I no longer have with updates and a few other things.&nbsp; Again thanks....<br />

<h2>            Extremely slow browsing</h2>
                    <p>I have FiOS and two Lenovos: a Windows 7 laptop with WiFi and a Windows 10 desktop with Ethernet. &nbsp;The laptop browses very fast, however the desktop browses incredibly slowly, either in Chrome or Explorer. &nbsp;Other applications run fine. &nbsp;Clearing browsing
 history had no effect whatsoever.</p>

<p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Add-ons can sometimes cause browsers to run slowly and crash, or they might pose a security or compatibility risk. For more information on how you can turn off and remove add-ons in Internet Explorer, you may check this

            Hello Mike,<br />
<br />
We'd like to get more information regarding this so we could further check and provide a more established workaround. Had this been the issue even before, or was this just recently?<br />
<br />
When was the last time Chrome prompted for an update?<br />
<br />
Furthermore, if you continue to experience this issue, here's an article regarding<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4002019/windows-10-improve-pc-performance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> tips on how to improve your PC performance in Windows
 10</a>.<br />
<br />
Hope this information helps.<br />
<br />
Regards.

<p>Also see in Programs and Features, if the Ask-toolbar still is there... If it is, uninstall it and restart the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps, run a scan with Adwcleaner, and remove what it finds. Get it here:&nbsp;<a href="https://toolslib.net/downloads/viewdownload/1-adwcleaner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://toolslib.net/downloads/viewdownload/1-adwcleaner/</a>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>What does changing console region affect&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            What does changing console region affect&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
As the title says, I'd like an in-depth explanation to what happens when you change the console's region.<br />
I know changing region affects the Xbox One store, but does it also affect things such as multiplayer servers? Ping? Something else?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any answers.</p>

<p>If you’re moving to another country or region, you might have to change the region associated with your Xbox Live account. When you change the region of your Xbox Live account, some things are unaffected, like your profile. Other things are potentially affected,
 such as:</p>
<p>Memberships and subscriptions</p>
<p>Licensed digital content (like games, video, and music) that you’ve already bought</p>
<p>Services you get through your Xbox console</p>
<p>Funds in your Microsoft Account</p>
<p>Note If certain conditions apply, you might be prevented from changing your account’s region.</p>
<p>This page describes what happens when you change the region of your Xbox Live account and the reasons why you might not be able to change it.</p>
<p>Here us the link to that page.</p>

<p>You don't change the region, you change the location on your console, two very different thing.</p>
<p>You can swap your console location as much as you want, and it will change the store you have, its supposed to remove all the credit on your previous location, but I have never tested it that way.</p>
<p>Server locations and such will depend on the games programmings but I doubt it goes from a manual set option on your console.</p>
<p>Don't touch your region through xbox live.</p>

<p>Thanks for the information.</p>
<p>So the only thing changing the console does is change the language and store language &amp; content, fix me if I'm wrong of if I'm missing something.</p>
<p>According to the link, if I buy a game through the US store, so long as my local country has the game on its store too, I can still play it, right? However I read that you need a matching billing account. Is the billing account my bank account, or something
 else?</p>
<p>And what about the Xbox LIVE region? What does *that* affect?</p>

                    I have an&nbsp;Acer Aspire V5-551G with windows 8 on it. Last week I played NBA 2k14 and during I am playing, my laptop suddenly shuts down. So what I did was, I updated the driver of "Microsoft Basic Display Adapter" and when I right click my mouse, the switchable
 graphics have gone. What should I do. I also upadated the driver of the processor. Thanks in advance.

            <p>Hi Kristoffer,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you get any error message after updating the driver?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might be facing this issue due to a corrupted graphics card driver. I suggest you to try the following steps and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Run the Hardware Troubleshooter</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
The Hardware Troubleshooter is an automated tool which checks the hardware on the computer for any known issues and provides the details on how to fix them. Follow these steps to run the troubleshooter.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Press “Windows Logo” + “W” keys from the keyboard.<br />
b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type “Troubleshooting” in the search bar and press “Enter”.<br />
c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the “Troubleshooting” window, click on “View All” on the left pane.<br />
d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on “Hardware and Devices”.<br />
e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on “Advanced” and then click on “Run as Administrator”.<br />
f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click “Next” and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the troubleshooting process.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Please check the troubleshooting report and let’s know the details. You may also try the suggestions given by the troubleshooter and check if that resolves the issue. If the issue persists, then try the next method.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Method 2: Uninstall and Reinstall the Graphics Card Drivers</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Uninstall the Device Drivers<br />
&nbsp;<br />
a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Press “Windows Logo” + “X” keys on the keyboard.<br />
b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on “Device Manager” from that list.<br />
c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Search for the Graphics card device from the device list, right click on it and then select “Uninstall”. On the un-installation window, if you have an option: “Delete the driver software for this device” you may select that and then remove the corrupted
 drivers from the computer.<br />
d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the on-screen instructions to complete it and the restart the computer if prompted.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
After the restart, you may again open the Device Manager and then click on the “Scan for hardware changes” button at the top of the Device Manager window and check if Windows 8.1 detects the graphics card device and installs an appropriate driver for it automatically.
 If that happens, then check if that resolves the issue.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Please do get back to us with the results.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Windows allows you to organize folders and files in a file hierarchy, imitating the way you store paper documents in real folders.
 Just as a file cabinet <br />
contains several folders, each containing related documents with dividers grouping related folders together. So the Windows file hierarchy allows you to<br />
organize your files in folders, and then place folders in other folders. Windows 7 comes with four libraries: Documents, Pictures, Music, and Videos.<br />
Libraries are special folders that catalog folders and files in a central location. A library includes and displays folders that are stored in different locations<br />
on your computer, Homegroup, or network.</span></span></p>

<p>Hi Kareenagrossen,</p>
<p><span><span>·<span> </span></span></span>Where exactly do you want to create shortcuts?</p>
<p>If you want to create shortcuts for the programs for different user accounts to their respective desktop screens then unfortunately it’s not possible. You need to logon to each user account and create shortcuts for programs you wanted to access directly
 from one location.</p>
<p>You may refer the following articles for more information:</p>

    <title>Xbox One select correct receiver input&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> smadwookiee  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One select correct receiver input&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I don't think it does this, but if someone has made it work, I would like to know. &nbsp;For some reason, when my xbox one turns on my AV receiver, it changes it to the "TV" input instead of the "Sat/Cbl" input which is where the xbox one is plugged in. &nbsp;My harmony
 remote has no problem turning on the receiver and making sure it is on the correct input setting. &nbsp;I would like to see Xbox do the same thing. &nbsp;At the moment, I have just set it so that my receiver doesn't turn off when the xbox turns off. &nbsp;The xbox one recognizes
 my receiver as an option in its setup (Denon AVR-1911), so it wouldn't seem like too much of a stretch to have it set the receiver to the proper input when it turns it on. &nbsp;I appreciate any suggestions anyone may have.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I've noticed a similar behavior on my Yamaha receiver with my Xbox One as well. &nbsp;After getting everything configured the way I needed it, this is no longer a problem for me as that's the input that brings in the optical audio anyway.</p>
<p>I would think that because the Xbox One is designed to pass through your TV signal that they defaulted the control codes to set your receiver to the TV input. &nbsp; You may be able to get around this by going into the manual set up options for your device codes,
 but I haven't looked into this as I said above that after I got everything set up and working the TV input was where I was receiving the audio anyway.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>Same problem except it turns my RCA receiver to tuner and plays the FM radio. Annoying...I'm ready to ditch the xbox turning on my receiver and just stick with my harmony remote. Cool feature...if it worked.

<p>Very simple solution. Find out what input Xbox automatically sets it too. Then switch your HDMI inputs on your receiver. For example on my Onkyo I switched the Xbox HDMI to VCR DVR. Now it starts up at the right input every time.</p>

<p>So your saying that the XBox does change the AV Receiver Input to a default Input? I was under the impression that the AV receiver powered-on to whatever the last Input that was selected when the receiver was powered off.</p>

<p>Well I'm not sure if this is useful or not but here it goes:</p>
<p>I own a RCA Kevlar sound system (old but really great sound)</p>
<p>I hooked it up to my TV and tried to get it to work through the xbox.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first code muted the system and the volume worked, When I turned the Xbox off, so did my sound system.</p>
<p>However, when I turned everything back on it would switch to AM radio. So annoying.</p>
<p>I attempted the audio device setup on xbox again, skipped the first code this time as well as the second one (didn't work)</p>
<p>The third once again muted and controlled the volume. This time the xbox couldn't turn the receiver off though.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After ripping my hair out, I realized that I never turned on the toggle setting for the audio device. Once I did that it worked like a charm. Stays on AUX with the second code that worked. The first one that worked was turning my sound system on and off
 without the toggle being on.</p>
<p>My advice would be to select "no" &nbsp;the first time it asks if the mute function worked, even if it does. Try to see if another code will work and make sure you have the toggle on.</p>

<p>Having same issue with my Pioneer 21THX. &nbsp;I cannot do the hook it to the signal that comes up as it will move from BD-TV/Sat which does not. even have HDMI. So everything will turn on except my receiver. &nbsp;So no picture or sound until I grab a 2nd remote.
 Almost a cool feature....sigh. </p>

<p>Instant on is set to turn on TV and open TV app. Occasionally, it will turn to my xbox360 input and will still show cable. A much improvement after I had changed the TV input name from 360-wii. The 360 is VGA don't know why the xbo would start up that input.
 I'm hesitant to change it from the TV's natural 'game' for the video settings.</p>

            This is a known issue with 1803. It has been happening with new update that new drive is getting uncovered and you start getting low space notifications. You can do following to hide it and there will be no harm anywhere.
<br />
<br />Type diskpart in Windows Start Search box (Cortana) &gt; Right click on Diskpart and Run as Administrator
<br />Give following command and Enter: 
<br />select volume f
<br />Give following command and Enter: 
<br />remove letter=f

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>a. How long have you been facing this issue?<br />
b. Any recent hardware/software changes made on your computer?<br />
c. Are you trying to install programs/applications from your administrator account?</p>
<p>Right-click on the setup file and select Run as Administrator (You may also use the same step to run the installed programs also).Now check if this helps.</p>
<p>You may also try turning off User Account Control (UAC) and check if this helps. Post back the status.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Turn UAC on after checking.</p>
<p>User Account Control (UAC) can help prevent unauthorized changes to your computer. UAC notifies you when changes are going to be made to your computer that require administrator-level permission. These types of changes can affect the security of your computer
 or can affect settings for other people that use the computer. We recommend that you leave UAC on to help make your computer secure.</p>

When I was in the middle of said upgrade, the Microsoft prompt to go to the Microsoft Store to execute my purchase indicated "to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro, use PayPal or a credit card, the cost $99.99." I did this, the charge executed, the purchase showed up
 in my MicrosoftStore Account which clearly said "Windows 10 Pro - $99.99." It said something similar in my PayPal account and on my credit card.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
But after ELEVEN telephone calls (over five hours) to Microsoft (and a visit to a Microsoft retail store) when I didn't receive a new Product Key, well, it wasn't until the last phone call that the "system error" was discovered. The Microsoft Rep told me that
 the upgrade from Home to Pro is not $99.99, but $199.99!!<br />
<br />
By the way, I have new rating system for international support representatives, and it works for any company. It's called COERS. Command of English Rating System. Rate your operators from 1 to 10, ten being a fluent and understandable English speaker. After
 five hours on the phone to Microsoft, after talking to eleven staffers, only one made it past 3!<br />
<br />
Just to be clear, I followed all of the several Microsoft approved methodologies of performing an upgrade. For example, I upgraded from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 Home using a DVD burned from the official Microsoft 64 bit .iso file. No problem. I was not prompted
 for a new Product Key, and although very time consuming, the upgrade completed without error.<br />
<br />
But when I tried to upgrade from Win 10 Home to Win 10 Pro, failure! &nbsp;Using the same methodology, I burned a Windows 10 Pro DVD from the official Microsoft 64 bit .iso file, I think it's two prompts in, when you are prompted for a valid Product Key. Now let
 me mention, what's really fascinating is that everyone from Microsoft staffers to ALL of the product reviews, upgrade blogs and web sites that I read, ALL these experts indicated that if you are prompted for a new Product key, just go past that screen prompt.
 Hello duh, you cannot!<br />
<br />
Not only that, when I called Microsoft and they agreed that I did not receive any product (a new Product Key) they refused to refund my $99.99. They told me I had to call my credit card company and dispute payment. Can you believe it?!

<p>
</p><p>I don't ask this to be pretentious, but how do you get your email?&nbsp; I know, like, my email server has spam and junk mail filters.&nbsp; One of the options is to automatically delete spam, and I do think it says junk mail, as well.&nbsp; I can choose the online spam
 folder&nbsp;for that email or I can have the spam noted as so in the subject line of&nbsp;the email and have it delivered to my inbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen Microsoft items in my online spam folder, meaning those folks who have it deleted automatically don't see the email at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 7 Pro. I received a receipt with a product key.&nbsp; I did the Windows Anytime Upgrade but isn't it considered retail purchase from the Windows Store?</p>

<p>
</p><p>and the biggest shame of all is that after all this frustration, in the end ...</p>
<p>windows 10 is not worth upgrading to, i wouldnt pay 50.00 for it let alone 200.00</p>

            <p><span>Hiya Brenda…</span></p>
<p><span><br />
A retail purchase always produces an order number – Yes I have one.</span></p>
<p><span>An order date – Yes I have one.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
The purchase price – Yes I have that documented. In fact I just accessed my MicrosoftStore account, the order is still there, I have a screen shot.
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Can you not produce the confirmation that your order was placed and paid for? – Yes I can.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
What about producing a PayPal statement?&nbsp; - Yes I have one.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
I'm sure a purchase is not going to simply drop off your PayPal account or credit card statement … Brenda, I agree, it's just that Microsoft refuses to do anything about it.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Here's the thing…. Microsoft refused to give me an email address so I could send them all the info. Microsoft refused to provide a real first and last name of a contact for any of this. In fact, I had to give my email address over and over again. Do you know
 what it takes to give someone who is not a native English speaker your email address, over and over again?</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Brenda.. Did you see / listen to that YouTube video of that guy where it took like an hour to tell Comcast he wanted to terminate his service? &nbsp;My interaction with Microsoft was 1000 times worse!</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Think about it, Microsoft has my $99.99 and has flat out refused to refund my money even though they agreed I didn't receive any product. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><br />
My conversations with Microsoft after hours and hours of effort, &nbsp;where I restated the &nbsp;issues over and over again, after countless dropped phone calls during transfer to yet another department, this has been a clear representation of gross incompetence on
 both on an administrative and technical level.</span></p>

            <p>Hi George,</p>
<p>
</p><p>$99.00 is the price for the Windows 10 Pro Pack.&nbsp; Is this what you ordered?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have to say, you can search until you are blind and will not find a way to purchase the Windows 10 Pro Pack.&nbsp; You can search until you are blind and will not find a way to upgrade from Home to Pro, only offers to purchase Windows 10 pro for $199.00.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found this on my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click on Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update&nbsp;&amp; Security &gt; Activation.&nbsp; When I click on that
<strong>Go To Store </strong>button, I get this page.</p>

</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a9d3f93f-c9ea-49df-a119-062766f25fc9" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you paid $99.00, this is what you would have&nbsp;gotten, the Upgrade to Windows 10 Pro.&nbsp; There are links in this forum that are supposed links to Windows 10 Pro Pack, but when you click on them, all you get is a webpage in the Microsoft Store advertising
 Windows 10 and the upgrade to Windows 10.&nbsp; I have found no way on that page to upgrade from Windows 10 to Windows 10 Pro.&nbsp; This is that link.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Brenda… Thanks for taking the time and interest……</span></p>
<p><span>You said: Do you see where it asks for the product key in that image above?&nbsp; Something is not right.&nbsp; If you got an order confirmation with an order number, etc, it should have contained a
 product key for a retail purchase.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So over the years there has been a distinct difference between standard or home editions and Pro. I get it. I have always purchased Pro editions. In the days of CD/DVDs they always shipped
 with Product Keys. Now buying product is different, yet the reality is that Product Keys still play a critical role in an install.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Today, there seems to be a disconnect at Microsoft on how a simple &nbsp;upgrade from Win 10 Home to Win 10 Pro is executed. Not only at the PC level, but at a systems level. By that I mean, some
 of my Microsoft sources have told me that if you follow the Microsoft standard, and while net connected, following the system prompts to upgrade, at the prompt for payment, I selected PayPal, I believe the data connection and validation of the payment, failed.
 In order to complete the upgrade from Win 10 Home to Win 10 Pro, you need a Win 10 Pro Product Key. If that payment connection had succeeded, my understanding is I would have gotten an eMail from Microsoft WITH a Win 10 Pro Product Key. Done.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I did get a receipt email but…. Microsoft claims they do not see my order or payment in their systems. Yet the order is in my Microsoft Store account, I can see it now, it's still there, I
 have screen shots</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Microsoft operators even gave me a hard time because my order confirming email said Order id: and they said it had to say Order number: and told me that my order id number is not a real order
 number. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When I said, if you give me your email address I can forward the mail to you, they said, we can't do that….</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There really are two central issues here. First I cannot get someone on the phone that understands the issue and or has the authority and capacity to resolve the issue. Second, the technical
 issue of the correct way to upgrade from Windows 10 home to Pro, and there is more than one way.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So in essence you're agreeing with me, I think... &nbsp; What should have happened didn't and I can't get to any resolution at all. I mean talking to them on the phone is a complete waste of time.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here's a company based in Seattle, a major American company, and I can't find anyone who speaks English well enough, or who cares enough, and or has the authority to fix a simple problem.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It's pretty depressing. For many many years I have been a Microsoft fan. I have never ever had this kind of issue with a Windows OS install and I have done hundreds of them. My son, a recent
 computer science graduate of UC Berkeley hates Microsoft and I always wondered how my son… could hate Microsoft; now I know why.&nbsp;</span><span>This kind of corporate incompetence is inexcusable.</span></p>

            <p>You may not have any other choice but to dispute the charge with PayPal.&nbsp; I received a replacement credit card today and while reading the literature that came with it, I thought about your message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The card was updated to a smart chip technology and the literature was concerning that, but it also referred to the everyday stuff that are the perks that come with your card, like fraud protection and extended warranty for your purchase, another year added
 to whatever warranty you got in the first place.&nbsp; I suppose your credit card company would assist you if you didn't receive anything at all.&nbsp; Hopefully PayPal can help you with this.&nbsp; I don't know what their policies are, though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Those people you spoke with on the phone.....they are usually reading from a book or a manual of some sort.&nbsp; I don't think anyone is deliberately trying to rip you off.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps PayPal support is the next step for you.</p>

            <p>Hello Greg… I didn't get what I paid for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the thing. What I got was 100% incompetence from Microsoft Corp. I spent
<strong>FIVE hours on the phone</strong> with Tech Support. I went to a Microsoft Retail store. And what I got was incompetence and stupidity. Sorry, just being real.</p>
<p><br />
Look, I solved my problem. I've got Windows 10 Pro installed on two of my machines, one more to go. But I have to say, after 30 years in IT (storage not desktop) it's pretty disappointing to see such a revered and now old… corporation be so self-serving and
 &nbsp;riddled with incompetence. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So you're thinking why he is saying incompetence all the time. Well, because aside from the complete lack of technical expertise, I can't even remember how many times Microsoft said to me, "Oh, just hold on I'll transfer you." And then of course, they drop
 the call. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Its probably been 10 years since I called anyone for support, and overall, I can fix anything. This was / is, a licensing thing, a product key thing, which both Microsoft and their support staff don't seem to know how it works in the real world, not in a
 lab, but in the real world. </p>
<p>
</p><p>And if you think that any day in this century or the next... &nbsp;that I would call Microsoft Corporation for telephone support, think again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I covered this delightful experience on my blog.... &nbsp;someday one of our great industry rags will pick it up and then maybe this issue will get some attention.&nbsp;</p>

<p>original title: PRINTER PROBLEM IN WINDOWS MAIL</p>
I can't print my messages in Windows Mail. I am on Windows Vista. I had a problem with a file that was too big to sent and it created all kinds of problem. I ran a registry clean-up and I think that's what started my problem. When I press the printer button
 nothing happen and everything freeze. I have to go into Task Manager to close Windows Mail. I have no problems printing any where else. I assume there is a problem of configuration in Windows Mail regarding printing. However I don't know where to look.&nbsp;

I can't print my messages in Windows Mail. I am on Windows Vista. I had a problem with a file that was too big to sent and it created all kinds of problem. I ran a registry clean-up and I think that's what started my problem. When I press the printer button
 nothing happen and everything freeze. I have to go into Task Manager to close Windows Mail. I have no problems printing any where else. I assume there is a problem of configuration in Windows Mail regarding printing. However I don't know where to look.&nbsp;

<p><strong><span>Hi MOETHETOE,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>In addition to suggestions provided by Steve Cochran y</span></strong><span><span>ou
 can also perform a SFC (System File Checker) scan. It will list any issues and will also recover any system files if needed.<br />
<strong>Follow the below steps to</strong> <strong>p</strong></span><strong><span>erform a SFC Scan</span></strong><span>&nbsp;-</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click&nbsp;<strong>Start</strong>,
 click&nbsp; <strong>All Programs</strong>, click &nbsp;<strong>Accessories</strong>, right-click&nbsp;<strong>Command Prompt</strong>, and then click&nbsp;
<strong>Run&nbsp;as administrator</strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click&nbsp;<strong>Allow</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Type
 the following command, and then press ENTER:</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>sfc /scannow&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>A message will appear stating that 'The system scan will begin'. Be patient because the scan may take some time</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>If
 any files require a replace SFC will replace them. You may be asked to insert your Win7 DVD for this process to continue</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>d.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>If
 everything is okay you should, after the scan, see the following message "Windows resource protection did not find any integrity violations"&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>e.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>After
 the scan has completed, close the command prompt window, restart the computer and check.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Check the below mentioned link for further guidance on SFC scan -<br />

<p>I have done what you suggested but it return a message to the effect that id did find&nbsp; some problems with some of the file but it could not fix it. It mention to look at a directory called: windows\logs\cbs\cbs.log Unfortunately I can not find that file.
 I find windows\logs\cbs but the cbs.log is not there. Any other place it could be or any other&nbsp; suggestion to resolve the problem</p>

<p>i LOOK AT THOSE ARTICLES. THEY ARE SOMEWHAT COMPLICATED FOR ME. WOULD DEINSTALLING WINDOWS MAIL AND REINSTALLING FIX THE PROBLEM. HOWEVER, I DO NOT WANT TO LOSE SOME OF THE FILES I HAVE IN THE WINDOWS MAIL FOLDER. SHOULD I RENAME THIS FOLDER FIRST.</p>

<p>Moethetoe,</p>
<p>If your issue started after using a registry cleaner, you could preform a System Restore back to when your printer was printing correctly. For information and steps on how to open System Restore, have a look at the following link:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/What-is-System-Restore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/What-is-System-Restore</a></p>
<p>Let me know if that helps!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I have registry kit software several time since then. The settings was such that it would start the scanning as soon as I openend it. If I did a restore would it go back to the last one or is there a feature to select a date from where you
 can restore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am usinf Mozilla Firefox browser and I was thinking of migrating to Mozilla Thunderbird email. Do you think that might solve the problem.</p>

<p>Moethetoe,</p>
<p>When you open System Restore, it will present a calendar. From there you can choose how far back you would like to restore to (assuming the restore points exist for that date).</p>
<p>I'm not sure if switching to Thunderbird would resolve the printing issue. Personally, I'd try the system restore first since it's a pretty effortless fix.</p>

<div>No. Windows Mail is part of the Vista operating system (OS). You would have to reinstall Vista.</div>
<div>I suggest you try out Windows Live Mail:</div>
<div><a href="http://explore.live.com/windows-live-mail?os=other" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://explore.live.com/windows-live-mail?os=other</a></div>
<div>It will automatically import all your Windows Mail data. </div>
