<h2>            print out same size as original scanned document on windows 7</h2>
                    When I scan a letter size page and save it as jpeg it will not print the same size as the original.&nbsp; So when I&nbsp;email a pattern that needs to be the original size, the recipient can not print it out the original size.&nbsp; I never had this trouble with windows
 xp, but I do with windows7.&nbsp; My printer/scanner is a hp psc 750xi.&nbsp;

            <p>Normally I would say, download the Windows 8 driver for your graphics card, but AMD have yet to release a Windows 8 driver for that particular card. Another option may be to install the Windows 7 driver in compatibility with Windows 7. To do that, download
 the Windows 7 driver, but do not run it, save it to your desktop. Right click the driver install on your desktop and select properties. Select the compatibility tab check the box "run this program in compatibility mode for:" and select Windows 7 from the drop
 down menu. Then run the installation like&nbsp;you would any other.&nbsp;Hope this helps.</p>

    <title>Game Won&#39;t Install &#43; Different Game Won&#39;t Open - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> charlie__777  say:</h3>
<h2>            Game Won&#39;t Install &#43; Different Game Won&#39;t Open</h2>
                    <p>I recently bought a few games from a used game store. All of the games except one have installed without any issues. The game stopped installing at 50% or less and I can’t cancel or uninstall
 it (I've clicked uninstall and cancel but nothing happens). I tried downloading it digitally but it also got stuck. I have enough space in my external storage so I’m not sure what the issue is. I tried downloading it offline, I cold booted it and restarted
 it. The game might be damaged or corrupted but I’ve also had problems with this game affecting one of my other games. I’ve had this other game for about a year and it installed with no problems. Now, sometimes it doesn’t pop up at all in my menu like it uninstalled.
 Other times it did pop up but nothing would happen if I clicked it. I’m mostly worried about the game that was perfectly fine until I tried to install the new game. My other games work fine after trying to download this new one. It might be because the game
 I've had for about a year needs an update. How do I completely remove the new game which is stuck installing? How do I fix the game that suddenly stopped working/popping up?</p>
<p>The game I was trying to install is Shadow of Mordor and the game that won't open is Assassin's Creed Odyssey.</p>

<li>Press the <strong>Xbox</strong> button to open the guide.</li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong>System &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Console info</strong>. </li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong>Reset console</strong>.&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>Make sure to select "Keep my games &amp; apps" and have&nbsp;the correct&nbsp;account login information plus your Wi-Fi password ready if you connect wireless because&nbsp;you will need to re-add the account's that were on the Xbox&nbsp;and re-connect to your network during the

<p>Hello Charlie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If none of the above options have worked for you. Then we recommend a <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
full factory reset</a>. This will delete all games, apps, profiles from the Xbox. Then you can start from scratch installing. As this will get rid of the install you cant, and the game that isn't working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brad</p>

<p>In order to get the 200 MS points, and 250 Bing rewards points, you have to be part of the program for at least 30 days. That is all within the ToS of the updated program.

    <title>Reserved Windows 10 Update For My Windows 8.1, Had A Problem, Could - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bernardjari  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reserved Windows 10 Update For My Windows 8.1, Had A Problem, Could Not Restart&#47;Boot Acer Aspire One Netbook,  Installed Windows 10 Pro Technical Preview Build 10041, Can&#39;t Activate It&#63;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;Well, I had purchased an Acer Aspire One Netbook, which had Windows 8 in it, and it upgraded to 8.1.</p>
<p>I saw the Windows Icon, reserved my Windows 10 upgrade/update, but I later ran into a problem, so I tried running a Restore Point, in attempt to correct the problem, and it said that the Restore was successful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, after it said that it was going to restart my PC/Netbook, the Netbook would not restart, stated some sort of error message, like maybe 0oxc000021A, or something like that, and switching how it booted/started up, it then said that there wasn't a
 bootable device, so I could not restart the netbook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what I did was, I did have, on my desktop PC at home, a copy of the ISO file for Windows 10 Pro Technical preview, Evaluation Copy, Build 100041, so I made an ISO image file, for my 4 GB Flash Drive, and then booted the netbook from the USB flash drive
 and then installed it on the netbook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, it won't activate, says that the activation key has been blocked, so now all I have on the netbook is the Windows 10 Technical Preview, unactivated, and now I am wondering whether I will get the Windows 10 upgrade or not, and what to do now, if
 I won't get the Windows 10 upgrade, and if I can't activate the version that I have, or if I won't be able to upgrade to a licensed/activated version of Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had already purchased, in the past, Win98SE, WIN-XP, and also had downloaded a copy of Windows 7, and had purchased an activation key for that, and do not feel like paying for Windows 10, since it has been offered for free, for a year, and I won't even
 be able to get it for the PC at home, since I do not have Internet at home.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows 7, that I have, can no longer be activated on a new installation,&nbsp; and when I tried to install Linux on the netbook, it would not allow it, and it said that it had something to do with GPT in the partition, or whatever, so I can't even install
 Linux on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, not sure what I am going to do, especially if I can no longer get a licensed Windows 10, which I had originally reserved, for the netbook, but I am wondering whether I am going to get that, now that I have the Windows 10 Pro Technical Preview installed
 in the netbook, and it won't let me activate it, and I have read about the Windows 10 upgrade, as either not needing activation, or that it will come already activated, or something on that order.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was unable to install Linux on the netbook too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well have a nice day,</p>
<p>Bernie</p>

            Thanks for the reply, and yes, I had, just before reading your reply, clicked on where it talks about it, and I clicked on the link, and it came back with a message stating that I had Windows 8, even though I have the Windows 10 Preview installed, and
 to get the Windows 10 upgrade, it said to upgrade to Windows 8.1 first, then I could get it, and it says that I can do other things, while I wait for the upgrade to finish, and that they would let me know when it was finished, or something like that, so I
 am waiting to see if that works, but I think that I am trying exactly what you told me to do, even though I had started it before reading your message to me, but anyway, I am in the "store" right now, and I have clicked on the 8.1 download, so am now waiting
 to see if it works or not, but while the download was going, I then had finished downloading my E-Mail, so was just reading your reply, and again, I think that I had started what you had said to do, and I think that I had already done what you had said to
 do, or at least something similar to it, but thanks for your reply.<br />

            But yes, after trying to run a Restore Point, the netbook could not be started, even said that there was no boot-able device, after switching to the other way of booting, so I ended up burning an ISO image to my USB flash drive, so I could boot the Aspire
 One Netbook, and it was a fresh install, instead of an upgrade, so thanks, and I did click on where it talks about if I can't get Windows activated, and it went to the "Store," and said that I had Windows 8, and to then download Windows 8.1 first. and then
 agree to the terms, etc. So if it works, I guess that I will be all set.

            <p>Well, it didn't work, I installed Windows 8/8.1, and it did run, but one version asked for the activation license key, which I didn't know, since I had no documentation for that, when I bought the Acer Aspire One Netbook, there wasn't anything to indicate
 what the key was. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I tried a different version, and then it worked, ran it, and even entered a "good" license key, which I found by using a program that "retrieves" the key for me, Produkey, or something like that, was the name of the program, and it did show an OEM
 key, that was the BIOS OEM key, but after the Windows 8/8.1 installs, and after it accepts the key, the install "gets stuck," where it gives me some sort of message talking about not being able to detect, or set up, or access, or whatever, can't remember the
 exact wording, but basically, it can't set up the connected devices, or something like that, and it says that something went wrong, so it still doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I am still stuck using the Windows 10 Pro Technical Preview, Build 10041, that I only installed because I had that, was thinking about trying it, but hadn't tried it yet, but needed to use it, because of making the mistake of running a Restore Point,
 to get rid of a problem that I was having, where I could not solve any other way, so I felt that I had two choices to try, either running a Restore Point, which I now regret doing, because after running the Restore Point, it rendered the Netbook UN-bootable,
 so I was stuck using the Pro Technical Preview,&nbsp; to boot the Netbook from the 4 GB USB Flash Drive that I have, and installed the Pro Technical Preview, so I could get the Netbook to run, or to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, now the Netbook, or even my desktop PC at home, can't even detect the USB Flash Drive as a Hard Drive anymore, and sees it as a USB storage device, so now I can't even boot the Netbook from the USB drive anymore, plus I can't even delete files on
 the USB drive, and can't even format the USB drive, or anything else, like the USB Flash drive doesn't even show up in the ISO to USB program, so I could burn an ISO image to the Flash drive either, and the Netbook will not boot from the USB Flash drive anymore
 either, even going to the Netbook's BIOS, telling the Netbook to boot from the USB Flash drive, which shows up in the BIOS, but the Netbook no longer will boot from the Flash drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now I do not know what to do.</p>

<h2>            upgrading to Windows 10 on a computer that is running windows 7 previously upgraded from Vista.</h2>
                    I bought my computer just as Windows 7 was being released. It was running Vista but came with a free upgrade for windows 7. The windows 7 upgrade&nbsp;came with a product key and has been loaded and activated. Now I am trying to upgrade to windows 10. All the

<h2>            Very Slow Download Speed From Marketplace</h2>
                    
<p>I've seen many posts about people getting slow download speeds over xbox live and I've tried every remedy I could find. My internet package is 60/4 but every speed test I do over xbox live, I get an average of 10Mbps DL no matter what time of day/night.
 The highest I've seen it get is 30, but that was a rare occurrence. The upload speed always tests to where it should be. Every large download takes many hours to complete and even if my speed is testing lower than it should be, it still shouldn't take as long
 as it is taking to download.</p>

<p>So I guess what I am asking, is there anything I may be overlooking in improving my connection to xbox live? My last attempt was putting my Xbox in my router's DMZ. I still saw no improvement. Thanks for any suggestions.</p>

<p>I would go into your router as an admin and use port forward. Here are the ports
</p>
<p>Xbox Live requires the following ports to be open:</p>
<p>Port 88 (UDP) </p>
<p>Port 3074 (UDP and TCP) </p>
<p>Port 53 (UDP and TCP) </p>
<p>Port 80 (TCP) </p>
<p>How to set up port forwarding</p>
<p>You may find information how to open ports on your router at the Port Forward website. Go to the Port Forwarding Guides for Xbox Live 360 page to find instructions for your router.</p>
<p>If your router is not listed on the Port Forward website, contact your Internet service provider or router manufacturer for help with opening network ports.</p>
<p>Tip The Port Forward website is available only in English. To translate the site, copy and paste the URL (www.portforward.com) into a translation tool, such as Bing Translator.</p>
<p>For more help with opening network ports, contact whoever provides support for your router, such as your Internet service provider or router manufacturer.</p>

            Hi KarenZZHH,
<br />
<br />As it is a recent purchase, it may be under warranty. Best to contact ViewSonic. They will also be able to provide the best driver for it.

<p>Hi,</p>

</p><p>If you are unable to install specific cumulative updates, you can download them manually one by one. Visit this site:
<a href="https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Home.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Update Catalog</a> and search for the specific KB update that doesn’t installed yet on your computer. Once you’ve found it, start downloading and install it.</p>

<p>One of my Dell XPS systems has had a problem installing the Fall Creators Update for months without success. Although, I really didn't care if I had that update or not, on about January 22nd a window started appearing forcing me to install the latest Win10
 security updates because I did not installed the Creators update. After trying every thing I could think of including having Dell verify all of my drivers I was ready to try a Clean install and go through the grief of restoring all of my apps.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I decided I would take the time today and manually verify that every single driver was up to date. After methodically going through every single driver I found that the Dell WiFi driver and the Realtek Network driver both needed updating. After
 updating both drivers and rebooting I was finally successful in installing KB4057142.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My point here is that even though you may not have a Dell XPS system it does not appear that neither Dell and/or Microsoft is capable of successfully detecting that drivers originally shipped with this PC are invalid. I personally believe that since Windows
 Update continuously initiated the Creators update and the subsequent Security Updates one should find it reasonable for them to detect the out of date drivers that worked fine for the previous build.</p>

1)&nbsp;Press Windows + X on the keyboard.<br />
2)&nbsp;Select Control Panel.<br />
3)&nbsp;Select Troubleshooting.<br />
4)&nbsp;Click on Run maintenance task under System and Security.</div>

3.&nbsp;To determine if the disk needs to be defragmented or not, click Analyze disk.&nbsp; If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
Once Windows is finished analyzing the disk, you can check the percentage of fragmentation on the disk in the Last Run column. If the number is above 10%, you should defragment the disk.<br />
4.&nbsp;Click Defragment disk.&nbsp; If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />

<h2>            Active window doesn&#39;t display on top</h2>
                    I have two different laptops, which have the same problem after upgrading to Windows 10 ... selecting a window to make it the new active window will frequently NOT be displayed on top, and will be blocked by other windows. &nbsp;The only solution is to constantly
 minimize all windows by displaying the desktop and then selecting a window from the taskbar. &nbsp;I never had this problem with Windows 7. &nbsp;Additionally, drop-down menus in Office products, like PowerPoint, frequently do not display, and have to be repeatedly
 selected. &nbsp;In every case, the taskbars and menu items have an appearance and act like the window or drop-down menu is being displayed, but they cannot be seen. &nbsp;Sometimes, the only way to solve the problem temporarily is by restarting the program or operating
 system. &nbsp;

<h2>            Classic Logon Screen &#40;Windows 8 Standard&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I've purchased the Windows 8 Standard Edition. How do I enable the classic logon screen? You know, where instead of having all the accounts appear on a single screen at startup, you have to type in individual usernames and passwords.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I search this over and over again on Google, every tutorial involves using secpol, that isn't in the standard edition. How do I enable the classic logon screen WITHOUT using secpol? I don't see it in the User Accounts options like it used to be. So where
 is it?</p>

If a Dell, that is the Dell Dock<br />

Look in Start &gt;Programs &gt; Look under Dell's software.<br />
<br />
Or re-download it.<br />

If a different manufacturer, look under their software.<br />

<h2>            Can&#39;t get cortana working in win 10</h2>
                    <p>I have upgraded 3 laptops to windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two laptops had windows 7 and one had windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem is I can only get Cortana to work on the laptop that was upgraded from windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other two laptops say Cortana isn't supported in my region.</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to the Cortana help site my region is supported.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm in the UK and my region and language is set to UK english</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked all 3 laptops and all 3 have the language set to UK english</p>
<p>
</p><p>So why wont Cortana work on the win7 laptops?</p>

            <p>For me - The issue with&nbsp;Cortana was related to other issues:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 - Edge wasn't working either, but Chrome was. Turns out that the upgrade set my WiFi as "Public" and Edge+Cortana need it to be "Private" for whatever reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Audio wasn't working. Both Mic and Speakers. Updating from Device Mgr didn't work, but going to the vendor site and updating from there did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE: I am US English and can't comment on regions where Cortana is active.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck!</p>

            <p>I just created Windows 10 installation media on a USB drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a clean install of Windows 10 on one of the effected laptops and now Cortana is working fine on that laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looks like there may be a bug in the upgrade process when upgrading from Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I have to decide whether to do another clean install on the other effected laptop or just wait and hope there is a windows update that fixes this.</p>

            <p>I've found that when I updated from windows 7 to windows 10 that Cortana would not work, again like you it stated that It was not available in my region, I eventually found out that keyboard, speech, and region must all be the same,</p>
<p>if you type into the search box "language" and select the control panal you'll have the option for "English UK" select options and update all that's in English UK, then type region into search and basically do the same, it seems that on the windows 7 download
 it does not scan for this item and causes this issue with Cortana, the only issue I have now is that I have no speech back from Cortana so I'm searching for the fix for that.</p>

<p>I INITIALLY THOUGHT THAT I HAD THE English Language&nbsp; pack installed that is what the&nbsp;ENG icon in bottom tool bar was telling me. I eventually went into Settings/Region and Language, clicked on English UK, FROM THE OPTIONS Downloaded English UK language pack.
 Cortana appeared after that and is working correctly, even, Hey Cortana, hope this helps. I have had 2 other replies from another forum, saying this fixed it for them as well.</p>

            <p>Hi. I have had the same problem but have just solved it!</p>
<p>You have to download the Language pack for the UK (I am in the UK so thought it was odd).</p>
<p>Press Start</p>
<p>Settings</p>
<p>Time and language</p>
<p>Region and Language</p>
<p>under related issues go to regional settings</p>
<p>Language .. press add a language</p>
<p>press options.....it then shows a box to download language for uk for windows 10</p>
<p>download then restart pc</p>
<p>press start all apps and Cortana should be there</p>
<p>Hope it works for you</p>

<h2>            Windows compatibility modes &#40;Win 7&#41; - what do they &#42;actually&#42; do&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    I've been wondering about this for awhile, but it came to a head last weekend when I've been trying to get an old game to work successfully.&nbsp; One set of people are recommending set compatibility mode to "Vista SP2", another group says "no, that won't work,
 you have to use WinXP SP2 mode, but *not* SP3".<br />
<br />
So, what exactly do each of these compatibility modes do to Windows 7 ??

Hi,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Program compatibility is a mode in Windows that lets you run programs written for earlier versions of Windows. Most programs written for Windows XP also work in this version of Windows, but some older programs might run poorly or not run at all.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If an older program doesn't run correctly, start the Program Compatibility Wizard to simulate earlier versions of Windows.<br />
1. Open the Program Compatibility Wizard by clicking the Start button , clicking Control Panel, clicking Programs, and then clicking Use an older program with this version of Windows.
<br />

            Yep, that's certainly what the Microsoft website says, but I was actually asking what these modes *do* to the system, not what is the generic conceptual reason for having the options present.<br />
<br />
I think most people have had the experience of trying to run an older program under Windows 7, find it doesn't work, get told to use compatibility mode, switch to "Vista SP2" compatibility, find that it fails differently, try "XP SP2" compatibility, find that
 it fails yet differently again, try "Windows 98 SE" compatibility, find that it fails the same as one of the other modes, and just give up.<br />
<br />
That's why I'm asking this technical forum what are the actual differences, in the settings of the operation system, in the different compatibility modes.&nbsp; I'd be satisfied just to have answers for "Vista SP2" and "XP SP2", compared with non-compatibility modes.&nbsp;
 That is the answer that I cannot find on the MSDN site.

            So what does it mean, that no answers are available for this question?&nbsp; I felt it would be reasonable to ask what the different compatibility modes do on the machine; is it classified information?&nbsp; Or does nobody really know?

<p><span>Hi</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for using Microsoft Windows Vista Forums.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I will require some additional information to assist you better.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>Ø<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have any changes been made to you computer recently?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 1:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow
</span><span>the instructions below from
<strong>safe</strong> <strong>mode</strong> to restore your computer to an earlier state.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Turn the computer on or Restart the computer
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Start tapping the F8 key. The Windows Advanced Boot Options Menu appears.</span></p>
<p><span>If you begin tapping the F8 key too soon, some computers display a "keyboard error" message. To resolve
 this, restart the computer and try again. </span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Ensure that the Safe mode option is selected.</span></p>
<p>
