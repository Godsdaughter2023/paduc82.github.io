<h2>            Windows 7 migration from HDD to SSD</h2>
                    <p>Hello, everyone!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The time has come to update my hardware. After I cloned my system partition from HDD to SSD&nbsp;AOMEI Partition Assistant Technician Edition 7.5 I disconnected my HDD and booted from SSD. I was greeted with a warning that my copy of Windows 7 was not genuine
 and the sustem failed to load any further. My copy of Windows 7 came with MS Action Pack and is authentic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible at all to migrate your system from HDD to SSD? Or do I simply fail to conduct this operation properly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It should not be a problem to clone your Win 7 to a SSD... This should not trigger an activation error all in itself...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that there was a problem with the cloning process...</p>
<p>If your HDD has more than one partition... One with DATA for instance...</p>
<p>It is possible that some of the needed files are stored there...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had issues in the past where simply unhooking a secondary HDD would cause a boot failure... Because it was attached during the installation of Win 7, there were additional boot files stored on it...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I no longer install windows with any additional drives attached as a result...</p>
<p>I hook them up later..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't used the program you mention, but you might have better luck imaging your HDD and loading the image onto the SSD...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might also have better luck if you were to do your cloning\imaging by booting with the Aomei program..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because your SSD is probably plugged into a different SATA Port, that could cause a boot problem as well, but should not generate a activation problem..</p>

<p>This should change your external IP address:</p>
<p>0) From a computer visit www.ipchicken.com to check to see what it is </p>
<p>1) turn off the Xbox and unplug the power supply cord from the back of the Xbox then</p>
<p>2) unplug power from the router (Some folks have a combination modem-router AKA 'gateway' or only use a modem with no router. If either, skip steps 3 &amp; 6).</p>
<p>3) unplug power from the modem.</p>
<p>4) Wait at least 5 minutes then replug the modem/gateway power.</p>
<p>5) Wait 'til the light on the front of the modem/gateway which says BROADBAND, ONLINE, READY, CABLE or DSL is on solid (not flashing), then plug in the router. If you have a gateway instead of a modem and router or a modem with no router, then when that
 light says it's ready, skip to step 7.</p>
<p>6) Wait until the WiFi light on the router is on; you may or may not use WiFi, but it's still a good indicator your router is finished booting up.</p>
<p>7) Plug in and turn on the Xbox.</p>
<p>8) From a computer, revisit www.ipchicken.com - if not different that seen before iin step 0) please call your ISP to ask them how to change the external IP address.</p>

<p>OBTW, if he got your name and address, it's because he obtained your password from somewhere, and I also suggest going to
<a href="http://account.live.com/password/reset" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">account.live.com/.../reset</a> and changing your password. Then, discuss this with the Xbox LIVE agents (Option 2) which you can call by dialing the number listed for your country

<h2>            How to get access to the Internet using Huawei USB Stick&#63;</h2>
                    How to get access to the Internet using Huawei USB Stick?<br />
<br />
I am running Windows 7.<br />
I have a Huawei E3372 Mobile Broadband LTE USB Stick.<br />
When I plug it in to my computer's USB 3 port, the light is solid cyan. Service is active.<br />
I can access the setup page.<br />
Data is flowing to the internet provider.<br />
<br />
If I leave my computer connected to my local Internet provider I have Local Area Connection 2 listed.<br />
When I plug in my Huawei USB Stick, I get a secon connection.<br />
It is called Local Area Connection 6.<br />
Now if I disable Local Area Connection 2 and leave Local Area Connection 6 enabled, I get no Internet connectivity.<br />
If I re-enable Local Area Connection 2, Internet connectivity returns.<br />
<br />
What do I need to do to get connectivity activated from the USB Stick?<br />
<br />
Once a few days ago, I was able to ping 8.8.8.8 and tracert 8.8.8.8 successfully.<br />
Now it does nothing.<br />
It times out.<br />
<br />
I tried to bridge connection 2 and connection 6.<br />
That did not work either.<br />

<h3> a1confused  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do you set up a Virtual port on Vista&#63;</h2>
                    I am trying to set up a virtual com port to get my Tungsten E2 to work with my Dell Studio 1537 which has Bluetooth capability.&nbsp; I have looked at&nbsp;Palm, Bluetooth, and various other sources of web based info that is out there but I can't seem to get a straight
 answer.&nbsp; I have successfully been able to make both my TE2 and laptop "discoverable" and have been paired.&nbsp; When I try to HotSync it (I am using the latest version for this), they start to communicate and then it asks me for the password.&nbsp; I type in the password
 I used for both PDA and laptop and I still get "Invalid Password.&nbsp; This handheld cannot be synchonized without a valid password."&nbsp;&nbsp; I have tried removing and then adding myTE2 many times to the Bluetooth software, sometimes with a password and sometimes w/o
 one. I have done the same with the PDA itself.&nbsp; Quite frankly I'm out of answers.&nbsp; Incidentally, I'm only assuming I need a virtual com port b/c&nbsp; I needed it when I was HotSyncing on Windows XP.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I almost forgot to mention that I have updated the drivers of the Bluetooth, also.<br />
<br />
I want to do this wirelessly which is why I've been trying very hard to do this.&nbsp; I have Vista 32-bit OS and&nbsp;my TE2&nbsp;is Garnet OS v.5.4.7&nbsp; &nbsp;Please help.<br />

<h2>            When I switch tabs from a dark colored screen to a brighter screen the screen takes a few seconds to brighten...</h2>
                    So I have a weird screen issue where the screen brightness keeps adjusting based on how bright or dark the screen is...so when I switch from a dark screen to a brighter screen the screen seems to have dimmed and takes a few seconds to brighten to the correct
 brightness setting. &nbsp;Does anyone know how to fix this? &nbsp;Adaptive brightness is turned off. &nbsp;

<p>I'm having some other random problems so I'm starting to think it has to do with me.</p>
<p>Maybe not but I'm sure I'll find out eventually. When I do I'll be back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having new problem now with bing.com but I can get that to work but not in anyway that makes sense.</p>
<p>I tried disabling my addons and got into bing but undid that action and still got in then restart and sometimes got in but sometimes didn't&nbsp; with same things disabled or enabled.</p>
<p>Bing is saying</p>
<p>(An error occurred during a connection to www.bing.com. Invalid OCSP signing certificate in OCSP response. Error code: SEC_ERROR_OCSP_INVALID_SIGNING_CERT)
</p>
<p>When it blocks me, Not something I'm real familiar with. </p>
<p>Somehow just the fact that I made changes to my settings lets me in but not always.</p>
<p>It doesn't seem to matter what changes I make.</p>
<p>So far those are my only problems.</p>

<h2>            HP Laserjet CM1415fnw does not print wirelessly</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: HP Laserjet CM1415fnw</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My printer has stopped printing wirelessly from my PC (but prints OK when connected with a&nbsp;CAT5 lead)&nbsp;. My PC is connected to the (BTHomeHub)wireless router, I can browse it and get into config. My Printer shows it is connected to the router with the correct
 SSID,&nbsp;and passes the HP Wireless Network Test on all counts. I have set the printer to have a fixed IP address in case it was a DHCP problem and set a static IP address reservation in the router. However, in advanced router settings, the router says the printer
 is not connected and I can't ping the router from my PC. It was working fine until recently. Any ideas?? Thx.</p>

<h2>            Unable to get sound on the computer-No sound device</h2>
                    <div>
<p>So I lost my sound devices after following few advices from the community and now I'm left without anything. My sound device which used to be named Realtek High Definition Audio or something similar is now named Audio Device on High Definition Audio Bus.
 This happened after I downloaded the following link: http://www.realtek.com.tw/downloads/downloadsView.aspx?Langid=1&amp;PNid=24&amp;PFid=24&amp;Level=4&amp;Conn=3&amp;DownTypeID=3&amp;GetDown=false<br />
As I click the second option which is&nbsp;<strong>64bits Vista, Windows7, Windows8, Windows8.1&nbsp;Driver only (Executable file)
</strong>, my computer is Windows 7 64-Bit. So after I install this, they told me to restart and so I did it. And what I'm left with is the Audio sign with a "!" sign in a yellow triangle,as I click it, it say:<br />
This device is not configured correctly. (Code 1)<strong><br />
</strong><br />
To find a driver for this device, click Update Driver.<br />
<br />
I tried updating, they say mine is up to date. When I right click Audio Device on High Definition Audio bus, it has an option called Scan for hardware changes, I click it. A new box called Driver Software Installation, it showed Audio Device on High Definition
 Audio bus Failed with a red cross sign. What do I do ? I'm so fustrated with this. When I right click on the Sound Icon on the toolbar and go Volume Control Option or any other option, I do not have any Audio Device which is the main problem, because of it,
 I can't hear anything. I need an answer as soon as possible please. Thank you.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

            <p>You should be able to roll back your system with&nbsp;<em>System Restore</em> but I typically let Windows start with a 'clean slate' by locating the sound device in Device Manager and right-click, Uninstall. Subsequently rebooting the computer should allow Windows
 to 'discover' the 'new' hardware and reinstall it. Allow a search through&nbsp;<em>Windows Update</em> should get you a stable driver that is compatible with your system,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've heard of others that have had to temporarily disable their anti-virus to achieve a correct installation but I've never had this trouble myself.</p>

            So I tried what you told me, even the one which is disabling my anti-virus. It did not 'discover' any 'new' hardware, after I reboot my computer. What else should I do ? When I right click Troubleshoot sound problems, they say it couldn't identify any
 problem, probably it's because they can't scan my Audio Driver which can't be found by the computer but it is there though.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0fed8a19-3a31-425f-a8b1-cb3f226fc206" />

            Okay, so I just did something which may help a little. I delete the whole file of the Audio Device on High Definition Audio bus and reinstall. It kind of work I guess ? No "!" in a yellow triangle. But now, the problem is when I troubleshoot it, it says
 The Audio Device is disabled. When I go back to the Device Manager, it is enabled, so I disabled it and enabled it but still, it says it is disabled. What am I suppose to do now ?

<p>So I tried Method 1 and 2. Troubleshooting didn't work. Re-installing did not help. I don't know what is the Model of my laptop though, the brand is Acer. I tried to update my driver and this happened.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Thank you for your update on the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the <strong>make and model number</strong> of your computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Code 1 error means that the system has not had a chance to configure the device. To resolve the problem,&nbsp;remove the device in Device Manager, and then run the
<strong>Add New Hardware </strong>wizard from Control Panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To enable any disabled audio devices in the system, try to follow these steps:</p>

<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, click <strong>Control Panel</strong> and select

    <title>x64 Windows 10 Intel HD Graphics Drivers - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            x64 Windows 10 Intel HD Graphics Drivers</h2>
                    <p>Hi, having a problem with x64 Windows 10 and Intel HD graphics.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a Thinkpad T410 Core i5 with integrated Intel HD graphics.</p>
<p>I'm stuck on the basic graphics card driver or the generic VGA card driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows update looks like it's trying to update to the Intel drivers, but fails with:</p>
<p>Intel corporation driver update for intel(r) hd graphics - error 0x80246007</p>
<p>
</p><p>Searches&nbsp;suggest removing graphics card using device manager&nbsp;- then retrying, but this doesn't solve, it&nbsp;just repeats with same&nbsp;error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also tried downloading the drivers directly from Intel:</p>
<p><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/25150/Intel-Iris-Iris-Pro-and-HD-Graphics-Production-Driver-for-Windows-10-64-bit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/25150/Intel-Iris-Iris-Pro-and-HD-Graphics-Production-Driver-for-Windows-10-64-bit</a>
 and selecting the .inf file to update directly, but get a 'failed to update' error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you use Setup.exe in the Intel .zip file, it gives you 'Computer does not meet minimum requirements for installing this software' - so perhaps Intel driver does not like final Windows 10 release.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Had 32 bit Windows 10 on yesterday and all OK, so seems to be an x64 problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone had similar or have been able to resolve?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi, good shout - tried this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately no luck... Still 'The computer does not meet the minimum requirements'</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Update installs all updates - except for the Intel HD driver (this one) there is some problem with it that means that it will not update automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing - this only affects x64 Windows 10.&nbsp; The 32bit Windows / HD driver from Intel does work correctly.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Well, I'm <em>fairly </em>sure that Windows 10 is now out of beta.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per original post I downloaded the drivers directly from Intel - which have been updated for Windows 10</p>

    <title>Capture settings for encoder for Windows DVD Maker - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jim duncan - mcm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Capture settings for encoder for Windows DVD Maker</h2>
                    
<p>I have about 24 hours of video I need to capture in order to make some DVDs with Windows DVD Maker.</p>
<p>I am using Windows Media Encoder 9 (x64) to capture in real time via S-Video on a USB tuner/capture device (on Windows 7 Ultimate x64).</p>
<p>Currently, the encoding step in DVD Maker seems to take just as long (if not longer) than the actual capture, so&nbsp;I must be doing something wrong with the capture settings in Encoder.</p>
<p>Ideally, I would like to be able to capture/encode the video with settings that would result in DVD Maker not having to re-encode the files very much (or at all) before burning the DVD.</p>
<p>Does anyone know the encoding profile settings that DVD Maker uses so that I can match them in Encoder?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>When you are selecting a video format, the primary factor to consider is in what country/region the DVD will be played back and the video format that is used in that country/region. Many DVD players are only capable of playing DVD-Video discs that are either
 NTSC or PAL. If you or your family and friends are going to watch your DVD in a country/region that uses the PAL video format, select PAL. Similarly, if your DVD will be primarily watched in a country/region that uses the NTSC video format, select NTSC.</p>
<p>There are no other DVD encoding settings in windows DVD maker.</p>

<p>Erm, thanks for that, I guess.</p>
<p>Though you didn't really answer (read?) the question...</p>
<p>I'm NOT trying to change encoder settings in DVD Maker;&nbsp;I am trying to determine what the encoding settings used by DVD Maker actually are so that I can use the same settings when capturing, thereby reducing the time DVD Maker needs to spend on the Encoding
 phase...</p>

<h2>            hp 6500 does not work with latest windows 7 updates</h2>
                    I am using Windows 7 Professional. The latest critical update on 8/12/2011 will no longer allow me to print on my Officejet 6500 E710n-z which is connected by a USB cable. I was able to print using wireless before the update. But the printer was not recognized
 in the wireless mode after the update. As a result, I created a restore point before the update and connected the printer with the USB cable. This allowed me to print. I then reloaded the Win 7 update and could no longer print. Since there were 14 "fixes"
 in the update download, I'm not sure what to do other than using the restore point that excludes all 14. Any suggestions are welcome.<br />

Thanks, but I uninstalled the printer and reinstalled it with the software from the HP web site you reference. I did this before I put in the question. I will try again, but the problem seems to be with the two .NET Framework 4 updates for Win 7 since the other
 updates have installed with no problems.<br />

<p>I am having the same problem as you with my HP 6500. I also have discovered MS Office – Word will not launch. Excel and PP do just fine. I too tried to re-install the printer
 without luck. I did a repair on MS Office, and everything starting working fine…. Until I did a reboot, then I was back at square one. Curious, do you have word (2007), is it working? This also tells me the problem is with the update, not the HP driver.</p>

            I downloaded the latest software from the hp site and reinstalled the printer before spending two hours with hp support. They say the problem is the computer and they are not trained on computers. I have not contacted Dell and I think I'll just wait until
 someone discovers the fix and then download Win 7 updates. Did all this before posting on here.<br />

            IE9 is not installed on my system. I did download an update to the 6500 two days ago that may have helped. Have not had time to try since all is currently working well and I have installed all updates to Win 7except two .NET Framework 4 updates.<br />

    <title>Unable to Install Bluetooth Driver Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> julie r88  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to Install Bluetooth Driver Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>My Bluetooth is Intel and in the past, I've been able to install and whatnot just fine.</p>
<p>For the past few weeks, Bluetooth Device Monitor and OBEX Service have been crashing. There's been no sign of this, other than it being stated in my reliability history.
</p>
<p>I removed my phone from the device list, as it had a yellow error next to it. Well, I get the error that the windows installer package has a problem, a program run as part of the setup did not finish as expected.</p>
<p>I tried another install of a version that was a little older, same thing. I also went into control panel - uninstall a program and tried to repair and uninstall my current driver software and had gotten the same message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did the FixIt and uninstalled the apparent corrupt driver software that way. But I still cannot install any version of the driver software. I even went to my manufacturers website and got the default software. It installed properly but still did not correct
 the issue of my Bluetooth not working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went into Services and there's NO driver for the above (the things that keep crashing.) so I can't start them. there's no issues in Device Manager, either. There's no driver for Media, Monitor or OBEX.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Though the Bluetooth program itself seems up and "running" AKA, it shows the icon in the bottom right corner and I can open settings, it won't even pair with anything now.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And now that I uninstalled the old driver, I get a RunDLL error message upon boot up, saying some aspect of bluetooth can't be started because it can't be found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Installer is up and running, I unregistered and reregistered it</p>
<p>This seems to be isolated with Bluetooth</p>
<p>I tried to install as admin and same error message</p>
<p>The Bluetooth folder in my Intel/x86 folder is totally empty</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is going on? How can I solve this and install a driver? Why won't it allow me to install anything bluetooth related?</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            <p>Pawel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had this problem, too, and I managed to find the solution to which Julie R88 referred but shamefully did not link. Take a look here:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://communities.intel.com/thread/104565</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows update in question is KB3161608. I uninstalled it and was then able to update the Intel Bluetooth driver. The Intel forum thread also mentions another problem being caused by
<span>KB3172605, which I don't appear to have installed.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Best of luck, Pawel. And once again, shame on Julie R88 for not linking to the solution!</span></p>

<h2>            Why can&#39;t XP find hidserv.dll at startup&#63;</h2>
                    For months I've been seeing error messages in the Event Viewer about problems getting HID to run ("The HID Input Service service terminated with the following error: The specified module could not be found."). Today &nbsp;I looked at the Services list in the
 MS Autoruns utility and saw this next to the checked HidServ entry: "File not found: &nbsp;C:\WINDOWS\System32\hidserv.dll"
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So I launched a search of the entire C drive looking for anything named hidserv. Among the results was a file named hidserv.dll sitting smack dab in the C:\WINDOWS\System32\ &nbsp;folder/path. What's going on?</div>

<h2>            Avoid me REP Help&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Ive had xbox live for years ive never once had any problems till today , To give you some back ground info iam a big fan of gears of war it may have had its life cycle like other games but to me it never died also that's why i have kept my skills in the
 game ive put many hours into even after i achieved max rank now all of a sudden In gears of war ultimate edition it seems like all players are laggy due to servers been shut down. This has kind of made alot of weird moments happen for all players but also
 i managed to do well still as mentioned due to previous experience over the years with this game. i do not send messages and upon checking my stats i was reported for cheating which i do not do.</p>
<p>I was speaking to a MS representative about this but the information they gave me was not really clear and seemed very unfair , i was advized that i needed to play some games online and watch my behavior But i cannot play online(due to no avoid me lobbies)
 I was wondering what i can do in this case and if it will drop off from my Account with time&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks any reply would be great and appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Your reputation score will have an effect on many aspects of your online experience including who you are matched with, the reputation of your Xbox Live party, and your ability to communicate with others on the Xbox Live service. Also your reputation reflects
 how the Xbox Live community views a player’s behavior over time. The reputation system emphasizes a player’s sportsmanship and overall attitude and is intended to help ensure a level playing field for all Xbox Live members.</p>
<p>If you routinely receive negative feedback due to unsportsmanlike behavior or communications in a specific game or gametype, it may become more challenging to find good matches or new players in that game title. By playing different games and interacting
 with other players in a positive and productive way, your reputation score can improve. For more info:</p>
<p><a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/home/howto#sub-topic0-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">enforcement.xbox.com/.../howto</a></p>
<p>So play nice and avoid activity that other players are likely to view as unfair or unsportsmanlike!

<p>The problem is as mentioned i DO NOT want to play other games I feel like i am beeing forced to do something i DO NOT want to also i pay for this service and that's NOT fair i should be able as a consumer to make my own choice of what I play so does my History
 as a good players over the last 7 plus years not get taken into account as mentioned ive never even been yellow checking my status on the MS page this is the first month ive received complaints and its not about communication its about cheating which mentioned
 i don't do and also i thank you for the Info but this does not answer my question
</p>
<p>I am not going to play others game as i do not want to does this mean that my account will not go back to good player if i just leave it for a while and wait will it go back to normal if not i will be FORCED to make another account and that would be really
 sad </p>

<p>Actually you are not being forced to do anything by the xbox live service, that is just an advice to help you get back online with a better rep. A change in an account’s reputation score is not considered an enforcement action and is not indicative of a
 suspension; it’s possible to have a low reputation score without violating the Microsoft Services Agreement or Code of Conduct.</p>
<p>So who is forcing you is not the service but the other gamers you shared a lobby. It's the community that has reported your way of interacting with others and your own behavior online. If there is anyone you should address your complaint is yourself. So
 be a nice sport and play for gaming sake!</p>
<p>Stay on the safe side! &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi LFC hitman,</p>
<p>I'm sure this situation is very frustrating for you and I'm sorry to hear you feel that your reputation is being attacked unfairly. I just want to make sure that you've looked at all the resources, for example, have you checked your reputation breakdown
 to see the specific complaints here: <a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
enforcement.xbox.com/home</a> that way you at least know what was said.</p>
<p>Secondly, I know M3tal shared the link on improving your reputation and I understand that it's really frustrating to feel you have to do something you don't want to do if you didn't do anything wrong in the first place, but putting that aside for just a
 moment, I did some research online in the reddit community and came upon a thread where other players, including those playing Gears, had similar issues and they too were encouraged by Microsoft to follow the steps for improving their reputation here: enforcement.xbox.com/Home/HowTo#sub-topic0-0
 . One suggestion was playing private matches with friends, no complaints coming from there!</p>
<p>Even really good systems can have a flaws or unfortunately people can abuse a good system. The players on reddit suggested playing games like Neverwinter or Battle Field 4 because you play with much larger pools of people so your ratio of players is better
 for your rep going up.</p>
<p>I definitely understand how unfair a situation like this can seem but I just wanted to share some options so you can get back to gaming enjoyably. I hope you're able to play Gears of War 4 on the Xbox One when it comes out since you're such a dedicated fan!</p>

<p>Metal Daze are you even from this world ? do you even read what i posted due no these complaints i got are not about me as mentioned ive been playing gears of war for years thats what makes me a good player i do not swear i have my mic on mute at all times
 i do no sent message as i play fair im just good at the game as mentioned i checked on the website that you guys have linked to me and yes all complaints are for cheating so no its not me and stop saying it is because all it takes in one quick google search
 and you will see that this is a huge problem were people are reporting good players so that either they dont have to play against them again or so they get bad rep this happened in HALO 5 also so its not just limited to gears of war or me in this case please
 the internet is full of it so dont come blaming me as mentioned i have been a good player for over 7 years and these are the first complaint ive had
</p>
<p>hammerfellchick thanks for your comment at least you didnt point the finger of blame at me since ive done nothing as mentioned a million times. but as for the options you gave me thats exactly what i feared i AM NOW FORCED TO PLAY GAMES I DO NOT WANT TO
 PLAY SO I CAN GET MY REP BACK IN THIS CASE SO I CAN GET MY PROFILE BACK AS I CANNOT MATCH MAKE IN ANY GAME I HAVE &nbsp;</p>
<p>.I swear if i lived in the USA id take microsoft to legal action this is a joke they cannot withhold a service from me that i pay for and have had for over 7 years so this is the last time im going to ask this question if i leave my profile for a month an
 just dont play will this bad rep drop off from my profile yes or no ? as mentioned if it does not go away with time i will give up and make a new account and count htis one as lost as i am not purchasing a game THAT I DO NOT WANT TO PLAY just to get my REP
 higher </p>

 just answer my question please will my bad rep drop off in time lets say i leave it for a month ? will it go away thanks
</p>
<p>this is an absolute joke that you have no control on this matter that false accusations without proof can do this to a persons account is a joke microsoft an absolute unfunny joke over 7 years ive not had 1 sinlgle complaint and now this if you need proof
 to unlock my account come talk to me directly inspect my xbox my controller do w.e you want DO NOT GIVE ME BAD REP ON FALSE ACCUSATIONS THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE JOKE

<p>Your reaction is naturally emotional as one can certainly notice from the tone you used in your answer. Yet still you are trying to shift blame without evaluating the situation and the possibilities to solve it. In this case the Microsoft service only provides
 the ground rules for a gaming community, rules that you accepted once you signed the xbox live agreement. Keep in mind that no one is accusing you of anything, bad rep is not a enforcement decision but the way you are seen from the gaming community.</p>
<p>Now its up to you the gamer to relate with other gamers as you coop or play against them. This what your rep represents the way you have interacted with other gamers and it takes patience to build a good rep or repair a bad one. Time cannot undo your bad
 rep, only by playing a variety of games with a larger pool of gamers you can try to get back some of your rep.
</p>
<p>Be nice to other gamers, don't react emotionally be that in victory or defeat, just try to enjoy the game you are playing and you will earn your rep again. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>WOW You actually answered my question shame its not what i wanted to hear this is an absolute disgrace that few can ruin it for many i am 22 years old have been on XBL since 7 or 8 years ago i am well behaved in all games ive played as you do not have the
 reading skills to be able to comprehend as i have written before this is the first time any one has complained about me in the last 6 months and as far as Iam aware ever . Its a shame that just because I play the game at a different level than normal players
 i get singled out as mentioned Im not a cheater and never have been and I am willing to prove it its a shame that my profile is forever lost because as mentioned i am not purchasing or playing games i do not want to play to get Reputation back that i should
 never have lost in the first place this is an absolute disgrace and it for sure is not the last time i will be asking about this on forums next step is to take it up with Microsoft themselves

    <title>Windows 7 Folder Moving &#38; Renaming Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> heyo_speaker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Folder Moving &#38; Renaming Issue</h2>
                    When I try to move or rename a folder in Windows 7 Home Premium, a notification appears titled "Item Not Found", which says:<br />
<br />
<br />
Could not find this item<br />
<br />
This is no longer located in C:\[CONTAINING FOLDER]. Verify<br />
the item's location and try again.<br />
<br />
<br />
If I click "Cancel", the folder name change is undone.<br />
If I click "Try Again", the folder name <i>does change</i> to the new name.<br />
<br />
I do not have this issue when moving or renaming a <i>file</i>, only when moving or renaming a
<i>folder</i>.<br />
<br />
For me this is just an annoyance, but it could be confusing for other users of this computer and I would like to fix the issue.&nbsp; I don't know what caused it; I suspected it was a Windows Update a few months ago, but I don't really know.&nbsp; I thought it might
 eventually be fixed by a subsequent update, but it hasn't, so maybe it's unique to my computer.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot to anyone who can help!<br />

Thanks, Dissed, for your concern.<br />
<br />
It seems to happen with any folder in any location.&nbsp; I've found other posts about similar issues online, with solutions involving registry keys, but I didn't want to try anything without some input from a Windows expert.<br />
<br />
*UPDATE*&nbsp; I thought I should do another Google search about this issue before posting and I may have found the solution here:&nbsp; http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/2ca522e9-f46c-4e88-9ea0-3c93359e878e/<br />
<br />
A while back I applied a registry change to disable libraries in Windows 7 so that it would be simpler for my mom to understand where her files were being stored.&nbsp; Perhaps this change caused the problem and I didn't notice it, or perhaps a subsequent Windows
 Update didn't agree with it.&nbsp; I was reading just now and it looks like I could have simply deleted the Pictures and Documents libraries, but I didn't know that at the time.<br />
<br />
Below are the .reg files I downloaded, in text form.&nbsp; I assume I ran the first file, and not the second file, but I can't remember.&nbsp; The third file is for reversing the changes.<br />

....I thought it might be a bad idea to mess with the registry, but trusted that this registry tweak was safe.&nbsp; Perhaps the author didn't expect subsequent Windows Updates to cause problems with the changes he came up with.&nbsp; Does anyone foresee any possible
 problems I might have if I run the third file now and reverse the changes?&nbsp; Especially now that many Windows Updates have been applied since I made the change?&nbsp; I don't know enough about Windows to understand what these files do.<br />

    <title>SD Card not recognised - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> f.wohlgemuth  say:</h3>
<h2>            SD Card not recognised</h2>
                    My new Surface Pro (i5 7300U, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD) does not recognise the SD card I was trying to read today. The SD card works perfectly well on other devices. The Surface does not react to it at all. I am not very happy about the prospect of having to
 send it in for repair - but I am also having trouble identifying the card reader in the device manager and thus I cannot uninstall and reinstall its driver. Windows 10 Troubleshooting does not find anything, the only "other devices" that the device manager
 lists as unrecognised are MS-ABTP and MS-TCC which I have read to be bluetooth-related, so that should not be the issue. I updated windows and I installed the driver update package I could download from microsoft.

<p>You must not have a Surface. Please stop guessing. When a microSD card is inserted, you will find the Realtek USB Card Reader under Universal Serial Bus Controllers in Device Manager.</p>

<p>Dear Barb,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you so much for the answer. The picture from the device manager is really useful - now I know how things should look like. Considering that the Realtek entry does not appear even when inactive devices are displayed, I fear there might be some problem
 - nonetheless, I will happily try the mask tape solution tomorrow.</p>
<p>Luckily, I am still in the guarantee period, so I fear I will have to send it in for a new one in the end.</p>

    <title>Battlefield 3 start up issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> novaclassdelta  say:</h3>
<h2>            Battlefield 3 start up issues</h2>
                    
<p>I bought recently (within the past 3 months) a new Xbox360 4GB console and have been playing Battlefield 3 online multiplayer without a single issue until today...</p>

<p>I put my Battlefield 3 multiplayer disc into the Xbox and it loads perfectly fine, it shows the intro screen then tells me to press start to continue, which I do, then as soon as I do about 3 seconds later the screen turns black. The game isn't frozen because
 I can press the button on my controller to enter the dashboard and all that other stuff. This happens on both of the Battlefield 3 discs.</p>
<p>I have loaded and played 5 other games and all of these games work perfectly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My Xbox360 does not have a hard drive, I have cleared the cache, and I have as I said above tried other games. I am stuck please help!</p>

<p>It cant be the disc...firstly it isn't just the multiplayer disc, it is both multiplayer and the campaign disc. I have not used the campaign disc in over 2 months. They are both doing the same thing at the same point.</p>

<h2>            PC losing work when battery runs out or power cut</h2>
                    <p>We have a few Windows 8.1 and 10 machines in the office now and I really like the ability to resume from sleep with the desktop just as I left it even if the machine loses power- run out of battery or plug pulled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just upgraded windows 7&nbsp;laptop to W10 (clean install) and it sleeps and resumes well during the day. However, when I come back to the machine in the morning my work/ windows are not there, it seems as though the machine shutdown overnight. Also, if
 I go to sleep mode and run out of battery, the laptop does not resume to where I left off unlike the other machines. Its no better than windows 7 in this respect, the laptop just runs slower (its a single core)</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no driver problems and no updates pending. The clean install went with out error. Why might this be happening?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the problem is due to unconfigured battery settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If You turned on the following option,Windows 10 will automatically hibernate your system when your battery's low.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check the following option available in your laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Press Windows Key-&gt;type Power Options-&gt;Select topmost result which opens on control panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select Change plan settings (on right pane)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select Change advanced power settings on the window that opens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scroll down and click/expand Battery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select Critical battery action -&gt; Set them to Hibernate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now,your PC Will enter into hibernate state( resumes where you left when you power on again)</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>
</p><p>thanks but i think this is differente issue. the laptop had no battery last night but it was connected to the mains.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I just tried opening several windows on a 8.1 machine, selected sleep and pulled the plug. On power on, the windows are where I left them. I can do the same on W10 on a desktop, in fact there is a girl who hates that her PC wakes up when the cleaner
 wipes her keyboard and switched it off every night after chosing power off/ sleep. It always wakes up in the morning where she left off. BUT this does not happen on the laptop with W10.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You Can select Hibernate if you don't want your laptop to lose work,when your battery runs out of charge.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Sleep vs hibernate...</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Sleep is a power saving state.when we use sleep your pc will consume power ( but very less) to keep itself awake.it may be useful for desktops(where power is plugged in always) but for laptops using sleep will not yield better result,as it consumes our battery
 power when we are not plugged in,resulting in some loss of charge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Coming to Hibernate...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hibernate is an option specially designed for laptops.Your laptop will never consume any power,when you put your laptop to hibernate mode,as your laptop will look like it was shut downed,but when you power on again you can see your work being resumed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You Can use sleep as well as hibernate &nbsp;while choosing critical battery action(see previous answer)</p>
<p>
</p><p>when you select sleep your laptop will go sleep and shutdowns(you will lose unsaved work)when the battery loses&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>its full charge..(but don't worry modern Windows OS like W10,8.1,etc. will automatically enter into hibernate mode from sleep,when the battery charge reaches critical point.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, if you select hibernate your laptop will enter into hibernate and you will be resumed to where you left when you power on again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So,use&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1).Sleep -if you are not going to use your laptop for particular period of time like 10 to 15 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Hibernate-if you are not going to use laptops for extended period of time (like night hours) and you won't have an opportunity to charge the battery during that time.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope i cleared your doubts...</p>

            <p>None of the machines hibernate, some have 16GB of memory!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, the observed behaviour you can try yourself: open word and excel and type something. Then sleep the machine (Power/sleep from menu). Then pull the plug or switch it off. Then turn it on again. Do you have the same Word and Excel windows open?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The windows 8.1 and Windows 10 desktop resume with the windows and work intact. BUT the laptop just upgraded reboots with nothing, it looses the work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both windows 10 installs were made from the same media, the hardware is different but neither machine has had their settings changed- power options are default.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>i suspect critical battery action is set to sleep/shutdown(which are default) is causing the problem.I tried the steps you asked to try (opening word,excel-&gt;type-&gt;sleep,etc) but my pc gets into hibernate mode automatically from sleep as i had set hibernate
 as my critical battery action in control panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So,Kindly set critical battery action to hibernate</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps :</p>
<p>
</p><p>Press Windows Key-&gt;type Power Options-&gt;Select topmost result which opens on control panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select Change plan settings (on right pane)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select Change advanced power settings on the window that opens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scroll down and click/expand Battery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select Critical battery action -&gt; Set them to Hibernate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select Apply-&gt;OK.</p>

            <p>GS-Toshiba,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The behaviour you describe indicates that the desktops have UPS [Uninterruptable Power Supply]&nbsp;and the UPS is giving them time to save their states to disk.&nbsp; You'd have to check the manuals for your desktops to check the precise mechanisms your UPS uses
 and how it integrates with Windows Power options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The behaviour of the laptop [losing work when power is suddenly removed] is normal.</p>

            <p>There are no UPS and the time to power off is really short, a few seconds. One unit is a nettop with W8.1, basically a laptop.<br />
</p>
<p>Just to be clear, the machines enter sleep BEFORE the power is cut in the test. Only the laptop looses work.</p>
