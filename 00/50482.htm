<p>After I installed <strong>Windows 10 Anniversary Update</strong>, boot up speed is totally
<strong>decreased</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Before upgrade</strong>, it is taking only <strong>4-5 seconds</strong>, but
<strong>after upgrade</strong> It is taking around <strong>5</strong><strong>0-60 seconds</strong> to boot up.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How do I resolve this issue?</strong></p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Harshil,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to keep your Windows updated, Install only necessary software programs and use a
</span><a href="http://www.askvg.com/top-5-best-free-antivirus-and-anti-spyware-software-for-windows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>good antivirus</span></span></a><span> and keep it updated.</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to run the System Maintenance troubleshooter and check if it helps.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Type <strong>troubleshooter</strong> in the search box and then press enter.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Select <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>. Click on <strong>
view all</strong> and select <strong>System Maintenance</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Click next and follow the <strong>on-screen instructions</strong>.</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>Also remove Unwanted Programs from Windows Startup: </span><span>T</span><span>here are many unnecessary software programs which automatically start with Windows and keep running in background. You can disable those programs from system startup to
 improve performance:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Right-click on Taskbar and select "<strong>Task Manager</strong>" option. Alternatively, you can direct open Task Manager by pressing "<strong>Ctrl+Shift+Esc</strong>" keys together.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Now go to "<strong>Startup</strong>" tab and select the unwanted program in the given list and click on "<strong>Disable</strong>" button to remove it from startup.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Restart your computer and the disabled program will no longer start with Windows and you'll get a faster running system.</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful. </span></p>

<p>I've already gone through all those steps, but any of this did not worked.</p>
<p>If it is the case of antivirus, then I have to say that I'm using <strong>Windows Defender</strong>.</p>
<p>And yes, All those software which are currently installed on my system are the same which were installed before the upgrade.</p>
<p>So, <strong>now what</strong>?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I solved my problem of slow boot up.</p>
<p>The problem is that, I've turned on <strong>Windows Subsystem for Linux (Beta)</strong> after upgrade. It is possible that this might have slowed down my device.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;<strong>turned off it</strong> from <strong>Turn windows feature on or off</strong>.</p>
<p>Now my device is running well.</p>
<p>

            <p>Same problem here. &nbsp;I tried the usual steps, disabled start up programs, maintenance sweep, etc. but to no avail. &nbsp;I decided to rebuilt from scratch, radical but I've plenty of back ups if need be. &nbsp;As a virgin build my system was back to its former speed.
 I then installed the Anniversary update and Ian now back to the stage one, boot taking over a minute from just a few seconds. &nbsp;</p>
<p>

            Same here, noticeably slower bootup time with the anniversary update. I checked the startup, and nothing new was enabled. Does Microsoft not know that they degraded bootup time? That was one really cool feature of Windows 10 before. Very fast bootup.

            <p>I had slow boot times</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found that is was related to the drivers of a discrete graphics card</p>
<p>
</p><p>First I went in to device manager and disable the device</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also disable fast boot</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shut down, Powered on</p>
<p>
</p><p>And took note of the boot time</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is faster than it is related to the drivers of your discrete card</p>
<p>
</p><p>I update the drivers for the card and seem to improve boot times quite a bit</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I tried difference Shut downs and restarts with and without fast boot to reset everything</p>

            <p>Same thing here. I used the Windows Performance Recorder to track the issue. </p>
<p>The result is that just at the beginning of the boot, it starts the windows file system filter (WOF) and it stays idle for 30 seconds. It seems it stays in "spaceport.sys", which is the storage spaces driver. I have a SSD, 2 hard disks, and a DVD writer.<br />

<h2>            Windows Explorer closes randomly &#40;does not crash&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello everybody,</p>
<p>
</p><p>some of the Windows 10 users in our network are experiencing this problem. Windows explorer just closes automatically. No crash, no event is logged, not a single symptom. Just closes and it goes again, if you open file explorer/this PC. There is no evident
 of it being time-dependent or event-dependent. Sometimes the user is not even at the desk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched a lot and didn't find anything like this and I would be very grateful, if anyone could help me on this.</p>
<p>

            Well, it's embarrassing to answer your own question. We found out, that this ONLY happens when a network drive is opened in file explorer. Using this as a clue, resulted in finding out that it has been known since windows 8 and the forum has already an
 answer. Changing the GPO for mapping network drives from "replace" to "update" did resolve the issue.

            Hopefully you'll see this and have a chance to respond. Where and how is the change you're talking about made specifically? I have a client who has a series of Win 10 machines where Explorer closes (no crash, just closes) randomly, all day long. This seems
 like the ticket, just need more info.

    <title>Windows 10 OEM license keeps deactivating - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rogerbarton1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 OEM license keeps deactivating</h2>
                    <p>I bought a laptop from Dell with Windows 10 preinstalled and the license keeps deactivating so I see the watermark in the bottom right hand corner. This has happened several times already, and can happen several times a day.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
However when I go to the Settings&gt;Activation, where it says that windows is not activated and press troubleshoot it becomes activated. Why does this keep getting deactivated? Ive checked various things from other forums, such as checking system files, but that
 hasnt worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I'm logged into windows with a microsoft account, but I dont think the license is linked to my account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be much appreciated :)</p>

            Hi Roger,<br />
<br />
If the Windows license of a computer keeps on deactivating, this means that the license is not completely registered to your computer. For us to assist you, we suggest that you visit this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/10738/windows-10-get-help-with-activation-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a>. From there, you'll see how to resolve activation issues in Windows.<br />
<br />
If the issue persists, we recommend that you contact the manufacturer of your computer. This is for them to verify why your computer is unable to use your Windows license. Here's an article that you can visit to see how to contact them:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14148/computer-manufacturers-contact-information" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply. It looks as if I had somehow deleted the Dell Imaging Toolbox software that I used to scan pictures. I have re-installed this, but now there seems to be a problem with communication between the scanner and the PC.
</p>
<p>I have told the scanner where to save the pictures to - generally the default setting appears to be "My Pictures" - it then asks for a prefix name for the scans, which I put in as "scanner".&nbsp;
</p>
<p>When I&nbsp;press the scan button, I get nothing. It then gives me an error message, saying check leads, turn on and off etc, restart the PC. All this I have tried, but to no avail!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe it's time to call Dell?!</p>

    <title>3D Builder shortcut. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marcelo miguel bazan  say:</h3>
<h2>            3D Builder shortcut.</h2>
                    <p>Hi:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just bought a PC with Windows 10 &amp; I want to organise the shortcuts by moving all of them out of their folders, but 3D Builder &amp; Print 3D are located in a folder called Windows Accessories &amp; I can't move them to the root of the Start Menu.</p>
<p>I could (&amp; did) it with previous versions of Windows 10 but, apparently, Microsoft keeps going backwards instead of forward&nbsp;when it comes to "updating" software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, I don't want to uninstall it, but if I can't move the shortcut, I'll do that because I don't like folders (useless extra steps).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you, Marcelo.</p>

            Yes, the new Win 10 Store &lt;C*&gt;apps are harder to pin/create shortcuts.
<br />
<br />Did you right click on the tiles?  When I do, I have the option to pin them to that Taskbar or Start menu (pane).
<br />
<br />The suggestion above goes along with this article:

<h2>            Dedicated video ram</h2>
                    <p>Now, I have tried different ways to increase my dedicated video ram but it doesn't work. Nothing changes. I've tried bios but i couldn't access most of the things. My last hope is to ask here, how do i increase my dedicated video ram? At least to 512 Mb.
 I've went to regedit and did the stuff there and restarted the laptop, but no it didn't change. Sooooo could anyone please explain what i have to do???? All the specs I found:</p>

<p>The only way to change the amount of system RAM that is allocated to an integrated graphics processor</p>
<p>is via the machines BIOS. The amount that can be allocated varies between machines.
</p>
<br />
<p><em>"At least to 512 Mb."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Your post shows - <em>Total Available Graphics Memory: 1792 MB</em>- . This is the maximum amount of</p>
<p>RAM that is allocated for gaming,or doing other graphics intensive tasks, and includes the 32MB VRAM</p>
<p>(assuming this 32MB is a VRAM chip and not a small portion of the system RAM 'dedicated' to video).</p>
<p>So you should still be OK with the current 'dedicated 32MB' as long as you don't do heavy multi-tasking.</p>
<p>It would take some serious multi-tasking to use 12GB RAM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The main difference here is the 'dedicated' memory<em> may</em> be a VRAM memory chip on the motherboard,
</p>
<p>vs using a portion of the system RAM (shared).</p>
<p>VRAM is much faster than system RAM, but there is no way to upgrade this, whether using integrated graphics</p>
<p>or a dedicated graphics card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- The other issue is some games do not recognise shared system RAM as an alternative to VRAM.</p>
<p>You are out of luck in this instance.</p>

<h2>            Windows and User file is 49,3GB...</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a C:/ and a D:/ harddrive, and my C:/ harddrive is only 58,5GB, so I save all my programs, pictures, music, documents, movies etc on the D:/ harddrive (which is 174GB). However, my C:/ harddrive has now been completely depleted of space, and after
 browsing the web, I found that I should use CCleaner and Disk Cleanup (from Windows). I completed both, but still my User file is 17,8 GB and my Windows file is 31,5 GB. As I'm not too familiar with all the specific folders in the User and Windows folder,
 I have no intention to go around and delete something I don't know anything about.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you guys have any suggestions to how I can decrease the huge size of these folders?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>

            <p>First I want to ask which browser you use. For example, if you use Google Chrome, then the Disk Cleanup tool you mentioned won't be able to clean it up. You'll have to open the Chrome options and manually clear the cache there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But aside from that, it can be helpful to use a program that identifies large files. You can open a search box
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcmdrkeene.com%2fanswers%2fwin7.jpg" />+<strong>F</strong> and then click in the search box and choose the size option to find large files, or you can use a dedicated program like WinDirStat that scans and shows which folders are using a lot of size.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After you use those to find larger files and identify them, you might recognize some (like say a large downloaded video) and know to move or delete it. But if you find any you are unsure about, you can come back here and let us know and we can try to help
 determine if it is safe to delete.</p>

            I have now cleaned my cache for Chrome, thanks!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
After downloading WinDirStat I get these results:<br />
<br />
C:\Windows/winsxs has 110 558 files and is 16,7 GB (a lot of small files)<br />
C:\Windows/Installer has 4415 files and is 5,6 GB<br />
C:\Users\svel2801\AppData\Roaming is 16 609 files and is 16,0 GB<br />
<br />
Basically, these bad guys here they fill up my PC. Can any of these be deleted?&nbsp;

            <p>Some of those are required, others are only necessary if you ever plan (or need to) roll back an update.&nbsp; Let's concentrate on the ones that are more in your control, the ones inside your User folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The roaming folder in the app data is larger than I might expect. Would you open that folder up and see what in particular is using all that space?&nbsp; Usually this folder is only used for your settings/preferences and some data needed for apps (like what options
 you selected so they can be remembered).</p>

            <p>That Apple one is probably your phone backup, so that's very likely. I'd explore them and make sure you'd like to delete them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And to be safe:&nbsp; just move them to the Recycle Bin.&nbsp; Leave them there for a few weeks. That way, if you happen to notice that you need it, you can restore it back.&nbsp; If a few weeks go by and you're sure you absolutely don't need them, you can "empty the Recycle
 Bin" to finish purging them.&nbsp; Better safe than sorry! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Also yes I would honestly not recommend touching the winsxs folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me also ask this, how big is your drive, and how much is free?&nbsp; For example, my drive is about 75% free space.&nbsp; As long as you have about 20% free, you don't need to worry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And keep this&nbsp;in mind: more free space will not make your computer any faster.&nbsp; It only matters how many programs are running simultaneously for that.&nbsp; To put it another way, it doesn't matter how big your library is, the only thing that slows you down is
 how many books you're trying to read at the same time.</p>

<p>Hi, I believe that with Wordament, the lexicon used is curated by the game creators itself, and is considered their intellectual property.&nbsp; As part of the proceedings, they review words that appear in literature, check them across several existing dictionaries,
 and do review individual words on a case-by-case basis.&nbsp; The custom curation of the lexicon also applies to the process by which they designate words as "common" versus "obscure."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure that this list could be readily made available as it's their intellectual property, but if you have a question or feedback about a certain word or words, you could probably use the website linked above or try
<a href="https://wordament.wordpress.com/about/contact-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
contacting them directly</a>.&nbsp; I must admit that I'm only a casual Wordament player these days and usually help people out with Xbox-related things here, so I'm not 100% certain if the direct contact link is still valid, nor do I have any insights on the other
 Microsoft word games.&nbsp; Hope this helps!</p>

<div>I am a Desktop Support Admin and we are faced with a problem where Sync Center is automatically syncing offline files. &nbsp;Is this by design within Windows 7 where Sync Center has the offline files automatically enabled and/or is this due to a Windows Update?
 &nbsp;Thank you.</div>

<p>
</p><p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a problem since the last update a few months ago with my windows 10. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Wordpad to edit php scripts and when I want to save existing file with diffenert name or a new file, .txt extesion is added after .php extension that I put after the file name, so the file is saved like script.php.txt.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that I can use double quotes and save the file in .php extension like this "script.php", but many time I forget do do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found out that the same problem is with Notepad, but before this update everithing was fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my office I'm also using windows 10 on different computer, but after the sam update I don't have this problem, I only need to put .php extension after filename.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After all I mentioned, I thing that is some general save option in windows that I cannot find, so please be so kind and help me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            <p>Safe Mode produced 5,347 errors, but Event 7024 was not among them (thank God for the log filter capability built into Event Viewer!).&nbsp; Clean boot with all non-Microsoft services disabled, and all startup items disabled also did not produce Event 7024 "The
 HomeGroupListener service terminated with..." error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By re-enabling services a few at a time, (generally I went in blocks by provider), it appeared the error was caused by two Nuance services related to Dragon Naturally Speaking Premium v13: The "Dragon Logger Service" and "Dragon Service".&nbsp; I have no idea
 what these do, but a quick test of Dragon NS with these services disabled seemed to indicate it is running properly and performing as well as it ever did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I re-enabled all the startup processes with the Nuance services disabled, and the error reappeared. It appeared tied to WinZip Preloader.&nbsp; But I normally run with this startup item disabled anyway, and WinZip doesn't seem to mind.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Numerous successful restarts convinced me I had the problem solved.&nbsp; Then my wife turned off "her machine" which was a member of the homegroup initiated from the problem workstation.&nbsp; The problem reappeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, this error started 11/19/15 when the Win 10 1511 update installed.&nbsp; During that event, for some reason, a slew of programs in "Programs and Features" (Control Panel) showed up as being installed on that date even though they were already installed long
 before the Windows Update ran.&nbsp; I don't know if the Windows Update changed some key component UAC items, install location, whatever: but it appears it somehow altered those installations and marked it as the initial install date for those applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a result of all the warm and cold reboots I've done for this testing, when I started the computer today (after yesterday's constant reboots, enable a few services / startup items, boot again exercises) I now have 24,946 ERRORS on a restart, Windows Search
 will not function, the start menu does not function (I have to use CTRL-DEL to get to power down options and have no access to any apps that do not have an icon on the desktop unless I can figure out the name and location of an .exe file).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Re-running sfc and dism still find no problems, but it is clear that key OS files (and some basic Windows 10 service files) are terribly corrupt.&nbsp; Yes, I've run virus / malware scans from multiple sources, all of which find nothing.&nbsp; It is clearly corrupt
 OS files, and it appears to have started with the Windows 10 1511 update.</p>

            <p>Error continues to appear despite safe / clean boots, leaving and rejoining the homegroup etc.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In trying to track down another error not flagged in the event log (I found that Settings-&gt;Privacy-&gt;Location setting could not be changed - greyed-out, unresponsive to mouse clicks) I noticed a HUGE discrepancy in files in C:/Windows/System32 compared to
 a laptop running the same version (1511) of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought DISM and SFC were designed to fix issues such as missing / corrupt OS files, but apparently these tools do not function in this way on Windows 10.</p>

</p><p>That is still an ideal that they aspire to.&nbsp; Nevertheless there will still be diagnostic value from your attempts to use them and then there may be manual procedures which could be devised to work through those details.</p>

            <p>I started having this issue post upgrade to Windows 10, I've never had any issues with Homegroups before but I've also never upgraded before (I usually clean install every new version of Windows) perhaps a lesson there then.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I eventually found a workaround to this after being unable to identify the exact cause, although I suspect its something to do with the&nbsp;Peer Networking Identity Manager as the problem is caused by the connecting account not being dynamically assigned
 to the local HomeUsers group.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case simply changing the "HomeGroup Listener" service to Automatic (Delayed Start) has solved the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Update 12/2016 - &nbsp;'Some' updates revert this service back to Manual start, so keep an eye on it, or run a PS script on startup to check it&nbsp;as I have now done.</p>

            That's really interesting. I just saw "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">HomeGroup Listener" not running on a machine giving me permission denied on shared folders. I started the service, and suddenly I have permission.
 What the heck? Thanks for the workaround until we can figure out what happened.</span>

            <p>Don't mean to necro this thread but I just wanted to mention that more and more these days, so called "updates" are actually full reinstalls of the OS. So that's probably why all of a sudden the programs in your installed list show as having been installed
 on the same date. Hope this helps future visitors to this little corner of the Web. :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: a good way to check is to see if you have a Windows.old directory suddenly appear in Windows Explorer. You should be able to safely delete it when you feel like everything is still working correctly.</p>

            <p>Don't know why nobody still haven't found this yet, but solution for this issue is quite easy and obvious.</p>
<p>Home Group Listener service default configuration is incomplete, and missing services which it depends on.</p>
<p>So service tries to start too early and fail as not all conditions met for it to start properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To fix it you should do the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Start Registry Editor from Administrator.</p>
<p>2) Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\HomeGroupListener</p>
<p>3) On right pane, right click Create -&gt; Multi String (REG_MULTI_SZ)</p>
<p>4) Name this parameter "DependOnService"</p>
<p>5) Fill in the following lines in it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>RPCSS<br />
RpcEptMapper<br />
MpsSvc<br />
HomeGroupProvider<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>6) Make sure no blank lines in parameter value, only filled strings.</p>
<p>7) Click OK to save parameter value.</p>
<p>8) Now make sure "Start" parameter is set to 3 (Manual), if not - set it to 3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Close regedit and reboot. Check Events log and Services. Home Group Listener should be running right from start and error is gone.</p>

<h3> notanexpert1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Scan won&#39;t recognize my scanner</h2>
                    <p>I have a Conoscan 9950f scanner and a new Windows 10 64 bit computer. As soon as I powered the scanner up, plug and play took off and installed it. Going to settings&gt;printers and scanners showed that it was installed. Clicking on the scanner icon and hit
 'manage' brought up the scanner page where I hit scanner properties which showed that it recognized my scanner as a canoscan 9950f and when I hit the Properties button it showed that the device was ready. Hitting the Test Scanner or Camera button went through
 the scanner's diagnostics and a popup showed "Your imaging device successfully completed the diagnostic test." Going back to the scanner page of settings I clicked on the Open Scanner button. Scan came up but said "To get started, connect to a scanner." If
 I open Windows Scan on it's own, a popup reads "Problem connecting to scanner. We can't find a scanner. Attach it to your PC and go to PC settings to add it."</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I go to device manager&gt;imaging devices&gt;canoscan 9950f and right-click on it and select "Update driver" it says "The best drivers for your device are already installed."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am dead in the water here. I might mention that though the Windows topics drop-down box shows Scan 3D, I couldn't find just Scan. I also see that others have the same problem.</p>

            Hey NAX.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />The problem is that a scanner or a printer which you want to be able to scan must have the full software package installed from it's maker's Support Downloads webp page.  This is the only way it will give fully featured, bi-directional scanning from the scanner top or PC.  Windows Fax and Scan is only a rudimentary utility for when a scanner is too old to have modern drivers.  
<br />
<br />The last driver for that scanner is WIndows 7 here. <a href="https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/support/details/scanners/support-scanners-canoscan-series/canoscan-9950f?tab=drivers_downloads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/ho...</a>  You can try installing it to see if it gives scanning functionality from the scan settings it installs, or if not from the Windows fax and scan. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            According to Canon, your scanner isn't supported under Windows 10. Just because your scanner appears and shows as having a driver does not mean it will work.

            Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: control printers
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Right click your scanner
<br />Click Start Scan
<br />
<br />What happens then?
<br />
<br />I notice there are native Windows 10 drivers for this model scanner which dates back to 2005:

<br />
<br />You could try using the latest available Windows 7 driver then install in compatibility mode, connect the scanner then see if it works:

<br />If it doesn't work, you need to consider getting a newer, compatible scanner.

            If you can get a fairly cheap laptop that can run Windows 7 32 bit, you should be good to go. Look for something around 2014 or earlier. Doesn't have to be a speed demon, but something you can get a long life out of.

            Just checking:  Did you try the Windows 7 driver in Compatilibity Mode, then see if Windows Fax and Scan can detect the scanner?  
<br />
<br />Did you expedite Windows Updates to see if it will give you a better driver to detect in Windows Fax and Scan?
<br />
<br />There are two $50 wireless all-in one printers - Canon and HP - on Amazon right now with free Prime shipping that work great.  Probably about the same in stores.

<p>Once you press print in Edge it opens the standard save dialog where you select where to save to.&nbsp; Just tried it here and it defaulted to Documents folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you use Edge … option to open the page in internet explorer it still has the File... save as... with your choice of several items with mht being the default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is trying to give users the best possible security as a package - part of that security package is Edge. &nbsp; Seems almost shameful to use another browser, but just like people have favorite colors, people out of habit have favorite browsers too.
 &nbsp; All other browsers I've ever used have their own various ways to save web pages.</p>

<p>Followed instruction and still doesn't work.&nbsp; Wanted to try TLS with outgoing SMTP server but TLS option is not available.&nbsp; (I experienced similar issue with my&nbsp;Android phone email app, I have to use TLS to get iCloud mail to work.&nbsp; But, TLS option is not
 available on Windows 8 Mail app.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
I had the same Problem, but I have just fixed it:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At first, I think you don't need the iCloud-Control Panel. Just enter the Apple-Server informations like described here in Settings--&gt;Account&nbsp;&nbsp;of your mail-app:
<a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4864" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4864</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After that, your Mail-Inbox should already work! But in my Situation I was not able to send any mails from my Apple-Mail Account. To solve this Problem I have played around with the checkboxes concerning the Athentification-Settings:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first box after the outgoing Mail-Server-Adress called somehow like "Server requires SSL" must be
<u>unchecked(!)</u></p>
<p>The second box called somehow like "Server requires athentification" you have to
<u>check(!)</u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After this your Apple-Account should work in the Mail-App of Windows 8! </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good Luck! ;) </p>

    <title>windows 10 full version and clean installations&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bullybeef73  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 10 full version and clean installations&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have the full version of Windows 7 HP. Having built my PC numerous times over the years, with components which required performing a clean (formatted) install, I have no doubt this will be something I will continue to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>With the Win 10 upgrade, would a clean,&nbsp;formatted future install mean I would have to use my Win7 HP disk first, and then use the downloaded Win10 upgrade to reinstall Win10?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or would I be able to create a Win10 clone to use on a future fresh install on a clean, formatted drive? Or would the Win10 upgrade allow me to use my Win7 product key to prove I had a genuine Windows product if a clean install was necessary?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In the coming months, after Win10 is released, my next project is a new mobo and CPU, which would require a clean install of Windows, so I'm debating whether to keep the Win10 upgrade on hold until I have installed the new components.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In any case, many Windows users now build or add upgraded components to their systems frequently these days, and unless a full version on Win10 becomes available, an OS re-installation process can occur often, so I'm sure these questions are very relevant.
 Installing two versions of Windows, just to install one version, is a timely process, which is why I chose to purchase the full version of Win7. If a full version of Win10 becomes available, I'll happily pay the cost rather than run the risk of an unprotected
 upgrade version should anything happen with my Win7 product key or disk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any further advice would be appreciated, Thanks in advance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>BB</p>

 Installing two versions of Windows, just to install one version, is a timely process, which is why I chose to purchase the full version of Win7. If a full version of Win10 becomes available, I'll happily pay the cost rather than run the risk of an unprotected
 upgrade version should anything happen with my Win7 product key or disk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any further advice would be appreciated, Thanks in advance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>I have the same question. I own Windows 7 Pro, and it is maintained on the Microsoft Store as Digital Content. Once I upgrade, will this digital content become a Windows 10 Pro download for my future hardware upgrades. I do frequent hardware upgrades which
 require me to do clean installs, as examples with complicated SSD/hybrid upgrades.</p>

            <p>Looks like there is an full Win10 option over the upgrade. I suppose for those who haven't trialled Win10, they could give the upgrade a go, perhaps on a spare HHD, and if you frequently perform clean installs, buy the full version if required.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Yes, as I posted today, the clarification that there would be a full&nbsp;retail version of Win10 has now been&nbsp;confirmed, which is all I asked and stated I would be happy to purchased if need be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I've always understood Win10 free upgrade was exactly what it was, but nothing was officially announced as to the full version and it's cost until very recently. This is why I suggest people could use the free upgrade to test Win10 for the year or until
 the upgrade their components. By installing Win10 upgrade on a spare HHD, they could even keep their present OS on their primary drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Or perform a system image/clone of your present OS, upgrade to Win10 for free and trial it. If you are happy, and prefer a clean install, buy the full version. If not, reinstall the system image/clone of your previous OS.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I think everyone understands what Free means, however an upgrade to Full OEM license as in the Windows 7 Professional does change the license agreement. Whether I pay for an upgrade or it is given to me for Free,&nbsp;I should still have the right and option
 to control the media&nbsp;and therefore my license. If there is a fee for the digital media or not, well I think that is the question here. If I bought an upgrade to Windows 8.1 from Windows 7 Pro, I would get something. Don't be so eager to give away your license
 for a free upgrade. This question is based on the fact of labor not money. Rebuilding a system from scratch is hard enough without having to make a build from Windows 7 Pro to SP1 to Windows 10 every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already tested Windows 10 on an image drive directly from a Windows 7 pro install and another directly from an ISO file clean install. I know the options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Ford gave you a car for free, wouldn't you want the keys. Think about it.</p>

 buying other licenses from various vendors, I do prefer the Microsoft Store. They maintain my copies just fine. Hopefully they will do the same with the Win 10 upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another good comparison is the Service Packs. You can down load them, and I actually recommend that to my friends before their license hits EOL or EOS.</p>

            <p>It has now been confirmed you can perform a clean install AFTER upgrading to Win10. That means, once you've actioned the upgrade installation, setup and signed-in to the desktop, you can then use the recovery tools in Win10 to do a clean reinstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>More info:&nbsp;http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-win_upgrade/microsoft-confirms-you-can-clean-install-windows/d5c47ef0-d475-4111-bd3b-4d88ed6497c4</p>
<p>
</p><p>And mentioned in this thread:&nbsp;http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-win_upgrade/windows-10-upgrade-key-for-clean-install/3c53bd4d-27dc-4f16-89c5-8e1accf1d81b</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>What is still in question is what happens after you've installed Win10 Upgrade and then you decide to change you system components. Some believe in this case, the upgrade, once it's installed on your present system and HDD/SSD, any future components changes
 may&nbsp;mean a new purchase of the full Win10 version is necessary - that is, the Licence Agreement for Win10 upgrade will be connected to the Product Key from your previous version of Windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Again, whether that means you could reinstall your&nbsp;previous version of Windows plus updates into your new system, then upgrade again to Win10, as long as you are still within that first year period, OR, create a system image/clone of your Win10 upgrade,
 then install this to you new system, we're are still unsure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally, I think it will be doubtful, but I expected as much beforehand, and I always contemplated purchasing the full version due to frequently upgrading my system components.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Flight Sim X Product Key</h2>
                    
<p>I bought Flight Sim X in 2006 when it came out. &nbsp;The product key in the box did not work. &nbsp;I had to call in to get a new code. &nbsp;I wrote it on the back of the book. &nbsp;It installed fine. &nbsp;Several computers and 10 years later I am trying to install it again
 and get back into it. &nbsp;I can't find the book with the code on the back. &nbsp;I chatted this afternoon with a support person who had me jump through hoops sending him a picture of the invalid code from the box, then send him a picture of the box and the disks,
 and after two hours of going back and forth tells me he can't help me because I can't find the receipt from 2006. &nbsp;Really??? &nbsp;He wanted my gamer tag, how in the world would my Xbox gamer tag be associated with a call for support for a PC game? &nbsp;It was a waste
 of two hours of my life.</p>

<p>How can I get a replacement key for a 10 year old game that Microsoft doesn't even make anymore? &nbsp;The people with Microsoft Officer are much more helpful.</p>

    <title>Hard Disk Partitions Removed on PC Reboot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> khubaib afzal 99  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hard Disk Partitions  Removed on PC Reboot</h2>
                    <p>I recently installed MSI Afterburner 4.3.0 on my PC. I have used this software for years and it has never caused me any problem before. But a very strange problem occurred yesterday when I installed and I haven't found any solution yet.<br />
</p>
<p>The Afterburner installation was successful but it comes with RivaTuner Statistics Server (RTSS) which also installs automatically after Afterburner. Yesterday when RTSS was installing it asked me to reboot my PC because there were some files it couldn't
 update yet. So I rebooted my PC and after reboot my 2 hard disk partitions, E (500 GB) and F (300 GB) were gone. Yes they are just gone and not visible in "This PC". I restarted my PC several times also shut it down completely and then powered up but those
 partitions are still not visible. I checked Disk Partitions and it shows me 800 GB Free Space! How is this possible? I just restarted my PC because RTSS asked me to and after restarting my partitions and all the data in it are completely gone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had some really important stuff that I can't afford to lose all. Please guide me if there is a way to restore my data and partitions. Is this a bug in Windows 10? Can I fix it or all my data (almost 800 GB) is just really permanently gone?

<p>
</p><p>As you can see in above snapshot my 500 GB and 300 GB partitions (OS is now 115 GB and the other one was full 300 GB) are completely gone. Is there any way to recover that data or bring back these partitions as they were before or it is all just completely
 gone?!</p>

            <p><span>Hello Afzal,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I realize the inconvenience you are experiencing. Please be informed that if you don’t have data back up with you, you won’t be getting any of your data.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to perform system restore. System Restore is a way to undo system changes by using restore points to return your system files and settings to an earlier point in time without affecting personal files of users. System Restore uses a feature
 called <strong>system protection </strong>that regularly creates and saves information about your PC's drivers, programs, registry, system files, and settings as restore points.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
If you are having recent problems with Windows 10, then you could do a System Restore to restore Windows back to an earlier point in time, called a restore point.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Please refer the link below to restore Windows back to an earlier point in time. Refer to the Section Restore from a system restore point in the link.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>System Restore disclaimer: </strong>When you use System Restore to restore the computer to a previous state, programs and updates that you installed are removed.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Hope this helps. </span></span><span>If you have any other queries related to Windows products, feel free to reply and I'll be happy to further assist you.</span></p>

            Thanks for the help. I hadn't made a system restore point but I recovered my data via a third party data recovery tool by recovering data from lost partitions.<br />
