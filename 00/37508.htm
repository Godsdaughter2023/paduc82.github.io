            What is in the folder?  Can we see a picture?  http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/open-snipping-tool-and-take-a-screenshot

There's a possibility a program is recreating it, since deleted files don't normally come back.  

If you want to make sure it can't come back, find it after deletion in the Recycle Bin and delete it from there, too.  Just click on the Recycle Bin on desktop, highlight it and right click to Delete.

I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.

            Where in the system are you trying to delete the  folder from? 

Have you tried deleting it from Safe Mode?

Log out and go to the sign in screen.
Hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen.
Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart.
Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears.
Click Troubleshoot
Click Advanced options
Click Startup Settings
Click Restart
Press (4) to Enable Safe Mode
Wait while Windows 10 starts in safe mode.
Log in

Try deleting the file again.

You can also try selecting the folder then press shift + delete.

            If the program does not want to be removed you can try the following options to get rid of that program:

1) Press Windows key and R
2) Type in MSCONFIG
3) Now Move to boot on top tabs
4) Now tick the box next to the safe boot option in the lower left side of the window
5) Now select apply and then ok
6) Now select the restart now option

You will now see your computer will boot up and the system will look a little weird but that's how we want it.

Now try to uninstall the program from there.
(Locate and uninstall or Delete)

When done revert back to your normal operating systems by completing steps 1-6 again but this time un-ticking the option in step 4.

Hope this work please let me know if it doesn't so i can assist you as fast as possible.

<h2>            Disabled SSD now prevents any type of boot to Win 10</h2>
                    <p>I inadvertantly disabled my SSD through DeviceManager, thinking that it was NOT being&nbsp; used by my Samsung Gamer laptop (my colleagues led me to believe that sans a drive letter, Windows wasn't using it).&nbsp; They were wrong, and my stupidity left me with a
 laptop that really just needs to revert to the last-known-good-configuration, or more precisely, last good restore point.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if I boot to a command prompt, I get an "X:" drive letter, and it can't see other drives.&nbsp; How can I boot to something that can mount my SSD and C: drives, magically let me run something like "<span>rstrui.exe", and thus return
 my SSD to "enabled" so that the MBR is properly found?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Alternatively.... How much of the boot process is really on the SSD?&nbsp; Should I just make my Windows drive the bootable one, and ignore the SSD? (Actually, I'd reclaim the skinny 8GB drive to install an app that could benefit from
 the speed.)&nbsp; If I go this route, how do I make my Windows partition bootable, without re-installing Win 10?&nbsp; (Used to be easy years ago!)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I'll happily PayPal $25 to the first (accurate) respondant hero!</span></p>

            <p>It's the Samsung Gamer laptop, and it came with internal SSD and regular hard drives.&nbsp; I'm unsure how the SSD is ever even known to the system, because BIOS setup lists only the two twin regular hard drives and my DVD drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can readily get into BIOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already checked with Samsung support.&nbsp; They wanted to refer me to a Texas outfit that handles out-of-warranty hardware.&nbsp; They did not return my call today.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also stopped by BestBuy and talked to the GeekSquad.&nbsp; They pulled the drives and confirmed all was in order, but didn't know how to revert to a prior restore point, nor how to get the system to boot again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my reading, it appears that if I can get Windows to boot to SafeMode, then I'd be able to return to a prior restore point.&nbsp; I don't know how to boot to ANYTHING on my laptop, but I was successful at booting to a Win 10 installation image on a USB drive.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>THANK YOU!</p>

            <p>That's a great question; thanks!</p>
<p>I've learned a little more... &nbsp;The SSD is really just an 8GB onboard chip. &nbsp;Intel apparently calls it "Express Cache". &nbsp;Who knew that it was so important?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is NOT mentioned in BIOS anywhere. &nbsp;It additionally is not a drive for facilitating RAID, so again, nothing in BIOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless someone can tell me how to boot to some interface that allows me to roll-back to a prior restore point, I can't see how Windows will ever boot since it has lost that initial boot phase handled by the ExpressCache. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Do I really need to just write a new MBR on my C: drive, and bypass the cache altogether?</p>
<p>2) Is it possible to do so, given that all I have is a recovery disk from my wife's matching configuration laptop and a Win 10 media download from Microsoft?</p>
<p>3) If I do re-install Win 10, will it ask for a product ID, of which I do not have since I upgraded from 7 to 8 to 10 (free)?</p>
<p>4) Am I better off to pull out my hard drives, attach them to a desktop PC, and salvage my files, or should I simply attempt the Windows re-installation, followed by a re-installation of all of my programs (dozens)?</p>
<p>5) Something else I haven't considered?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!!!</p>

            Hi Andrew.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Update the Touchpad driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you also have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help then enter Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button,  go to Mice &gt; Touchpad and then Driver tab.  Choose Roll Back or if not present choose Uninstall, restart PC using keyboard to Ctrl Alt Del, on blue screen tab to Power Icon in bottom right, press Enter, arrow down to Restart, press Enter to restart to reinstall the driver. 
<br />

<br />
<br />Go to Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Touchpad to go over the Settings.  Then choose Additional Settings which opens the Mouse properties box.  The Touchpad software installs a tab onto it - usually the last one - that should have more settings to check, including a checkbox to Disable Touchpad when USB pointing device is atached.  This prevents palm drag from causing the cursor to jump

    <title>programs will stop responding when printing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jorgeortizcolom  say:</h3>
<h2>            programs will stop responding when printing</h2>
                    All my programs refuse to print on Windows 10, this includes CAD (Dassault DraftSight), Adobe Reader and the whole Microsoft Office 2013 Suite. Any printing attempt will freeze the program and it will be "not responding". I have been unable to make the
 printing function functional and it seems to be an OS problem given the wide range of programs in which this situation occurs. It even occurs in "Export" and "Save As..." modes. Thus though I can edit documents in the programs and do simple saves in the same
 format that they are encoded, any other saving and printing function will freeze completely and irrevocably those programs, risking the loss of more recently inputed data.

    <title>Win10 ver 1703 update caused Bluetooth 4.0 driver to fail and print - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kevint i980x  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win10 ver 1703 update caused Bluetooth 4.0 driver to fail and print sharing via router to fail</h2>
                    <p>Previously running Win 10 version 1607 with no issues. USB Plugable BT 4.0 with Broadcom 20702 chipset and drivers worked fine. Print sharing via TP-LINK Archer C9 wireless router also worked fine. Printer is an old HP Deskjet 970Cse. Upgrade seemed to have
 completed with no issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Platform: HP Pavilion Elite 190t Desktop with Intel i7-980X and 24GB RAM. Purchased in 2010 with Win 7 Pro. Upgraded in 2015 to Win 10 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the upgrade to Win10 version 1703 two days ago:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Windows Troubleshooter tries to fix the BT problem by reloading the BCM20702 driver - unable. Message as follows: "Broadcom BCM20702 Bluetooth 4.0 USB device has a driver problem". Tries to reload the driver and has me do a restart but the problem remains.
 I am using the Plugable USB device inserted into one of the USB ports on my Dell monitor for best wireless reception. Have not tried connecting it directly to my desktop, shouldn't need to, it worked fine till the upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) No error messages as to why the printer is no longer showing up on the Devices and Printers screen. The TP-LINK Printer Controller app sees and identifies the HP Deskjet 970CSe but the printer no longer shows up on any print dialog screen when I want
 to print, so I can't print ! Have tried everything I can think of, including reloading the TP-LINK software, no joy. The printer connects to the router via one of its USB ports with a physical cable and my desktop is connected via 802.11ac to the router. Was
 working fine prior to the upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any support or help would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You.</p>

<p>As per my original post, there were <strong>TWO</strong> separate problems: 1) Bluetooth in general not working and 2) print sharing via wireless router not working. This is not a Bluetooth printer problem per se.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of today I have resolved both issues and both functions are working again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I did to fix the problems:</p>
<p><strong>1) Print sharing </strong>- the printer was not being recognized by Win10 1703. Something about installing this new update caused Windows to not see or 'forget' that there's a HP Deskjet 970CSe connected to the TP-LINK Archer C9 wireless router.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a hunch, I connected the printer directly to the PC (bypassing the router) to try to get the PC to 'remember'. Once I saw the printer was available in Windows (as I knew it would), I disconnected the printer USB cable from the PC and reconnected the printer
 via the USB port on the router as it's normally configured. It worked. And it seems to be stable after repeated PC restarts.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2) Bluetooth </strong>- the HP Pavilion Elite 190t had Bluetooth installed as built-in. That BT adapter was not performing well so I installed a Plugable USB-BT4LE that uses a Broadcom BCM20702 BT 4.0 chipset. The built-in BT adapter was disabled
 and uninstalled when running under Win10 1607 which allowed the USB-BT4LE to function perfectly. Installing 1703 killed it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Working with Plugable's support desk (Andy), we figured out that 1703's Generic Bluetooth Adapter (GBA) was installing itself on every restart in an attempt to use the built-in BT adapter which conflicted with the external Plugable BT device. 1703's GBA
 cannot tell which is the preferred BT adapter so defaults to the built-in one. The solution is to
but do not uninstall</span> the driver. This allowed the external USB device to function normally without the Win10 GBA trying to takeover. If the GBA is uninstalled then Win10 1703 attempts to reload the GBA every time there's a restart or boot and BT ceases
 to function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: the new BT behavior in 1703 no longer has the messages that were automatically generated when connecting to paired devices. It still connects automatically, it just takes a little longer and with no on-screen messages saying connection is being or
 has been made.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps some other poor soul out there ....</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Creators Update stops at 40&#37; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Creators Update stops at 40&#37;</h2>
                    <p>Greetings.</p>
<p>I have recently been struggling to update to Windows 10 Creators Update, and I have been trying a lot of techniques trying to update it, but it still stops at 40% and an error box pops up stating that
</p>
<p><strong>'Windows could not configure one or more components.'&nbsp;</strong>After this, I am forced to restart and lose update progress.</p>
<p>I have skimmed the web trying to find proper techniques that would work, but they do not help me at all.</p>
<p>I cannot do a clean install as I use a shared computer and I store many precious programs and files on it. I have also tried troubleshooting errors, but to no avail.</p>
I am also getting&nbsp;<em>increasingly worried&nbsp;</em>, as I heard there was recently a ransomware outbreak and I am anxious of getting my computer damaged and losing important files.
<p>Does anybody know any useful solutions that have worked in the past?</p>
<p>Thank you all, in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(TL;DR: Windows could not configure one or more components, when I upgrade to Windows 10 Creators edition it stops at 40%.)</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you can successfully install updates on your computer, we need to make sure that the Windows Update components are working correctly. To reset the components, follow the instructions on
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/971058/how-do-i-reset-windows-update-components" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this page</a>. After the series of steps have been performed, see if you will be able to get the Creators Update through Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it turns out.</p>

<p>I went through the first phase fine, but I got the error again on the second phase, still when it hits 40%.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I won't see a way out of this as I am unable to do clean install.</p>
<p>I could just leave my computer alone until the update is somehow sneaked onto my system, which I wouldn't really mind. But the chances of that happening is slim.</p>

<p>I use a shared computer and the computer contains precious images, files and apps, so I am unable to do a clean install. Unless I am thinking of it the wrong way (or haven't read the article right) and you can still keep the data you would like to keep.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Headphone jack not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> matt12d  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Headphone jack not working</h2>
                    <p>After upgrading to Windows 10 I noticed that my headphone jack had stopped working. The sound would continue to come out of PC rather than switching to headphones. Thought it may have been the headphones but all worked in another device. After realizing
 this I checked the playback devices noticed that it had the headphones on it. <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8aa66a02-1c13-4828-a2f9-7abf836424d7" /></p>
<p>The only way I could get my headphones to work was to manually change the default device. Any thoughts on this?&nbsp;</p>

            Hi John.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If this was caused by a Version Update then for 10 days you can roll it back in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool which is explained more here:   
<br /><a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninstall-and-block-updates-and-drivers-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninsta...</a>.
<br />
<br />After 10 days you can reinstall the older version using downloads available from Microsoft TechBench here:  <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>
<br />Burn to DVD using WIndows Image Burner or create bootable flash using one of the options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />
<br />But first I'd try everything possible to repair the audio:
<br />
<br />I'll give you all possible solutions for Sound problems.  If you have any problems performing any steps I'll be standing by here to help you.
<br />
<br />1)  Update the sound driver from the PC or device maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model, if it is newer than the one presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  While there compare to make sure you also have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display, Network and all other drivers.  
<br />
<br />2) Restore the Windows Audio Service which may have become disabled: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/57567-restore-default-services-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/57567-resto...</a> 
<br />
<br />3) Next try this checklist:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4026994/windows-fix-sound-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/402699...</a>
<br />
<br />4) Right click Volume icon in System Tray, choose Sound Settings, from the Output and Input devices dropdown menus, choose then one(s) affected to see if that helps.  If not use the Troubleshoot button nearby. 
<br />
<br />5) Run the Playing Sound troubleshooter at Start button &gt; Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />6) Try rolling back the sound drivers in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  Choose Sound controller and other audio devices, then Driver tab, then Roll back if available.  
<br />  
<br />7) If no newer sound drivers then uninstall the one presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button.  Restart PC to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />8) Try other and older drivers for your model Sound controller, too.  For example, try the next oldest driver in the model's online Support Downloads list.  To try all previous drivers installed on your system, in Device Manager choose Sound controller's Driver tab, then Update Driver, then Browse, then Let Me Pick.  
<br /> 
<br />9) If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />10) If this was caused by Version 1809 update (which you can confirm at Settings &gt; System &gt; About) then you can roll back Version 1809 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />11) You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />12) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />13) If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a> 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

</p><p>HI Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of the audio steps worked unfortunately, maybe this is an issue with 1903.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I install 1809 how can I stop it updating?</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>There are several known issues with audio in v.1903. You can find them <a href="https://www.thewindowsclub.com/known-issues-with-windows-10-v1903-may-2019-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>, albeit in somewhat technical language.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a roll-back period for 10 days after you install a feature update. During those 10 days, you can 'roll back' to the preceding feature update. But although that's a fact, it's also misleading. The truth is, the more you have used your computer since
 updating, the less likely you are to succeed in rolling back. There's only so much that can be 'undone.'</p>
<p>
</p><p>This probably won't help you now, but if you adopt the habit of backing up every day, you can roll back to any day at all, as long as you made a backup on that day, and your computer will look and work&nbsp;<em>exactly</em> as it did on that day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To the second part of your question: You cannot stop updating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I struggle to find the right words to explain this to posters. Windows 10 is not a product that receives updates - it
<em>is</em> updates. It is a continuous series of updates that began at a point in time and will continue indefinitely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Updates are a fundamental part of Windows 10 - one of its key features - so Microsoft goes to great lengths to ensure that users receive them. The only way to stop receiving updates is to break your operating system, and there are people here who will be
 happy to show you how to do that. Not me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can&nbsp;<em>delay</em> updates, and that's an excellent idea for everyone. Feature updates should be delayed for months, or until the consensus is that they are stable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I always find it amusing that the same people who'll teach you how to interfere with Windows so you'll stop receiving updates are the very same people who publish instructions and urge posters to bypass all of Microsoft's built-in protections and get new
 feature updates as quickly as possible. Isn't that ironic?</p>

            Hi John -
<br />
<br />There are older version downloads via Microsoft TechBench here:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>
<br />Burn to DVD using WIndows Image Burner or create bootable flash using one of the options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />
<br />Then follow the  illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />After install immediately run the Hide Updates tool to search for Version 1903 and block it as shown here:

<p>You can defiantly stop windows updating different version, how else would studios and people keep their version. Some people need 1703 for example.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows breaks things a lot by the seems of it, so I don't find it hard to believe why people want their stuff not messed up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This interface has no reported issues working in windows, so it must be 1903. I have already reinstalled once.</p>

<p>I honestly wish you well, but I'm afraid you're going to have a lot of trouble with Windows. You could join the majority who have learned how to work successfully with Windows, but you have to want to be in that place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This place is populated by many posters who only need the right direction to become successful with their computers, but instead they are taken in by 'advisors' whom it seems are determined to keep them among the underclass of computer users.</p>

</p><p>In services.msc, System Event Notification service (SENS) isn't running and will not start even though Startup Type is Automatic. Before the "Invalid access to memory..." string is Error 998.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason, the %TEMP% folder contains about 4000 WER????.dir0? subfolders, which are created by Windows Error Reporting, if I understand correctly. I turned off WER using sysdm.cpl as a workaround, but the system isn't stable without SENS. I don't
 know that this symptom is necessarily connected to the SENS problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In System Event Viewer, the error is thrown from DCOM and the description is:</p>
<p>"The server {D3938AB0-5B9D-11D1-8DD2-00AA004ABD5E} did not register with DCOM within the required timeout." Using regedit, I traced the Clsid back to SENS, but that doesn't really tell me anything. The value is the registry is "SENS Subscriber for EventSystem
 EventObjectChange events."</p>
<p>
</p><p>The services on which SENS depends are the COM+ Event System and Remote Procedure Call. Both are Automatic and Started.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I fix this? Thanks much.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Andy in SoCal.</p>
<p>

            <p>After more research, I found that the WER????.dir0? files are created by Dr. Watson Post-Mortem Debugger. For some reason, Dr. Watson runs many processes just after booting XP. Not sure why. I turned off Dr. Watson using the registry update described in
 this article:</p>
<p>http://techdows.com/2009/03/how-to-fix-drwatson-postmortem-debugger.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>Might XP have turned on Dr. Watson because SENS won't start as XP is booting?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks much.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your note, John. Yeah; I could disable SENS, but isn't that a bit like pulling the fuse in the Check Engine light circuit? And if it's symptomatic of another failure I'd rather have more clues from XP than fewer.</p>

            <p>Hi again John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was about to run a non-destructive re-installation of XP Pro, but decided to run sfc /scannow using the XP Pro SP3 CD. That pretty much solved the problems. Also discovered that the user was logging in as administrator so changed the account type to limited.
 I ran Windows Memory Diagnostic and no errors occurred. Also ran Windows Defender Offline from a bootable USB gizmo. No malware was detected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I suspect that there might have been a malware problem that might have been partially resolved in that the malware was removed but not all the damage was repaired.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At any rate the system is satisfactory now. Will upgrade to Win 7 ASAP. Thanks for your kind assistance.</p>

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>What steps have you taken to resolve this issue so far?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the computer you are trying to install this software on is joined into an organisation, you will need to speak to your Technical Support administrator.</p>
<p>If this is your own personal PC, if you are not using an Admin level account, ask your PC admin to install the software for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try right-clicking on the installer package, and click Run as Administrator, it will have a shield next to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Edit: You could also try disabling your anti-virus software whilst you try installing this software.</strong></p>

<h2>            Set login greeting to NAME not GAMERTAG &#40;and display name in upper left&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello! My wife is now using my xbox one to watch tv, but she doesn't like being greeted by her GAMERTAG instead of her name when she logs in. She also doesn't like that it is stuck in the upper left corner, and wants that to be her real name too. Is there
 a way to change which it displays? Other posts from 3 years ago mention a page on live.com that doesn't exist. Want to make sure this is actually possible before sinking lots of time into it. To be clear it is displaying her GAMERTAG and she wants her name
 displayed. Any help appreciated! Thanks!</p>

 button or really anything on the taskbar really to work.&nbsp; I am using a Dell Optiplex 780 and keyboard is not the issue.</p>

<p>Joel, thanks for your prompt reply and happy new year!&nbsp; I appreciate your time.&nbsp; Just like ELB8...&nbsp; My laptop started having this issue after a big windows update -- immediately after.&nbsp; However, I will provide the info you requested nonetheless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order of your questions, here are my responses:</p>
<p>
</p><p>* The significant change was a very large Windows update.&nbsp; Not sure if they are the same update, but in the last several weeks, or longer, a Windows update failed at least twice and my system undid any of the failed update attempt changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>* I am not getting any error messages when I use the keyboard Windows button nor when I click the Windows icon in the far left bottom of my task bar.&nbsp; Since I am unable to get to my Settings window, I am unable to tell if there are pending updates.&nbsp; If fact,
 the only reason I noticed my Windows button was not working is because on system boot, I have to enter my password, but prior to the update, I was using my already-established PIN and I wanted to go into Settings to change the way I log on to my system.<br />
</p>
<p>* I have an ASUS R554L Series laptop purchased in June of 2015 originally running Windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>* I am running McAfee Anti-virus provided via a Home Use program for US Government workers.&nbsp; I will not disable it as it has real-time updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>* External keyboard Windows Start key when depressed act only as a "Tab" function whereby when this dialog box has focus of the cursor pressing the Windows Start key moves focus to the border of the box and the cursor disappears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you can help me resolve this issue.</p>
<p>

<p>We appreciate the additional information that you have provided. Third-party antivirus programs are well-known to cause issues in downloading/installing important updates for Windows 10. You can just go ahead and temporarily disable it to remove any possibility
 of unsuccessful updates. </p>
<p>

<p>Jomel, thanks for your continued help in this matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Per your suggestion, I temporarily disabled my McAfee anti-virus.&nbsp; I then ran SFC /scannow with the result "Verification 100% complete," and "Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon completion of SFC, I ran "DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth" Image Version: 10.0.16299.125, with result "No component store corruption detected."</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows Start button still does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you know if Microsoft is working on a patch to run to fix this issue?&nbsp; It appears that my system is not working correctly directly after running a Microsoft update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the next thing you recommend I do to fix this issue?</p>

<p>Jomel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, I'm grateful for your assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to right-mouse click the WIndows Start button and select "Settings."&nbsp; From there I navigated to the Troubleshooting area and ran the troubleshooter.&nbsp; It showed 3 fixes to updates and said my system was not in need of any updates.&nbsp; Under the Updates
 tab of Settings, however, there is one update which failed on 31 Dec (Windows 10 update successfully updated on 30 Dec).&nbsp; The notice next to the failed notification is "0x80240034".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oddly enough, the Update tab "Check for updates" button didn't show that the failed update was available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on the update, 2017-12 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 ver 1709 x64-based Systems (KB4054517)(2), an MS Edge window initiates but fails to load and then disappears after a couple seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also followed your link to "How to: Perform a Repair Upgrade Using the Windows 10 ISO file" to see if I wanted to download the ISO file fix.&nbsp; When I clicked on the hyperlink "<span>Click&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>HERE</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;to
 download official&nbsp;ISO media for Windows 10 from Microsoft."&nbsp;</span>it takes me to a new window with two possible downloads "Windows 10 Fall Creators Update now available" and "Create Windows 10 installation media".</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I have to resort to trying to do a Windows 10 install, which one of those downloads do I use?</p>

<p>I have seen a similar thing about 2 years ago and the cause was DropBox. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have DropBox installed?&nbsp; Can you disable startup items from the Task Bar and then restart and see if the problem goes away. If so then add startup items back one by one and see if the problem comes back.</p>

    <title>Qualcomm atheros AR9485WB driver not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> elvischris  say:</h3>
<h2>            Qualcomm atheros AR9485WB driver not working</h2>
                    I recently bought my brother a new laptop, Samsung ativ book 2 for school and it worked fine until mi broke down and I had to use his. Then I got a win8.1 update and on update the wifi drivers went berserk for some reason and stopped working. So I downgraded
 back to win8 , but nothing fixed. On device manager under network adapters the Qualcomm atheros ar9485wb was marked with a yellow triangle and an exclamation so I used my phone via USB tethering to scan for changes but nothing happened. I tried to update driver
 software but my drivers are up to date. I tried refreshing the PC to an earlier time when it worked fine but it was no good. I even uninstalled the adapter and deleted the drivers as suggested in several forums and downloaded new drivers, used Samsung update,
 I even bought a DOS driver disc but still nothing. I'm posting this here to seek help because this started when I was upgrading my OS. So I finally desperately purchased a 15gb file for all kinds of drivers of all types

            <p><span>Hi, </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>In Windows Vista, there is no built-in template to create DVD labels however; you may visit this link to create labels for CD/DVDs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This behavior occurs if you use the "Backup and Restore Center" item to back up files and folders on CD media that already contains data or on DVD media, which already contains data.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To help provide a reliable backup, the "Backup and Restore Center" item does not support using media to which data has previously been written.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To work around this behavior, insert a new blank media in the CD drive or in the DVD drive when you use the "Backup and Restore Center" item to back up files and folders in Windows Vista.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This behavior is by design.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>For any additional information, please refer to these articles.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong><span>Message that you receive when you use the "Backup and Restore Center" Control Panel item in Windows Vista: "Label and insert a blank disk</span><span>":</span></strong><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/931274" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/931274</strong></a>

<p>It seems a lot or people still wish to play original &nbsp; xbox games on the 360</p>
<p>Note not all games are compatible </p>
<p>This a link of backward compatible games </p>
<p><a href="http://support.xbox.com/pages/xbox-360/how-to/play-original-games.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../play-original-games.aspx</a></p>
<p>This has worked for me </p>
<p>Fist connect to xbox live put a original xbox game in your 360 , download the emulator for free this will take just a few seconds this should work for you</p>

<p>Be careful about downloading the patches to load ordinary Xbox games because some have bugs in them and they cause a number of problems and one of the problems causes the Xbox 360 to freeze when an Xbox 360 game is being played in single player. &nbsp;That happened
 to me when I downloaded a multi-patch to play GTA III, GTA: VC and GTA: SA. &nbsp;Everytime I wanted to play GTA 4 my console kept freezing in single player minutes and sometimes seconds after I started playing it. &nbsp;When I was playing TLaD in single player I had
 the same problem where TLaD is connected to GTA 4 when you play TLaD as the downloadable version. &nbsp;When I deleted my game save from GTA 4 everything was fine apart from me having to delete what I did it GTA 4 and luckily I had already got 100% otherwise I
 would have had to start the game again. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Two other problems while playing ordinary Xbox games with the Xbox 360, first we always get logged out of Xbox Live so we can't chat to our friends in a Party Chat and also the ordinary Xbox games have no achievements. &nbsp;When GTA: SA was added to the Marketplace,
 even though it was changed to load in the Xbox 360, you still get logged out of Xbox Live when you load the game and there's still no achievements with that game.

I've been searching all over the internet to try find a solution to my issue. Since 2 days ago I've been unable to connect my Xbox 360 to my network. I'm trying to connect wireless using the built in wireless receiver.<br />
<br />
Further info:<br />
<br />
<strong>What Country/State/Province do you live in?<br />
</strong>Victoria, Australia<strong><br />
Modem brand &amp; model number: </strong><br />
Netcomm nb14wn<strong><br />
Network Connection Type: </strong><br />
Wireless<strong><br />
If Wireless, what type of encryption are you using?<br />
</strong>PPPoE<strong><br />
If Wireless, are you using a white or black external adapter, or an internal (Xbox 360S) adapter?<br />
</strong>internal (Xbox 360S) adapter<strong><br />
</strong><strong>Things you have tried: <br />
</strong>I've turned modem on and off, reset modem through modem interface, manually put in IP address on xbox, resetting xbox.<strong><br />
</strong><strong>Is UPnP Enabled? Yes/no/Unknown:<br />
</strong>Unknown<strong><br />
</strong><strong>Is NAT Type Open? <br />
</strong>Unknown<strong><br />
</strong><strong>Any Error Codes you encounter:<br />
</strong>It never gives me an error code, it just has a red cross through the connection area on the Xbox.<strong><br />
</strong><strong>What type of internet do you have? Cable/DSL/T1/3G?<br />
</strong>ADSL2+<strong><br />
</strong><strong>Who is your ISP(Internet Service Provider)? </strong><br />
Dodo<strong><br />
</strong><strong>After you run "Test Xbox LIVE connection" and click on "More info", what is the exact message shown on screen?<br />
</strong>"Can't Connect to your wireless network. Make sure you're connecting to the correct wireless network. Your console is configured to connect to the Netcomm Network. Do you want to select a different wireless network?"<strong><br />
<br />
If somebody could help that would be great, I'm happy to provide more information that you need!<br />

<p>The first thing I would try is powering off your console and router for about 30 seconds, power the router up first and once you have an internet connection power up the Xbox. Test your network connection again.</p>
<p>If you still have the issue then I would try resetting the network settings on your Xbox. Note that when you do this you will probably need the password/security key &nbsp;to connect to your router.</p>

<p>I have to assume it is because you would have noticed when you reset the settings. Does your router/modem sign you into your ISP automatically?</p>
<p>I noticed you're using PPPoE encryption. Have you always used this encyption method to connect your Xbox to your network?</p>

<h2>            HP refurb laptop. Upgraded to Windows 10. Run out of space on Recovery &#40;D&#41;. Help please&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I bought a new/refurbished windows 8.1 hp laptop. Switched it on and it offered a free upgrade to windows 10 which I accepted. now it's coming up with this message:"low disk space You are running very low on disk space on RECOVERY (D:)" I have not downloaded
 anything but windows 10. I have used 55/910gb of C, and 20/20gb of D. ? I don't know if it was like this before the upgrade, or as a result of it. There were no restore points before the upgrade and it won't let me create any new ones as there's not enough
 space. I haven't made recovery discs yet as I can only do it once and not sure whether to do it now or when it's fixed.&nbsp;Does anyone know why this has happened and how to fix it please?</p>

            Hi, thanks for your reply.&nbsp; I have uninstalled Windows 10 and am now using 8.1, but the problem is still the same. There is nothing for me to remove as I hadn't installed anything onto the computer. I had just got it new, so there shouldn't have been anything
 on there but the factory install and&nbsp;Windows 10 that I had downloaded. I'm not sure what to do from here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>&nbsp; Same problem here, Downloaded the 'free' windows 10' and now there's that Stupid 'slide in banner' w/ the dam 'chime' saying 'you are running out of disk space on Recovery (D:) and there's NO HELP HERE...</p>
<p>&nbsp; I'm 'compressing' the drive and allowing the files to have the contents indexed in addition to file properties, but before all this I'm creating a 'restore point' on an external hard drive...
</p>
<p>My recommendation...</p>
<p>The Windows 10 free upgrade has a lot of 'retarded' stuff on it like 'hidden scrolling bars' under the ugly and dumb 'start window' that aren't apparent until 'moused over'.. why? who in windows **** knows?<br />
&nbsp;There's NO REASON FOR IT! Plus it's the most invasive OS EVER! Using up bandwidth to send demographics etc. back to microsoft 'cause they wanna be more like 'social media' for the almighty $ available there.</p>
<p>Of course MS will stop supporting the older OS's @ some point so you MUST upgrade, again, for the almighty $ to be added to Bill &amp; Melinda's pocketbook, oh, and the stockholders of course... Philanthropics be damned if you stick it to your customers to get
 the $ to do it.</p>

                    How do I convert music files that are in my Windows media player to MP3 files so I can then put them on my MP3 player?

<blockquote>How do I convert music files that are in my Windows media player to MP3 files so I can then put them on my MP3 player?</blockquote>
==================================<br />
The following freeware can do the conversion:<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System<br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />
<br />
Format Factory<br />
<a href="http://www.pcfreetime.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pcfreetime.com/</a><br />
(FWIW...you may want to uncheck<br />
all the boxes on the final screen)<br />
<br />
After downloading and installing Format Factory...<br />
open the program and choose an Output Folder...<br />
(this is where you will find your files after they are<br />
converted)<br />
<br />
Drag/drop your .wma files onto the main screen...<br />
<br />
Select 'All to MP3' / OK...<br />
<br />
Left click...Start...on the toolbar...<br />
<br />
That should do it...<br />
<br />
Good luck...<br />
<br />
