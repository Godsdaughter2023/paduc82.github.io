<h2>            Windows 10 BSOD pci.sys</h2>
                    <div>I recently encountered several DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE crashes and restart automatically after I leave from my laptop for a few minutes or hours.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Just enabled the minidump today and finally get a minidump report. After I use WinDbg to see what's going on and it's related to pci.sys but honestly I'm not a pro to analyze the debug information. So I am still confused now. Would anyone mind please checking
 what's the real problem for me? I do really appreciate it!</div>

<br />Recommendations
<br />1. Create a system restore point so that if something wrong happens you can revert. 
<br />2. Force a Windows update to update pci.sys as they are from Windows.
<br />3. Watch your system for few hours. If BSOD appears again, it means pci.sys is not the direct culprit but some other driver. Upload the new dump
<br />4. Enable Driver Verifier and generate dump files and upload to Onedrive and share the link here (Don't forget to turn off Driver Verifier after the job is done). Do read the instructions carefully particularly how to get back into Windows when you get the crash.

            Hi WestinYung
<br />
<br />All your minidump files indicate your Nvidia graphics card device driver is causing your system crashes - nvlddmkm_IMAGE_pci.sys
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button)
<br />Expand the Display Adapters Section
<br />Right click your video card and choose Properties
<br />On the Driver Tab, choose 'Roll back Driver'
<br />
<br />Restart your PC once done . . .
<br />
<br />If that does not resolve the issue, go to the support page for your device on the manufacturers website, then download and install the video driver they recommend, it may well be an older version to the one you are currently running       
        </p>

            nVidia is coming as additional driver but it has a date of 16-Oct-2018. So, I am not sure if there is a driver post to this date. You will need to check on computer manufacturer's website.

<h2>            Windows 10 clean install on a formatted &#40;blank&#41; hard drive</h2>
                    <p><span>My PC is an Acer TC-220; Windows 10 was pre-installed.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span><span>A simple Factory Restore went terribly awry and I found myself in a position that none of the
<em>Recovery Disks</em></span><span> (including a separate Applications &amp; Drivers disk) I made when I unboxed the PC or the
</span><em><span>Win 10 System Repair Disk</span></em><span> I created a short while later were of any assistance in getting my computer up and running.</span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter
 what I tried I</span></span><span>&nbsp;could never get past the ‘entering Setup’ screen.</span><span><span>&nbsp; I let it sit one day for over 4 hours &amp; it did not change.&nbsp;
</span></span><span>It was suggested that I remove the HDD and format it and proceed with a clean install.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>I have a HDD enclosure so I put the HDD in the enclosure, connected it to my laptop and proceeded to format the HDD.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>I then returned the HDD to my PC.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>I downloaded the Windows Media Creation Tool.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>I installed it on a formatted 32GB thumb drive and also burned the ISO files to a DVD-R.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>I also downloaded a file called Rufus.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Try as I might, I am no further ahead no matter which type of media I try.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Actually, I cannot now even get past the logo screen.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Clicking F12 is supposed to proceed to the Setup screen except nothing happens when I do; but that makes me wonder how the computer would recognize a usb mouse and/or keyboard if they have nothing more than a blank
 HDD to access?</span><span><span>&nbsp; </span></span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span><span>I am totally lost.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Can anyone offer any Dummy step-by-step instructions that would assist me in

<p>Hello &amp; many thanks for taking the time to try and assist.&nbsp; However, I don't feel that you really understand my dilemma.&nbsp; The wiki information you provided is hardly dummy instructions although&nbsp;I am aware of the information contained therein.&nbsp; &nbsp;I've been
 at this for ages and I don't think there is a website or a YouTube video on the subject that I have not visited.&nbsp;&nbsp; My head is spinning.&nbsp; I need Dummy instructions that can tell me what I am doing wrong or what I may be overlooking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I have a formatted (blank)&nbsp;hard drive.</p>
<p>- I downloaded the Media Creation Tool and created a flash stick installer on a 32GB thumb drive as well as burning the ISO files to a DVD-R.</p>
<p>- I put the thumb drive in the computer and boot it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>- my usb mouse and keyboard are connected</p>
<p>- The PC starts and the Acer Logo screen appears.&nbsp; </p>
<p>- Clicking F12 is supposed to take me to&nbsp;the Setup screen.&nbsp; It doesn't!!!&nbsp; I am stalled at the logo screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;- I try the DVD.&nbsp; Ditto the above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again many thanks but I am no further ahead.</p>

<p><span><span>I tried Rufus once to no avail.&nbsp; The majority of my efforts has been trying&nbsp;to figure out&nbsp;the Media Creation Tool.&nbsp; I have installed it&nbsp;on various (blank/formatted)

 turn on the computer, I get the Acer Logo screen and that is it.<span>&nbsp; I can bang on the F-12 key until it pops out of the keyboard but nothing happens.&nbsp; I am still left staring at the Acer Logo screen.&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Something is amiss and I can’t figure it out; however,</span><span><span>&nbsp;t</span></span><span>rying other ports (thank you for the thought) was not something I had

<p>Beautiful instructions. Excellent wikki article. I have bookmarked in case of another rainy day down the road. &nbsp;I suspect the part that LG13 missed was the deletion of existing partition as i stumbled there before i read your post. &nbsp;Thanks again, your efforts

            One thing that I have noticed missing from this that might be of interest: F12 is not always the key to enter boot or BIOS. It all depends on which motherboard and BIOS version you are running. Find out what motherboard you have and do a Google search
 to find which key needs to be pressed to enter BIOS. For my MSI motherboard, the Delete key is the one I need to press. If your computer is not trying to boot off the DVD or USB, it will not proceed.&nbsp;

<p>My Win7 os has been working fine for the past 3-4 years, decided to do a clean install of Win10. The usb media is recognized, completes the loading files page and goes into the motherboard text page with (1) white dot showing then goes to a blank screen.
 Tried the usb media on another computer and worked fine, turns out the one white dot is the start of the circular dots showing the active install. Attempting to install the new w10 os on a 1tb ssd that was wiped and formated as an “F” drive before removing
 the main ssd “c” drive with the previous os system and files still in tact. I have reloaded the bios defaults but cannot get past the above text page with one dot. Could the “F” drive designation be causing the problem and if so how do I change. If not any
 advise would be very much appreciated.</p>

<p>Intel i7 4771</p>
<p>I can reinstall the original ssd that contains w7 and the system functions normally.</p>

<p>Did you create media only from Media Creation Tool?</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html<br />
<br />
Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer.<br />
<br />
If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup&nbsp;&nbsp; to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. http://www.mydigitallife.info/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/</p>

<p>
</p><p>I recently updated to Windows 10 and my mail isn't working. Simple as that. I keep getting the message "Your Outlook settings are out-of-date" and I get prompted to press "Fix account" or "Dismiss". If I press "Fix account" a window flashes and then closes
 and nothing has been done. Thanks to this I can't sync my mail. How do I fix this?</p>

            That didn't help me. My Outlook account doesn't "stick" as the default email account. Instead, one of the accounts that I have linked to my Outlook account takes over. My Outlook mail still seems to come in, but when I send an email, the Mail app uses
 the linked email address. Bummer.

            That's how my problems started...technically yesterday. I've been up a while trying to find a solution. None yet. I got a notification when I logged on that my Outlook settings were out of date. So I told it to fix them, and it said it couldn't. Then I
 noticed my admin privileges seemed not to work. I can't change settings, can't open the Windows Firewall, can't add a user.... I try to open the firewall and nothing happens except a notification block that says "expand". Eventually it gives up, and then it
 says "This snap-in is not responding. To return to MMC and check the status of the snap-in, click CANCEL". Up until now, I'd have said Windows 10 was okay (although XP was probably the best so far). Now I'm thinking Windows 10 is a bug farm. I&nbsp; upgraded because
 Microsoft claimed it fixed the annoying aspects of Windows 8.1, but after installing Classic Shell to get rid of all that metro screen stuff, it worked well enough. This problem with 10 is a pretty big bug that needs fixing quick. A lot of people are having
 problems with it, and since it affects so much, it's getting posted in various different threads in the forums.<br />

<h2>            Signed up using email.  How do I get a Skype ID&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just signed up for a new Skype account (via Version 12.10.572.0, for Windows 10).&nbsp; When prompted whether to use an email or phone number, I decided to go with the former.&nbsp; That email address appears to have become solidified as my Skype ID, which it now
 seems I will be unable to change...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was hoping to create a Skype ID that's simpler and more convenient than my cumbersome email address...&nbsp; Any suggestions??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much,</p>

<p>Hi Carlos,</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<h2>            Disk read error on loading Windows</h2>
                    
<p>"Hello,</p>
&nbsp;Yesterday, I was working on Windows 7, not overloading or something, but suddenly I heard the sound of the HDD that you hear when it stops (when you shut-down), and the<a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/260188-32-disk-read-error-wrong-read-info-bios#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>PC</span></span></a>stopped
 responding except the pointer. I restarted, and it gave me:&nbsp;
<p>disk read error <br />
press CTRL+ALT+DEL</p>
&nbsp;
<p>I restarted, it sort of booted giving me the 2 choices of Windows 7:</p>
&nbsp;
<p>-Start normally<br />
-Launch repair</p>
&nbsp;
<p>In start normally it loads up the boot screen but just after that it restarts. It restarted and read the HDD like "BzBzBzBz" after POST. I entered BIOS, it read it as 571 GB and some weird stuff...</p>
&nbsp;
<p>I happened to have Live CD of Linux on my USB flash (on which I'm working now), I mounted Hard Disk drives, they all work! But the "Documents and Settings" folder is empty.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>This problem happened before and I don't know what the cause is?</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Is it the MBR, track zero or SATA controller? and please tell if I could do something through my USB flash (like launching a specific test or fix)</p>
HDD: Western Digital 160 GB 7200 RPM SATA<br />
<p>Motherboard: Gigabyte, Chipset: Intel 945G<br />
OS: Used to be windows 7<br />
RAM: 1 GB DDR2</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Posted before to TomsHardware.com, but no luck (as it is probably something to do with HW)</p>

<p><span>Hi M.Mag,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This looks to be a problem with the hard drive or hardware device on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Check if there are any bad sectors on the hard drive would suggest running chkdsk which would scan for any bad sectors on the
 hard drive and if those errors are repairable if would repair and if it cannot at the end of the chkdsk scan you would see a message “found one or more unrecoverable error on the hard drive” which means the hard drive is damaged.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you have a Windows Vista installation disc, you need to restart (boot) your computer using the installation disc. If you
 do not restart your computer from the disc, the option to repair your computer will not appear.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Insert
 the installation disc.</span></p>

<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 the Start button, click the arrow next to the Lock button , and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>If
 prompted, press any key to start Windows from the installation disc.<br />
<strong>Note</strong>:&nbsp; If your computer is not configured to start from a CD or DVD, check the information that came with your computer. You may need to change your computer's BIOS settings. For more information, see BIOS: frequently asked questions.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 7 RC </h2>
                    Ok, I have just purchased a retail version of Windows 7 Ultimate to replace the RC. Why can't I just change the product key to&nbsp;keep from doing a nuke and pave? I feel punish for being a tester.

<blockquote>Why can't I just change the product key <br />

Because the RC is a test version and is much different under the hood then the final RTM of Windows 7, and was not designed for continued use or for upgrading<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Can You Upgrade From Windows 7 Release Candidate To The Final Version&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;<br />
For info about the Windows 7 Release Candidate expiring and what to do:&nbsp; <br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/release-candidate-Windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/release-candidate-Windows-7
</a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Sorry, Microsoft does not support an upgrade from Windows 7 Release Candidate (RC) to the final version. The Windows 7 RC was for testing purposes only and was not designed for continued use or for upgrading. You can backup your files and settings with Windows
 Easy Transfer before reinstalling XP or Vista, and then move to the final release version of Windows 7 if you wish. You will need to reinstall your programs.&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The Windows 7 Upgrade software requires XP or Vista to be installed first, if you have a qualifying version of Windows (XP or Vista) you can install it on your computer and buy an Upgrade version.&nbsp; The Upgrade software doesn't allow an upgrade version of Windows
 7 on a blank hard drive to be activated.&nbsp; The installation procedure does not ask you to insert a Windows disc in the drive for verification, the Upgrade disk software requires the actual qualifying operating system to be installed.&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you do not have a qualifying Windows operating system with a genuine license, then you cannot use the Upgrade version of Windows 7 - you would need a "Full version" Windows 7 license.&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
In summary:&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. The Upgrade software needs a qualifying Windows operating system (XP/Vista) to be installed.&nbsp;
<br />
2. The qualifying Windows operating system must have a genuine license (product key) and it must be activated. If you don't have a qualifying license you will need a Full version.&nbsp;
<br />
3. To move from XP/Vista to 7, boot to the qualifying Windows desktop, insert the Windows 7 Upgrade disc in the DVD drive.&nbsp;
<br />
4. When the setup menu appears, select Custom (advanced) to initiate a clean install procedure, or Upgrade if you are upgrading.&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The Following Message From Microsoft Was On The Download Page For The Release Candidate:&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Please note: All users of the Windows 7 Release Candidate (including Windows Vista users who have upgraded to the Release Candidate) must do a clean installation of Windows 7 RTM. Please keep this is mind as you consider downloading the Release Candidate as
 opposed to waiting for the general availability release.&nbsp; <br />
Thanks again for your help in reaching this important milestone. We hope that you will join us in testing the RC and finishing Windows 7!&nbsp;

                    <p>I am trying to connect my MDR-XB650BT Sony headphones to my HP Pavilion dv7 laptop, but I have no idea where to start because the only thing on my computer relating to bluetooth are the "Bluetooth Support Service" and the "Bluetooth Service." I tried downloading
 multiple drivers, but all of them aren't compatible or didn't do anything at all. Any help is much appreciated.</p>

<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
I am still having this problem and still dont have much of an idea of where to start, or what things might lead me to an answer.<br />
</p>
<p>It turns out I actually have the widcomm bluetooth driver on my computer, and before, I didn't do a thorough enough search. Upon discovery of this driver, I don't see anything or at least lack the knowledge to notice anything that would be related to connecting
 my headphones to the computer. I try opening an application named "Bluetooth Headset Helper," but the only thing that shows up after opening is this "error message."</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cca432c4-59eb-47f1-a8dc-373436698641?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cca432c4-59eb-47f1-a8dc-373436698641?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Which obviously wasn't too much of a help.<br />
"<span>MDR-XB650BT" doesn't appear in Devices and Printers or at all, anywhere. Along with the only things relating to bluetooth in the device manager being "Bluetooth audio" and "Bluetooth hands-free audio"<br />

<p>Most of the problems relating to connecting new Bluetooth devices such as headphones to Windows 7 computers are caused by the fact that many of these devices use Bluetooth v 4.x (also known as Bluetooth Low Energy or Bluetooth LE) but Windows 7 does not
 natively support Bluetooth 4.x.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sony doesn't make it easy to find out what version of Bluetooth is used by these headphones, but I finally found it and yes, these headphones use Bluetooth 4.0 --

https://docs.sony.com/release//specs/MDRXB650BTB_mksp.pdf</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The odds are pretty good that you don't have Bluetooth 4.0 support, but to check, see
<a href="http://www.bluetoothandusb3.com/how-to-confirm-bluetooth-version-of-computer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.bluetoothandusb3.com/how-to-confirm-bluetooth-version-of-computer</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming that this is your problem, you can solve it by simply purchasing a Bluetooth 4.x adapter that is compatible with Windows 7.&nbsp; This device should come with (or have a link to download) the necessary Windows 7 driver.&nbsp; They aren't very expensive.&nbsp;
 For example:&nbsp; </p>

    <title>legacy bios mode crashes Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> masikwha  say:</h3>
<h2>            legacy bios mode crashes Windows 8.1</h2>
                    1. Windows 8.1 loads and was loading fine with bios mode EUFI. <br />
2. Never tried changing bios mode to legacy bios until recently.<br />
<br />
3.-----<br />
4------<br />
<br />
5. Tried changing bios mode to legacy bios but windows fails to load&nbsp; saying insert bootable disc (or something like that)!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But if i change mode to EUFI, it loads windows just fine.<br />
<br />
What happened in 3 and 4:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;3. I installed Trisquel GNU linux.<br />
<br />
Restarted but I didn't get dual boot option, so using F2 I went to boot option and tried changing bios mode to Legacy Bios.<br />
Yes, Linux was loaded. If I wanted to load windows, I would have to go to boot menu and change bios mode to EUFI.<br />
<br />
4. I thought Linux sucked, just like I had heard, so I decided to remove it. I ended up deleting the partition Linux was on.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I restarted, (bios mode still being in Legacy Bios) , it failed to load any, with error message something like unable to find boot device or 'insert bootable cd'
<br />
<br />
Changing bios back to EUFI loads windows normally, <br />
I never used Legacy Bios prior to installing Linux so I do not know how it would have behaved otherwise, but now it is not loading anything.<br />
<br />
Can anybody give me an idea what might have happened?<br />
I have tried deleting what is so known as linux 'grub' with bootrec /fixmbr&nbsp; /fixboot etc as suggested by some forums, but the behavior persists.<br />
Shall be concerned? Shall keep using EUFI mode or shall I reinstall windows? or Are there any other way to fix this? or to delete linux grub ie to reinstate master boot loader?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />

            Thanks for detailed response. Both links require product key. Even though windows came with the purchase of my laptop Acer v3, I do not have the product key but s/n and snid on the back panel, and it is not printed on the receipt from the store, Fry's
 either.<br />
<br />
Secondly, I can access Advanced Start Up through PC settings but repair fails. And let me make it clear that my windows is working just fine with EUFI bios mode. Its only when I change the mode to Legacy Bios mode, it crashes trying to boot Linux on a partition
 L:\ which I previously had but deleted now.<br />
<br />
Did Legacy Bios work before I installed Trisquel Linux? I do not know because only after I installed Trisquel and rebooted, when Windows loaded without giving me dual boot option, I went to bios mode and changed to Legacy Bios, which loaded Linux only and not
 windows. But of course after changing to EUFI mode, windows would load just fine.
<br />
<br />
I am not even sure at this point if this is normal for Legacy Bios not to load windows 8(now 8.1 updated) or is it? Has installation of Trisquel actually left Grubs in to my windows MBR or not? I did not get dual boot option at all before and after the install
 and uninstall of Linux.<br />
<br />
Is windows 8.1 supposed to load with Legacy Bios option as well? <br />
<br />
Since I don't have product key, what would be my next alternative without having to Refresh or Reinstall windows from recovery? I have heard even with format of C:\ grubs is hard to get rid of, is that true? If so, this seems like a deliberate attempt of Linux
 distributor to attack on Windows users, no?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

            <p>Your license key is usually in the battery compartment of a laptop, or on a sticker on the bottom of the machine. If you are using a desktop, the sticker is on the outside of the PC or inside the removable side.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The factory has to provide the license key to you. If you did not erase Windows 8.1, why don't you just boot up to the recovery partition and restore it that way or if it will go into 8.1, go out to Settings and then refresh the system. That way it won't
 get rid of your files. </p>

            <p>i doubt you would even care at this point about your problem, but if you still want to know,
The&nbsp;</span><strong>Unified Extensible Firmware Interface</strong><span style="color: rgba(37, 37, 37, 1)">&nbsp;</span><strong>UEF&nbsp;</strong><span style="color: rgba(37, 37, 37, 1)">is
 a&nbsp;</span>specification<span style="color: rgba(37, 37, 37, 1)">&nbsp;that defines a software&nbsp;</span>interface<span style="color: rgba(37, 37, 37, 1)">&nbsp;between
 an&nbsp;</span>operating system<span style="color: rgba(37, 37, 37, 1)">&nbsp;and platform&nbsp;</span>firmware<span style="color: rgba(37, 37, 37, 1)">.
 UEFI replaces the Basic Input/Output System (</span>BIOS<span style="color: rgba(37, 37, 37, 1)">) firmware interface originally present in all&nbsp;</span>IBM PC-compatible<span style="color: rgba(37, 37, 37, 1)">&nbsp;</span>personal
 computers<span style="color: rgba(37, 37, 37, 1)">,</span><span style="color: rgba(37, 37, 37, 1)">&nbsp;with most
 UEFI firmware implementations providing legacy support for BIOS services. UEFI can support remote diagnostics and repair of computers, even with no operating system installed.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(37, 37, 37, 1)">UEFI (or EFI) comes preinstalled on windows Operating systems Windows 7 and up. &nbsp; anything before that used BIOS (basic Input Output System)
 &nbsp; they essentially are the same thing but UEFI handles the boot process differently. &nbsp;Unlike BIOS, UEFI can allow you to boot into recovery options, such as the command prompt, BIOS (Not the boot type. however BIOS is pretty much a generic term for the boot
 options and everything) settings, UEFI can also support disks over 2 TB in size (With GPT [GUID Partition Table]). (Oh and UEFI is a lot prettier)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(37, 37, 37, 1)">as far as i know, UEFI checks the boot loaders keys and signitures to verify that it is a non malicious program. &nbsp;This is where secure boot
 comes in. &nbsp;Secure boot is basically the "anti virus" of the boot manager. &nbsp;It verifies that he boot loader is safe and what not. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The Downside to this is that UEFI <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>ONLY</strong></span> supports booting with UEFI Windows OS's, which are windows 7 and up, and blocks other UEFI or EFI systems from using the windows boot loader.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>However, BIOS doesnt do that. &nbsp; Your computer is not broken so dont worry about reinstalling it or anything. &nbsp;your situation was normal. &nbsp; The reason you cant boot your windows OS in legacy/CSM/BIOS mode is because BIOS mode cant boot the modern windows
 boot loader, and UEFI cant boot the old windows boot loader. &nbsp; The reason you had to switch boot modes to get into linux was because your particular linux distribution was setup to boot in bios mode. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However there is a way around the dual booting block that microsoft did with UEFI. &nbsp;and that is to make sure that your linux is booted into UEFI mode (before installing it, also research how to do this because it would make this way longer than it should
 be), and then when you install linux, make sure that you mount the boot loader to /boot/efi, or choose the main partition (/dev/sda) (research like i said to make sure) &nbsp;because once this has been done, the GRUB (Grand Unified Bootloader) will overwrite the
 Windows Bootloader as the one that would boot windows. &nbsp; So instead of the Windows Bootloader running your computer, the Linux GRUB loader would be &nbsp;However there is ANOTHER problem with this...</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If GRUB is your main boot loader for windows AND linux, it can render your computer inoperable for a limited amount of time (by that i mean until you rebuild the boot loader and what not, ill provide a link for this) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If something happens to the Linux OS, for example, you wipe all the linux partitions, includeing the boot, swap, and main partition, and you leave only your windows ones, GRUB cant find anything to boot to (windows boot manager was chainloaded to GRUB) so
 when you turn your computer on, you be stuck in grub recovery mode, because you wiped the boot loader partition FOR grub. &nbsp; The Windows OS is still untouched, however theres no way to access it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I know this is a mouthful but i hope it answered some of your questions. &nbsp;haha and if this doesnt make a lot of sense, just research it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Heres how you can rebuild your Windows Bootloader just incase you cant access it because of GRUB being wiped, or for any other reason it wouldnt work:</p>

            <p>Hi Omar,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are many reasons that makes you unable to purchase from Windows Store. What's going on? Here are some possibilities:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span><strong>The app isn't available in your country or region.</strong>&nbsp;Not all apps are available worldwide. So the app your friend saw in France might not be available in Germany. If you bought an app in one country or region and then you moved to another
 one, apps you had might disappear.</span></li><li><span><strong>Family Safety settings might be hiding apps.</strong>&nbsp;Parents can use Family Safety settings to make sure that their child can’t view or install apps that are inappropriate for their age.</span></li><li><span><strong>The app is no longer available.</strong>&nbsp;Sometimes an app is removed from the Windows Store, but it takes a little time for the app description page on the web to get pulled down.</span></li><li><span><strong>The app is not compatible with your device.</strong>&nbsp;The&nbsp;Windows Store&nbsp;automatically hides or blocks the Buy button on apps that are incompatible with your device. You might see an app from&nbsp;the Windows Store&nbsp;available on your PC, but not on
 another PC, or your Xbox.</span></li><li><span><strong>Your PC was recently updated, but wasn't restarted.</strong>&nbsp;If updates for Windows were recently installed, you'll need to restart your PC before you can install apps from the Windows Store.</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you've check all of the possible reasons listed and are still unable to find or install apps, you can try clearing the cache for the Windows Store.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            Hi Anita,
<br />
<br />When all else fails, the manual approach is your best option to transfer the files, the built in Photos App can be a bit unreliable, and you will have more control over the files are transferred . . . 
<br />
<br />Open Windows Fie Explorer (folder icon on your Taskbar) 
<br />
<br />On the left click 'This PC' 
<br />
<br />On the right double click your device or the DCIM folder (whichever shows up) 
<br />
<br />Then simple select the files you want to transfer and drag them into the Pictures folder in the left pane of File Explorer 
<br />
<br />That's it!       
        </p>

<p>
</p><p>About a week ago I downloaded Windows 10, and some three days later I dropped soda on my computer and I had to reset it and I've lost my Windows 10. Is there any way to get it again for free?</p>
<p>

            <p><strong>Will my Antivirus be compatible with Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Most likely not. Windows 10 will require that you have a version of your Antivirus that is designed for Windows 10. It is recommended that you uninstall your current Antivirus before intiating the upgrade. If you have a subscription that has not expired,
 contact the developer to find out about Windows 10 support. Most Antivirus utilities should be upgraded by the time Windows 10 launches. If your subscription is still active, then you should be entitled to a compatible update for Windows 10.</p>

    <title>Xbox 360 E hard drive upgrade&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bdewitt82  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox 360 E hard drive upgrade&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I just bought a new 4Gb Xbox 360 E and was furious when the very first game I popped in (Army of Two: Devil's Cartel) told me that I couldn't play it with all of the enhanced HD content because I didn't have a local hard drive to install the content on.
 I installed an 8Gb flash drive (and tried clearing enough space on my 4GB drive) &nbsp;but the game is requiring the content to be installed on a local hard disk - not flash memory.</p>

<p>So my question is whether there are hard drive upgrades available for this "E" model yet? I'm not finding any online. There was an Amazon review post from a guy claiming to be a Microsoft IT employee stating that the 360 Slim hard drives would be compatible
 but I wanted to make sure before spending the money.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The hard drives from the slim models should fit into the new &nbsp;360E. The original Xbox hard drives will not however. This video will show how to remove the current hard drive if you're not sure how to do it. [View:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36WuZ4s4JW0]</p>

<p>Did anyone try it? Fitting a Xbox 360 Slim HDD in the Xbox 360 E model. Did it work properly? Because I bought the Slim HDD for my E console and it gave me E68 error code. That red ring light. Tried troubleshooting with various methods even from Xbox support,
 but it didn't work. But unplugging the Slim HDD my E console worked just fine.</p>

            <p>Microsoft doesnt repair controllers. They only replace them when they are still under warranty hense why the only option is to opt for a replacement.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Since you had a limited addition controller there is no guarantee you will get the same one since they dont make them anymore.

    <title>Windows Media TV Setup cannot detect the CableCard in my ATI TV Wonder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jdirector  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Media TV Setup cannot detect the CableCard in my ATI TV Wonder DCT &#40;Digital Cable Tuner&#41; nor any available channels</h2>
                    
<p>ATI TV Tuner purchased as a component with HP d5100t PC year ago.&nbsp; Finally had Comcast install Cable Card.&nbsp; Windows Media Center (after two days of trouble shooting) finally sees the device as one of my available tuners but cannot detect the installed Cable
 Card.&nbsp; Have had Comcast verified the accuracy of the S/N of the Card, Host ID and Data codes.&nbsp; Within WMC Diaganostics, card information displays under pairing tab.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Connected as only way possible via USB port on HP d5100t.&nbsp; Have powered ATI Tuner off and on numerious times, loaded and unloaded the device driver number of times.&nbsp; Device shows operating normally in Device Mgr.&nbsp; WMC finally detected the ATI DCT when I reconnect
 an antenna to the ATSC tuner in the PC.&nbsp; On all scan modes, WMC still cannot see Cable Card nor any of the channels.<br />
<br />
Cable signal is valid feeding through one cable splitter to Comcast's HD TV tuner/DVR with the other lead being split one more time between a cable modem and the ATI DCT.&nbsp; TV and Internet functions normally.&nbsp; Program guide is loaded and while the over the air
 ATSC signals display properly in WMC, program indicates&nbsp;no tuner for the cable channels.<br />
<br />
The HP d5100t is dual booted with W7 Ultimate 64 bit as my main OS with a 2nd W7 Premium 32 bit on a different partition for use with programs that I use which do not install nor run in 64 bit.&nbsp; Same situation and results under both OS.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else run into this same problem and come up with a resolution?&nbsp; Have requested Comcast bring out another Cable Card to exchange in case this is the result of a faulty component but my gut guess is that won't really be the problem.</p>

<p>this is very confusing. do you have a separate ATSC tuner or were you using <br />
the ATI Digital Cable Tuner without a cable card as a tuner?</p>
<br />
<p>if you have a separate tuner, please disable it in device manager for now</p>
<br />
<p><br />
</p>
<br />
<p>You may have RF issues with the line being split a second time before it gets<br />
to the DCT. Can you take the second splitter out of the mix for trouble <br />
shooting?</p>
<br />
<p>If that solves the problem, you will need Comcast to bring out a newer three <br />
way splitter/and/or a drop amp. </p>
<br />
After you reconfigure as suggested above, power cycle the computer and the <br />
DCT.
<br />
<p>Look in the network window and see if the DCT appears.If you see it, you can <br />
double click it and a web based interface will open and let you navigate various<br />
tabs that show the operation mode of the cable card. </p>
<br />
<p>Now, you need to re-do TV Setup when you open Media Center and see if the <br />
cable card is detected. If not, you may indeed need it to be replaced.</p>
<br />
<p>You should ignore the other reply which is incorrect.</p>

<p>Hello Michael2453<br />
Thank you for writing to Microsoft Forums.</p>
<p>To resolve this problem, use the Startup Repair tool. The Startup Repair tool can fix some problems that prevent the operating system from starting correctly.<br />
You can run the Startup Repair tool by using the Windows Vista or Windows 7 installation disc or by using the computer's preinstalled recovery options.<br />
To run the Startup Repair tool by using the Windows Vista or Windows 7 installation disc</p>
<p>If you have the Windows Vista or Windows 7 installation disc, follow these steps to use the Startup Repair tool:<br />
1. Insert the installation disc.<br />
Note: The computer must be configured to start from a CD or from a DVD. For information about how to configure the computer to start from a CD or from a DVD, see the information that came with the computer.<br />
2. Restart the computer. To do this, click, click the arrow next to the Lock button, and then click Restart.<br />
Note: If you cannot restart the computer by using this method, use the power button to turn off the computer. Then, turn the computer back on.<br />
3. Set your language preference, and then click Next.<br />
Note: In most cases, the startup repair process starts automatically, and you do not have the option to select it in the System Recovery Options menu.<br />
4. Click Repair your computer.<br />
5. In the System Recovery Options dialog box, click the operating system that you want to repair, and then click Next.<br />
6. In the System Recovery Options menu, click Startup Repair to start the repair process.
<br />
7. When the repair process is complete, click Finish.</p>
<p>“A Stop error occurs, or the computer stops responding when you try to start Windows Vista or Windows 7”<br />
