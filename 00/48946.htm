<h2>            Rating of melodies doesnt work properly in mediaplayer</h2>
                    Why is it that the rating seems to work randomly, it dissapears on some of the files and too often it is not visible in the explorer window. Appreciate any help.

            <p>Hi Oddgeir,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the Windows Media Player library, the blue stars are auto ratings and are controlled by non-Microsoft data providers and some online stores.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You can override an auto rating by manually choosing a new user rating. (Yellow star). New tracks are auto-rated with 3 stars. When you first play a track the auto rating increases to 4 stars and the rating goes up only if the track is played all the
 way through.</p>

            Thank you for a quick reply - anyway I have to say it only made it worse -<span>&nbsp;I ran the win media library fix only to find that the "medialibrary is damaged"
 but there was no fix??? I started the media player again and it took a while before the library was filled up again with all my music - during that time the update arrow in the bottom was constantly flicking. Unfortunately it ended up with plenty blue ratings
 in between my yellow stars, all of them with the default 3 stars.&nbsp;</span>
</span><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">auto ratings "controlled by non-Microsoft data providers" unless they are inside the fix!!?</span></p>
<p><span>I have figured out that if I go into the details view in properties and set my ratings the dialogue with WMP is made to fully work. I can change the ratings in WMP and it will follow suit in the explorer. To have it in explorer is important
 if you like to backup your files - in the library you call it "keep the ratings for globally use" but this is not working globally.</span></p>
<p><span>Appreciate more help on this.</span></p>

<p><span>Hi kbus,&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>What
 is the type of printer? Is it wired or wireless?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Are
 the printer preferences options grayed out?</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>What
 is the make and model number of the printer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 2</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>This may happen due to corrupt drivers on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s check if you are able to access the printer preference manually.</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Open&nbsp;<strong>Devices

</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right-click
 the printer that you want to use, and then click &nbsp;<strong>Printing preferences</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Make

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 3</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>Also check if the printer is compatible with Windows 7 using the Windows 7 compatibility center.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We appreciate your interest in Windows 10. The description suggests the issue could have occurred due to drivers issues. I suggest you to update the drivers for Smart TV as well as graphics card and check if that helps. Here is the steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Press <strong>Windows Key</strong> + <strong>R</strong> on your desktop screen to go to run command box.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Type <strong>devmgmt.msc</strong> and hit <strong>Ente</strong>r.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Look for the specified drivers, expand, right-click the device drivers listed, and then click
<strong>Update</strong>.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>I would also have you check with&nbsp;a different&nbsp;cable and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly share the results and write to us for further assistance and we'll be happy to help you.</p>

    <title>Continued repeating of &#43; sign or dashes automatically without - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> warren982  say:</h3>
<h2>            Continued repeating of &#43; sign  or dashes automatically without pressing the keyboard</h2>
                    <p>A little history: My two laptops, Acer and Asus, 5 1/2 and 7 years old, died several weeks ago. Since then, I've used a 15 year old Thinkpad with Windows 7, as had the past two laptops. I upgraded this Thinkpad to Windows 10 without difficulty, then bought
 a slightly newer Windows 7 Thinkpad (8 years old) and upgraded this to Windows 10 using an ISO, again without difficulty though attempting this with Windows online never did work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem: for the past week I've been getting, occasionally at any moment, the + sign repeating in a space where something should be put in. This happens only occasionally and can occur when entering a password or in the search file box and without my
 touching the keyboard, I had been using very old USB keyboards and a newer mini one. This seemed to occur more often with the older keyboards, which I didn't like, and threw out. Then I learned at this site that this can be a USB keyboard issue. I ran the
 Fix Device on Windows 10 and it said it solved the problem and this seemed so until it occurred again a few minutes ago. I ran the complete Windows Defender check twice, it taking many hours, before using this laptop and yesterday and it found nothing. I ran
 the Lenovo Mechanical check for all systems and again nothing wrong was found. As a writer, this occurrence makes me particularly nervous. I had a sense that it might have something to do with the latest Firefox edition but I found it occurred when copy/pasting
 a newspaper link on my Facebook page using the Opera browser too. One more point: this never happened with Windows 7 and I'm now using a new WiFi keyboard that I bought yesterday. Also I got an odd message on my computer, when using the USB keyboard, stating
 that there was a problem with the 4 key. Never received this before. It just happened a minute ago with dashes causing a saved document to disappear with continuing dashes suddenly occurring in place of the letters. I was about to power down the laptop when

</p><p>To better assist you, do let us know if you tried connecting a different keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, I suggest you to try the methods below and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Hardware and devices troubleshooter</strong></p>
<p>This troubleshooter checks for common issues and makes sure that any new device or hardware attached to your computer was installed correctly.
</p>
<p>1. Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong>.</p>

<p>4. Click "<strong>view all</strong>" on the left pane.</p>
<p>5. Run the <strong>hardware and devices </strong>troubleshooter and follow the on-screen instructions.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Uninstall Keyboard driver</strong></p>
<p>In order to identify if this is a driver related issue, I suggest you to uninstall the keyboard driver and restart the computer and have Windows automatically install the driver upon restart.
</p>
<p>1. Press <strong>Windows key + X </strong>and select <strong>device manager</strong>.</p>
<p>2. Locate the<strong> keyboard driver </strong>and <strong>uninstall </strong>
it.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Restart </strong>the computer and check the functionality.</p>

            <p>Many thanks for your very quick response. I've tried and a Visual something error was found in addition to a USB malfunction. Not sure which USB this was but I changed the WiFi keyboard USB to another on the laptop. I also have another USB hub hooked up
 to the powered USB on the Thinkpad and an AC powered USB hub holding about 8 things. I couldn't keep disabled all the non-MS startups since they involved a VPN and an online backup. We'll see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've used two very old USB keyboards (Logitechm HP) recently and threw them out. I have another old USB mini-keyboard that I used for a while but didn't like because the keys tended to operate too quickly. This new WiFi keyboard I like.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again.</p>

            It just happened again, continuing + signs when I pressed the Windows button to get to the Files. When I pressed it again it didn't occur, or when I posted things on my Facebook &amp; Twitter pages just before.<br />

            It's still happening now on this page automatically without touching the keyboard I had thought it might be related to an external back-up drive for I had gotten the message from Windows that the trash bin for it was corrupted and did I want to delete
 it and I indicated yes. So I removed this external drive (before that when I pressed the File button all went haywire with it), restarted the laptop, and all was normal until I entered this page and the dashes and + signs began. Puzzling. Time for Ghostbusters?

            I just plugged in the external hard drive again and the + +sign +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++automatically began entering into the Firefox search box without my touching the keyboard. So it m++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ay
 be related to this hard drive after all (a new 3TB Western Digital with great Costco reviews).

            I did all the suggested including reinstalling Windows and it began repeating again so I'm back to using my 15 year old Thinkpad. I've been Googling and think that it isn't a Windows problem but a keyboard issue and tried a suggested fix: hitting the +
 sign repeatedly and removing the battery for awhile. I just had the thought that setting the laptop up so it only relates to the wifi keyboard might help. If these don't work, I'll get a new laptop, which I probably should have done in the first place.

    <title>Suggestion&#58; DBZ Kinect Game - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mld woody  say:</h3>
<h2>            Suggestion&#58; DBZ Kinect Game</h2>
                    
<p>Now, who else thinks this would be ****? I grew up on DBZ and would love to see this game made (made well). I was playing Kinect for the first time with some buddies and we played the boxing game on Kinect Sports. As soon as we discovered that if you squat
 down and put your hands in the air it looks like you're "powering up", it was on from there. Just **** aorund doing DBZ stuff. (This was after getting rug burns doing legit slides in soccer and my buddy repeatedly trying to hit an actual bicycle kick by
 doing one in front of the TV).</p>
<p>Anyway. Dragon Ball Kinect. Get on it.</p>
<p>I wanna be throwing down Special Beam Cannons!</p>

<p>It would probably end up turning out to be "Slow Motion DBZ" because I don't really see how they could simulate the fast action of DBZ with your actual movements. &nbsp;But anyway, I grew up on DBZ, too. &nbsp;It's still one of the only real anime shows that I've
 ever watched. &nbsp;My only beef with the show is that, after Cell, I never really felt like the Saiyan was a powerful beast. &nbsp;It was the same cycle over and over again.... &nbsp;How can a Super Saiyan 4 seem so weak?</p>

<p>Okay, I guess to understand my perspective, you have to understand the timeline. &nbsp;When I was an early-mid teen, I watched all the episodes (except Dragonball) up until the end of the Cell Saga. &nbsp;Just this past year (I'm 23 years old), I bought Seasons 7-9
 and GT 1-2. &nbsp;I literally watched episode after episode JUST to finish the series. &nbsp;It was miserable. &nbsp;So yeah, you're right... I don't ever remembering it dragging on so bad when I was younger. &nbsp;The Great Sayaiman(?) was the worst Saga by far.</p>
<p>So that's why it seems that I clump the later seasons with GT. &nbsp;Because I watched it all at the same time. &nbsp;I honestly just wanted to finish the anime that I loved so much as a teen.</p>

<p>The Gameboy games were fun.</p>
<p>I mean, it wouldn't be crazy fast too. You aren't gonna just be going nuts in front of the camera. But you should be able to do the main attacks, and I think it could differentiate between an open hand palm and a fist (energy blast v . punch).</p>
<p>I nvr watched all of GT, but its not as good. DBZ *** is awesome though.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t add attachments to E-mail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> taylordebolt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t add attachments to E-mail</h2>
                    <p>I just recently upgraded to windows 8.1 it worked fine had no problems with it until today. I was trying to send myself an email with a photo attachment and an error message came up saying: You don't have permission to open this file. Contact the file owner
 or an administrator to obtain permission. So, I tried another email account and that didn't work, finally I tried a different browser and that didn't work. I can access all the files I want and manipulate these files, but it just won't let me add these files
 as attachments. </p>
<p>I began to get irritated by this and decided to google for an answer. I found sites claiming that I needed to add permission to my&nbsp;account to access these files, so I went through and made sure I had permission, even though I am the administrator, everything
 was set correctly and I had full control of these files. Still no solution. I believe something with the new windows 8.1 update may have caused the problem, but I'm just at a loss for ideas at this point.</p>
<p>Any advice?&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>P.S. I just found out the only file I can add as an attachment is a text file from notepad. No other type of file works MS Word, any photo file type, any video file type, none work. Don't know if this will help anyone.</p>

            <p>Hi Taylor,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Is the notepad file saved in the same location as other files? Did you create this notepad file after updating to Windows 8.1?</i></p>
<p><i><br />
</i></p>
<p><i>Did you get the same error message when you tried to attach files using different email accounts and different browsers?</i></p>
<p><i><br />
</i></p>
<p><i>What steps did you follow to add permission to the files?</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue could be caused due to some incorrect settings or due to some corrupt user account files. I would suggest you to try these steps and check:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Open File explorer and right click on the drive where files are saved.</p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click properties.</p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>In the Security tab, click on advanced button.</p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Check the user name against owner.</p>
<p><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>If it is not the username of your account, click change.</p>
<p><span><span>f)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Type your username and select check names.</p>
<p><span><span>g)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click OK and apply changes.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Now, check if you are able to attach the files. Try these steps and let us know the results for further assistance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The notepad file was one created and saved before the update to the same location as other files.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I got the error message on both IE and Firefox.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I got the error message on both my Gmail and yahoo account.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I went under the permissions of my files and made sure they were all set to full control and that I was the owner/creator of the files.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I also have a external hard drive that all the files were backed up to. Thinking the files may be corrupt I went under the external hard drive and renamed them, then put them on to my computer to see if I could attach these files, but that didn't work.&nbsp;(The
 files on my external hard drive were backed up before the update)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>2 things that may help:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have some of the same&nbsp;files saved to my SkyDrive and they will attach to an email.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Also when I go under permissions to files I have this occurrence. The icon for a single user comes up with a red question mark. It's name is S-1-5-21-xxxxxxxxx-yyyyyyyyyy-zzzzzzzzzz-1004. But after a few seconds the name changes to:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Home Users (ComputerName\HomeUsers)
 and the red question mark goes away.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So I guess one question is coming to my mind can I just delete Home Users because I would still have my account and the admin account? If not then is there someway to repair this?</p>

            <p>I'm having a similar problem.&nbsp; Since I upgraded to 8.1, some of my files cannot be uploaded from the Skydrive to email or course management software.&nbsp; I've never had this problem before, but I get messages like, "You are not the administrator of this file,"
 even for files I had just created and saved to the skydrive moments earlier.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Is there a fix for this problem?&nbsp; All I've been able to do so far is close the attachment box on outlook or blackboard, open the file as a Word document, save it to the desktop, and then upload it from there.&nbsp; But there must be a way to upload directly from
 the skydrive; I did it all the time before the 8.1 upgrade.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>The problem was resolved for me and the fix is kind of strange. The tech support guy did this:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click on the directory you want like document, pictures, video, etc. then you right&nbsp;click and select properties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next go under the security tab, click edit, and in the new window click add.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Type everyone in the bottom box and then click check names.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you do that close out that window and add full control to that group. This will allow you to access all the files in the directory.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Continue to do this for every directory including the skydrive directories. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then try to add attachments. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One other thing you may want to do is disable microsofts administrator account. For some reson when I installed 8.1 it made it so i could go under a different admin acount that microsoft had created.
</p>
<p>This is optional so only do it if you want to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want you could just call Microsoft for help, it took me about 40 minutes and the waiting was minimal.</p>

<p>To be honest mate, I think other than the previous Deus Ex games, not many others really offered this type of complete stealth. Perhaps look into the Splinter Cell series.

                    I am trying to install RSAT on windows 8 and I am getting the following error "update is not applicable to your computer". Is there a workaround for this or what could possibly be causing this? I am actually trying to install this on an&nbsp;ASUS VivoTab Smart

            I have found a solution to this issue. It was not the same error I was getting, but the fix WORKED.
<div><br />
<div><a href="http://www.wincert.net/tips/microsoft-windows/windows-8/3470-windows-update-standalone-installer-0x80004005-remote-server-installation-tools-for-windows-8-x64" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.wincert.net/tips/microsoft-windows/windows-8/3470-windows-update-standalone-installer-0x80004005-remote-server-installation-tools-for-windows-8-x64</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>Give it about 5-10 minutes and you should then see it in your start menu. If not by then, try waiting just 15 mins and then restart(to be safe it isn't still installing)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also using one of these commands:</div>
<div><br />
<div><span>runas /netonly /user:domain\userid "mmc dsa.msc /server=dc.in.other.domain"</span><br />
<br />
<span>runas /netonly /user:domain\userid "mmc dsa.msc /server=ipaddress"</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>will allow you to access AD on your domain if not already connected to your domain.(For use when outside of your network via VPN)</span></div>

<div>You and I have the exact same hardware, and your instructions work great also for the x86 version of RSAT (just substitute the .cab file name), and the runas tip was icing on the cake. &nbsp;Thanks, again.</div>

    <title>Windows 10 always in quiet mode&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 always in quiet mode&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So I've tried googling for an answer, but it just isn't there. The things I find only make me more confused as to why this is happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure wether it's called quiet time or quiet mode in English (my pc is in Dutch, but whenever I start my pc, it's standard in quiet mode. I have to turn it off manually whenever I start my pc. It doesn't matter wether I start it at 8am or 3pm, it's
 always on. Wich is extra confusing because I read they are supposed to be set from midnight to 6am, and that can't be changed.</p>
<p>My user times (or whatever it's called in English) are set from 12 to midnight.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So why is this, and how do I fix it?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Try:</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My windows is Windows 10 Home version 1607 Build 14393.1066, x64 bits</p>
<p>I don't know exactly when this started, but at least a couple weeks now.</p>
<p>There isn't much to try and fix this, because there's nothing to find on google. I've just turned it off every time, I don't know what to try (hence why I'm asking here)</p>
<p>Since I don't know when it started, I don't really know if there were any changes before it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is however an update that has 'problems' with installation. Trying again didn't work. It says "security update for Microsoft Silverlight&nbsp;(KB4017094) - Fault 0x80070643"</p>
<p>
</p><p>System File Check came back clean</p>

            I just remembered changing something about the restarting settings because of a Witcher 3 crash. I thought that wouldn't matter and just turning it off (at night) and on (in the morning) would have the same effect, but it clearly doesn't because when I
 just restarted my pc, a couple of other problems were fixed too and I got a popup from Windows to check my privacy settings for some update. My pc is not in quiet mode at the moment, and I hope that it won't be tomorrow either.

<h2>            Problem with microsoft.net Framework64 v2.0.50727 cscomp.dll</h2>
                    Original title:When I run Update from Control Panel it never does anything just sits there. Help, please
<br />
I searched for a question like mine but found nothing that solves my problem.&nbsp; So...<br />
<br />
I'm running Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit and just noticed that NONE of Windows update have been installed for almost 7 months.&nbsp; When I run Update from Control Panel it never does anything just sits there.&nbsp; Help, please
<br />
<br />
I'm running a Gateway LX6810-01 with an Intel Core 2 Quad Q8200 processor, 8GB of DDR2 RAM, and 1TB of HD space.<br />
It has an NVIDIA GeForce GT210 with 1GB of discrete memory.<br />
<br />
I've stopped all non-essential software from running leaving only NVIDIA, Windows Explorer, Power PanelPersonal Edition, Task Manager and Norton Security Suite running.<br />
<br />
When I run Update from Control Panel it never does anything just sits there.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold">
Help,</span> <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; text-decoration-line: underline">
please</span> <br />
<br />
I forgot to add that I get an error code indicating that there's a problem with microsoft.net Framework64 v2.0.50727 cscomp.dll.&nbsp; I've gone to Microsoft, downloaded and installed Framework64 but the problem persists.&nbsp; I've looked at the file "cscomp.dll" and
 noted that it a zero length file.&nbsp; So I don't know what that means or how to correct it.<br />
<br />
Thanks, CMG<br />

<h2>            XBOX IS &#42;&#42;&#42; ME&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>so every once in a while ill buy xbox live gold 1 month at a time, making sure to turn off my auto-renewal. i know i turned it off because i have no money on the card usually after so i make a habit of turning it off. this time for some reason i noticed
 i still had xbox live past the 1 month period so i just chalked it up to a mistake on microsofts end. only to find out a few days later that i was actually charged via auto-renewal... now i didnt have any money in my card but days later im all the sudden charged
 again but this time with a $34 insufficient funds fee...</p>
<p><br />
im being *** over here... something went wrong on there end and they turned my auto renewal back on without my consent and charged me for another month that i had no idea about until it was to late. now im stuck with having to pay more because of microsoft....
 this is complete BS. and now there security for there website is getting in the way of me getting complete access to my account because of emails that i no longer have access to being my backup emails...</p>
<p><br />
am i going to keep getting charged $34 until i pay it off? this is really aggravating and i feel like im getting robbed here by microsoft.</p>

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>it's best to contact Xbox Support regarding a billing issue like this, they will be able to check if autorenewal was indeed off and help in sorting the issue. To contact Xbox Support use <a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/contact-us</a></p>
<p>Also try to see if you can update any security settings via: <a href="https://account.live.com/proofs/Manage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">account.live.com/.../Manage</a></p>

<p>Hi Jayson8600,<br />
<br />
What's the exact model number on the ARRIS modem? And, have you attempted to turn off the wireless security to see if you can connect then (this is of course just a test, you can turn it back on later)&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jayson, the Arris TM802G is a Cable Modem only, it does not have any sort of wireless / routing capability. This means that you have a router in your household that's giving other wireless devices in your household internet access.<br />
<br />
Please reply with the Router's make and model number. <br />
<br />
Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Headset not working when 2nd Controller w. Headset is attached</h2>
                    
<p>Hello Community,</p>
<p>I have a problem, when I try to play with a friend and we both have a Headset attached to the new Controller.</p>
<p>We try to play Minecraft and we want to broadcast it on Twitch. Everything is fine, execpt we can only hear the audio from the Headset of the 2nd Controller attached. The first Headset seems to be muted. When I unplug the Headset of the 2nd Controller the
 audio from the 1st is broadcasted again.</p>
<p>Is it not possible to have two headsets attached?</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Tom</p>

            <p>Hello Proehlth.</p>
<p>Go to Settings&gt;All Settings&gt;Kinect &amp; Devices&gt;Devices &amp; Accessories and make sure that you assign each device (controller and headset) to the correct profile using them.</p>
<p>This should fix the issue of the console switching which headset it broadcasts. It may also allow you both to talk and the console broadcasts both, but it may not - I'm not 100% sure if this is supported when broadcasting from the console app.</p>
<p>However, give this is a try and let us know how you get on. I hope this helps.</p>

<p>Make sure you map each controller to a user. &nbsp;Go into settings then kinect/controllers. &nbsp;Select each controller and assign it to a user.</p>
<p>That hopefully should fix it.</p>

<p>Hi Maxen13 and Atroopspad,</p>
<p>each controller is now assigned to a different profile.</p>
<p>Unfortunately that didn't solve the problem.</p>
<p>Perhaps you're right Maxen13 and it's not supported.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help,</p>

<p>ok your xbox is not modded but has it ever been repaired by a 3rd party (any one other then microsoft) i'll take it it has i have the same code and have been w/o live on that xbox since 5/19. I have researched it to death since then the reason that you got
 that code is because the xbox has been modded even if you didnt mean it to be. The person that fixed your xbox didnt have the same dvd drive they took to put back in so they used a diffrent 1. Say your xbox came with a BenQ dvd drive inside it the person went
 to fix it &nbsp;but all they had was a Lite On dvd drive its still a xbox drive it came out of a diffrent xbox but its not made to go into yours . So to get past this what they did was put a "spoof" on it (this is a flash to the firmware of the dvd drive to trick
 the xbox into thinking that its the original drive). This will allow the dvd drive to work just fine it will play games with no problem and up till now xbox live never realy checked for this but this new update dose. When it goes to update it must first flash
 your drive. Ok it's like live is talking to the xbox and says "hey what drive do have" and the xbox would reply "a BenQ"(but remeber it dosent have a ben q anymore its a lite on) so live says ok well ill send out the update made for a benq but wait thats not
 a ben q it's a Lite On so it calls shanagins and gives you that code telling you that the xbox has been changed/tampered with/ Altered IE Modded im very sorry but the update will never take while your xbox is in this state maybe if you could put the original
 drive or 1 of the same type in it it might work but i am not sure of it sorry</p>

    <title>Delayed online scrolling - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> luke e.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Delayed online scrolling</h2>
                    <p>To whom it may concern:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have an HP EliteBook with Windows 10.&nbsp; Recently, it has developed an issue with online scrolling.&nbsp; I can load up an online page just fine, but once I begin to scroll up and down the page, it lags.&nbsp; In other words, I click the down-arrow on the scroll
 bar, and nothing happens.&nbsp; For about five seconds (or longer), my pointer will cease to function and the down-arrow will remain highlighted.&nbsp; Then, all of a sudden, the page will jump down to the position which I had wanted.&nbsp; Unfortunately, while I am waiting
 for the page to catch-up and move into its position, I cannot click or perform any other tasks with the mouse or keyboard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This issue occurs all the time online, no matter the browser, regardless of whether I am using the mouse wheel, scroll bars, trackpad, keyboard, or the touch screen.&nbsp; Interestingly, I can scroll just fine on all other programs (Word, Excel, etc.), including
 those which connect to the internet for updates or licenses (Outlook, PTC Creo, etc.).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I took the computer down to the local tech center (twice), and each time they tried to fix it, my scrolling problem would stop, and all would be well - for about ten minutes.&nbsp; Then the issue would return.&nbsp; I'm not exactly sure what they tried, but I'm
 pretty sure they were uninstalling/reinstalling the mouse driver.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any help on this problem would be greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>Hi Luke E.,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There might be something running on the background that's causing this. Just a few things that I would like to clarify though:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you experiencing this to browsers only or is it any browsers and applications that requires internet connection?</li><li>Have you tested if the issue is happening on other user profiles?</li><li>Is it happening to specific browsers or is it happening to any browsers?</li><li>What is the current build and version of your Windows 10?
<ul>
<li>You'd be able to have this checked by pressing the <strong>Windows button + R</strong> on your keyboard to open the
<strong>Run</strong> box and type <em><strong>winver</strong></em> and press <strong>
Enter</strong>.</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>As an initial troubleshooting, I suggest that you run the <strong><a href="http://aka.ms/diag_networking10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">troubleshooter for with connecting to the Internet or to websites</a></strong> to automatically find and fix any
 possible hidden issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please don't hesitate to get back in touch with me for further assistance.</p>

<p>2.&nbsp; My computer has no other user profiles.</p>

<p>Thank you for the clarification Luke E. It seems that your Windows needs updating as the version that is runs is already outdated. Prior to performing an update, I would suggest that you
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10/how-to-manually-backup-and-restore-your-files/45859954-c9c3-403f-b997-e96c8e001963">back up your files</a></strong> first. Once you've already successfully backed up your files, you
 can proceed with <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4028685/windows-10-get-the-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">updating your Windows 10</a></strong>. Best to use the the

 your Windows updated, please have it checked if you're still encountering the delayed scrolling.</p>

<p>My new console started making this unbearable noise in the last couple days. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shZ46SJUB5U" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.youtube.com/watch</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/shZ46SJUB5U?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/shZ46SJUB5U?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div></p>
<p>Is that the same squeaking you're hearing? I'm not hopeful this is something that has a solution or will actually get fixed even if I do send it in, to be honest. Not to mention the idea of already being on refurbs after owning a console for less than a
 month is fairly obnoxious.</p>

            <p>Hey everyone!<br /><br />Sorry to hear about the console noise issues. If you are continuing to experience noise issues, I recommend trying a few troubleshooting steps to see if it will sort the issue:<br /><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>Press and hold the power button on your Xbox One console for 10 seconds.</li>
<li>Once your console is powered off, unplug the power cord.</li>
<li>Wait 5 minutes and then power on your console.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />If the issue continues your console may need to be repaired. You can request a repair from our&nbsp;<a href="https://myservice.xbox.com/Pages/Welcome.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Online Service center</a>&nbsp;or through phone support from our&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contact Us</a>&nbsp;page. In the future, please create a new thread. &nbsp;This way you can receive support specifically tailored to you. &nbsp;Be sure to include the details of the issue as well as any troubleshooting steps that you have tried. &nbsp;Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Glad to hear that you have found out what is causing the issue. A service with gibberish name and with an unknown manufacturer seems suspicious. Please perform a security scan with your preferred antivirus and antimalware software and see if they can detect
 any threats.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also look that suspicious service in <strong>Services</strong>. Please type
<strong>services </strong>in <strong>Cortana </strong>then press <strong>enter</strong>. If you are able to see that service on the list, you can double click on it then check the
<strong>Path to executable</strong>. That will give you an idea on where that service is located.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update us on the result.</p>

<p>Hi Nachappa, Kevin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you ever find a resolution to the problem? &nbsp;I'm guessing that if you sign into MS Jigsaw with an MS Account then you progress in a game will be saved so there is no need to back up the game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I think I am suffering along with a lot of other users, where the Jigsaw game will not connect and therefore prevents any progress being saved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you advise what we should do if we cannot login to the game?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
