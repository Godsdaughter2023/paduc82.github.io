</p><p>In order to retrieve data stored in the Guest account of the previous version of Windows the fall back position, if you are unable to retrieve&nbsp;the data&nbsp;by&nbsp;any other means, is that you have a thirty day grace period during which you can roll the installation
 back to the previous version of Windows, having taken care to back up all your data, first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I activated the in-built Guest account August 01, 2015, by&nbsp; following the <a href="http://www.howto-connect.com/windows-10-tips-enable-administrator-guest-account/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</em>from an elevated command prompt (right-click Start/Windows button and select Command Prompt (Admin)).&nbsp; Guest then appeared in the list of available accounts on the lock screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have, in the past couple of days, activated the Guest account on two more Win 10 PCs.&nbsp; The command line echoed that this had succeeded, and Guest appears, as one of the alternatives,&nbsp;when I click on my account name at the top of the Start Menu, but when
 I select it, instead of switching to the Guest account which is not password protected, it takes me to the lock screen, where Guest is no longer shown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Microsoft appear to be suppressing the Guest account, for reasons that I/we do not know.&nbsp; We should be told.</p>

            <p>Hello!</p>
<p><br />
The concensus of opinion in this forum is that it is impossible to recreate in Win 10 the Guest account of previous versions of Windows.</p>
<p><br />
The workaround is to create a local user account (you may have to Google (or Bing) how to do that), which, by definition, is not a Microsoft Account, and doesn't require an e-mail adddress, or other identity details.&nbsp; You may also have to Google/Bing how to
 retrieve any docments in your previous version of Windows Guest account, which disappeared when you upgraded to Win 10.</p>
<p><br />
Name this new local user account Visitor, and create it as a Standard user, not Administrator, and you will have as close as you are going to get to the old Guest account.</p>
<p><br />
Thank you.</p>

            <p>I think FTP access not included in EDGE. You can use "Open with Internet Explorer", and hit 'Alt' key to access the task window - select View and choose Open FTP site with File Explorer. Or you can use command prompt and open ftp site using command : ftp
 &lt;url&gt; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel better to use a ftp client instead for a better access. </p>

    <title>New hardware windows 10 upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> krazyone_  say:</h3>
<h2>            New hardware windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>So i purchased a computer from ibuypower in 2012 and no longer have the windows CD key that came with it. A few years later windows 10 comes out with a free upgrade and i grab the upgrade and am happy with it. Now a few days ago i purchased new hardware
 for my pc (processor, motherboard and ram) and now it wants me to activate. </p>
<p>
</p><p>To me I think "ok no problem maybe a few minutes?" nope! I call windows support and they inform me that I MUST have a CD/product key in order to activate windows 10 despite it already being activated. I inform them I no longer have the key. They then told
 me to go through the place i purchased the computer and ask for a key from them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ibuypower informs me that no they do not keep copies of said keys and they are sorry but they cannot help. So basically microsoft is forcing me to buy another copy of windows because they cannot simply keep the key i had on my pc? Is there another way around
 this that I am not seeing? I repeatedly asked windows support if there was another way and they said "this is the only way to do this".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I post I wanted to note that yes I have tried activating windows and creating a new account and everything else that microsoft suggests to do BEFORE I contacted support.</p>

            No it did not find it. It said the device does not have one or something. I guess i could re-install my old hardware and get it that way? Or is that even an option at this point?

            Except that is not the case or true at all. If I had saved the product key support said that is all that I would need and they would give me a new key to use after that. This is a hole in your argument that it is ONLY good for the device as windows is
 made to transition from device to device (it have re-installed in the past and never had any issues)

            Activation depends on what type of license you have of Windows 7/8/10. <br /><br />If Windows 7/8/10 came preinstalled with the computer, that is called an OEM license. For an OEM license, the license dies as soon as Motherboard dies. So essentially it is non-transferable. If that is the case you need to get a new license. <br /><br />However, this is not same for retail licenses i.e. you purchased the license through Microsoft store. That does carry transfer rights. If that is the case, please see the below steps: <br />(Not applicable to you) <br />What you need to do is to grab the key using any Software like Showkey Plus, uninstall that key from older PC and use it on another computer. <br /><br />Download Showkey Plus: <br />www.thewindowsclub.com/showkeyplus-product-key-finder<br /><br />Uninstall the key<br /><a href="https://winaero.com/blog/how-to-deactivate-windows-10-and-change-the-product-key/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://winaero.com/blog/how-to-deactivate-wind...

<p>
</p><p>You're kinda right and kinda wrong there - it depends on the licence type.&nbsp; If it was an OEM licence (which is commonly supplied with PCs bought as you did) then these cannot be transferred - the licence lives and dies with the motherboard of the machine.&nbsp;
 If you had a retail licence from back in the day then these can be transferred but you would need some sort of proof of this (like a COA or licence key?).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fundamentally Windows is <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">sometimes </span>
made to transition from device to device but all dependent on licence type.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you've done it in the past I can only think you either had retail licencing, or you used a OEM licence which in the older days you could move between machines (although you actually weren't supposed to but if often worked).</p>

<p>Then microsoft support lied to me in telling me that when i get the key then they would help me? They knew without any hint of doubt that it was from an older computer and that it was purchased through another company. They instructed me (as seen above)
 that i need to contact the company and get the key from them in order for MS to help me further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And i would have to assume you are correct because I do not have much knowledge on the new Windows 10 OS but I have a lot on 7/XP/Vista/ME and it is just odd they would change the entire way the system works with Windows 10.</p>

<h2>            WD MyPassport 071A</h2>
                    So it seems that there is an issue between certain WD external drives and Windows 10. My WD MyPassport does not properly install drivers when I plug it into my USB 2.0 port. Tried USB 3.0 port but that didn't work. Drive is powered up and running, and
 even shows up in the Device Manager, but no amount of rebooting, checking to see if the drive is corrupted, or installing drive utilities can fix it. Tried installing DriverUtility from WD website but even that doesn't recognize it. If anyone knows where there
 is a link that I can directly download the WD MyPassport 071A Win10 drive from, I will be forever greatful.&nbsp;

    <title>Can I uninstall a Windows 7 upgrade&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joaoairoux  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I uninstall a Windows 7 upgrade&#63;</h2>
                    Ok so here's the scenario:<br />
<br />
I was on a computer that already had Windows 7 Home Premium installed as the OS, this was my 64-bit Dell laptop. Since I am part of the Computer Science department at my school, the network gave me access to a collection of software that included Windows 7
 Professional for free to all those who have access.&nbsp; I was interested in being able to run XP Mode, and so I downloaded the OS on a disc and installed it the long way instead of using the Anytime Upgrade since it didn't allow me to use the serial code which
 I was given for Anytime Upgrade.<br />
<br />
The upgrade worked fine and my computer is now operating on Windows 7 Professional, but everything is gone. I don't mean programs because I had already backed up all my programs and files so those are all safe, everything else is gone. The anti-virus software
 package that came with the computer is not there (McAfee), it won't connect to any networks, and it has none of the default programs that came with the computer.<br />
<br />
I am really worried right now.&nbsp; All I want is to remove the upgrade and go back to my old OS as I had bought it. Is there any way to do this?
<br />
I appreciate any and all feedback.

            <p>Its possible you might have deleted your recovery partition which would be used to reinstall Windows 7. If you have, you will need to contact Dell for a back disc:</p>

<em>Recovery Discs</em> with <em>Dell</em> DataSafe</a>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are several <strong>system recovery options for Dell computers</strong> and not all of them require such drastic measures as reformatting the hard drive and starting over. Newer Dell computers, such as the Dell Inspiron 580, will have the DataSafe
 Local Backup Option in addition to the the tradition method of restoring from an image located in a system recovery disk. Use the following methods to create recovery media and restore it in the event your Dell PC no longer boots.</p>
Create Dell System Recovery Media
<p>You can create recovery media using the DataSafe Local Backup utility. You can use either DVDs or a USB stick with 8GB or more of space. The system recovery media can be used to restore your Dell to the condition it was on a previous date without having
 to worry about the loss of data. To create the System Recovery media, turn on the computer and let it boot up. Insert the blank DVD (cannot be a re-writable disk) or USB stick and then go to Start&gt;Programs&gt;Dell DataSafe Local Backup and then click the
<em>Create Recovery Media</em> option.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pctechbytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/datasafe.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.pctechbytes.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2010%2f11%2fdatasafe.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the creation of the media. Once done, store the media in a safe place for future use.</p>
Dell System Recovery
<p>You have several options to get your Dell back up and running again. Try the following in order, as they are organized as easiest to hardest:</p>
<p><strong>System Restore</strong> – A system restore is a feature built into Windows that allows you to go back to a previous state in the event a system file or hardware driver has been damaged. To perform a System Restore, go to Start&gt;Programs&gt;Accessories&gt;System
 Tools&gt;System Restore.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pctechbytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/sysrestore.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.pctechbytes.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2010%2f11%2fsysrestore.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Click through the restore options and go back to a date when you know the computer was working properly. Your personal data should be safe using this method.</p>
<p><strong>Dell DataSafe Local Backup</strong> – You can use this method if the System Restore does not work properly. You will need the USB key or DVD you created from the instructions above. Restart the computer. When you see the Dell logo, tap the F8 key
 until you access the <strong>Advanced Boot Options</strong>. Select <strong>Repair Your Computer</strong> from the list. Next, select
<strong>Dell DataSafe Restore and Emergency Backup</strong> from the System recovery Options and follow the onscreen instructions to complete the recovery process.</p>
<p><strong>System Recovery Media</strong> – Use this method to perform a System Recovery in the event you cannot boot into Windows or if you have replaced your hard drive. To use the System Recovery Media you created above, put the USB stick or DVD into the
 computer and restart the machine. As the machine begins to boot, tap the F12. Select the boot device (either the USB or DVD) and then follow the instructions to perform recovery using the media you created.</p>
<p><strong>Dell Factory Image Restore</strong> – This final method will destroy any data or programs you have added since you bought the computer. If you are still able to backup, backup any important photos, documents or other data before attempting this process.
 When ready, reboot and tap F8 until you see the Advanced Boot Options.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pctechbytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/dellrecovery.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.pctechbytes.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2010%2f11%2fdellrecovery.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Select <em>Repair Your Computer</em>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pctechbytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/factoryrestore.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.pctechbytes.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2010%2f11%2ffactoryrestore.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Select <strong>Dell Factory Image Restore</strong>. The image resides on a separate partition of your Dell’s hard drive. When the factory image restore has completed, your Dell will be the same as it was when you brought it home.</p>
<p>As you can see there are several different recovery options for your Dell; some are easy, some are drastic. Choose the one that is best for you. Be sure to create the recovery media as soon as you can and always perform routine backups of your important

<h2>            Unable to install kb2677070 prerequisite for kb3046310</h2>
                    <p>Have a Win7x64 SP1 Dell Studio desktop; ran Windows Update to install the live.fi CRL update released on 16 March. It was not showing up under either important or optional updates. Went to<br />
<br />
https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/3046310<br />
<br />
which recommends installing via the automatic updater of revoked certificates, WU, or manually.<br />
<br />
When I click on the link https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3046310 to manually download the update, it lists as prerequisites 2677070 and 2813430. Checking Installed updates, I already have 2813430, but not 2677070. Clicking on the link to 2677070<br />
<br />
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2677070<br />
<br />
I then click on the download link for all supported x64-based versions of Windows 7:<br />
<br />
http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=e0092d19-d2b7-4714-96fe-53d68cfdae5a<br />
<br />
I save it to the desktop; when I try to run it I get an error message that it is not appropriate for my system. When I click on the download link and select Open rather than Save, I get the same error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggestions would be greatly appreciated (&lt;g&gt;),</p>

            <p>Okay, you asked for suggestions, so this is your fault :P</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my Windows 7 box the prerequisites both existed. &nbsp;I asked&nbsp;`WMIC QFE LIST FULL on a command line looking for&nbsp;HotFixID=KB<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2677070 and&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;HotFixID=KB<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2813430
 with FIND, example:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>`WMIC QFE LIST FULL|FIND "HotFixID=KB<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2677070"</span><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Result:&nbsp;</span>HotFixID=KB2677070, in other words, the "WMI Quick Fix Engineering" thinks I have it. Whatever that means, obviously I don't trust what "update history" or "remove progams" try to tell
 me. YMMV. &nbsp;So that's the first suggestion, check that you really don't have it already, a manual update of something that's already there would be entitled to produce incomprehensible error messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second suggestion, read the article again. &nbsp;All it talks about are those two prerequisites. &nbsp;It does not mention the real thing, a manual update for KB3046310. &nbsp;The Windows Update Catalog also does not know it. &nbsp;Bing does not know it. &nbsp;Google does not know
 it. &nbsp;A manually started Windows Update finds no available updates (ignoring the almost always available optional MSE update.) &nbsp;And the WMIC command line (see above) confirms that I do&nbsp;<strong>not</strong> have KB3046310. &nbsp;While sfc /scannow says that everything
 is fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Third suggestion, fun stuff for this unscheduled frustration:</p>
<p>
</p><p>wmic qfe list full|find /C "HotFixID=KB"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Result on my box: 407 installed "quick fixes" since SP1, not counting four blocked updates with IE11, and a special IE10 block. &nbsp;When I ask disk cleanup, what it would do, if I let it, it would free 7.6
<strong>GigaBytes</strong> of cruft (old fixes superseded by new fixes, and only needed if I ever uninstall a fix with "remove programs" instead of dirty "system restore" hacks corresponding to three of the four blocked updates.)<br />

</p><p>Many thanks for your prompt reply! I wasn't aware of the wmic qfe command; I had been using Control Panel &gt; Programs and Features &gt;View Installed Updates (which, according to tickets on this forum, should be reliable).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the command and wmic concurs -- 2813430 is installed, 2677070 and 3046310 are not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess it is one of those patches that MS discovered to be problematic and pulled (it pays to wait at least a couple of days (&lt;g&gt;)). The guy who alerted them to the issue did so 4 years ago (good thing they didn't rush the patch).</p>

 Windows 7 box, and checked the effect in certmgr: &nbsp;In fact live.fi and some other certificates are now listed as untrusted. &nbsp;Sadly the new CNNIC ROOT problem isn't covered (as of today), but the older KB 3046310 issue was about live.fi, and that's fixed.</p>

<h2>            f1 to f12 keys not working</h2>
                    I just got a new computer a few days ago. It's an Asus with Windows 10, and the f# keys aren't working. For example: The brightness keys just highlight the website address and the volume keys open up the coding for websites. I don't know why they aren't
 working properly, and I'm not sure how to fix it. Is there something in settings I can do to change it? Maybe the keys are just mixed up due to the settings not being set properly.

<h2>            Windows Update doesnt work. Error code 80246008.</h2>
                    Hello everyone,<br />
<br />
My PC was infected with a virus and I fought with it for 7 hours. I finally managed to find it and get rid of it (I think so).<br />
But unfortunately the virus did some damage; it turned my internet off, my sound off and Security center off, aswell as all other Services.<br />
I managed to restore most of them and I ran through a FSS scan and it found some services not properly running yet.<br />
<br />
BITS service isnt running, and as far as I know, it allows WIndows Updates to start working.<br />
WIndows Defender isnt running, and when I try to start it, I get an error 0x80070426
<b>(I have Norton AV and many people say it disables WD by default (?) )</b><br />
When I try to start WD in the Service Tab I get error 577.<br />
Also, cryptsvc isnt running.<br />
<br />
Windows Update gets an error after I start it, the code is 80246008<br />
<br />
If I try to start BITS, it gives me an error 1079 and this is where I'm stuck.<br />
BITS depends on COM+ Event System and Remote Procedure Call (RPC). Both of them are running fine and with no problems.<br />
<br />
<br />
Malwarebytes has just finished with the scan and it has detected 3 new threats that have been solved.<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S I managed to turn internet back on, and sound, and many other processes and services.<br />
But my connection says: Ethernet - Limited and it has an exclamation mark on the "tool tray"<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c793e1dc-df23-454c-accc-b2312a1cbb76" /><br />
<br />
<b>I put this thread into Windows Update because I think it's the main problem. Iif you think I should put this thread somewhere else, please notify me.</b><br />
<br />
<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Unfortunately Windows Startup Repair says it is unable to fix the problem. I don't know why.<br />
<br />
What instalation media are you referring to?<br />
I have my W8 64 bit instalation CD, but when I put it i.e for a PC Refresh option, it says it's not valid.<br />
I have original Windows 8.<br />
<br />
And the F12 key....when should I press it? I keep pressing it but nothing happens.<br />
I have Boot Options on key F7.<br />

How have you determined that the computer is no longer infected?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you upgrade a (e.g., Win7) computer to Win8 or...?</p>

            To be honest, I am not 100% sure that it was a virus and I dont know is it still infected. Perhaps it's just a software issue after a long battle with an infection (?)<br />
<br />
But, I can't understand how did the virus go through antivirus, windows defender and firewall just like that.<br />
<br />
How it all started? I rebooted my PC, got to desktop and noticed I dont have any sound, internet, services, and many other things disabled. My antivirus was off, aswell with Security Center and everything else.<br />
After running scans they found Trojan and some worms. I was confused and I concluded my PC
<b>was (or is) infected.</b><br />
After running more scans again, for hours, they found nothing anymore. <br />

            Win8 was preinstalled on my PC.<br />
I upgraded to 8.1 approximately at the beggining of December.<br />
I have 1 year free membership of Norton AV (which was preinstalled and working atm).<br />
There were no free-trials of any AV programs.<br />

If MBAM detected &amp; removed "3 new threats," either the computer's still infected or you're seeing the effects of infection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Answer-by-number in your reply (without quoting my post):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. If your "antivirus was off,"&nbsp;was it MBAM or another&nbsp;application&nbsp;that "found Trojan and some worms?"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. When (approx. date) did you purchase the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. When (approx. date) did you install Win8.1?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. When (exact date, preferably) does your current Norton AntiVirus (NAV) subscription expire?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. What NAV version is currently installed (e.g., NAV v21.x; NAV 2013)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Have you contacted Norton Support or posted in Norton community forums about these infections &amp; their aftermath?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. Have you run the automated <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9830262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>No profiles found on my Xbox. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sixhty9  say:</h3>
<h2>            No profiles found on my Xbox.</h2>
                    So last night, 07/28/12 I was gonna watch Netflix which is on my "quick play" on the dashboard but I accedentaly clicked on GTA San Andreas. Knowing that game doesn't work when I start it up I turned off my Xbox, now the Xbox was taking awhile to turn
 off so I unplugged the power cord from the back. Then when I turned it back on my Xbox was frozen at the white screen that says "Xbox 360". After about 5-10 minutes it finally loaded to create a profile or download a profile? I tried downloading my profile
 but I get "Xbox live accounts cannot be downloaded at this time" and some error code. So then I tried creating an account and after I enter a username it loads but just sends me back to choosing a name? Any help is appreciated ~

<p>If you can't download then I think there may be a connection issue.</p>
<p>I'd start by clearing the system cache (it's just updates plus other temporary files, nothing that's at all important to anyone) by:</p>
<p>1) Tap the silver Xbox Guide button on the controller, go right 2 clicks to Settings, pick System Settings.</p>
<p>2) Select Storage (or Memory).</p>
<p>3) Move over any hard drive or memory unit (not the Cloud) &amp; press (Y) on your controller &amp; pick Clear System Cache.</p>
<p>4) When asked to confirm storage device maintenance, choose Yes.</p>
<p>Some NAT problems are subtle and don't appear in the Test Xbox Live Connection test. Most likely there's a port blocked... ports can be blocked in your router, modem, or at your ISP. Since the Xbox 360 uses different ports than PCs &amp; Macs use, you can't
 see the effect of a port blockage except on the Xbox. A sequential power cycle is the first step in clearing a port blockage:</p>
<p>1) turn off the Xbox then</p>
<p>2) unplug power from the router (Some folks have a combination modem-router AKA 'gateway'. If so, skip step 3).</p>
<p>3) unplug the power from the modem.</p>
<p>4) Wait at least 30 secs then replug the modem (or gateway) power.</p>
<p>5) Wait 'til the light on the front of the modem (or gateway) which says ONLINE, READY, CABLE or DSL is on solid (not flashing), then plug in the router. If you have a gateway instead of a modem and router, then when that light says it's ready, skip step
 6.</p>
<p>6) Wait until the WiFi light on the router is on; you may not use WiFi, but it's still a good indicator your router is finished booting up.</p>

<p>Suggest you find a USB flash drive, put it on a USB port on the Xbox, prepare it for use and redownload profiles to the Memory Unit so created by preparing the flash drive. If that works OK, your hard drive may need a reformat.</p>

            Hello, I understand your problem. Unfortunately, Word mobile does not have all the options and settings which are available on the PC. If you would like to change the size of the first letter on your document, you may do so by selecting it (selecting the letter or the word you would like to enlarge), and find the size on the top bar of the keyboard. If it doesn't appear, select "Home" and scroll through to find the size setting. 
<br />Hope this helps!

<p>
</p><p>Right clicked on update driver &amp; received&nbsp; message that I have the latest driver for this device installed.&nbsp; Restarted and still have same problem.&nbsp; But not with iphone.&nbsp; When I connect the ipad to pc, I hear the the "sound" that I normally hear when I hook
 up an external device.&nbsp; I also went to view on file explorer and selected show hidden files.&nbsp; No result.&nbsp; This is a new computer but I don't see how that has affected this since it does recognize the device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I originally hooked up the ipad to pc, aftet about 15 minutes the icon all of sudden showed up on file explorer but I could never get it to do that again.</p>

            <p>Thank you Sangeeta for prompt reply<br />
<br />
1. Yes</p>
<p>2. I have tried it with Edge as well.<br />
3. I can't connect to the network when issue occurs , I lose the IP address. This is not a router issue (also the DHCP) , I tried to connect to my neighbour's router = same<br />
1-2 min' after closing browser IP &amp; ping returns.<br />
It's basically a streamer (Tronsmart Ara X5 Plus Windows 10 ) , I use the TV as a monitor only. &nbsp;<br />
It has the latest firmware</p>

    <title>Left-Click Drop-Down menu - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ninja8tyu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Left-Click Drop-Down menu</h2>
                    <p>Whenever I left-click, from time to time, the drop-down menu (the one that's supposed&nbsp;to pop up when you right-click) pops up and it bothers me a lot. I've been searching online for a solution, but I haven't found a problem like this that's solved. I don't
 know if it's the hardware or software that's causing this and what I need to do in order to fix this problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll repeat myself to try and eliminate misunderstandings in case I've worded it wrong or something else. I'm going to summarize this as well to make things simple and probably easier to read.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I left-click, it randomly decides to right-click instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Left-clicks sometimes results in the drop-down menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Left-clicks sometimes results in a right-click.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Normal clicks do another unwanted function, open the drop-down menu that right-clicking does.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no online solution to my problem that I have found. I have found a similar case, but since it has no solution/fix, it's pointless and unnecessary to talk further about it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not know if it's the programs and code that is the cause of the problem or the mouse itself that is the cause of the problem.</p>

<p>On the Device Manager (assuming that's where I find the model name), it's called an "HID-compliant mouse" and I know that this mouse came with the computer and was built by Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have made changes and just did trial and error to&nbsp;try and fix the problem, but quickly returned&nbsp;it to normal when it didn't seem like it worked. I haven't made changes to it before this issue popped up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't used another mouse yet. I do have another one, but I can't find it and test if the mouse I'm using is the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't really done anything to try and identify the problem other than messing around with the mouse settings (did nothing that would stop the problem temporarily or permanently). &nbsp;</p>

</font></font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><font><font>I would like to tell you that Bejeweled Twist Game is compatible with Windows 8.
</font></font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><font><font>To check the same, refer:</font></font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/win8/CompatCenter/ProductViewerWithDefaultFilters?TempOsid=win8&amp;Locale=en-us&amp;TextSearch=bejeweled%2Btwist&amp;Type=Both&amp;CurrentPage=0&amp;TotalPages=1&amp;ShowCriteria=0&amp;SortCriteria=Relevance&amp;Compatibility=Unknown&amp;LastRequested=14" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/win8/CompatCenter/ProductViewerWithDefaultFilters?TempOsid=win8&amp;Locale=en-us&amp;TextSearch=bejeweled%2Btwist&amp;Type=Both&amp;CurrentPage=0&amp;TotalPages=1&amp;ShowCriteria=0&amp;SortCriteria=Relevance&amp;Compatibility=Unknown&amp;LastRequested=14</font></u></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><font><font>However, this could have happened if the graphic card drivers are not up-to-date or if there is any software conflict.</font></font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><font><font>I would recommend you to follow the below given methods and check if it fixes the issue.</font></font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><font><font>Method1: Put the computer in Clean Boot state to see if there is any software conflict as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.</font></font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><font><font>Follow the instructions (Step 1 for Windows 8) given in this link to perform a clean boot:</font></font></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><font><font>Note: After performing the troubleshooting steps in clean boot, follow these steps to return the computer to Normal startup mode.</font></font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><font><font>a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.<br />
b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.<br />
c) On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click ok.<br />
d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.</font></font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><font><font>Method2: I would suggest you to update the latest graphics card drivers from the manufacturer’s website and check if it helps.<br />
</font></font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><font><font>Method3: As a work around, you may try to open the game in Windows 7 compatibility mode and check if it helps.</font></font></span></p>

<p>Hello JaredMantooth,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on the Xbox forums. We need a&nbsp;little more information to ensure we provide the correct solution.&nbsp;Is there an error message that appears when the child accounts attempt to join the realm? Are the child accounts utilizing an

            My child is attempting to play in a realm on Minecraft Pocket Edition on his phone. It works just fine when we play on the Xbox, but we are traveling and he would like to connect from his phone. It says he cannot play because of how his Xbox live account
 is set up. You can change these settings online. I went and double checked to make sure, all the privacy settings for Xbox One and Windows 10 are set to allow so he should be able to play online.

            <p>I did what I should have done in the first place. which was not to update Windows 7. I did a refresh which of course deleted everything and spent yesterday reinstalling all the programs that I would have had to do if I had installed 8 from scratch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Why I let anyone convince me to do otherwise I have no idea. One would think at the age of 62 I would have learnt something.</p>
<p>For the record, I don't like Windows 8 but I will try and get used to it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Windows media loaded but it still doesn't like it if you have a mouse with a trail. Somebody should have sorted that one.</p>
<p>I have one other ongoing problem in that I used to have multiple screens Now I have 2.&nbsp;Six hours working at that one has stumped me but I assume that is a problem for ATI.</p>
<p>Of course the&nbsp;moral to all this&nbsp;is of course, why didn't I wait a while before installing 8.</p>

<h2>            Windows Mail app wil not sync Gmail and Yahoo accounts on Windows 10 with error&#58; 0x80072746</h2>
                    <p>First off let me answer the questions that are going to be posted. &nbsp;Yes I have read other posts. &nbsp;No they did not work. &nbsp;I have tried the win app troubleshooter and that thing is worthless all it told me to do is turn the UAC back on...no. &nbsp;I've tried changing
 sync settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just performed a large update to win 10 and the mail app stopped working, again, for certain mail accounts. &nbsp;All my mail accounts work, including my microsoft account, except my yahoo and gmail accounts. &nbsp;Everytime I try to sync those accounts I get the
 error code:&nbsp;0x80072746. &nbsp;The last time I had this issue I ended up doing a fresh install because I was having other issues as well, but the mail app worked well until the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any suggestions on what could be causing this and how to fix it?</p>

            <p>Thanks for the response. &nbsp;I checked all the sync options and they're properly set up. &nbsp;I tried deleting the account then re-adding it to the app, but I still get the same error when trying to sync. &nbsp;I also looked at the article that you linked and checked
 the privacy settings, but they're set up like the article states.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did figure out what was causing the error though. &nbsp;It appears that Avast! mail shield is causing some issues. &nbsp;I disabled the shield temporarily and was able to successfully sync the gmail and yahoo accounts. &nbsp;When I re-enabled the shield it gave the errors
 again. &nbsp;So, I will post on their forums to see if there's a fix or workaround for this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: &nbsp;Doing a quick web search I was able to find a fix for this issue that worked for me. Here's the link to the article that lays out the steps to fix this incase anyone else is experiencing these issues and uses Avast! antivirus.</p>

<br />
We got your concern. On the account, it will be depending on the subscription of Bob. You have to ask Bob what his subscription is, kindly ask him to log on to his Microsoft account online.

<p>Bob has a hosted Office365 -- Plan E2 account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You refer to "install Office 365"... he's using the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
hosted </span>Office365.&nbsp; The issue is not with installing software (he has separately purchased Office 2016 software and installed that).&nbsp; The problem is on his PC he cannot set up Outlook 2016 to use his Office365 account.&nbsp; On the PC, Mail setup is getting
 confused saying "There's already an account set up to use xxx@****".</p>
<p>
</p><p>My hypothesis is this is being caused by Bob having both a personal Microsoft account &amp; work Office365 account with the same name, xxx@****.&nbsp; Don't know if that's correct?&nbsp; If so, how can we overcome that so he can set up Outlook 2016 on his PC to connect
 to his Office365 hosted mail?</p>
