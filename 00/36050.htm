<h2>            Enable Hibernate in Windows XP</h2>
                    Just had to format c: and re-install everything on my wife's XP Pro SP3 tower. It used to be able to hibernate. Now, there is no Hibernation tab on the power options properties, and there is no Hibernate In option on the Power Schemes tab. XP help sez
 that's because the PC does not support hibernation, but it used to support hibernation. I have searched thru the BIOS options and cannot find any applicable settings for hibernation. Helpppp???

<p>Go to your computer manufacture's support web site and check for Windows&nbsp;XP drivers for your specific model number.</p>
<p>If there are Windows&nbsp;XP drivers then download to a folder on your hard drive and install all of them, starting with the Motherboard/chipset drivers, SATA, LAN, Audio, Etc., and so on.</p>
<p>Check the Graphics card manufacture's download site for the most recent Windows XP drivers for your card.<br />

    <title>Why is Windows 10 file sharing on local wifi horribly slow&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> apex94  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is Windows 10 file sharing on local wifi horribly slow&#63;</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(34, 36, 38, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(34, 36, 38, 1)">Thank you for your time and I am sorry for the lengthy read ahead, but I believe it is necessary for understanding the problem.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 36, 38, 1)">As the question implies, when sharing a file / folder in windows 10 the connection is horribly slow. What I am essentially trying to do is to share a folder on one computer and access that folder and the files
 within from another computer on the same wifi network. More precisely, the shared folder contains video files (movies) that I would like to access and watch from other computers in my household. The way I am sharing said folder is by right clicking the folder
 &gt; share &gt; share with specific people &gt; from the dropdown select everyone &gt; add &gt; share at which point Windows gives me a link. Then, on every other computer I just add a shortcut that has the path set to the network location / link provided when sharing the
 folder.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 36, 38, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(34, 36, 38, 1)">The problem is that not only does it take forever to load the directory hierarchy on the client computers, but also playing the files on a client computer is horrible (low frame rates, incredible loading times
 when opening a file and / or seeking).</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 36, 38, 1)">The computers themselves are relatively new, the oldest being a 3 yr. old desktop PC, one Asus laptop that is around 2 yrs. old acting as the host, an Acer laptop, 1 yr. old, and an Intel Compute Stick with
 Windows. As you can probably tell, due to the limited storage on an Intel Compute Stick, I want to keep my blu ray movies on the asus laptop and just watch them from the stick. The asus has a Qualcom Atheros AR9485WB-EG wireless adapter and a 256 gig SSD.
 As for the stick... well I'm not sure. All devices are running either Windows 10 Pro or Windows 10 Home.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 36, 38, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(34, 36, 38, 1)">In any case, I did some testing and using speedtest.net I was able to get anywhere between 10 Mb to 35 Mb/s in download speed depending on server test location on the stick. That's 1 to 4-5 megabytes /s. With
 good torrents I was able to get up to 8.2 mebiBytes per second in download speed (aprox. 8.6 megabytes) but it usually downloads at 4-5 megabytes per second.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 36, 38, 1)">On the other end, the asus gets between 22 and 40 megabits/s in uplaod speed (2 to 6 megabytes /s) but I haven't seen more than 4 mebibytes / s in utorrent when seeding.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 36, 38, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(34, 36, 38, 1)">All the tests were done through wifi (ethernet cables are not and will not be an option).</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 36, 38, 1)">Also, I used Steam to stream games at 1080p to the stick from the asus and I have an average of 20 fps with the ocasional frame drop here and there.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 36, 38, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(34, 36, 38, 1)">However, when trying to copy a test file (500 megabytes) from the asus to the stick, the transfer rate is only about 1.2 megabytes/s.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 36, 38, 1)">The reason I mentioned I have 4 PCs in the house (the stick, 2 laptops and a desktop) is because I tried sharing the test file on every computer at a time and tried copying it to the client computers and see
 if the problem persists if for example ignoring the stick and using the laptop as a host and the desktop as the client. Of course, the transfer rate was still about 1.2 megabytes/s so there can't be a limiting factor on any of the computers since they all
 performed the same.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 36, 38, 1)">The wifi router used is an Asus RT-N12E which is rated for an ideal 300 megabits per second. As I mentioned earlier, it is successful at delivering around 8 megabytes of info.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 36, 38, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(34, 36, 38, 1)">I forced all devices (PC and router) to use only the 802.11n standard and I also placed all the devices at the same distance from the router which also did not cause any improvement. In normal use, the stick
 is around 3 meters away with no walls in between and the asus laptop is 5 meters away with only a door in between. According to several apps, I concluded that channel 6 is the channel with the least interference and forcing the router to use that channel,
 I wasn't able to notice any improvements.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 36, 38, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(34, 36, 38, 1)">The only thing that seemed to make a difference was disconnecting the internet cable from the router. The copy speed seems to have jumped from 1.2 megabytes / s to around 2 yet trying to play a movie still
 was horrible.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 36, 38, 1)">I also ran</p>
<pre><code>netsh interface tcp set global autotuning=disabled
</code></pre>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 36, 38, 1)">And 2 more netsh commands on all computers and restarted them and still nothing.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 36, 38, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(34, 36, 38, 1)">So, how come I can download torrents with 5 megabytes per second on the stick and upload with 3 megabytes per second on the laptop over wifi to and from the internet, and on my local wifi network I only experience
 1.5 megabyte / s transfer rates? What gives? What can I do to improve my situation or what other alternatives do I have (I should specify that I do not intend on using any third party services such as ftp servers, streaming programs, etc. and also, all my
 drivers are up to date)?</p>

            I tried it. I actually turned off all devices except the laptop and the stick and I also disconnected the router from the internet but the speed was still around 1.8 - 2 megabytes and the video files were still un-watchable.

            <p>I posted that question on superuser. Unfortunately, I posted it as a guest and some time after, I deleted my browser cookies and super user won't recognize that I am the owner of the question so I can't reply to the post anymore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding the suggestion in that article (&nbsp;<a href="http://superuser.com/questions/1032134/windows-10-file-sharing-on-local-wifi-is-horribly-slow/1032142" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Disable both the settings&nbsp;Large Send Offload V2</a><span style="color: rgba(34, 36, 38, 1)">)
 I don't have those options under the advanced tab and therefore I can't test it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I actually tried the support desk from Microsoft. After a couple of hours of deleting temporary files, scanning the computers for viruses (they were squeaky clean) and updating drivers that were already up to date I got tired of having whoever the support
 person was, remote controlling my computer with no obvious results. The only thing network related that he / she actually did, was to disable Remote Differential Compression API Support which also didn't increase performance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, perhaps disabling RDC might help others. In order to disable it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Press the start key and start typing the word "features" (or search for the word "features" with Cortana)</li><li>From the results choose "Turn windows features on or off"</li><li>Scroll down the list of features until you find "Remote Differential Compression API Support" and uncheck it.</li><li>Click "OK" and wait for Windows to do it's thing.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe it's just how Windows file sharing works. Whoever might be reading this question, I would be curious if you experience the same speeds so can you chime in and at least confirm it's the same for you?
</p>
<p>Or better yet, if the transfer rates you experience are better can you chime in as well?</p>
<p>After all, if this is the way it's meant to work or if these are the limits to the service, perhaps there is no solution.&nbsp;</p>

            I've been having similar. It turned out in my case that 2.5Ghz is too saturated in my residential area. Wifi 'N' defaults to 2.5Ghz and has 5Ghz as an option. If I force it to 5Ghz I get super fast speed because everyone else is still on the default 2.5
 frequency. I suggest you try the same.

<p>I had the indentical problem between 2 new Dell laptops, both high end gaming systems. Drove me nuts. I changed the wifi network on both laptops from Private to Public, rebooted, and all was well. I still haven't determined why this works as the Public network
 settings are more restricted than Private.. go figure.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Communities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be glad to help you with the issue you have installing Windows 10. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 uses approximately 10 GBs of disk space. The minimum disk space available is to facilitate the installation process. Some install files are compressed and need to be expanded during setup. Some files are temporary and are deleted during or after
 installation. Also, because you might have data and apps on the hard disk, they will be moved around during migration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can follow the below link to know how to free up space to install Windows 10:</p>

 </blockquote> 
<p>I'm aware that it is the Enforcement team that handle the reports and they do not do a very good job. An example of having my account&nbsp;messed with and certain features disabled is that I was in a sniper only lobby and someone joined using assault rifles half&nbsp;way through the game I had had enough with him cheating and messaged him saying this is a sniper only server&nbsp;can you not see all the f*ing snipers (didn't censor the swear word but don't feel it's appropriate as this is for everyone to see) and he said I've reported you.</p>
<p>Now bare in mind this was on Battlefield 4 witch is rated 18 so it's for adults and therefore you should expect that people will&nbsp;swear. If you still do not like swear words you can block the person&nbsp;witch stops any communication with that account,&nbsp;your&nbsp;account won't get suspended or banned and that person doesn't ever have to deal with you again but because the report button is right there in the&nbsp;message menu people then can and do&nbsp;abuse&nbsp;it. They know it&nbsp;can mess with your account and because it is so easily accesed people abuse it.</p>
<p>To sum it up a system that can tamper with your&nbsp;account should not be so easy to access&nbsp;it should require some actual effort for a person to report you (calling Microsoft/Enforement team) this will stop any abuse of the current system&nbsp;because no one would want to hang about waiting to speak to someone and go through all that trouble unless their reason was valid. Not difficult to fix and it will ensure a fair system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A side note:&nbsp;you cannot contact the Enforcement team via calls&nbsp;it is all through Emails and&nbsp;I've seen a number of videos explaining their problems with the Enforcement team and&nbsp;how they don't get back to people etc. Even I&nbsp;personally know that they suspend/disable features for unjust reasons like the one&nbsp;example I made out of many others.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The game itself may be rated M, but everything else on Live has to remain E for everything. That is what you agreed to when you signed up. The report system is not the problem. You said something that violated the code of conduct so you were punished. It's that simple.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Alright sorry for not wanting to live in a world that punishes you for freedom of speech on a platform that never had this problem before. Not that&nbsp;long ago if you didn't like someone you would simply block that&nbsp;account no harm done makes no difference to you and the person&nbsp;that blocked you're account&nbsp;doesn't&nbsp;have to deal with &nbsp;you&nbsp;again, how easy.&nbsp;The fact of the matter is that the report system&nbsp;is abused and the&nbsp;report option&nbsp;should&nbsp;be taken out of console menus&nbsp;and people should be made to call if they have a serious issue with someone.&nbsp;Not difficult,&nbsp;doesn't change&nbsp;anything&nbsp;just stops weak and or petty people from abusing a flawed system. Oh and I garantee if they did change it the number of reports would drop drastically.&nbsp;</p>

There will be a mountain of abuse committed every seconds&nbsp;that will make&nbsp;online gameplay&nbsp;almost impossible to play and everybody sending an email to report might take more time to investigate then real live reporting.

            <p>I don't want to keep going round in circles but how the report button is implemented now is far to easy to be abused.&nbsp;All I'm saying is it needs to be implemented in a fair way that stops people just being able to spam it whenever,&nbsp;fair or not it can still get you suspended just by the number of reports. Swear words are just that words if you play a game that's an 18 you should be able to handle general&nbsp;swearing and if not mute or block still work just fine.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>The Xbox 360 never had this issue because once you went online you'd know to expect people to swear but now we live in a world where freedom of speech barely exists and that my friend is the start of a collapsed society.

 </blockquote> <p>Not true. You can be reported a million times and not get suspended. In fact, the other person can be suspended for filing false complaints. But you can be suspended off just 1 report if you do something to violate the code of conduct.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Console Suspension Inquiries</h2>
                    <p>To whom it may concern,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br /> This is&nbsp;Veronica&nbsp;<strong>[MOD Removed - Please see <a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/news__events/announcements/f/6/t/515277.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Click here!">Forum Guidelines</a>]</strong>&nbsp;the owner of StrippinPig (gamertag). Recently my console was placed with a temporary suspension which started last Jun 21, 2017 12:22:03 AM - Which should ended last Jul 5, 2017 12:22:03 AM - UTC Time zone. However, upon checking&nbsp;the console,&nbsp;it still appears suspended which is why I contacted Xbox Chat support. The support Ericson C. assisted me and confirmed that the suspension on my console should lifted. Ericson C. advised me to restore the console to factory defaults and restart it to refresh the Xbox. However,&nbsp;the status of my console didn't changed. The support&nbsp;advised me to raised this through forums instead to reach the Xbox Enforcement team to review this further.

            Many users reporting problems with the update that came end of last year.
<br />I would recommend getting rid of it for now.
<br />
<br />First block it... 
<br /><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3232632/microsoft-windows/how-to-block-windows-10-fall-creators-update-from-installing.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.computerworld.com/article/3232632/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Then remove it.
<br /><a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/rollback-uninstall-windows-10-creators-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/rollback-uninstal...</a>
<br />
<br />When you are ready to install the update then follow this article that goes into how to prepare for a update.
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-and-version-update/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />Also doing a clean install as long as you have all your apps and data backed up is another solution.
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/clean-install-windows-10/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>

            Hi Katrina.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Turn off Fast Startup at Settings &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; Sleep &gt; Additional Power Settings &gt; Choose what Power buttons do &gt;  Change Settings Currently Unavailable &gt; uncheck the box for Fast Startup, Save Settings. 
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />Click Advanced Options

<br />See if KB4056892 is installed or not. 
<br />
<br />If it is, right click it then uninstall it.
<br />
<br />
<br />I recommend you block it until the next cumulative update is released. Many are reporting the same problem too and it looks like this update is buggy.
<br />
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>

<br />
<br />After downloading, launch it, click Next, wait while it detects pending Windows Updates.
<br />
<br />Click the Hide Updates menu.
<br />
<br />Scroll through the list then select then select the update. Check the box next to the update then click Next to confirm changes.
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />

            Looks like you are one of those affected by KB4056892. To correct this, Microsoft has released an update which disables the patching by KB4056892 and you should not experience reboots anymore after installing.

            Hi Janice, 
<br />
<br />Start PC, just as the Lenovo logo disappears and Windows attempts to load, press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down
<br />
<br />Do this twice
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc.
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing
<br />Then start the Reset       
        </p>

            Janice it looks like a major Windows 10 update has failed to install . . .
<br />
<br />Have yo any USB devices plugged into your system?
<br />
<br />Unplug all devices, especially a USB receiver for a wireless mouse or keyboard
<br />
<br />Press and hold the Power Button to perform a hard shut down
<br />
<br />Wait 5 minutes and then start your system again
<br />
<br />Give it 15 minutes for the rollback to proceed . . .

<br />
<br />When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10.

<h2>            Windows 7 nvidia graphics card problem.</h2>
                    Hi, I bought a toshiba satellite a665 not too long ago and it came with the intel graphics card and an nvidia graphics card. So I disabled the intel graphics card because I wanted to just use my nvidia one, but the resolution went kinda wack, and basically
 my laptop's resolution changed. I tried downloading the newest driver for nvidia to see if this would fix the problem. When the program asked to reboot, i tried restarting my computer but now it won't get past "starting windows". So now I have no clue what
 to do. I tried starting in safe mode and it gets stuck too.

<p><br />
Pardon? your laptop has an nvidia graphics and an intel chipset and as a result of your fiddling you appear to have wrecked your laptop setings</p>
<p>I hope you have the restore disks, or made them when you first powered up your new laptop</p>
<p>For laptops you obtain any drivers from that makers site</p>

<p>Please stop making threads on the same topic over, and over, and over again. As you were told previously. If phone support cannot reproduce what your seeing with your own modded profile previously it's unlikely they will be able to fix this.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Your previous threads:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong><a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/12/p/312936/1638324.aspx#1638324" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/12/p/312936/1638324.aspx<br />

<br />
You've said that deleting and downloading the profile doesn't work, you've tested your connection to XBOX Live. It's likely that you messed something up when&nbsp;<span><strong>you&nbsp;</strong></span>changed files on the XBOX 360's Hard Drive to do this modding and
 messed up something that contained profile data that's now showing you an incorrect gamer score in a certain part of your profile.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Again, no one can "fix" this for you because no one can reproduce this showing for you as it's only showing for you on your own side. Making multiple threads won't get it fixed because forum support agents can only relay information to engineers and when engineers
 can't reproduce something they&nbsp;<strong>can't</strong>&nbsp;fix it. You were also told to try a USB Flash Drive to see if it's actually a problem with your hard drive that you've been modifying files on which you said you don't have, I suggest going out and buying
 one that's good enough to use on the XBOX 360 around $5-10 and try that to see if it fixes your issue because otherwise it's sort of something you'll have to honestly learn to live with.<br />
<br />
The gamerscore is showing up correct on XBOX.com, your friends can see the correct gamerscore, you see a correct gamerscore in certain parts of your profile but not others. So it leads me to believe something is messed up on&nbsp;<strong>your&nbsp;</strong>end. More
 than likely due to you messing around with files on your hard drive.</p>

    <title>How do I get Windows 7 to forget a drive&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fpbear  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I get Windows 7 to forget a drive&#63;</h2>
                    <p>In the process of replacing my motherboard and hard drives, I removed one of the drive letters, drive "Y" that used to hold My Documents.&nbsp; This location was set in the properties for the Library.&nbsp; Now, with the new hard drive arrangement, I have&nbsp;Documents
 on a different drive letter and Y no longer exists.&nbsp; I updated the Library location and used that dialog to Move the files for me.</p>
<p>The problem is that some Windows features keep thinking I have drive Y even though I moved the Library to the correct new location!</p>
<p>For example Windows Backup always says that some files were skipped because it could not find Y:\Users\Myname\Documents.&nbsp; Even though I setup backup again to let Windows choose what files to backup, it keeps giving this error when backup completes.</p>
<p>Another example, some (but not all) file-open dialog boxes launched from web pages attempt to look for Documents in drive Y and then I'm unable to choose the real location of the documents from the dialog.</p>
<p>I searched through the entire registry and replaced all instances of Y:\Users with the new drive letter "K".</p>
<p>I thought that would fix it, but it didn't.</p>
<p>So then where is Windows 7 still finding references to this drive letter??&nbsp; In some cryptic .ini file somewhere?&nbsp; In config.sys?&nbsp; Did it burn it into CMOS?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>These answers (Method 1-4) don't really address the question.</p>
<p>1. This issue has nothing to do with drivers, services, etc. loaded upon boot.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>2. I already changed the drive letter, that's what caused the problem.</p>
<p>3. Restore libraries had no effect.</p>
<p>4. I can already see the drive letters assigned, that's not the issue either.</p>

            <p>If shows drive letter K for My Documents.</p>
<p>However Windows has some bug whereby it still thinks I have My Documents on the old drive letter, but only for certain applications such as backup and a few web browser based dialogs.&nbsp; I already tried starting to configure the backups fresh.</p>
<p>I have a feeling that the final solution might involve cleaning up the registry somehow.&nbsp; But I could not find any more instances of the old drive letter in the registry, which is strange.</p>

            <p>I was able to install Windows 10 upgrade on my W700 tablet but discovered that the wifi is very unstable and frequently causes my internet connection to fail, not only on my tablet but on all three computers on my home network. I have to shut down the Acer
 and restart all computers on the network to get the connection back. </p>
<p>It doesn't look like Acer has any intention of providing Windows 10 compatible drivers from their own webpage so I will be checking to see if Qualcomm Atheros will have a solution.</p>
<p>In the meantime I won't be using the tablet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just checked out the site:</p>
<p>https://www.atheros.cz/atheros-wireless-drivers.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>and they don't seem to have any wireless drivers for Windows 10 - yet. Fingers crossed.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 refuses to boot without the old monitor. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> serpent90yk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 refuses to boot without the old monitor.</h2>
                    <p>So, I used to have two monitors connected to my computer:</p>
<p>-An iiyama G-Master GB2783QSU Silver Crow connected through a DisplayPort</p>
<p>-And an old Acer AL1912 connected through a DVI port with a VGA to DVI adapter. (POST was showing on this monitor)</p>
<p>My GPU is a Geforce 970</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently the older monitor started flickering and died. So after powering down the computer (it did an update at that time) I disconnected it entirely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next time I started the computer it went trough POST normally (it was shown on the new monitor) but then after showing a low dash a couple times the screen went black. (didn't shut down, but was entirely black, no mouse cursor anywhere even when trying to
 move the mouse)</p>
<p>I tried waiting for 1/2 an hour to see if it would boot eventually.</p>
<p>I tried logging in "blindly"</p>
<p>Nothing worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pressing the power button would shut down the machine instantly. (after restarting it it went trough POST again to the same result)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I had an idea. I reconnected the dead monitor.</p>
<p>And magically, it worked. It booted normally. POST was invisible due to the fact that it was probably sent to a dead screen, but after booting windows defaulted to the new monitor (as it was set to do).</p>
<p>I tried this a couple times and noticed that the old monitor doesn't even need to be powered on or connected to electricity. Just connected to the port.</p>
<p>I also tried scanning for hardware changes in the device manager after unplugging the old monitor. It went from showing 2 pnp monitors to showing one. But it still wouldn't boot without the old one (it resets to 2 pnp monitors after the reboot)</p>
<p>I tried updating the GPU drivers, no change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea on how to fix it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>EDIT:</p>
<p>Tried entering safe mode with msconfig boot settings. Bad idea. No image on the new screen. (even with the old connected) Couldn't exit safe mode. Had no vision.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Connected the new monitor trough HDMI instead of DisplayPort, it somewhat fixed the issue. It doesn't need the old monitor to boot anymore and I was able to exit safe mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still, I would like to connect it with Displayport, I don't think HDMI allows the 75hz @1440p this monitor is capable of.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
To address your issue with connecting a new monitor, please perform these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Plug in the old monitor.</li><li>Uninstall the video driver, go to <strong>Device Manager</strong> &gt; right-click on the video driver &gt;
<strong>Uninstall</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Unplug the old monitor, then connect the new one.</li><li>Turn on the computer, <span><span>and Windows will attempt to reinstall the driver.</span></span><br />
</li></ol>
<p>Update us on the result.</p>

            <p>The second step might be hard to do without a working monitor connected.</p>
<p>The old one is dead, no image whatsoever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit:<br />
Also tried doing that:<br />
1. Plug in the new monitor (with HDMI).<br />
2. Uninstall the gpu driver<br />
3. Unplug HDMI, connect with DisplayPort<br />
4. Reboot</p>
<p>
</p><p>Failed at step 4. It doesn't boot with the new monitor connected with DisplayPort.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Edit 2: I just recalled something worth noting:</p>
<p>I had another main monitor before the iiyama.</p>
<p>It was connected through a second DVI port. (DVI-D)&nbsp;</p>
<p>One day, it stopped working. I tried connecting it trough HDMI and it was fine. (but POST started showing on the old monitor, it was on the main one before that)</p>
<p>I supposed that the DVI cable was dead at that time, and thought nothing of it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It might have something to do with the issue I have now.</p>

<h2>            Laptop display won&#39;t turn on after sleep mode, but other than display is on &#40;after update to windows 10 10.010586 build 10586&#41;</h2>
                    <p>so after the windows update, I have this issue. When I tried to wake my laptop from sleep mode, the screen won't turn on, but the other ones turned on (I know this because when I press space button, I can hear the youtube video that I played before sleep
 the laptop).</p>
