    <title>Returning Inside Feedback - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Returning Inside Feedback</h2>
                    <p>From the beginning of the Windows 10 Insider Program, I have been a part of this program. &nbsp;However, I decided to take a break from testing and submitting feedback and returned to Windows 8.1 after many months of Microsoft going in the wrong direction (my
 personal opinion) with each new build of Windows 10 I was receiving. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still believe Microsoft made a massive mistake in not allowing the user to choose which UI they want to use! &nbsp;This was available in the earliest Insider Preview build but unfortunately was removed in a future build. &nbsp;Although only an option when completing
 the setup. &nbsp;Microsoft could have made it a choice that could be changed in the control panel and changing it would simply require the user to log out and log back in to their account for the setting to change. &nbsp;With that out of the way. &nbsp;Here comes some feedback
 after my long break from Windows 10. &nbsp;I will do my best to break my feedback down into specific categories to help keep it clear. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Windows 10 Start Screen (full screen Start)</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a lot of wasted space on this screen! &nbsp;The top third of my screen goes unused thanks to the group title bars for the tile placement not being adjustable. &nbsp;I also find it disappointing that each tile ground must be 4 medium tiles in width. &nbsp;Under
 Windows 8/8.1, there was a lot more flexibility in customizing the Start Screen. &nbsp;If I want to make a group of tiles only one medium tile wide with a title, then I should be able to do so. &nbsp;Please fix this! &nbsp;I would also like to see the margins between each
 group reduced slightly. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/603a4c8d-9488-46da-8efc-4529c90a70a6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/603a4c8d-9488-46da-8efc-4529c90a70a6" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The two groups of three buttons, one at the top and one at the bottom on the left side of the screen. &nbsp;Why can't these be relocated to one row of six, starting from the bottom left corner on top of the Start Button, to the right? &nbsp;Personally, I don't understand
 why there needs to be a duplicate of the log off/shut down/restart option when it is the second option from the bottom in the Context Menu (right clicking on the Start Button). &nbsp;This is a small change that would go a long way in my opinion and would hopefully
 easily solve the wasted space above and below the tile groups area. &nbsp;Can we please have the option to make the tiles varying levels of transparency back as well? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All Apps/Programs needs to provide the Windows 8/8.1 style as an option. &nbsp;I understand that not everyone has 21:9 aspect ratio screens but most do have a wide screen monitor. &nbsp;Having the option to choose between scrolling up and down for All Apps/Programs
 or scrolling from left to right for All Apps/Programs would really be greatly appreciated! &nbsp;This would also eliminated about half of my screen being completely wasted empty space. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e6d9ffca-1d72-49db-823e-c6962fa82168" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e6d9ffca-1d72-49db-823e-c6962fa82168" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Windows 10 UI</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>It is nice to see some screens, tabs, and apps offer a dark option. &nbsp;Personally, I would like to see the option to completely switch the UI and everything within it, to a dark theme. &nbsp;That means, forcing developers to support having a dark option that can
 be triggered by changing a single setting on Windows 10. &nbsp;Third party browsers and most other programs do not offer any sort of dark option or setting. &nbsp;I would also like to see the return of animated backgrounds along with an adjustable level of transparency
 in the Start Menu/Screen tiles. &nbsp;If my Nokia Lumia 635 on Windows Phone 8.1 can do transparent tiles, then there is no reason why Windows 10 can't! &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Microsoft Edge</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Edge happens to be something I think Microsoft is on the right track with. &nbsp;It's definitely quicker than IE ever was, it does have a dark option, and supports the adding of extensions. &nbsp;Excellent! &nbsp;Where it can improve slightly is with Top Sites. &nbsp;It is
 nice to be able to add some very frequently used sites below the search bar on a basic blank start page. &nbsp;This is actually something I have enjoyed using with the Maxthon browser for years now. &nbsp;Where it could be improved is, by allowing those eight Top Sites
 placed in there, to be arranged in a grid arrangement and allowing more than just eight Top Sites to be added. &nbsp;The screenshot below is a good illustration of what I mean. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/181bb6ad-08b0-4f77-bb2d-78dfe1234055" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/181bb6ad-08b0-4f77-bb2d-78dfe1234055" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>See how nice that looks?! &nbsp;:P &nbsp;It would be nice to be able to asign a background to the Top Sites blank page as well. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Windows 10 Driver Updates</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is one thing that has annoyed me incredibly for a long time with Windows 10. &nbsp;As a Computer Consultant and Tech that primarily works with senior citizens and visually impaired and or blind clients. &nbsp;Have an option to disable the automatic updating of
 drivers! &nbsp;I see too many Windows 10 systems regularly because of WiFi adapter driver updates that actually cause WiFi to not work, especially on laptops! &nbsp;Even deferring the broken driver only lasts until another one hits Windows Update, which usually isn't
 any better. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it comes to Jaws for Windows and Zoomtext Xtra, a generic display driver works best! &nbsp;Screen readers for the visually impaired and blind do not function properly with most display drivers. &nbsp;To be quite honest. &nbsp;If Microsoft can't grasp the concept that
 some of their implementations actually cause more issues for visually impaired and blind users, then expect a class action lawsuit against the company at some point based on failing to adequately provide adequate equal access to using the most widely adopted
 operating system for people with disabilities. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some games function better with drivers optimized for them. &nbsp;If I decide to go back and play something from a year ago and it works better with a driver from that time. &nbsp;Then I should be able to roll back the driver without having to fight with Windows Update
 and deferring drivers. &nbsp;This also especially applies to Creative sound cards! &nbsp;Trust me when I say this. &nbsp;I know what the best drivers are for my hardware and I should have the choice to disable driver updates via Windows Update. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">General Comments</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>From the last build I have tested (more than a year ago) to the current 14393 build I installed yesterday. &nbsp;There have been a lot of improvements. &nbsp; That doesn't mean there isn't room for a lot more improvements, but I do understand that these things take
 time and that my opinion is just one of many. &nbsp;At this point, Windows 10 still comes off as something that can only be compared to Homer Simpson's car design that bankrupted his brother's company. &nbsp;:P &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8bc40f97-689e-49fa-978b-fe3f27379581" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8bc40f97-689e-49fa-978b-fe3f27379581" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can do better, Microsoft. &nbsp;Get to it! &nbsp;</p>

            A Lot of what you posted has been posted over the life of the program my suggestion is to post it in the Feedback Hub where people can upvote if they think that it's an issue. I don't find that the start screen is that important when it comes to looks
 as I click on something and start using my system and don't sit looking at the start screen but that's my opinion.&nbsp;

            <p>This is the Windows 10 Insider forum where we are downloading, testing, and supplying Microsoft Feedback through the Feedback Hub. This is a peer to peer group of volunteers and we have no direct contact with Microsoft. We are currently evaluating the early
 builds of Redstone 2 which will be released in the Spring of 2017. When we find issues, bugs, or even to make suggestions we use the Feedback Hub to post our findings. Your very well thought out post should be directed to Microsoft via another forum or via
 the Feedback Hub where Microsoft evaluates the information posted to determine its value for future builds. You may also post to the forum for the general public's use here:</p>

            I shouldn't have to say this but you have been able to disable automatic driver updates for a long time.&nbsp;A quick search of the web will tell you where to change the settings.

            Of course you can also be like some people I know and not use Start at all. Looks weird seeing a Windows 10 desktop full of shortcuts just like Windows 7. But some people don't like change I guess.

            It's not 160 tiles as just the way I want to organize things. &nbsp;There are a few programs that I stack one on top of the other in a single row, basically for audio editing. &nbsp;For media apps, I ten to make them the wide tiles. &nbsp;It is pretty much impossible
 to recreate with the Start Screen the way it is under Window 10 because the groups are locked to 4 medium tiles wide. &nbsp;With all of the empty space on the top, I would rather fill that with a straight row from left to right of tiles that include my weather,
 calendar, e-mail, and a few new sources I regularly read from. &nbsp;In Windows 8/8.1, the groups didn't star almost a third of the way down the screen but they were much more flexible in making categories suit whatever you wanted. &nbsp;

            <p>If Windows 10 didn't have the full screen Start Screen, I would be forced to stay with Windows 8/8.1. &nbsp;The Start Screen was too much of an upgrade to allow Microsoft to go back on. &nbsp;It takes too long to find things in the Start Menu when everything can be
 arranged nicely, all right there in a single view, with one tap of the Windows Key. &nbsp;There just isn't enough room and it isn't organized enough to actually make use of the Start Menu, at least for me, to use it as a viable alternative. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think I have any screenshots laying around of how I had things set on Windows 8.1 but I will definitely look and see, just for the sake of illustrating what I mean. &nbsp;</p>

            Ciao,
<br />
<br />volume license is usually a company license (one product key, many activations): if this is your situation, you should contact your IT Dept and ask for their help.
<br />
<br />Differently, if you just bought off the shelf, you should explain this situation to your reseller that will certainly solve your issue.
<br />
<br />In any case, please have a look at the following that contains an overview of Office Activation Process and some FAQs:

            Exactly how/where did you buy it?  
<br />
<br />If you got it legitimately, they gave you the wrong type of key. If you bought it on the internet, you were scammed. Contact your credit card company to cancel the payment. 
<br />
<br />Pro Plus is not sold to the general public. It is commonly "bootlegged", bought and resold illegally (contrary to license terms).  The volume license uses 2 types of activation, one of which requires contact to a server at the company that originally bought the license. It appears that you got that type of license.

    <title>Missing calls after Lumia 640 Upgrade to 10, need to Reset with no - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> greg carmack - mvp 2010-2020  say:</h3>
<h2>            Missing calls after Lumia 640 Upgrade to 10, need to Reset with no Windows 8 Contacts backup</h2>
                    <p><span><span>I have a problem with a Lumia 640 I gave my elderly Uncle for Chistmas (and which he loves) which was Upgraded to Windows 10 via Insider slow to 10.0.10586.420 and is now not getting all of its calls.&nbsp; The phone doesn't ring nor does it log the
 calls.&nbsp; So we forwarded his calls to his second line Android phone and they are being all received. The provider says it could not be a cellular setting that's changed. They recommend Reset which is my instinct too.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
</span></span><span><span>I have an identical phone I Upgraded six months ago which works fine. I notice that even though it's listed as ready for WIndows 10 that it isn't being pushed out via Updates so maybe this is why.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>So I want to roll it back to native WIndows 8 using Reset or WDRT. The problem is that he has a huge address book and (unlike with my 640) it did not save a Windows 8 backup but deleted it in favor of latest WIndows 10 backup on OneDrive (I have
 both). Since I don't think a Windows 10 backup will work when rolling back to Windows 8, we need a reliable way to back up his Contacts.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>His MS account is a Gmail address which is supposed to save contacts, but in Account Settings is only synching email.&nbsp; This may be because that exact same Gmail address is his MS account address; we have yet to install his actual Gmail account
 on the phone to see if offers to sync Contacts.&nbsp; Does anyone know for sure?&nbsp; Can this then be confirmed in his cloud Google account before we Reset the phone?</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>There are various apps that claim to transfer Contacts, but none seem to work cross platform Windows 10&gt;8.&nbsp; I don't think Windows Sync Settings includes Contacts although it certainly should.<br />
<br />
Is there a reliable method to copy out Contacts to replace after Reset when going from WIndows 10&gt;8 mobile, or another Manual backup method for backing up address book contacts? I think I originally ported his address book over from Android phone via Bluetooth
 using a Windows app but that list is dated now. <br />
<br />
I would appreciate any suggestions on this. &nbsp; Thank you.</span></span></p>

            <p>This was resolved for now by the latest Insider Build update to v.494. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I now feel&nbsp; out on a limb having put an Insider Build on my Uncle's phone just because it was stable for several months on mine of the same make/model.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like others opinions on whether I should roll back to Windows 8.1 and then run the Upgrade Advisor app to see if it will provide a more stable build.&nbsp; I had assumed since Windows 10 was not pushed out by Windows Update that there was not another way
 than Insider, but Support tells me that Upgrade Advisor would have been the place to start.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>They also told me that if his entire Address Book I'd copied over via Bluetooth from his old Android phone is showing up in the People app, that it will be backed up in Settings Sync and restored as soon as signed into MS Account, and that a Windows 10 backup
 will work after rolling back to Windows 8.1 using Device Recovery Tool.&nbsp;&nbsp; Can anyone confirm these?&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

https://people.live.com</a> with his G-mail based Microsoft Account.&nbsp; I know you said it isn't set to sync contacts but it's probably worth checking to see if they are in fact in the cloud and associated to his Microsoft Account.</p>

            <p>Hi Mark -</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the great suggestion.&nbsp; His complete address book for the old Android phone is there along with many duplicates from Yahoo and Google mail accounts.&nbsp; I tried the Clean Up feature on the Tool Bar and it only found a few duplicates which is strange
 because there are so many more.&nbsp; Do you&nbsp; happen to know of a good app to merge these, or is that not desirable since they remain also rooted in Yahoo and Google accounts, too, while the old Android's Address Book appears now as Outlook contacts?&nbsp; Perhaps the
 link feature is more appropriate?&nbsp; It seems to have already linked some of them in the background, but their duplicates remain in the list.&nbsp; Ideas?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suppose the worry about not having his Contacts backed up is over now that we know they're in Outlook and phone Sync is turned on?&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you have another Contacts backup method to suggest?&nbsp; We do have Backup turned on but it is only a Windows 10 backup
 and we may still yet need to roll back to Windows 8 so I'm still not certain that Backup would be useable.&nbsp;

            <p>I have now found the answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution is to set up the account manually not using the Hotmail connector</p>
<p>
</p><p>Email account - the&nbsp;email address&nbsp;you want to use</p>
<p>
</p><p>Login - the @outlook.com email address</p>
<p>Password - as per live.</p>
<p>Requires SPA</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outgoing server use the same setting as incoming.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Incoming server imap-mail.outlook.com Port 995 SSL</p>
<p>Outgoing server smtp-mail.outlook.com Port 587 TLS</p>
<p>
</p><p>And no more hexadecimal emails!</p>

<p class="contentCodeblock">I have a problem that appears to have been a problem at least since 2011. I am using Outlook for Windows on a PC with Windows 10. My version of Microsoft Office is 365 ProPlus. When I read a message in my inbox, the appearance
 changes from bold font (unread) to regular font (read). However when I move that message from my inbox to a folder, the message becomes bold (unread) once again. I then have to go into the folder to mark the message as unread AGAIN. Is there a way to have
 the read messages left as read after moving them into a folder?</p>

<p>Hi Fabienne,</p>
<p>
</p><p>From your description, may I confirm if your issue is when you read an unread email in the Inbox folder, then move it to another folder, this email will show as unread after moving?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, please kindly do following simply steps to see if it helps:</p>
<p>1. Open Outlook, go to File &gt; Options &gt; Advanced &gt; Outlook panes.</p>
<p>2. Click on the Reading Pane button and then Select the option "Mark itemsas read when viewed in the reading pane“, for your reference:&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Please feel free to let me know if above steps cannot help you fix this issue. Meanwhile, to have a deeply understanding of your issue and assist you better, please send us some screenshoots of the issue you encountered ( for example, about "the appearance
 changes from bold font (unread) to regular font (read)." and "the message becomes bold (unread) once again").</p>

                    For the most part, I understand what all the symbols are in Show/Hide, but there is an almost roundish-type symbol that appears in a table in MS Word that I cannot identify since there are paragraph, tab, and other symbols.&nbsp; You can't delete it.&nbsp; Any idea
 what that symbol might be?

<h2>            Help with a macro in Excel</h2>
                    
<p>I have recorded a macro that will sort a range of data on a table by a column of dates. &nbsp;It works fine in the worksheet that I recorded it in but I can't work out how to get it to work in any of the worksheets I have in my workbook of which there are 12,
 one for each month.</p>
<p>Here is the code for the macro:</p>
<p>Sub OnsiteDateSort()<br />
'<br />
' OnsiteDateSort Macro<br />
' Sorts the selection of audits by onsite date<br />
'<br />
' Keyboard Shortcut: Ctrl+q<br />
'<br />
ActiveWorkbook.Worksheets("Aug").Sort.SortFields.Clear<br />
ActiveWorkbook.Worksheets("Aug").Sort.SortFields.Add Key:=Range("G4:G14"), _<br />
SortOn:=xlSortOnValues, Order:=xlAscending, DataOption:=xlSortNormal<br />
With ActiveWorkbook.Worksheets("Aug").Sort<br />
.SetRange Range("B3:T14")<br />
.Header = xlYes<br />
.MatchCase = False<br />
.Orientation = xlTopToBottom<br />
.SortMethod = xlPinYin<br />
.Apply<br />
End With<br />
End Sub</p>

<p>If anyone has an idea how to adjust the code I'd be grateful.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance &nbsp;Rob</p>

<h2>            MS Excel Files Open with &#34;Upload Pending&#34; Message For OneDrive Documents</h2>
                    <p>Recently I've been having the frustration of opening my Excel files that are stored in OneDrive and getting the Excel warning banner "UPLOAD PENDING Click Save to retry your upload." When I click Save, I get the warning banner "SERVER FILE UPDATED A newer
 version is available." I click the "Reopen Document" button in the banner, and I get a warning about discarding my changes. Then, the file opens as Read-Only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I love OneDrive, except when this happens, and a few months ago I lost my local copy of the OneDrive files and had to recreate the local library folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I saw a similar posting of this from 2015, but it's closed now and it's suggestions didn't solve this.</p>

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The issue that you're experiencing could possibly due to outdated OneDrive app that's causing sync issues. As our initial recommendation, we suggest that you

<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, let us know so that we can provide you the next troubleshooting procedure possible.</p>

<p>I'm logged into Office with my corporate account all the time (and I checked again today. It is.) I also logged into Microsoft Support Community with my personal Microsoft Live account and it didn't make any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also followed the "Fix OneDrive sync issues" link and it found a couple of unrelated filename issues that were repaired. Problem remained afterwards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried unlinking my OneDrive for Business and remapping it and it may be okay now. Testing so far seems successful.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The issue that you're experiencing could possibly due to outdated OneDrive app that's causing sync issues. As our initial recommendation, we suggest that you
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027498/windows-10-run-the-troubleshooter-for-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">run the Windows App Troubleshooter
</a></strong>as this can scan issues and will provide automatic fixes. We also suggest that you refer to the methods provided on this page for help to correct the issue:</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/4028268/windows-fix-onedrive-sync-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Fix OneDrive sync issues</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, let us know so that we can provide you the next troubleshooting procedure possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>So, I ran the app troubleshooter and that seems to have done the trick, but I also tried to run the Fix OneDrive sync issue link and it says I already have a later version installed.&nbsp; The link needs an update!&nbsp; :)</p>

            <p>After read the feedback and discussion from a lot of insider users, I compromise and solve the problem, let my mobile 1520 more like mobile, needn't connect to the charger. The suggestion is switching off the cellular &nbsp;data connection.</p>
<p>If no wifi outside, &nbsp;my mobile really likes Nokia 3120, 20 years ago.</p>
<p>Build 14342 has severe defect, draining battery makes mobile like fixed line phone. Before releasing, had better test the users from your own MS company.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Frequent updating is NOT a good idea unless security issues. Adding more features is meaningless for most of users.</p>
<p>If possible, develop more apps by yourselves to attract more new users.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Deleted hotmail.co.uk alias</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>i really need help in trying to restore my hotmail.co.uk alias that was accidentally deleted by my young daughter a few days ago...I have set up an outlook.com alias to use for other purposes to my original email address, but the hotmail one which I've had
 for years and years and has been my main line of contact- clients/business associates/utility companies/mortgage provider etc. Is very important, is there a way to retrieve this?? I'm assuming that now it's been deleted nobody sending mail via the hotmail.co.uk
 address will be able to get through for now so I'll never receive this info and will have to change my details with every contact that had this address is this correct? A pop folder has also appeared in my inbox, which I don't know what this is either. Please
 help!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Martine,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your&nbsp;query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have removed your Hotmail address from your alias, you will not be able to&nbsp;login to your account using this address. To recover the account you will have to&nbsp;sign up for&nbsp;a new account with the same Hotmail address&nbsp;after 30 days. For now, you will have
 to use the new alias you created. </p>
<p>
</p><p>A&nbsp;POP folder will&nbsp;occur only&nbsp;if you have configured your account through a device or an app with&nbsp;POP3 server settings.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Jesinta Rozario</p>

            <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>hotmail.co.uk was my primary alias, I added another ending outlook.com and changed this to be the primary one but then accidentally deleted the hotmail.co.uk. There doesn't seem to be an option to add an alias with a hotmail.co.uk alias anymore as a way
 of retrieving the original email address, which is basically what I need to do...</p>
<p>so I can log in to the account, I just really need the old account address back as it's the address everyone uses to get in contact with me and I'm currently not receiving any mail due to this as there all bouncing back</p>

            <p>Hi Bob,<br />
<br />
What is the result when accessing these websites directly?<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To access the site directly, you can remove the link checker Facebook has placed on the URL. Refer to the screenshot below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bc54a472-9ef1-44a4-96f8-c0f280381b1f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bc54a472-9ef1-44a4-96f8-c0f280381b1f" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Also, let's perform the additional method below and see if it fixes your issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method: Reset Internet Explorer settings</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Close&nbsp;all&nbsp;Internet&nbsp;Explorer windows. Select the&nbsp;<strong>Tools&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>button, and then select<strong>&nbsp;Internet options</strong>.</li><li>Select the&nbsp;<strong>Advanced&nbsp;</strong>tab, and then select&nbsp;<strong>Reset</strong>.</li><li>In the&nbsp;<strong>Reset Internet&nbsp;Explorer Settings&nbsp;</strong>dialog box, select&nbsp;<strong>Reset</strong>.</li><li>When Internet&nbsp;Explorer finishes applying default settings, select&nbsp;<strong>Close</strong>, and then select&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>.

 it was Slow Ring.</p>
<p>I was on the Slow Ring and wanted to get 10122 so I changed to Fast went to Updates and checked and no update.&nbsp; Went back and looked and was at Slow.&nbsp; Changed to Fast and did not leave the screen for two minutes.&nbsp; Noticed that there was drive activity, went

    <title>Common Problem&#58; Mac Outlook 2011 data file is corrupt. Can&#39;t - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> markmicrosmith  say:</h3>
<h2>            Common Problem&#58;  Mac Outlook 2011 data file is corrupt.  Can&#39;t empty any deleted mail, database won&#39;t repair</h2>
                    Under Mac OS 10.68 using Outlook 2011 the database is corrupt. &nbsp; Cannot delete even one mail from the deleted items folder. &nbsp;The database utility opens and demands a rebuild. &nbsp;But the rebuilt doesn't help. &nbsp; When EXPORTING mail to the desktop, the export
 stops 1/3 of the way and demands a rebuild or the program closes. &nbsp;The program works fine if one leaves the more than 3,000 deleted items in the folder. &nbsp;The database has been rebuilt multiple times without success. &nbsp;Nothing can be deleted from the mail trash
 folder.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Stellar Phoenix has an OLM recovery program &nbsp;http://www.stellarinfo.com/email-repair/outlook-mac-repair.php, but their tech support said that their program only works on an exported file, so Stellar cannot be used. &nbsp;Another support rep said the datafile
 is an OLM file and the program is worth trying.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1. &nbsp;Is the mail database file &nbsp;(222 MB) an OLM file ?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>2. &nbsp;Has anyone used Stellar Phoenix on their data file and it brought success ?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>3. &nbsp;It seems the SP2 update to MSO 2011 is the cause of this lethal corruption. &nbsp;Has anyone tried reinstalling and using MSO 2011 and not updating the program, and if so was that met with success.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>4. &nbsp;Will upgrading the OS 10.68 to 10-.7, 10.8, or 10.9 improve the chances of the database utility fixing this corruption ?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>5. &nbsp;Is the ONLY cure to make a new database and start fresh ? &nbsp;This means that one will have to reassign the default database when wanting to see all the old e-mail.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>6. &nbsp;Is there an application which will export all the e-mail to a single readable and searchable document, thereby one can keep both Outlook and the old mail open and visible.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you.</div>
                </div>

            I do not recommend Stellar Phoenix. I've recovered many&nbsp;Identities for clients after they tried using their recovery tool.
<div><br />
<div>If you have the space you can rebuild u<a href="http://www.officeformachelp.com/2012/11/outlook-rebuild-results-in-folders-named-recovered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">sing the method described here</a>. You might need to buy an external drive to do the recovery. This has worked
 100% of the time for me and I've recovered hundreds of&nbsp;Identities using this method.</div>
<div><br />
<div>BTW,&nbsp;Outlook does not store your data in the&nbsp;database file.&nbsp;It's only an index. Your data is in the Data Records folder.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Many users found that their data under SP1 was corrupt and upgrading to SP 2 failed. Once you rebuild using the method described in the link, you can first try exporting as .olm file that should now be good. THEN if the upgrade process fails, you can use
 the .olm file to import into a new SP2&nbsp;Identity.</div>
<div><br />
<div>NOTE: After upgrading to 14.2.0 IMMEDIATELY upgrade to 14.3.9. Under no circumstances use the 14.2.0&nbsp;Identity.</div>

            Thank you so much. &nbsp; Why would a user want to continue with Outlook 2011 when it's subject to these problems ? &nbsp; Has anyone had corruption with Mac Mail &nbsp;which is free and included in the OS ?
<div><br />
<div>Is the database really the issue ? &nbsp; Suppose one simply downgrades from 14.3.9… will that cause the database to behave ?</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>Is there an application which will export all the e-mail to a single readable and searchable document, thereby one can keep both Outlook and the old mail open and visible.</div>

            Mavericks Mail has issues with Gmail accounts and Exchange accounts. While all email clients have issues, the process to recover is much easier with&nbsp;Apple Mail.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Outlook for Mac is a version 1 product and while it has improved it is not known for stability. We are all hoping the next version is a big improvement.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Downgrading will not help. While you can rebuild under 14.1.0, you do need to upgrade for&nbsp;Outlook's improvements.</div>
<div><br />
<div>There are&nbsp;third party products that will import your mail but there is not a single document option that is searchable.&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            HTC Touch Pro2 - Outlook BCM mobile contacts won&#39;t sync at all</h2>
                    HI,<br />
<br />
I am the proud new owner of an HTC Touch Pro2 (WM 6.1), just upgraded from an HP Ipaq 6915 (WM 5) so screen-wise it's a big improvement :-)
<br />
<br />
I have a laptop running Vista&nbsp; Office 2007 Small Business w BCM, and although I have managed to install BCM Mobile onto my new device (I installed the version for pocket PC, the same as I used on my previous PDA via the sync cetre) the contacts won't sync at
 all; the BCM icon in the laptop's sync centre shows as a little blue &amp; white box (rather than the usual BCM icon) and although I check the box to sync contacts, they just won't &amp; I get an error message so have to uncheck the box again.<br />
<br />
As I bought the Touch Pro2 specifically for business use, I would be gutted if&nbsp;I can't get this to work.&nbsp; I would be really grateful if anyone can suggest how I can try to fix the issue.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.

            Hi kitten1711,<br />
<br />
Congrats on your new phone! I don't use BCM, so I'm not that familiar with it. But here is a link to a thread in another forum. Some of the resources here may be helpful to you.

<br />
<br />
Also, when the error message displays, is there a number associated with it? <br />
<br />
Thanks!

I just wanted to check in to see if you were still having issues. Here is another thread on this forum about BCM contacts and an HTC Touch Pro. Maybe it will help?

<h2>            Sending invitations to events in 24 hour format</h2>
                    My calendar is set to 24 hour clock format but when I send out an invitation to this event (eg for 20.00), this goes out in a 12 hour clock format (eg 08.00pm). It shows as this in my sent mail folder as well as the recipients mail inbox. How can I set
 it so that &nbsp;invitations are sent using the 24 hour clock times?

</p><p>I'll be glad to help you identify the reason why the calendar invitations still appear in 12-hour format even it was set up to 24 hours. It would be very helpful if you could provide us the screenshot of the full page settings where we can see that it was
 set to 24-hour format. </p>

<h2>            Word Scrambling Text and Out Of Memory Error Statements.</h2>
                    <div>
<p><span>For some unknown reason, after some time open, Word scrambles EVERY .docx file that is currently open.</span></p>
<p><span>As an example, the following is the lyrics for the song,
<b>I’ve Never Been To Me. &nbsp;</b>Cut and pasted directly from the corrupted text file:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ꟃ<span>雃</span>Ӡ<span>井罹쑭</span>ƙ<span>奓</span>࿤<span>晜</span>ɹ<span>뵭</span><span>珓</span>๰<span>룃㟧</span><span>냡긲</span><span>ぺ䓰氳</span>ѓ<span>쐖悉䓞</span>*<span>崪溿</span>ᝏ<span>䮨</span>Ƈﲧꕩ<span>挞䥳醟紙포狤</span>꧒<span>候ꔑ鰔烊ᱱ</span><span>窻</span>ᕌꀢ<span>㷸启</span><span>拀䑂</span>௴<span>䧼</span>ㆪ<span>즼抆</span>☉<span>쓱</span>↮<span>叿蛵㾛첐㱌</span>ꏿ<span>頙㍶皩鵑㉿犀䃁</span>Ö<span>䧦ꚩ윍㬢</span>ᒬ<span>捾</span>ἢ<span>朝倹㊚婽椖㜄僜昲</span>ᖒ꫔<span>骘좬椸</span><span>돛Ჰ뽡轂</span><span>餞</span>⯝<span>푞</span><span>泝樤</span>ꠒࠐ೬<span>컺愈䛥卋읛</span>㇫<span>鉦埱긎嗉</span>ӽ<span>丰魯轶</span>├<span>葢咊</span>ꏝ<span>掼騋</span>›<span>㣘</span>ꐛ<span>鷷ヶ</span>ऱ<span>琣驵뼶룈</span><span>㞥䝻擠</span>⡣⏐<span>웸풟뷔蹺窧</span>ꥴᬘ<span>秷圕</span
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<span>Now while the National Security Agency would love to know another encryption algorithm it is a Major Hazard for important text files of mine. &nbsp;Now I long have had a habit of
 saving any and all files after the slightest change. &nbsp;It doesn't matter if it's a change from a period to a comma to an entire paragraph. &nbsp;I finish something I save whatever file I'm working on. &nbsp;Instantly. &nbsp;I have been burned too often by unfinished files
 that weren't saved.</span></p>
<p><span>Now after working on some file I may not come back for a few hours. &nbsp;And it almost always happens: Perfectly legible text scrambles into garbage. &nbsp;ALL Open text files are affected. &nbsp;The smart thing to do
 is to QUIT Word, Force Quit if necessary, and then re-open everybody. &nbsp;This can mean up to Ten (10) text files at a time. &nbsp;And if I hit the SAVE button on something that was scrambled can mean hours of work junked in an instant.</span></p>
<p><span>For a while I wondered if there might be a shortage of free memory.<span>&nbsp;
</span>So I got an app that frees up memory when activated.<span>&nbsp; </span>
+3GB of free memory and text files still get scrambled.<span>&nbsp; </span>Leave ANY text file open long enough and
<b>it will be scrambled</b> when I get back to it.<span>&nbsp; </span>
Granted, the text file doesn’t get turned into hash while I’m working on it, only while left unattended for some unknown amount of time.<span>&nbsp;
</span>But why does leaving a text file unattended cause problems?</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Which bring me to the <b>
Out Of Memory Error</b> problems.</span></p>
<p><span>3BG to 4GB or more of free memory open, three to small to medium spreadsheet files open (largest 125,000 bytes), then it is time to open Word, and get
<b>Out Of Memory Error</b> when opening file(s).<span>&nbsp; </span>I once got the
<b>Out Of Memory Error</b> when I tried to open two Word files immediately after using the Free Memory App.<span>&nbsp;
</span>No other files were open, spreadsheet or text.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Free Memory App shows how much memory I have to work with.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I KNOW there is enough memory to open the files I want to work on.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Seeing the <b>Out Of Memory Error</b> doesn’t make sense.</span></p>
<p><span>When I see the
<b>Out Of Memory Error</b> when I’m opening text files my options are to either to ignore the message, say “Screw You” and continue to open the files if there are no Word files already open, or Quit Word and re-open the previous Text files plus which
 text files is/are about to be opened.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>On occasion when I tell a text file to Save before closing it I get a
<b>Out Of Virtual Memory Error</b>. OK, I probably saved this particular file some time earlier, but saving it again to be safe and I’m out of memory with multiple gigabytes of free memory.</span></p>
<p><span>To quote a song's lyric:&nbsp;<i>What's the buzz? Tell me what's a-happening...</i></span></p>
<p><span>Spreadsheet contents are completely untouched by this error.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And just in case you want to know or compare, the following is the unscrambled text for
<b>I’ve Never Been To Me</b>: </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span><b>I've Never Been To Me</b></span></p>
<p><span>Charlene </span>
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hey lady, you lady, cursing at your life</span></p>
<p><span>You're a discontented mother and a regimented wife</span></p>
<p><span>I've no doubt you dream about the things you'll never do</span></p>
<p><span>But, I wish someone had talked to me</span></p>
<p><span>Like I wanna talk to you.....</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Oh, I've been to Georgia and California and anywhere I could run</span></p>
<p><span>I took the hand of a preacher man and we made love in the sun</span></p>
<p><span>But I ran out of places and friendly faces because I had to be free</span></p>
<p><span>I've been to paradise but I've never been to me</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please lady, please lady, don't just walk away</span></p>
<p><span>'Cause I have this need to tell you why I'm all alone today</span></p>
<p><span>I can see so much of me still living in your eyes</span></p>
<p><span>Won't you share a part of a weary heart that has lived million lies....</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Oh, I've been to Niece and the Isle of Greece while I've sipped champagne on a yacht</span></p>
<p><span>I've moved like Harlow in Monte Carlo and showed 'em what I've got</span></p>
<p><span>I've been undressed by kings and I've seen some things that a woman ain't supposed to see</span></p>
<p><span>I've been to paradise, but I've never been to me</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>(spoken)</span></p>
<p><span>Hey, you know what paradise is?</span></p>
<p><span>It's a lie, a fantasy we create about people and places as we'd like them to be</span></p>
<p><span>But you know what truth is?</span></p>
<p><span>It's that little baby you're holding, it's that man you fought with this morning</span></p>
<p><span>The same one you're going to make love with tonight</span></p>
<p><span>That's truth, that's love......</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Sometimes I've been to crying for unborn children that might have made me complete</span></p>
<p><span>But I took the sweet life, I never knew I'd be bitter from the sweet</span></p>
<p><span>I've spent my life exploring the subtle whoring that costs too much to be free</span></p>
<p><span>Hey lady......</span></p>
<p><span>I've been to paradise, (I've been to paradise)
</span></p>
<p><span>But I've never been to me</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>(I've been to Georgia and California, and anywhere I could run)</span></p>
<p><span>I've been to paradise, never been to me</span></p>
<p><span>(I've been to Neice and the isle of Greece while I've sipped champagne on a yacht)</span></p>
<p><span>I've been to paradise, never been to me</span></p>
<p><span>(I've been to cryin' for unborn children that might have made me complete)</span></p>
<p><span>I've been to paradise, never been to me</span></p>
<p><span>(I've been to Georgia and California, and anywhere I could run)</span></p>
<p><span>I've been to paradise, never been to me.</span></p>

            Hi Uncle Phink:
<div><br />
<div>Know the song well, you don't need to post the lyrics -- just pray I don't start singing it :-)</div>
<div><br />
<div>And that's not encrypted, it's perfect Chinese :-) &nbsp;If you had the fonts you would be able to read it too :-)</div>
<div><br />
<div>From your description, you have a version of the "Asterisks Bug". &nbsp;Which means you haven't updated your software: that bug was fixed in an update about a year ago.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Go to Help&gt;Check for Updates and run that as many times as it takes to tell you that you are fully up-to-date. &nbsp;That should cure it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Come back if it doesn't...</div>
<div><br />
<div>And that's not the original version of the song: the original (which was the second release) contained the line&nbsp;<span>"I've
 been to crying for unborn children that might have made me complete" &nbsp;:-)</span></div>
<div><br />
<div>Cheers</div>

            As well of having a habit of saving files I also have this near fetish of making sure I have the Very Latest version of Web Browsers, and EVERY software update available. 



Normally I use my Mac's Internal drive for day to day work.  But come Friday Afternoon I go looking for the latest updates for Everything.  Then I reboot to an External drive that holds a slightly different OS.  When I get there the first thing I do is look for software updates for everybody.  The second thing I do is copy all the text and spreadsheet files to multiple thumb drives.  Third thing is copy new **** to different thumb drives. ;^) 



I updated Office last weekend.  Just double checked: 



There are no updates available for your Microsoft software at this time.  Please check again later. 



The ball is in Your court again. 


And I'll check the lyrics of the song again. 



Unk

<h3> mc916  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook Mac 2011 reply to HTML email doesn&#39;t include original text, reply to plain text does</h2>
                    <p>Since installing Office 2011 with the latest updates, in Outlook 2011 connected to Exchange 2010 when I reply to an HTML email it does not include the original text. If I reply to a plain text email it does include the original text. Both HTML and plain
 text&nbsp; replies honor the setting chosen under Outlook/Preferences/Email/Compose/Attribution of original message which controls whether to display From To Subject Date when replying. I also tried the feature where you only select some text then hit reply and
 it's supposed to insert just the hightlighted text but it's also blank. I have already tried a complete uninstall following a Microsoft document. I've also tried multiple email accounts and identities. This worked in Entourage. Any suggestions appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Mark</p>

            Have you tested in a new Identity? I'm assuming you imported your Identity from Entourage. Imported data can sometimes bring over problems. Any data that is under "On My Computer" can be exported as .olm file and imported into the new Identity.<br />
<br />
Reinstalling rarely fixes issues like you are describing.<br />
<br />
If testing in a new Identity fails, test in a new User.<br />
<br />
CREATE A NEW USER<br />
<br />
Go to System Preferences&nbsp; &gt;&nbsp; Create a New User in Accounts (Users &amp; Groups). Switch to the New User by logging out under the Apple in the Menu bar or use Fast User Switching.
<br />
<br />
Do you still see the issue?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If yes, then the problem is with your base files.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If no, then the problem is in your User's folder.<br />

            <p>Sorry for the delay in getting back to you. Thanks for the suggestions but unfortunately we are still having the problem. We had previously tried&nbsp;a new identity numerous times. Today we tried a new Apple&nbsp;User which caused me to create a new identity and
 we have the same problem. So to me this points to as you say "your base files"&nbsp;When you say "base files"&nbsp;are you referring to OS files or Office files? If Office files I have already tried a complete uninstall then reinstall&nbsp;following&nbsp;this

<p><span>From the description of your post I see that you are facing issues with Internet Explorer performance.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To understand the issue better I want to ask you few questions:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Is the overall performance of your computer is slow or it is confined to Internet explorer 8?</span>
</li><li><span>Which operating system is installed on the computer?</span> </li><li><span>When you say “pages redirecting when searching" what exactly are you referring to? Is the issue confined to a website?</span>
</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Please get back with more information so that we can assist you better.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I have provided you suggestion for both overall slow performance of the computer (Windows) and slow performance in Internet explorer.</span></p>
