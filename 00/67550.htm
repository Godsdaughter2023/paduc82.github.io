    <title>Windows 10 Update will not install ANY new updates. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Update will not install ANY new updates.</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>I really need some help here, I am not overly savvy with computers but I have spent my fair share troubleshooting and fixing them. This however, is driving me insane and quite frankly angry beyond belief. Windows 10 refuses to update past the original update
 that was installed with my OS. This is stopping me from using it for a new piece of hardware and honestly is making me regret going with a Microsoft OS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple days ago it was just a problem installing them, the updates would restart and then on restart I would be notified of a failed install. Okay. So I spent several hours trouble shooting that with resets, log deletion. Nothing. I then went on to run
 the Windows Media Creation Tool. Low and Behold, not only did it fail the rollback of the reset and waste another couple of hours of downloading and installing, it now displays there are no updates for windows available. Hence a manual installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really need someone to give me a hand here.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please answer the following questions so that we can help you.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to check if the services responsible for Windows update is running. Refer to these steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>Windows key +R</strong>, type “<strong>services.msc</strong>”</span></li><li><span>Locate the <strong>BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer </strong>and the <strong>
Windows Update Services</strong> and check if it is running.</span></li><li><span>If not, right click on the service and click start to start the service.</span></li></ol>

    <title>Strange Parental Controll Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fear avarice  say:</h3>
<h2>            Strange Parental Controll Issues</h2>
                    
<p>After the most recent Xbox Live update, I have been unable to access user-generated content on any of my games. (i.e. Forza Motorsport 4 and Halo: Reach)</p>

<p>I get this message: "This privilege has been blocked via your Xbox LIVE parental control settings." I, however, do not have parental controls set on my console.</p>

<p>I have tried everything to correct this problem personally, and I'm stumped. Any suggestions or solutions would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>The parental controls for this wouldn't be on your console but will be on your online safety or online privacy settings.</p>

                    <span>
<p>This problem is getting ridiculous. &nbsp;My CD/DVD drive has been on and off appearing and disappearing over the last few weeks. &nbsp;I've tried the registry hack of removing upper and lower limits and it seemed to work once but after a while the drive disappears
 again, sometimes after sleep mode and sometimes spontaneously. &nbsp;Rebooting used to clear up the problem for a while, but now the drive seems permanently gone. &nbsp;I've uninstalled iTunes and Nero since I saw they may have caused issues. &nbsp;I can't use device manager
 because the device isn't listed, so no way to update drivers. &nbsp;I'm at the point now where there isn't much more information that I've found from Microsoft or other sources, if anyone has had this issue or knows something else I can try to get Vista to recognize
 the drive I'd really appreciate. &nbsp;Thanks!</p>

<br />
After the above :<br />
<br />
Try this - Control Panel - Device Manager - CD/DVD - double click the device - Driver's Tab - click<br />
Update Drivers (this will likely do nothing) - then RIGHT CLICK the drive - UNINSTALL - REBOOT
<br />
this will refresh the default driver stack. <strong>Even if drive is not shown&nbsp;continue below.<br />
</strong><br />
Then work your way through these - remember the drive could be bad, could have a loose cable or<br />
slight corrosion on the contacts (usually for a laptop) and other issues.<br />

Another possibility is that the cables are loose. Remove ALL power, then check cables in both<br />
ends. Remove and replace, do not just snug. For laptops you can often clean the power and<br />
<br />
Some DVD&nbsp;drives do not use the Windows default drivers so check with the System maker and<br />
device maker to see if there is firmware or drivers for you drive if needed.<br />
<br />
Hope these help.<br />

<h3> rearrange  say:</h3>
<h2>            Realtek high definition audio &#40;onboard&#41; not recognizing rear panel speakers. static from right speaker.</h2>
                    Realtek high definition audio (onboard ASUS CG5270) -current driver v6.0.1.6043<br />
OS: Win7 64bit<br />
<br />
Everything worked great untill last week. I had not made any changes and the update logs did not show any updates.<br />
<br />
Issue:<br />
Using "Realtek HD Audio Manager" in the control panel.<br />
The back panel is not showing any speakers connected. (Tested speakers and working on other systems.)<br />
No sound at all until I disabled front panel jack detection. Now I get sound threw the rear speakers but with static at 1/2 volume, no mute, and the "Realtek HD Audio Manager" still shows no rear panel speakers.<br />
<br />
Things I've Tryed: <br />
<ol>
<li>checking connections (cleaning connections) </li><li>different speakers. </li><li>uninstalling drivers and software. </li><li>updating drivers. </li><li>Rolling back drivers. </li><li>System restore. </li></ol>
<br />
Note: the "Realtek HD Audio Manager" shows the digital connection and front panel as available but has faded out the rear panel even though the rear panel are the only jacks in use.<br />
<br />
I can usually solve these problems on my own and this is the first time I've used a forum to ask for assistance in 15 years. I'm just stumped.<br />

<p><span>Hi Rearrange,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Since you have tried almost everything to fix the issue, I would like you to check if the rear speakers are disabled and if the volume
 level is fine. <span>&nbsp;</span>To do this, follow the steps below.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Click on Start.</span>
</li><li><span>Click on Control panel and click on Sound.</span>
</li><li><span>Playback tab click on the speakers and click on properties.
</span></li><li><span>Click on Level tab and check if the rear input is set to mute and uncheck it.</span>
</li><li><span>Select the level to 100% and check if the rear speaker works fine.</span>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also you may try to
</span><span>disable enhancements and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>To
</span><span>disable enhancements:</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Access Control Panel</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click Sound</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select Playback tab</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select Speakers/Headphones entry</span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click Properties</span></p>
<p><span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select Enhancements Tab</span></p>
<p><span><span>7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Disable all enhancements</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the above steps do not work, you may contact the mother board manufacturer and try to reset the BIOS to default settings and check
 if it helps. Also you may take their assistance and try to update BIOS and check if it helps.
</span></p>

    <title>The total paging file size for all disk drives may be somewhat larger - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            The total paging file size for all disk drives may be somewhat larger than the size you specified.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Paging File&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed an SSD on my system and moved the paging file from the system to a standard drive on D:. &nbsp;The SSD is 256GB with 222GB usable. &nbsp;Drive D: 2 1TB drives setup as one Raid 0,1 with 2 drives. &nbsp;After moving the paging file, I receive this error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows created a temporary paging file on your computer because of a problem that occured with your paging file configuration when you started your computer. &nbsp;The total paging file size for all disk drives may be somewhat larger than the size you specified.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I receive this error and when I click OK, it brings up the Performance Options screen showing that a 1280MB paging file has been created but does not specify which drive it was created on. &nbsp;I receive this same error message even when I have selected "No
 Paging File" for all drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted MS Support to ask them and the individual I talked to on chat would only tell me I had corrupted files and almost insisted that I buy support for the year at $149, &nbsp;I asked him if I still had support from the purchase of windows 8 and he said
 yes, then immediately went into his buy the assurance spiel. &nbsp;I would sure like to find a resolution to this problem without being pressured into buying something I am not sure I need, let alone be able to afford.</p>

            There are no wildcard options in regedit.exe. You would have to write a script (e.g. a VBScript) that goes through the subkeys of the
<em>Classes</em> key, examining each of them for the existence of the <em>xMenu</em> subkey. Using the "find" function is probably much faster than writing and debugging such a script.

    <title>I need to figure out why computer keeps crashing. please help. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thunder_ruler  say:</h3>
<h2>            I need to figure out why computer keeps crashing. please help.</h2>
                    <p>Ok, so i'm having some problems with my pc. I recently been having some bad luck with it, and I need to know which part of it is bad before I can fix it. So the problem I have is that, after I play a demanding game, for some reason videos, and certain programs
 start lagging and stuttering. I know that this is related to using all my power towards the game, instead of the video, however when I close the game completely I still have the same problem. Sometimes the computer becomes unstable, and just crashes,
<strong>shuts off</strong>, or stops responding for some time, and then just freezes. Most of these are without warning and are very unexpected and not wanted.
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">There are times where it gets so stuck, that pressing the power buttons doesn't work, and I need to use the mother board reset button.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now there is a lot more to this than meets the eye. There are times that I don't do anything demanding on my computer, like watching youtube while doing work. The computer will just shut off, or freeze without warning, No lag, no stuttering, nothing. Something
 i find strange about this is that when I turn back on my computer sometimes it will freeze during boot, and i will need to reset. There are times where im playing something on flash, and the computer will just shtoff right away, rebot by itself uncessecfully,
 and i will need to reset the computer 1-2 times before it goes back to normal. Rarely it will give me a blue screen
<strong>with a "</strong><strong>whea_uncorrectable_error&nbsp;"</strong><strong>, </strong>
and sometimes it will boot normally again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that you know those to main problems, here it the biggest one of them all. I recently replaced my PNY GTX 650 GPU, with a EVGA GTX 570 GPU simply because it actually performed better, and allowed multiple monitors. I never had any major problems with
 the computer before except it crashing when I played games for a long time which is most likely because of overheating, since I have a liquid cooler now. After I switched Gpu's I started noticing that videos tended to stutter and lag. I figured out that this
 is a common problem with the GTX 570, and that many people from the day it came out where having this problem, but nobody mentioned that the GPU would stutter after playing games or crash while doing nothing demanding. So does anyone know what may be causing
 this? I dint have this lag when I originally got this GPU until about 2 weeks later. So that leads me to think that I may be the GPU or not but i would like to know what i happening first before i go around replacing things, and reinstalling windows. Im not
 sure if it windows that is having the problem, or my hardware, I try not to reinstall windows since I need to use my computer most of the time and don't want to reinstall everything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My rig is a costom built pc with an:</p>
<p>AMD FX 8350</p>
<p>16GB ram</p>
<p>2TB of stoage</p>
<p>GTX 570 and GTX 650 (as a dedicated physx)</p>
<p>750W PSU</p>
<p>and no overheating problems.</p>

<h2>            How can I make the scroll bar wider as I could in XP&#63;  </h2>
                    In XP, I could&nbsp; right click the desktop, click on Properties, click on Appearance tab, click on "Advanced" and modify the width of the scroll bar for all windows.&nbsp; I think I had a similar experience in Vista.&nbsp; It is not available in Personalize, nor in
 Ease of Access.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
A wider scroll bar makes working with a stylus on a resistive touch screen or with an active digitizer easier to manipulate.&nbsp;

<h2>            deleted slui.exe &#38; slui.exe.mui &#61;&#62; Bluescreen</h2>
                    <p>Hello everybody,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I trnasphered a windows 7 licenc from my old Laptop, which was updated to windows 8 by the time I transphered the licenc to another PC. By that time win 10 has already been released so I created an installation stick and installed win 10 on my new PC.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything went well till one day annoying messages started to appear that i have to insert my licenc key. I did so but it told my that it would not be a valid one.
</p>
<p>One day it started sending pop up messages. Ok, I guess i had to buy a new one, but that's not what I did...</p>
<p>Insted I googled and figured I'd just delete the slui.exe and slui.exe.mui which are bot located in Windows\system32. the slui.exe.mui was located in an another folder which I don't remember the name of anymore.
</p>
<p>Well, after I deleted both of them, nothing happend. And then I restared my PC and since that Moment he only shows me a blue screen when ever I try to start it up.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be more precice about the error: PC boots, Motherboard mark shows up &gt; the windows logo shows up and a loading cycle appeares loading for about 20 seconds &gt; sad smili appeares and it says that there is a problem on my compuer and it will get restarted
 now &gt; restarts &gt; motherboard logo &gt; loading cycle appears and it says "Auto repair is starting" under it then it says "auto diagnosis of PC starts" &gt; Blue screen telling me my PC did not get started correctly with 2 options to choose: Restart (starts everything
 from the beginning and it goes on for ever) or Further Options Where I can reset my PC, open a CMD and other stuff like that.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2 things to know: 1. my PC is set to german so the translations might not be perfect.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Never had problems with that PC before, Windows installed on a SSD.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please tell what I'm supposed to do to not loose everything. Could I prevent data from beeing lost by simply unplugging my HDD and reinstalling Windows after that? Because thas's what I would have done if that Forum didn't exist</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Clemens, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the information that you’ve provided, deleting slui.exe is not advisable. Slui.exe is an important part of Windows. It is used when activating the operating system. To recover your Windows 10, we recommend that you perform an in-place upgrade using
 an ISO file to repair any broken system file while keeping your personal files, settings and installed applications.
<span>To do this, click this <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-perform-a-repair-upgrade-using-the-windows/35160fbe-9352-4e70-9887-f40096ec3085">

<p>Hi Wolf,<br />
<br />
Sorry to hear about the game troubles. Sounds pretty frustrating. Let's see what we can do to get things sorted.
<br />
<br />
I would suggest starting out by running through our <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/disc-drive/disc-unreadable-error-games-on-demand" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
"The disc is unreadable" Error</a> support article.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Let us know how that goes, or if you have anymore questions. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How to mantain Internet Explorer running on the background while the screen is locked&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi! So, I own a Surface.... yey! kind of....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since Microsoft App Store refuses to give us&nbsp;Pandora, Youtube and other needed apps, the only way to use these pages is through Internet Explorer....&nbsp;</p>
<p>(in my opinion, they do this so that someone uses Internet Explorer)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now ok, I've accepted that! I've look for the pages I need and have pin them to the Start..... So, problem solved?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NO.... The screen, if you don't touch anything or move the cursor or something, it automatically locks itself after a while..... and the music and the videos just stop playing.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, when I go to Internet Options, I can't find anything to repair this. In change PC settings neither... In Personalize, where it says Lock Screen Apps, it gives you the option of choosing 'the apps to run in the background.....', but Internet Explorer
 is not available for this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now someone, anyone.... tell me how this is possible!!! How can I leave Pandora running or a 1hour YouTube video running?</p>
<p>What are my options?</p>
<p>1. Setting the tablet to not discontinue or stop the use of internet explorer when the screen is locked... Is that even possible?</p>
<p>2. Setting the tablet to not auto lock the screen when I am using certain Apps, like Internet Explorer (again probably not possible)</p>
<p>3. Magically the App Store makes available Youtube Pandora Facebook and other needed apps (pfffff apparently not going to happen)</p>
<p>4. Whatever have worked for you guys.... Any Suggestions?!?!?!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are just little things that have made the use of my Surface annoying, impractical and incompetent.... It's sad when smartphones can be more useful and practical than my Surface..... really really sad. This just comes from someone who wants this to
 work efficiently and favorable for the customer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank You for reading, for helping, for posting and for understanding, I hope I'm not the only one with this problem!!!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you tell us a little more about this situation? For example, when you leave Internet Explorer to play, is the device plugged in or running on battery?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the way, the Google app in the Windows RT Store has YouTube included within it as an app (Google Maps is included too, Google Search and several other Google apps).

<p>You might try PRadio in the Store:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PRadio is a third party Pandora Internet Radio Modern App for Windows 8.&nbsp; It allows users to stream music from Pandora recommendation service in the background.

            Amen Brother. My iPod has more capabilities than my surface. I have Pandora playing in the background as we speak, but I couldn't tell you how. By trying several different things, (top left explorer, split left or right-duplicate tab etc.) No single method
 works twice). I suggest taking it back to where you bought it and have them give a demonstration if they can. I am taking mine back to upgrade.

            <p>I finally got the updates to work, after more than 2 dozen failures since July &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The key for me was to finally spend the time to run the DISM tool as mentioned in some of the references -
</p>
<p>after running the update troubleshooter for the umpteenth time, </p>
<p>and running that SFC command as administrator: sfc /scannow</p>
<p>and stopping and starting the various services needed,</p>
<p>and then running the DISM command: Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth</p>
<p>after previously renaming that software directory,</p>
<p>downloading the complete update I needed and running that offline,</p>
<p>and generally seeing another half dozen update failures again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When that DISM command was successful, </p>
<p>I then had to rerun the update program, wait a while for that to finish; </p>
<p>then I had to do the restart - which also took a while to complete.</p>
<p>These final steps - after DISM worked - took a bit more than an hour - install the update and restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But getting to the point where I could try using DISM had me trying most of the non-working solutions being offered here over the last few days; no one at MS is disclosing the known windows update bug in the windows 10 build 1511 or whatever the heck they
 call the one I was using. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes DISM even reports things wrong when everything is OK; and the windows update troubleshooter doesn't care if it corrects things with corrupted files, it just dos that over and over. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck; best I can say is that this will help you learn about the many weaknesses of Windows 10 and maybe help you get better prepared for the next big failure you will encounter using Windows 10.</p>

<p>I'm having trouble redeeming an xbox live trail code. After I enter it, it says it's valid but after I click submit it says "something went wrong" and won't activate. What's going on? Screenshots below...<br />

<p>I used the BlinkBox App on Saturday 16th November to rent 'Monsters University'. I used part of a £10 credit for Blinkbox, and my BlinkBox account now correctly says I have £6.51 left in my account.</p>
<p>Somehow I have been charged by&nbsp;Microsoft for the&nbsp;same amount&nbsp;today (20th November) for the same film. I have not watched the film again since Sunday 17th. As I understand it, I could watch the film for 48 hours after I started watching.</p>

<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>@oldskoolTiger blinkbox on the Xbox seems to work a little differently from any of their other apps. I think payments are taken by Microsoft rather than blinkbox themselves. This might explain why you can't use blinkbox credit (unless you buy a movie on
 another device) and why you might be charged for purchases you've made directly on your console.</p>

    <title>Win 7&#47;64 Ultimate Backup &#38; Restore gives this error&#58; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xb77  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 7&#47;64 Ultimate Backup &#38; Restore gives this error&#58; 0x800704B3</h2>
                    <p>Backup and Restore (B&amp;R) used to work without this problem. It hasn't for some time, and I don't know of any precipitating change. Here is what happens:</p>
<p>When attempting to run at scheduled time, B&amp;R bombs giving this error: 0x800704B3. It will not run after re-attempting. The target drive is a NAS on my LAN and all are connected via ethernet (no wirless issues). I can access the drives, folders (including
 Backup &amp; Restore's folders) using any other program on the computer (Word, WordPerfect, Excel, Explorer, etc.) except Backup &amp; Restore. If I open the B&amp;R folders before attempting to run B&amp;R--just to make sure the computer has access, and that the NAS is "hot,"
 it doesn't make any difference. The one exception that allows B&amp;R to run a backup is if I do a restart and immediately run B&amp;S--then it works!</p>
<p>But why would B&amp;R not have authorization when everything else does, except immediately after a restart? So now I am only running backups manually (no automatic schedule) after a restart and wondering if I will be even able to do a restore if ever needed.
 My B&amp;R routine includes both a system image and some file/folder backups FWIW--MS default choices. There is no capacity issue. I do not have any other issues, networking or otherwise. The machines are clean and haven't been infected. AV and FW don't have any
 effect. (This is happening on two Win 7/64 Ultimate machines--exact same symtoms, same LAN, same NAS.) I am thinking that it is a B&amp;R issue, but can't find any reference to it. MS doesn't seem to support B&amp;R or trying to find answer in B&amp;R threads hasn't yielded
 anything.</p>
<p>Because this seems to be a B&amp;R issue, but is giving a networking error, I have posted it to both System Repair &amp; Recovery and Networking, Mail and Getting Online--oops, [edit] the System Repair &amp; Recovery post has been deleted, I guess by admins?</p>

            <p>Event Viewer Reports</p>
<p>1. Normally when an error occurs on your computer looking in Event Viewer should be your starting point for finding a solution. Most system
 related errors are logged and getting an exact copy of the relevant report is important. Unfortunately understanding the reports is not easy and most computer users need help with their interpretation. I have more to say later on interpretation.</p>
<p>2. Event Viewer comprises three main Windows logs. These are Application, Security and System. For troubleshooting purposes System is
 by far the most important.</p>
<p>3. To access the System log select Start, Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Event Viewer, from the list in the left side of the window
 select Windows Logs and System. Place the cursor on System, right click and select Filter Current Log. Check the box before Error and click on OK and you see only Error reports. Click on the Date and Time Column Header to sort. You may need to click a second
 time to see the latest Report at the top. </p>
<p>4. A tip for posting copies of Error Reports! Run Event Viewer and double click on the error you want to copy. Select the Details tab
 and check the box before XML View. Click on the Copy button to place a copy on your Clipboard and close Event Viewer. Now start your message and paste into the body of the message. Make sure this is the first paste after exiting from Event Viewer.</p>
<p>5. There are three types of Report, being Information, Warning and Error reports. In most situations it is Error Reports that offer the
 best information but occasionally Warning Reports provide useful clues. </p>
<p>6. All reports have date and time stamps and when troubleshooting it is important to concentrate on more recent reports. Study reports
 since the point when the computer was last booted and then check whether a similar report appeared in the previous session. If errors do not repeat investigation as to why they occurred is wasted effort.</p>
<p>7. Within individual reports the more important information is Event ID and Source as these help when looking for help on the internet.

<h2>            Windows 10 Pro - PowerCFG Hibernate TYPE&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello All!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I noticed something new in Windows 10 Pro Powercfg command line options... I was messing around trying to shrink my Hiberfil size and noticed these options:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6bb52903-47d5-4777-ad11-739ff635d679" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to reduce the Hiberfil size to about 1.5 GB....</p>
<p>
</p><p>The hiberfile size has been set to: 1693499392 bytes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now my issue is that my ASUS S451LN runs Instant On software... For some reason after I upgraded to an SSD (Samsung 840 - 250 GB) I run into Deep S3 Standby &amp; Hibernation problems ONLY WHEN ON DC Power... The battery runs down extremely fast when I put it
 to sleep... Now on AC power it only enters "Normal" S3 Standby... And there is no battery drain compared to Battery Mode... Even if I'm on High Performance mode... Is their a direct relationship between Deep S3 Sleep and AC/DC power???
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what I get with "Reduced" Hiberfil type:</p>
<p>
</p><div>C:\Windows\system32&gt;powercfg /a<br />
The following sleep states are available on this system:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standby (S3)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fast Startup</div>

<div>The following sleep states are not available on this system:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standby (S1)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The system firmware does not support this standby state.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standby (S2)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The system firmware does not support this standby state.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hibernate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hiberfile type does not support hibernation.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standby (S0 Low Power Idle)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The system firmware does not support this standby state.</div>

<div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hybrid Sleep<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hibernation is not available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate any and all input with my question... I have looked all over the web and haven't come across anything having to do with Hibernate "TYPE"...</p>
</div>
<p />
                </div>

            <p>***UPDATE***</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hace been digging a little deeper concerning my battery &amp; standby issue... It seems that turning off hibernation right before unplugging the AC adapter then turning hibernation back on after unplugging AC adapter temporarily fixed that problem... Adding
 that I too discovered that ASUS notebooks don't play nice with "Fast Startup" just like some ASUS motherboards... I have since turned it off...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I'm still standing by for an explanation about the newly discovered "Hiberfil TYPE" "Reduced | Full"</p>

<h2>            Updates</h2>
                    <p>Why are we having updates like Plays.tv enforced on to my desktop it overwrites everything on my computer I am a adult in my 60s don't need games or childish software or even better software that my desktop cannot run because I do not have the hardware needed,
 over the last year my desktop hard-drive is filling up with software I don't want or need and unable to uninstall, if it is not apart of the OS system it should be a option to download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been with Microsoft since Windows 3.1 then XP, Vista, 8.1, and now Ten, I was looking forward to Windows Ten and now I regret using it, compulsory updates of non relevant software, I will have to make a choice Windows Ten or Apple desktop. ps If I
 could DELETE plays. tv permanently from my desktop I would. but it uploads every time I start Edge.</p>

            Hi Peter,
<br />
<br />Plays.TV is not part of Windows and must have come down through another source, most likely with AMD Display device drivers . .. 
<br />
<br />You should uninstall Plays.TV from your system:
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App (gear icon on your STart Menu)
<br />
<br />Go to Apps
<br />
<br />See if Plays.TV is listed in the list of installed Apps
<br />
<br />If so, uninstall that from there
<br />
<br />
<br />If that is not listed, open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Program Files\PlaysTV\
<br />
<br />Double click uninstall.exe to uninstall that app
<br />
<br />
<br />Finally if none of the above works for you, click the link below to download a troubleshooter form Microsoft that can be used to uninstall apps that do not appear in the list or stubborn apps

            <p>Hello Korabii,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We regret the inconvenience. Let me assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ntoskrnl.exe and&nbsp;nvlddmkm.sys&nbsp;are both termed to be System process. The issue you are facing might be caused if the related drivers (graphics)&nbsp;stop responding or if a&nbsp;task fails to manipulate system resources,&nbsp;thereby triggering a system reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before we proceed further, let us know a few more details on the below questions.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>What is the make and model of the PCs you are using?</li><li>Did you check if you have installed the latest drivers for all the devices installed in your PC?</li><li>Does the issue pertain to the particular application/software you are referring to?</li><li>Do you see significant memory usage before PC reboots?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>As an initial recommendation, I suggest you to b<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">oot the computer in safe mode with networking, and&nbsp;check if the issue still persists.&nbsp;This is a diagnostic step towards identifying&nbsp;and isolating the possible cause/s of the issue.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Safe Mode With Networking:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Safe mode is a troubleshooting option for Windows that starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started. The words
<strong><span>Safe Mode</span></strong> appear in the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode you're using.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Refer: <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Start your PC in safe

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><em>Note: </em>The application may or may not run in Safe Mode environment, as it is subject to&nbsp;driver dependencies.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If&nbsp;the PC works normally without rebooting, use the following steps to disable automatic restart in Windows&nbsp;on system failure, (if).</span></p>
<ol>
<li>At "<span>Start</span>" -&gt; "<span>This PC</span>" --&gt; right click on "<span>Properties</span>", and then tap "<span>Advanced system settings</span>".</li><li>In Advanced, click&nbsp;on "<span>Settings</span>" for Startup and Recovery.</li><li>In the Startup and Recovery window, <strong>uncheck the Automatically restart</strong> check box.</li><li>Click OK.</li><li>
<div>Now if the computer generates an error, it should not automatically restart </div>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If the above does not apply, refer to the below methods and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">To eliminate potentially unwanted software, including rootkits, you can run the Windows Defender Offline in your PC if the active Windows firewall is unable
 to remove the threats.</span></p>

    <title>Virus protection for Windows 10...any free&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kimleese  say:</h3>
<h2>            Virus protection for Windows 10...any free&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm new to Windows and virus concerns...a Mac user from way back, never really had to be concerned about this problem. Got my HP laptop a few months back, installed Windows 10 and now my free Macafee is running out. I would like to know if there's anything
 out there for Windows 10 that's free and reliable, understanding of course that the OS is new and limited to software let alone free!!! Any help would be greatly appreciated,</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Kim</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Defender is included with Windows and helps protect your PC against <span>
malware</span> (malicious software). Malware consists of viruses, spyware, and other potentially unwanted software. Malware can infect your PC without your knowledge: it might install itself from an email message, when you connect to the Internet, or when you
 install certain apps using a USB flash drive, CD, DVD, or other removable media. Some malware can also be programmed to run at unexpected times, not only when it's installed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Defender helps keep malware from infecting your PC in two ways:</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Providing real-time protection</span>. Windows Defender notifies you and blocks malware that tries to install itself or run on your PC. It also notifies you when apps try to change important settings.</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Providing anytime scanning options</span>. Windows Defender automatically scans your PC for installed malware on a regular basis, but you can also start a scan whenever you want. Windows Defender automatically quarantines or removes anything that's
 detected during a scan. For more info about how to scan your PC using Windows Defender, see
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/how-find-remove-virus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</li></ul>
<p>When you use Windows Defender, it's important to have up-to-date definitions. Definitions are files that act like an ever-growing encyclopedia of potential software threats. Windows Defender uses definitions to detect any malware and to notify you of potential
 risks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To help keep your definitions up to date, Windows Defender checks online for updated definitions before scanning your PC. You can use Windows Update to automatically download and install new definitions as soon as they're released.
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-update-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><div>
<p><strong>To open Windows Defender </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Type Windows Defender in search bar and click it</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> If you’re using a PC at work, your IT admin might be using another security program and turn off Windows Defender.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Links provided above can be applicable for Windows 10 as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

<h2>            Dishonored Definitive Edition has the wrong language</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just pre-ordered Dishonored 2 and got the prequel Dishonored Definitive Edition for free. I pr-ordered it in the german store because im German. But after downloading it the language is English. But my console has Germany as location and German as language.
 But the game is English. Why is that so? It´s annoying. Can somebody help me with that issue?</p>
