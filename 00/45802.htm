<h2>            Computer died when installing update, stuck on certain screen</h2>
                    I was installing an update, and my laptop died while it was installing, so it was restoring windows to a previous version, which also got stuck so I force shut down. After this, it did a disk scan and repair, which then took me to a &nbsp;screen that says "Please
 Wait" where it gets stuck, leaving me unable to do anything.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To clear an event log by using Event Viewer, here's what you can do.</p>
<p>1. Open Event Viewer.<br />
2. In the console tree, navigate to the event log you want to clear. <br />
3.&nbsp;On the Action menu, click Clear Log.<br />
4. You can either clear the event log or save a copy of the event log and then clear it.<br />
-&nbsp; To clear the event log without saving: Click Clear.<br />
-&nbsp; To clear the event log after saving: Click Save and Clear, type a name for the saved file in File name on the Save As dialog box and click Save.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information is helpful. If you have any concerns, please do let us know.</p>

            <p>i was looking to do the same myself today. i am able to individually clear event logs but i noticed the administrative error reporting and warning logs were still there and there was no clear option in the action drop down. then i remembered something..
 when you do a disck cleanup it locates all temp files and junk data, tells you the amount of space its taking up and ask if you want to clean... &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/delete-files-using-disk-cleanup#delete-files-using-disk-cleanup=windows-8<br />
</p>
<p>*when you get to that page you will see:&nbsp;</p>

</p><div style="color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1)">

<p>
</p><p>click the arrow to the far right and you can choose your operating system. Follow the instruction for each operating system and once you get to the popup box illustrated below be sure to select system files then ok; this action will take you to a similar
 looking box but here you will see &nbsp;error reporting files. check all boxes then ok.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Finally, to prevent having to ever do this again, you can disable the error reporting logs as well as all others. Just google "disable error reporting (your system) " follow the link and instructions.</p>

 keeps getting selected.</p>

<h3> jarrady  say:</h3>
<h2>            Teredo Tunneling Psuedo Interface adapter network , with an IP address, appeared in my Norton 360 full scan results yesterday for the first time ever.</h2>
                    I have 64k Pro version with SP-1. I have been running this system for 6 months and run a Norton full scan every time I use it. Is this something I should be concerned about? Could it be some kind hack? Also I installed Windows update KB 3022345 yesterday
 which does some kind of reporting to Microsoft, could this be source of the new network? I am not comfortable not knowing why it is there. Any help will be appreciated.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>Hi,</p><p><br /></p><p>No, unfortunately that isn't possible.&nbsp; The&nbsp;reason for this is that for backwards compatibility to be achieved, &nbsp;Xbox 360 games have to be&nbsp;reverse engineered and then recompiled by the BC team.&nbsp; This is why even when you have a 360&nbsp;BC game on disc, you still need to download it from Xbox Live.&nbsp; The 'update' is the game.&nbsp;<br /><br />If you still have your Xbox 360, you can transfer your save games to the cloud and continue where you left off on your Xbox One.&nbsp;But, games must be downloaded again from Xbox Live.</p>

<h2>            Windows Shuts Down Unexpectedly</h2>
                    <p>I am running Windows 8.1 on a HP Pavilion 23 all-in-one unit. Have been a good little Windows user and done all the updates recommended. About a week ago, I noticed that my unit would completely shut down, no warning, just shut down. It only occurs when

</p><p>Hi Russell, </p>
<p>
</p><p>A possible software conflict is a possible reason why you're Windows is shutting down automatically. I recommend to perform a clean boot in your Windows computer. This will help eliminate software conflicts that occur when a program or update has been installed.
 Do this by clicking this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<em><strong>support link</strong></em></a>, this link has been helpful to a lot of Community members who had the same issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also run System Maintenance troubleshooter.<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key + W</strong> and type <strong>troubleshooting</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>View all</strong> on the top left corner.</li><li>Run System <strong>Maintenance troubleshooter</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Another troubleshooting step to consider is to use Microsoft easy fix solutions. This easy fix solution helps in solving software issues. It was previously known as Microsoft Fix It. Click this

<p>I had done all of the above suggested steps previous to contacting this forum. Wife reminded me of the good old msconfig.exe utility. Ran that, stopped a bunch of programs through Task Manager, stopped more through the msconfig directly, and problem is mostly
 solved. Only&nbsp; a few minor glitches, which we should be able to figure out.</p>

<h2>            Normal &#40;not connected&#41; Standby mode possible&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I do not want to use the connected standby mode, as in many cases the login (Windows hello) takes painful long. I tried a lot, but nothing fixes this problem. I disabled connected standby in registry (csenabled --&gt; 0). Now windows hello works very fast.
 But the sleep modes is gone, only hibernation is available. Is there any option to enable the normal standby mode again? (That works so well on most notebooks?) I do not understand, why this is not the standard case.</p>

</p><p>Thank you for the excellent process for checking my Windows 10 Operating System. &nbsp;Unfortunately I have not found the problem and I have not been able to load a new program that I need. &nbsp;I renamed my ati video file, removed and updated Java, did the Clean
 Boot and did your System Check for corrupted files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please keep posting, if there are any files on my computer for you to review, I would be happy to send them. &nbsp;The program I am trying to load is Garmin Basecamp so I can communicate to my GPS devices.</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the make and model of the computer? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ideally the catalyst control should be showing up in task manager. This issue normally occurs when the graphics driver is corrupted and needs to be repaired.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Catalyst Control Center is the managing software of the graphics driver, since you are getting error message from the computer, I would have uninstalled all the related software of catalyst and reinstall from the manufacturer website.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information helps. </p>

<p>Are you sure that Gamertag does not have auto-renewel on it?<br />
<br />
If you reported this to your bank then really they should have frozen your bank account and credit card. I would suggest calling or meeting with them again to have this done if you think someone else is using your details. But I would also ring Xbox Support
 in the link the above poster has provided so they can remove access from this person, if that is the case. I would also ask them first if the gamertag has Auto-Renewel on it incase that may be the cause.<br />
<br />
The last time that gamertag was online was 23/04/2012, so it may be a cause of someone else using it. So again, contact your bank and have your credit card details frozen and immediatley ring Xbox Support and tell them what is happening.</p>

            Windows Media center can detect your device and it is also scanning the channels and audio is there , only issue i faced was that it makes My PC slow .
<div><br />
<div>If you are using TVHome Media 2 on windows 8 , you need to run it with the compatibility option (Run as Windows 7) with Admin permissions. &nbsp;You can Scan , and watch but there is no audio . Here is the
<b>good news</b> . If you <b>click on Record Button Audio will work</b> . I know it is not the solution, but that's all i can offer.</div>
<div><br />
<div>good luck</div>

<p>The Dany u 2000 usb tv is not shown on the Windows Compatibility Center and so I think it is not compatible with Windows 8.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Vista won&#39;t boot without the PLOP Boot Manager CD as I needed this - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> saif ahmed 777  say:</h3>
<h2>            Vista won&#39;t boot without the PLOP Boot Manager CD as I needed this to install Ubuntu from a USB</h2>
                    So I had Ubuntu 12.04 on a USB to install, and I thought I'd use the PLOP boot manager in a CD form to boot from there since it's an old computer. &nbsp;I used the plpbt.iso for the CD. I had a Partition already set as 20GB for Ubuntu. It was in NTFS format
 which I thought was ok. I booted successfully to the Ubuntu environment, I &nbsp;chose the Partition choice as I wanted Ubuntu to be installed In Drive F while Vista had Drive C. I chose Ext4 for the drive (I thought it would be more faster then NTFS) then it installed
 fully. &nbsp;I wasn't too sure about roots so I gave it the '/' Sign.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Once I took out the PLOP Boot manager CD, I rebooted it and then some GRUB rescue command comes up because I don't have the CD. Also my CD drive is a bit weird as the CD Tray doesn't eject sometimes. If I can put in the CD, PLOP Boot Manager comes up and
 I can boot into Vista from the HDD1 Drive Partition choice. But I can't Boot into Ubuntu... &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I went into Vista and I looked on the 'My computer' screen and Ubuntu's drive doesn't appear there.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I would appreciate it if you could help me, thanks for reading.&nbsp;</div>

<p><span>Safe mode starts Windows with a limited set of files and
drivers. Startup programs do not run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers needed to start Windows are installed.</span></p>
<p><span>Safe mode is useful for troubleshooting problems with programs and drivers that might not start correctly, or that might prevent Windows from starting correctly. If
 a problem does not reappear when you start in safe mode, you can eliminate the

<ol>
<li><span>Remove all floppy disks, CDs, and DVDs from your computer, and then restart your computer.
</span></li></ol>
<p><span>Click the Start button
, click the arrow next to the Lock button
, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Do one of the following:
</span>
<ul>
<li><span>If your computer has a single operating system installed, repeatedly press the F8 key as your computer restarts. You need to press F8 before the Windows logo appears.
 If the Windows logo appears, you will need to try again.</span> </li><li><span>If your computer has more than one operating system, use the arrow keys to highlight the operating system you want to start in safe mode, and then press F8.</span></li></ul>
</li><li><span>On the Advanced Boot Options screen, use the arrow keys to highlight the safe mode option you want, and then press ENTER. For more information about options, see

<p><span>When your computer is in safe mode, you'll see the words Safe Mode in the corners of the display. To exit safe mode, restart your computer and let Windows start normally.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Advanced startup options (including safe mode)</span></b></p>
<p><span>The Advanced Boot Options menu lets you start Windows in advanced troubleshooting modes. You can access the menu by turning on your computer and pressing the F8 key

<p><span>Some options, such as safe mode, start Windows in a limited state, where only the bare essentials are started. If a problem does not reappear when you start in safe

<p><span>Creates a file, ntbtlog.txt, that lists all the
drivers that are installed during startup and that might be useful for advanced troubleshooting.</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;Enable

<p><b><span>To reinstall Windows</span></b></p>
<p><span>If you want to reinstall Windows with a clean installation—possibly to restore the default Windows settings—here's how to do it. (If you're having a problem with Windows,
 first see What to do if Windows won't start correctly, which explains how to use the Windows installation disc to fix problems without completely reinstalling Windows.)</span></p>
<p><b><span>Warning</span></b></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Back up your files before you begin reinstalling Windows, even if you're reinstalling Windows on a hard disk partition. A clean installation replaces the current
 version of Windows and also erases all personal files.</span></li></ul>
<ol>
<li><span>Turn on your computer, insert the Windows&nbsp;Vista DVD or CD, and then restart your computer. If you are asked to press a key to start (or "boot") from DVD or CD, press
 any key. When the Install Windows page appears, go to step 2.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>If the Install Windows page does not appear and you're not asked to press a key to start from a CD or DVD, you might have to specify that your computer use its
 DVD or CD drive as the startup device. This means that you need to set the DVD or CD drive to the first startup device in the basic input/output system (BIOS). To learn how to do this, see
Start Windows from a CD or DVD. After you have selected your DVD or CD drive as the startup device, restart your computer, and then start Windows from the installation DVD or CD as previously described.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>On the Install Windows page, follow any instructions that might appear, and then click Install now.</span>
</li><li><span>On the Get important updates for installation page, we recommend getting the latest updates to help ensure a successful installation and help protect your computer
 against security threats. You will need an Internet connection to get installation updates.</span>
</li><li><span>On the Type your product key for activation page, we strongly recommend that you type your 25-character product key to help avoid problems during activation.
</span></li><li><span>On the Please read the license terms page, if you accept the license terms, click I accept the license terms.</span>
</li><li><span>Follow the instructions on each page. On the Which type of installation do you want? page, click Custom.</span>
</li><li><span>On the Where do you want to install Windows? page, click Drive options (advanced). Select the partition where you want to install Windows, and then click Format.

</p><p>It seems I am not alone in experiencing critical failures when playing (or saving) games on my xBox One X. I keep getting the error message to delete my local saves, but doing so doesn’t resolve the issue. Gah! Now my machine is crashing every 30 mins, no
 matter what game I play. About to bin it off and get a PS4 (unless &nbsp;anyone knows a fix for it?) / Microsoft have been of no help :( - more details see link below. HELP!!</p>

    <title>Lost emails after moving them to a different folder - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Lost emails after moving them to a different folder</h2>
                    <p>I move email to any one of my folders but when I go to a particular folder only current emails are displayed. &nbsp;What happened to ones I moved over months ago? &nbsp;Is there a limit to how many emails you can store in a folder? &nbsp; If so, how do I go about doing
 something with those emails so I don't lose them in the future. &nbsp;I am a bit of a novice here, never had this kind of a problem with outlook. &nbsp;Thanks.

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. It seems that you don't get to view the emails that you have transferred to the&nbsp;other folders, correct? If so, then we would be needing a few details from you to further isolate this issue. Kindly answer the
 following questions below:</p>
<ul>
<li>May I know if you are using Windows Live Mail to access your account? Or are you using Microsoft Office Outlook?</li><li>What account is configured in your mail client? Is it a Microsoft account? </li><li>if you have a Microsoft account, do you also encounter the same issue when you view your account via
<a href="https://mail.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://mail.live.com</a>?</li></ul>
<p>We'll wait for your response.</p>

            <div>Hi Glenda:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Maybe I was not clear.&nbsp; What happens is when I move a message from in box <br />
to one of my folders, that works.&nbsp; But after a time all of the older messages I <br />
had moved are no longer there.&nbsp; For instance in my HOA folder I have been moving <br />
messages into that folder since Nov of last year but when I click on the folder, <br />
as of today, the oldest saved message is dated 3/21/14.&nbsp; This happens with all <br />
of my folders so I no longer have the tracking of old messages that I thought <br />
would stay in the folder.</div>
<div>I do use WML to access my account.</div>
<div>My two accounts are gmail and outlook</div>
<div>I don’t use mail.live.&nbsp; Should I use that instead of WLM?&nbsp; I do not like <br />
WLM but I lost Outlook Express when they converted to WLM and have never been <br />
happy about that.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thanks</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting us back here in Microsoft community. I do apologize for the delayed response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are using Windows Live Mail and the emails that you have moved from one folder are missing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you configured your Outlook.com account to sync, meaning you use the automatic configuration, emails and folders will be the same as what you have on the web. If this is where you're losing the emails, you need to check if these emails are on your account
 when you access it via web browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I see that you are using 2 accounts. For us to provide the correct resolution:</p>
<ul>
<li>I need to clarify on what account are those emails missing?</li><li>How did you configure this account in your Windows Live Mail?</li><li>Where is the folder where you moved your emails to? Is it under the Storage folder in Windows Live Mail?</li></ul>
<p>Looking forward to your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi Sundog,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards the "One Touch Management Software Ver 2.3.3", you need to contact the diabetic monitor company that made it and ask them if there is an updated version of the software for Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is no new version of the software then you need to either return to your old version of Windows or buy a brand new monitor and software and I'm guessing their not cheap.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry that's your only options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>

<p>Hello Jamiebate113,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on the Xbox forums. We began our keyboard and mouse support with very few games that support these features. We are adding this feature to more games over time with the help of the developers. The developers help by approving the feature
 on their game, and updating the game's settings to modify this feature. As of this moment, we do not have any indication that
<a href="http://www.pubg.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Player's Unknown Battleground</a> will utilize this feature. The best option will be to reach out to the support team of the developer for any more information. We hope this helps!</p>

<h2>            openCL.dll and opencl.dll corrupted in &#34;store&#34;&#63; ONE month of fails.</h2>
                    <p>I've been ONE month trying to install W10.</p>
<p>Fail, fail, fail, with multiple issues all the way from MS not updating the AMD SMbus, and several other drivers, to repeated crashes doing regular things like playing a simple game.</p>
<p>I'm not a programmer. I read many 'solutions' to opencl.dll corruptions, and they are ALL network related and require degrees in something I don't have.</p>
<p>It's just a darn upgrade, why does it fail continuously?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've managed to clear most errors up, but... </p>
<p>I still get "Could not reproject corrupted file [l:23 ml:24]"\??\C:\WINDOWS\SysWOW64"\[l:10]"opencl.dll"; source file in store is also corrupted" running something called sfc. I get several errors on this file all the time.</p>
<p>I also get errors involving ntdll.dll, which I read is a graphics-related nvidia issue that MS has not addressed, it says the file isn't there, but there are at least six instances of it on my C: drive, and none show up at bad in the sfc.</p>
<p>I read how you need to 'mount' something somewhere and do all kinds of esoteric stuff I am not qualified to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This last attempt, I installed W7pro, installed the 'malicous software' thing, authenticated and upgraded to W10. Ran of a few hours and hasn't run since, crashing on anything graphic.</p>
<p>Yes, I have checked and validate all devices, swapped all devices (including a newly formatted C: drive 1TB.SATA2, reversed the memory, swapped out the graphic card, optimized/safe settings in CMOS, 4 different monitors, etc. Each time drivers were updated
 and the install verified with that sfc thing, that ALWAYS reports every damn copy of opencl is corrupted.</p>
<p>I'm at my wit's end.</p>
<p>Ideas? Thx.</p>

            <p>Do not take opencll corruption seriously.the reason why windows reports it corrupt because it gets replaced by the 3rd party Driver software-Nvidia in your case and windows thinks that the stock file has lost its integrity.</p>
<p>So summary is, opencl.dll isn't corrupt, it is just a false note.</p>
<p>Where does the installation stops?any error codes?</p>

            <p>Thx.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is 'fully' installed, but won't stay stable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's an example, since this game gives a error log, it said&nbsp;it can't find the expected dll's in the proper/respective/expected (and really, actually there) folders: ntdll.dll, kernel32.dll (!), nvd3dum.dll, sysmain.dll.</p>
<p>All these files exist in the proper places and passed the sfc scan.</p>
<p>I ran it again and still the opencl.dll, but you say ignore.</p>
<p>OK, I also get an occassional kernal fatal error, not always the same one.</p>
<p>I've tried low settings on graphics.</p>
<p>I rolled the nvidia drivers back to359.06, which is I believe released on 12/1, before my issues started.</p>
<p>I installed them custom and as a fresh install.</p>
<p>Setting graphics to high crashes sooner than set to low mostly, but I can't get even an older game like Pirates! to run for very long.</p>
<p>Also if I work with PAINT.net it will crash. Also if I move a lot of images between folders, it will crash.
</p>
<p>It's a MSI 970 Gaming ms-7693, AMD Phenom II 8 core 3.5 GHz, 4GB DDR3 matched RAM, EVA nVidia GTX 750 TI 2GB, Dual monitors, SATA2s. W10 pro.</p>
<p>Thanks again for any thoughts.</p>

            <p>I lied; it's actually been since 11/15/15 I tried to install W7pro on a new motherboard, an MSI. After two and one half months I've determined the board is to blame. There is no other explanation. Anything to do with graphic calls and the system crashes,
 in many different ways, for a Multitude of reasons, never the same one twice, nor in the same place, and often with different results; sometimes a hard crash, sometimes the program closes, sometimes it even starts up again; other times it won't even reboot,
 or needs to restore or as I said a multitude of reasons/consequences. MSI 970 gaming MB - I'd have to say avoid them, based on this nightmare.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Close this, as there is no good info here for others whose errors may be similar, but for different reasons. I've learned a lot about how W10 works and that makes me madder, as all I want to do is USE it, not FIX it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>W10 is the most robust OS yet, in terms of recovery ability; if only it could have said "Bad MB! Dump it!"</p>

            <p>Dear All I am frustrated with the Dell and will never buy any pc of Dell. Other PC manufacturer are making driver for their earlier model where as dell did not even provided the driver for windows 8/8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>However there frustration does not help so I have installed bluetooth driver in windows 10 for my dell inspiron 15R N5010 but whenever I turn it off its gone and requires again installation. Therefore my device bluetooth is in on mode since I installed it.
 I think we don't have proper driver for windows 10/8.1 64 bit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However if some one wants to install the driver like I did then you need to follow this.</p>
<p>First find the dell driver resource DVD and try to install Bluetooth software 365 by assuming that it wont install.</p>
<p>After getting the error message go to the following location:</p>
<p>C:\dell\drivers\R273948\Win64</p>
<p>I had extracted the driver package in C drive.</p>
<p>Then double click on Inst and your bluetooth driver will get installed.</p>
<p>If you dont have dell driver DVD click on the link below to download from dell site.</p>

Yes Ruth Buruga. I have installed every update in my pc. In my laptop installed bluetooth device is manufactured by Broadcom and we were using dell wireless 365 bluetooth driver version 12.0.0.8047&nbsp;in windows 7 which does not support windows 10. Please suggest
 what we should do in this situation where I have successfully installed the driver of bluetooth but when I turn it off the bluetooth icon from taskbar and from settings went away and does not come back unless I reinstall this driver.
