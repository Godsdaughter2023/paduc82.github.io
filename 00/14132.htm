<h2>            Outlook 2003 continues to crash, even in safe mode</h2>
                    Outlook 2003 continues to crash, even in safe mode.&nbsp; Problems seemed to begin when I added an external hard drive running continuous back up of all user files.&nbsp; So I disconnected the external drive but the "not responding" issue continues.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
In safe mode, Outlook will run normally for a while, then stop responding.&nbsp; After a few moments, it starts again on its own for a couple of minutes before crashing again.&nbsp; Weird and frustrating.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I'm wondering of uninstalling and reinstalling the program would solve the problem?&nbsp; Maybe a corrupt file someplace?&nbsp; Thing is, I've already used all my licenses so I don't think I'd be able to reinstall off the disk.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Any ideas?&nbsp; I'd appreciate any suggestions.&nbsp; I'd rather not shell out the $$ to purchase a newer version if I can avoid it.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I'm using Outlook 2003 SP3 with MS Word as my editor on Windows 7 Home Premium SP1, 64-bit with 16GB of RAM.&nbsp; My .pst file is nearly 2.2GB.

            <p>When you say safe mode do you mean windows safe mode or by using the Outlook safe switch?</p>
<p>Have you used Office Diagnostics (Detect/Repair)</p>
<p>The office licence, for a retail version, is for two working devices and not two installs.</p>
<p>Uninstall/Reinstall rarely cures anything that an office repair wont cure, and when outlook is reinstalled it uses the origonal profile, which could allways be part of the problem.</p>
<p>Have you run the inbox repair tool, scanpst.exe, against your data files, with OL closed? Run it again if it finds/corrects errors, until it finds no errors.
<a href="http://www.howto-outlook.com/faq/aboutpst.htm#scanpst" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howto-outlook.com/faq/aboutpst.htm#scanpst</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Outook requires full read/write access to the pst files, opening OL immediately sets the pst files as modified, even if no data is written. Depending what continuous backup program you used that may have impacted upon the pst files.</p>

<h2>            Trying to connect... Disconnected - Outlook</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok. Here's the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trying to connect to my work Outlook account. While I'm at the office at work on WIFI Outlook keeps repeating the "trying to connect... disconnected" notifications at the bottom right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I use a wired connection at work it connects just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I use WIFI at home it connects just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nobody else in my office is having this issue over WIFI and I'm unable to utilize a wired connection where I am.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further to this, I have run the Office 365 Support program and it's trying to tell me that my domain name is not registered... which doesn't make any sense if you read the above information. Apparently it's only unregistered when I'm on WIFI at my work office?
 Doesn't make sense to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            The AutoShapes collection has both "Brackets" and "Braces." The Bracket has an adjustment handle that allows you to change the shape from round (parenthesis) to angular (square bracket). The Brace is a curly bracket; it has two adjustment handles for changing
 the shape. Both can be sized both vertically and horizontally. If you want something that neither of these provides, can you provide a reference to a visual example?

            <p>Hi. Do you still have the same issue?&nbsp;If yes, does this also happen with other Lumia phones? Have you tried using another USB cable, port and even PC to isolate the issue? Make sure that you're using an admin access and all firewall&nbsp;&amp; antivirus programs
 have been disabled. You can also try rebooting the 2 devices. Keep us posted.</p>

<br />
Rebuild Basics:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Do Not Rebuild Identities with Exchange and IMAP accounts. Delete the accounts (this deletes the cache files in Entourage). Do the rebuild then add back accounts. Better yet start over in a new Identity.</li><li>Make sure you have plenty of free space on your drive. <a href="http://www.officeformachelp.com/2007/09/rebuilding_a_damaged_database_that_exceeded_size_limit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

</li><li>Rebuilding does not fix all issues. It can make some problems worse. Even though the Database Utility will make a backup, I advise making a copy in the Finder first.</li><li>You can delete the rebuild version after you are satisfied with the results.

<h2>            Nokia 8600 &#43; PC Suite&#63;&#63; Helpppp</h2>
                    Hey all,<br />
Ive been searchin for awhile and can't come up with any reason why this is doing this...<br />
Basically i downloaded pc suite but I can't seem to connect the phone to it.<br />
If I plug the data cable in you get 3 options appear on the phone.. Mass storage, webcam or COM Port, I thought ok it should be mass storage or com port, click on mas storgae and the phone says "No storage for PC". If you click on COM port it doesn't seem to
 do anything.<br />
If I try connecting the PC Suite it simply doesn't connect to the phone, it just stays in the connecting screen for ages???<br />
Also I've noticed the memory is under 1meg.. is that correct? That means you can't store a single audio file on the phone basically? I can't believe that could be right!<br />
Ive read through and it seems nobody else has these issues.. anyone help with whats going on its abit frustrating.

            I do not have 8600, but it sounds a bit strange it says COM port as one of the alternatives. Do you have the right cable:<br />

There seems to be only 128 MB inbuilt memory, no possibility for external memory card.<br />

<br />
YOu can try to remove phone battery for a moment and then restart phone and try again.<br />
<br />
Also, check from settings, if there is option for USB settings to see if playing around with those would make a difference

            i just bought an 8600 luna today and it's also china made. i have the same problem. There seem to be block with the phone...i can use explorer to open the internal memory but when clicking the refreshing button several times, every file seem to disappear
 from explorer, but my computer still show a detection from the phone. i have to unplug the micro usb and plug it back to see the files in the memory for about 2 minutes.

            Well, I ended up buying another 8600(made in Korea). That one works as expected. I think all the china ones that you get from ebay or whatever is fake. I tried running the IME on the original I had they couldn't find it. Yeah sorry to burst your bubble.
 I was pretty dissapointed myself.

            Hi, your phone is a "Cect" nokia clone from china.<br />
Pc suite will not recognise it.<br />
Just use the usb mass storage option when you plug it in the Pc to transfer data or music.<br />
Create new folders in the phone's applications folder and you can transfer whatever you want!<br />
Believe me it works<br />
Good luck!

            Hi,<br />
When you switch the phone on , it writes WELCOME then NOKIA.<br />
If you look carefully across the word NOKIA it writes the word "CECT" -which is the brand name for the Chinese version of Nokia 8600-,<br />
in very small letters.<br />

<h2>            Syncing Hotmail calendar to Android Phone</h2>
                    <p>I have Samsung Galaxy A3 running Android OS&nbsp;Version 5.0.2</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Microsoft Outlook app installed and am using it to sync to my Hotmail.&nbsp; My email address ends in @Hotmail.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>My emails and contacts are syncing. Email sync happens automatically each time I open the Outlook app on the phone</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;have contacts sync disabled but sync it manually myself via Settings and that works fine<br />
<br />
My calendar is not syncing in sense that i not getting pop up reminders on the phone for appointments in my calendar even though i have set the Reminder option when i created them in hotmail on laptop</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see the appointments/events in the calendar in the OUtlook app on the Phone but am not getting any reminders
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have reviewed the article at <a href="https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/Sync-calendar-and-contacts-with-my-phone-or-tablet-8479d764-b9f5-4fff-ba88-edd7c265df9f?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-IE&amp;ad=IE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe I am setup correctly</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the phone I have in the Outlook for Android app, &nbsp;in the calendar section, &nbsp;in the setting section, &nbsp;have set calander to notify me 1 hour before the event and 1 week notification before an all day event</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have set the sound option on and also the vibrate option<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However I am not getting either email reminders or pop up reminders on my android phone in advance of the calendar event/appointment even though I have set notification options on</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used to have a Windows Phone and I used to get pop up reminders on the phone for appointment in my Hotmail calendar</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I still doing something wrong or is this not supported on Outlook for Android on Android Phone</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;My phone is a Samsung Galaxy A3 running Android version 5.0.2</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts re what i need to do to enable this or is this possible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks </p>

                    I have form called EdReports. This form allows the end user to select the course and the beginning data and ending date. This produces a report that shows which employees have taken the selected course within the parameters of the beginning and ending
 date. The form has the following controls:<br />
Combo Box on form: name cboCourse<br />
unbound control on form: name BegDate<br />
unbound control on form: name EndDate<br />
Combo Box on form: name cboName<br />
Combo Box on form: name cboDepartment<br />

Check Box : name&nbsp; EmptyFlag&nbsp; (which allows the report to generate with empty date values as well)<br />
<br />
The Report is called rptCourse<br />
<br />
<br />
SQL is<br />
SELECT Attendance.CourseNumber, Employees.FirstName, Employees.LastName, Attendance.Attended, Attendance.DateAttended, DepartmentData.Title, Department.Department<br />

            There is no built-in function to do this. The controls will dissapear after a while by themselves. If you still want to remove them manually, however, you can download and use the app

    <title>Calculation bug - starting a formula with a plus sign&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> engibay  say:</h3>
<h2>            Calculation bug - starting a formula with a plus sign&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I found a similar bug this thread here that was never resolved, however, now have more details with regards to how to reproduce the bug:<br />
</p>
<p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-excel/excel-2010-a-formula-starting-with-and-a-decimal/df4a2456-e682-42af-8a46-da271466f303<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Essentially, the problem arises when the number format of the cell is "Currency" and a user tries to start a formula with a + sign and divide with a decimal in the denominator.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For example, if one tries to enter, without quotes, "+10/1.5" in a cell that is formatted as "Currency", it returns an error. However, "=10/1.5" works fine.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, excel automatically calculates and hard-codes the result to fractions when the formula is started with a plus sign and the cell format is currency. For example, "+10/5" would return a hardcoded "2", however, "=10/5" would retain its original
 formula formatting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can somebody please tell me whether this is a bug, and whether there is a workaround to this problem? It is much more convenient to start formulas with + than with = when working consistently with the number-pad.<br />
<br />
Many thanks.</p>

<li>Select File &gt; Options.</li><li>Click Advanced.</li><li>Scroll all the way down to the section 'Lotus compatibility settings for'.</li><li>Tick the check boxes 'Transition formula evaluation' and 'Transition formula entry'.</li><li>Click OK.</li></ul>
<p>You can now enter +10/1.5 and have it converted to the formula =10/1.5, whether the cell is formatted as Currency or not.</p>

<p>I have just the same problem. Settings are done and o.k, the cable also shoud be o.k. ... - but neither picture nor sound on my TV-Sets... No idea what there could be wrong...</p>
<p>Can anybody help?</p>
<p>And above all: Who has tested the TV-out of a Nokia X6 16 GB -&gt; successfully? If anybody has - with an original Nokia TV-out cable or another cable ("Vivanco" etc. ...)?</p>

<p>In my Telephone-settings -&gt; accessories -&gt; PAL ist activated and that is&nbsp;&nbsp;correct - for my region resp. country (Austria) as far as I know... ?!&nbsp; But I will try -&gt; NTSC too&nbsp;in the evening...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So once again: Has anybody tested an X6 with a TV-out cable - may be with a cable that is not an original Nokia CA-75U...?!</p>

<p>It looks I have the same issue.</p>
<p>I've just bought a cable. A compable one, but the cable is just 4 wires.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My TV detect composit video signal, when I connect the phone. I have stable picture, but the screen rests black. If I change PAL to NTSC (my TV supports also NTSC), the screen becomes dark-gray. For other TV-out parameters modification, the picture blinks
 once and I have again stable black (or dark-gray) screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sound is OK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The phone is bought in France.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please, answer if you find a solution or manage to compare the reason of the issue.</p>

            They start ignoring you and say they will be with you in a sec - kidding.
<br />
<br />Skype can only do conference calls, so, the person you are chatting with, would not be able to do that while chatting with you.

<p>All I get are apologetic error messages.&nbsp; This is not huge issue as this is a spare computer.&nbsp; But ask me if I would try Windows 10 on my desktop or my other laptop.&nbsp; Not if you paid me to.&nbsp; I need an OS that actually functions.&nbsp; And just for the record
 I used the technical preview of 8.1 on this same laptop and did not have anywhere near the problems I am having with 10.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a Windows fan and I actually like 8.1.&nbsp; But Windows 10 is, for me, a nightmare.&nbsp; I will stick with it to the end because as I said this is a spare computer so the fact that Windows 10 does not work properly really doesn't matter much and I am not someone
 who likes to be defeated by my computer.&nbsp; Trouble is from what I am reading in the forums many others have given up and gone back to 8.1 or the lovely bulletproof 7.&nbsp; Do you really think these people are going to give 10 another try?</p>

            <p>What I am finding particularly disturbing is that it now seems a group of inexperienced Support Engineer trainees&nbsp;have been unleashed on this forum, armed with no knowledge of Windows 10 other than a few prepared scripts that get copied and pasted seemingly
 at random as answers to questions posted here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try to ignore the unhelpful cut-and-paste replies, hopefully someone who understands the issue will help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The closest thing I have seen to what you are describing is a popup I've seen occasionally, saying my Microsoft Account needs attention, taking me to a webpage at Microsoft that showed my transaction history or some other useless information, but there didn't
 appear to be anything else affected. So I think what you are seeing is probably something else.</p>

            I have experienced problems with accessing the Windows Store (beta), the Insider Hub, and the Feedback app since the 10041 build was installed.&nbsp; I am now using the 10121 build and that added the problems with Spartan.&nbsp; What makes you think that going backwards
 to 10074 build will solve any of these issues?&nbsp; I would like to know before I do another clean install (I have already reinstalled twice and refreshed once).&nbsp; Will that really make a difference or should I just wait for the next build?&nbsp; I have run the system
 check as advised and it says my installation is fine.&nbsp; The odd thing is that my programs like iTunes and Picasa work just fine.&nbsp; It's only the Microsoft apps that give me trouble.<br />

            Thank you for the suggestion.&nbsp; I tried this and of course it did not work either.&nbsp; Nothing does.&nbsp; I have wiped my laptop clean 3 times and reinstalled various builds of this very much less than useable Windows 10 operating system.&nbsp; I seriously fear that
 this God awful "upgrade" may be Microsoft's undoing.&nbsp; If I owned stock in the company I would sell it before this horror is unleashed on the general public.&nbsp;&nbsp; Free or not it is a disaster!<br />

    <title>Removing Office, re-install and activation problem - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Removing Office, re-install and activation problem</h2>
                    <p>I work at an overseas (relative to North America)&nbsp;location,&nbsp; The computer that I have at the base has Office ProPlus 2010 installed but appears that it never was activated&nbsp;&nbsp; At first opening of any office file the dialogue box opens for the 'Microsoft Activation
 Wizard', which I believe starts to show after a period of time after initial installation.&nbsp; But I cannot find any activation key or original software disk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I purchased and downloaded a new program (same version)&nbsp;and have the key provided.&nbsp; I uninstalled the original installation and installed the new.&nbsp; However the very same dialogue box immediately opened that seemed to be part of the initial install.</p>
<p>I uninstalled again, and tried to purge everything that I could via the registry and installed again the newly downloaded program.&nbsp; Still the same dialogue box and when I try to enter the key it responds that the key is not valid for that installation.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I believe that the dialogue box that is opening is vestigial from the original install that was never activated because I believe that on a new install the activation notice does not display for some period of days.</p>
<p>How can I do a clean enough uninstall so that all traces are removed to accept the new install with its activation key.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>2nd part of question, if I were to upgrade to 2013 with 'home &amp; business 2013',&nbsp;what would I expect,
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>thanks</p>

Yes I did purchase a download version and received a key.&nbsp; And I had already tried the 'manual' removal as per your referenced link, although some parts of the instructions created some uncertainty as to whether they were referring to a 'next step' or continuing
 with sub-keys of the initial instruction.</p>
<p>I will give that process&nbsp;another attempt.&nbsp; </p>

            Yes, every Office installation allows a trial period. If it is not explicitly a trial installation the trial period is typically limited to 25 "starts" of Office programs.<br />

Try using the "Fix It" in the following tip to uninstall 2010.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
<div>
KB 290301 Uninstall Office 2010
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/290301" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/290301</span></a><span>&nbsp;
</span><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">2010</span><b> If you have 64-bit windows, download the tools to your HD before running them
</b>(make copy of your NORMAL.DOTM, EXCEL.XLSM, and for 2010 QAT: Excel.officeui and Word.officeui if you have done any customization).<span>&nbsp;
</span><br />
<br />
</p>
<p><b>NOTE</b>: 2 people have said that the Fix It in method 2 would not run in Windows 8.</p>
<p>Method 2 in this tip does a more thorough job that the “normal” uninstall via Programs and Features (aka Method 1 in the tip). The Normal uninstall is designed with the assumption that you will be re-installing Office. It does NOT delete
 everything. It leaves configuration files like NORMAL.DOTM and other templates etc. and it also leaves configuration Registry entries. These “carry-overs” may contain corruption that is causing your problem.</p>
<p>Method 1: Uninstall from Control Panel</p>
<p>Method 2: Uninstall using Fix it 9737366</p>
<p>Method 3: Uninstall with the Program Install and Uninstall troubleshooter
</p>
<p>Method 4: Remove manually</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>If uninstall of Click to Run Office does not work:</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Start run window: &lt;Win<span> </span>R&gt;</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Start Services dialog: services.msc</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Locate ‘Client Virtualization”</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Right click, select Properties.</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Set Startup type to disabled and Stop the service.</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Repeat FIX IT from KB 290301</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<br />
<br />
Boot the computer.<br />
<br />
Go into Programs and Features to see if there is still a copy of Office 2010 installed. If there is, uninstall it all.<br />
<br />
Then use the manual technique described in the tip to check for any remnants of Office, and get rid of them too.<br />
<br />
Boot the computer again.<br />
<br />
Try installing again.<br />

What do you want to know about the differences in 2013.&nbsp; You can download the 365 Home Premium trial free for a month.&nbsp; That will show you the differences.<br />
<br />
Essentially 2013 is functionally the same as 2010.&nbsp; There is more skydrive integration, and a few other new features, but not much.&nbsp; On the downside (in the opinion of many people) is the new very degraded User Interface. The colors have been wiped out of the
 application background color schemes and the icons have been dumbed down to work on a small smartphone screen (ye, even on the PC version).&nbsp; Here are some screen capture comparisons of the 2003-2013 user interface<br />

<p style="margin-left: 0">
Deactivating Office leaves the Office applications on your PC in read-only mode, which means that you can view documents but can’t create new documents, edit, or save them. To remove Office applications completely, you must uninstall Office from your computer
 using your PC’s Control Panel. </p>

<p>Office On Demand “portability &lt;snip from Office 365 FAQ&gt;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/preview/en/faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>What is Office on Demand?<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Office on Demand lets you use Office applications on PCs you did not install Office on, for example a PC in the library, at a business center, or one that you borrowed from a friend. The applications are “streamed”
 nearly instantly to the PC without being permanently installed on it. Once you log off the PC, the applications and documents are no longer available to other users of that PC. You can use Office on Demand on a PC that is connected to the Internet and running
 Win7 or later. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/preview/en/faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>How do I use Office on Demand?<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If you installed the Office 365 Home Premium Preview, you can create a new document using Office on Demand by going to
<a href="http://officepreview.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>www.officepreview.microsoft.com</span></a>, signing in with your Microsoft account and then, on the MY OFFICE tab, clicking Create New for the application you want to use. You will
 be able to start working on your new document within seconds—even before the streaming of all features is complete. You can also access existing documents using Office on Demand either from
<a href="http://officepreview.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>www.officepreview.microsoft.com</span></a> or from SkyDrive. Just sign in with your Microsoft account and open the document you want to work in. The document will initially open in
 its Web App, but you can open it in the full application from the Web App. <br />
<br />
If you installed the Preview version of Office 365 Small Business Premium or Office 365 Enterprise, you can use Office on Demand by logging into your account at
<a href="http://www.office365.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>www.office365.com</span></a> on a PC that doesn’t have Office installed. Then, go to SharePoint and open the file you want to work on, selecting the option to edit the document in its application.
</p>
<p>&lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p>Office 2013’s Touch Mode makes visual elements in Office a little more widely spaced to in theory make them easier to use on a touch screen</p>
<p><b><span>Office 2013 Account pane: </span>
</b><span>The Account pane shows all the online services (Microsoft and otherwise) currently connected to your copy of Office. Additional services at this time include LinkedIn, Flickr, and YouTube.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Recent locations: </span></b><span>When you switch to the File tab and elect to open a document, you’re given not only a list of recently opened documents but a list of locations (folders, network paths)
 where documents were recently opened. If you’re constantly squirrelling around in the same directories for different files, this is a godsend.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Full Screen View</span></b><span> -

</span></p>
<p><b>Office Telemetry:</b> This will collect reports from all Office clients and monitor all PCs with Office 2013, sending administrators information about client performance, files used, and customizations applied. Collect migration-oriented
 information on Office 2003, 2007, and 2010 clients.</p>
<p><b>Click-to-Run:</b> This capability is designed for network-based installations, such as for remote clients. Microsoft says it has been enhanced to
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj219427%28v=office.15%29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>allow large enterprise deployments</span></a>.</p>
<p><b>Office-on-Demand:</b> This option provides a single Office application on demand to users when they need it.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The Office application is streamed to the PC but is not permanently installed. &lt;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/preview/en/faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/office/preview/en/faq</a>&gt;</p>
<p><b>Metro Look</b>: Note the flatness of the Office Ribbon in Word 2013 (above) versus its predecessor in Word 2010. Much of Office’s eye candy, including three-dimensional elements<span>&nbsp;
</span>(following link has comparison screenshots<span>&nbsp; </span><a href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/galleries/software/productivity_apps/240003864?pgno=4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.informationweek.com/news/galleries/software/productivity_apps/240003864?pgno=4</span></a>
 ) Personally I don’t like it. Metro looks like it is designed by a kindergarten kid. Big fat icons, simple flat icons (vs 3D shading, many colors), upper case tabs (in ribbon), wider spacing.<span>&nbsp;
</span>All of these “downgrades” in the UI are due to need to support touch and smaller device<span>&nbsp;
</span>screens.</p>
<p>Office 2013 as a whole is a significant update to the apps you know and love – across the board, we’ve done a ton of work to ensure this version is:</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Integrated tightly into the cloud, allowing you to easily keep all of your content (and the apps themselves) accessible everywhere&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>At home on Win8 with a refreshed, Metro-style look/feel, that still feels familiar to both novice and advanced Word users</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Tailored for both keyboard/mouse and pen/touch, enabling you to be productive on all of your devices</p>
<p>Across Office</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
<span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Simplified welcome screens,
 focusing on what users want to do when they open an Office application (either open an existing document or create a new one).
<em>Click on the image to see the larger version.</em> Note that the list of recent files includes documents from the hard disk and from SharePoint sites.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
<span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Cleaner look and feel – the ‘chrome’ is reduced to make more of screen real estate (important to users with tablets which tend to have smaller screens than laptops and desktops).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
<span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Improved integration with document repositories – it’s now much easier to interact with multiple repositories such as SharePoint, SkyDrive, SkyDrive Pro and other web locations
 that you configure. Yes, you can continue using your hard drive just as you have done for the past 20 years.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
<span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Roaming between Office installations – you can now set up an account and apply this to Office installations, and synchronise Office settings, dictionary changes and lists
 of recent documents.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
<span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For PowerPoint and Word you can continue reading a document where you left off – imagine you’re reading that 537 page document and after reading page 215 you close Word…
 when you next open the document Word will remind you where you were. In conjunction with the roaming capabilities this works across installations – for example I could read the document on my ThinkPad, close it, open it later on the Surface and be taken to
 the page I was reading (assuming that the two devices can access the document from a place they have in common).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
<span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Touch mode –
<a href="http://www.dadams.co.uk/2013/01/02/microsoft-surface-with-windows-rt-take-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>covered here</span></a>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
<span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Run Office 2013 side-by-side with older versions – on my ThinkPad I have both Office 2010 and 2013 installed, and with the exception of Outlook I can run the two versions
 at the same time. While most companies probably wouldn’t want two versions of Office installed, this is a good temporary option to ensure that users don’t have major issues with documents and add-ins during a transition period – if they need to they can fall
 back to an older version.</p>

New Feature Comments and Revisions

<p><span>our new “Simple Markup” view of track changes and comments. In this view, we keep the document clean, make it clear where tracked changes and comments are, and give you the ability to easily review the tracked
 changes and comments as you’d like to.</span></p>
<p>you may have noticed two additional ways we polished document review:</p>
<p><span>Track changes and comments look modern</span></p>
<p>People and communication are integrated into comments</p>
<p>in Word 2013 because you can add replies to comments by clicking the reply button in the comment, right-clicking in the comment, or clicking New Comment on the ribbon while you are in a comment.</p>
<p>Related, we’ve heard that when customers are finished with a comment, they want to get it out of the way, but don’t necessarily want to delete it as it provides useful context. In Word 2013 you can address this scenario by right-clicking
 on the comment and marking it as done. This will shrink the comment and all replies down and fade it into the background.</p>

<p>As a result, we added insert controls that appear right outside your table between two existing columns or rows. Just click on it when it appears, and a new column or row will be inserted at that location.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">First, we created a new tool called the Border Painter that is designed to make it easy for you to apply formatting to specific borders in your table. Just choose your formatting, then with the Border

<p style="margin-left: 0">
Word 2013 can only convert to editable text content that’s available as embedded text in the PDF. Not all things that appear as text in a PDF are actually stored with a ‘plain text’ version as well. If the PDF has an image (even if that image is of a page full
 of text) then Word can only display that image.</p>

You can change the ‘Save As’ type to PDF but you can’t save it over the original PDF. Word 2013 considers that an open / read-only document which isn’t accessible.

 which one you want – in just one click you can go from a casual multicolored document to a professional looking black and white document with numbered headings. As a bonus, you can hover over the ones you’re curious about to see how they’ll change your document
 before you apply the formatting.</span></p>

Updating layout in the new Word while maintaining compatibility
<p><a href="http://blogs.office.com/b/microsoft-word/archive/2012/08/21/layout-in-the-new-word.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://blogs.office.com/b/microsoft-word/archive/2012/08/21/layout-in-the-new-word.aspx</span></a>
</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<div>
A little background
<p><span>There are two components that make up the new layout engine in Word:
<b>Line Services</b> and <b>Page &amp;</b> <b>Table Services.</b>
</span></p>
<p><span>Line Services, or LS, is a component that is used in products across Microsoft to control line layout. This was originally included in Word 2000. Since that time, LS has handled everything from individual
 characters, like basic Latin characters, to math equations and special East Asian phonetic objects. It also includes how text is broken at the end of a line.
</span></p>
<p><span>Page and Table Services, or PTS, was first introduced in Word 2007. This component is used to handle the layout of everything outside the control of Line Services. For example, it handles the layout of
 objects like tables and figures (pictures, charts, SmartArt, etc), as well as their interactions with the paragraphs of text on the page.</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<div>
What’s new
<p><span>With the new layout engine we had three goals:</span></p>
<p>More accurate, predictable layouts</p>
<p>Start introducing new, more sophisticated layouts</p>
<p>Improved performance</p>
<p><span>The first order of business in fully integrating LS and PTS into Word was to break the pattern of carrying forward undesirable behavior. The newer, cleaner code of LS and PTS didn’t include many of these
 issues and by fully integrating with the components, we were able to address many of these behaviors. The end results are often subtle: text can be more evenly balanced across multiple columns, table cells can be more accurately auto-fit to their contents
 and figures’ positioning properties are applied more faithfully.</span></p>
<p><span>Going beyond this, in the new Word, you will be able to:</span></p>
<p>Create footnotes using a different number of columns than what is used in the main document</p>
<p>Insert pictures that are taller than 22” in web layout, which is now a truly “bottomless” page</p>
<p>Wrap text around a figure in a header</p>
<p><span>The second area where performance was improved was in the web layout view. For those who aren’t familiar with this view, it was introduced to help author digital content. Its big advantage for this type
 of content is that it isn’t constrained by pages. Instead, it is a single “bottomless” page. In order to make this work in prior versions of Word, a behind the scenes limit of around 22” was actually enforced, which made working with very large figures and
 tables difficult. </span></p>
<p><span>In the new Word, this limit of 22” was removed. What made this possible was the ability to incrementally layout and redraw only the portion of the page that is being changed. By not having to update the
 entire document on every change, we were able dramatically improve performance in this situation.</span></p>

Friction-Free Collaboration
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b>Simplified Sharing</b> – Through the Backstage, it’s easy to share documents with the people you’re working with, so you can all easily access the document to work together. When I share, I can easily choose both who I’m sharing with, and how
 I want to share (Do I want you to edit, or just read? Do I want you to be able to share with more people, or is this invitation just for you?)</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b>Simple Markup</b> – When groups of people are working on a document together, Track Changes is a commonly used tool to make sure that everyone can see “who changed what when” in the final product. The result of that can be a document that’s
 hard to read, as all of the tracked revisions make it hard to see what the current state of the document is.</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b>Comment Replies / Mark Comments “Done”</b> – Comments are a powerful tool when working on a document with others, and we’ve added functionality to address the two common requests: you can now reply to a comment, to have a discussion about a
 specific item, and you can mark a comment “done”, so you don’t have to delete it to communicate that you’ve taken action on its contents.</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b><span>Lock Tracking</span></b><span> – If you want to ensure that all changes to a document are tracked, you can require a password to ensure that the people you’re working with don’t accidentally turn it off.</span></p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b><span>People Everywhere</span></b><span> – Finally, you’ll notice that the names in comments aren’t just names anymore; they’re associated with the people that made them, so you can both see their picture, and hover over it
 to contact them via phone/IM/e-mail without leaving Word.</span></p>

2013 01 29- 10 killer new features in Word 2013<span>&nbsp;

</p>
<p>A word processor is indispensable for anyone who creates documents, be it for work, school, or writing angry letters to your representatives in Congress. Now that Microsoft has finally released Office 2013 to the general public, we’re naming what we think
 are the 10 best new features in Word 2013. (We reviewed the whole enchilada last December, when it became available to Microsoft TechNet subscribers. You can read our opinion
<a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2017550/review-microsoft-office-2013-features-new-look-prices.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>here</span></a>.) </p>
<p>Word 2013 boasts new and improved features across the board, spanning document creation to reading, editing, and collaboration. What’s even better is that Microsoft has made these advanced features easier for everyone to use.
</p>
<p>The new Design tab includes document formatting options to format the entire document.
</p>
<div>
<p>Document formats can be further extended by choosing Themes, Colors, and Fonts to use with them. If you come up with something you’d like to use all the time, the new Set as Default option allows you to make the current combination of formatting settings
 the default for all new documents.Word 2007 and Word 2010 added interesting features for styling a document, but the tools were scattered throughout the user interface, and they were difficult to use. The new Word 2013 Design tab consolidates all these tools
 onto one tab, so they’re easy to find. Microsoft has also added a visual element to its Document Formatting tool that allows you to preview a document style before applying it to the entire document. You’ll also find a range of new document format designs
 to choose from. </p>
<p>The new Alignment Guides in Word 2013 show you when an object is lined up with another object or page element.
</p>
<div>
<p>If you have text wrapping set to an option such as Square, the Alignment Guides also show when the object is aligned with the top of a paragraph or to a heading.This new feature makes lining up images and other objects a cinch in Word 2103. When you move
 an object such as an Image, Chart, or SmartArt illustration around in a document, Alignment Guides automatically appear to show you when the object is lined up with other elements on the page. The guides also show you when the object is lined up to key page
 locations, such as the edge of the page and the left and right margins. </p>
<p>Read mode provides a superior experience for anyone who uses Word primarily to read documents others have created.
</p>
<div>
<p>If you use Word more to read documents than to create them, you’ll like Word 2013’s new Read mode. It automatically resizes a document to the full window. Click the on-screen arrows to flip through the pages, or swipe the screen from either edge of the display
 if you’re using a touch-screen monitor. Switch to page view for vertical scrolling. Right-click on any unfamiliar words to display a definition without existing read mode. You can also click on any image, table, or chart to enlarge it for easier reading.
</p>
<p>The new comments tool encapsulates related comments into a single bubble, which makes them much easier to follow.
</p>
<div>
<p>If you collaborate with others on Word documents, you know how quickly conversations can become difficult to follow, because Word’s comments tool treats every utterance as a new comment.
</p>
<p>In Word 2013, you can reply to a comment <em>within </em>that comment by clicking the Comment Reply button. This captures the entire discussion of a given point inside a single comment box, which will appear as a small bubble in the document’s margin.
</p>
<p>You can also lock the change-tracking feature, so it can’t be bypassed unless the collaborator provides the correct password.
</p>
<p>And with the new Simple Markup option, you can hide complex markups and view the final version of the document. Switch between this and All Markup view from the Review tab or by double clicking the line in the left margin beside a tracked change.
</p>
<p>Word can now open PDF files so you can edit and complete them in Word including working with table data in the file.
</p>
<div>
<p>Word 2013 can not only open a PDF document, it also enables you to edit it—without need of a third-party application. You can also edit the data inside tables and move images around the document. When you’re finished, you can save the document as either
 a PDF or a Word file. This is a must-have feature for anyone who works with PDFs frequently.
</p>
<p>Select a picture, chart, or SmartArt object, and the new Layout Options icon lets you configure placement and text wrapping options for it.
</p>
<div>
<p>You can also select <em><span>Move with text</span></em> or
<em><span>Fix position on page</span></em> to control the location of the object. Click
<em><span>See more</span></em> to open the old Layout dialog, which offers other options for positioning the object on the page.New layout options in Word 2013 make features such as wrapping text around an illustration much easier to
 use. When you click an image, a chart, or a SmartArt object in a Word document, a Layout Options icon appears outside its top right corner. Click it to select text wrapping options such as Tight, Square and Through.
</p>
<p>As with the other applications in the Office 2013 suite, a formatting task pane opens when you right-click an object and choose, for example, Format Picture or Format Shape. This stays open as you work and shows formatting options relevant to the currently
 selected object. </p>
<p>If you use tables in your documents, the new Border Painter tool and Border Styles feature simplify and speed up formatting.
</p>
<div>
<p>Select a Line Style, Line Weight, and Pen Color; or choose a preset from the <em>
<span>Border Styles</span></em> list and paint the borders onto the table. You can also sample an existing border, using the Border Sampler tool in the Border Styles panel, and then use the Border Painter to paint that style elsewhere
 in the table.Formatting a Word table by adding different width and style borders has always been a pain point. Word 2013’s handy Border Painter tool makes this task supremely easy. To access it, choose
<em>Table Tools, Design, Border Painter</em>. </p>
<p><br />
There are new icons for inserting rows and columns in tables and options on the Mini Toolbar for deleting them, too.
</p>
<div>
<p>Word has always had weak table tools, and Word 2013 finally addresses the problem. You can now add a new row to a table by hovering your mouse just outside the left edge of the table at the point at which the row is to be inserted. A small icon will appear;
 click on it and you’re done. There’s a similar icon for easily adding a new column. New Delete buttons on the Mini Toolbar make it easy to delete columns and rows; if the table itself is selected, the option lets you delete the entire table.
</p>
<p>New Expand/Collapse options let you collapse and expand a document to make it easier to work on.
</p>
<div>
<p>Long documents can become unruly to manage, especially if you’re working in just a small portion of it. Word 2013 lets you collapse and expand a document, so you see only the portion you need. To do this, you must format the document’s headings using the
 built-in styles Heading 1, Heading 2, and so on. </p>
<p>Switch to Print Layout view and you can collapse the document by hovering your mouse to the left of a formatted heading. Click the small disclosure triangle to hide the paragraphs between this heading and the next, leaving just the heading text visible.
</p>
<p>Right-click a heading formatted with one of the heading styles to access the Expand/Collapse option, which gives you menu control for this feature.
</p>
<p>Now you can present a document online to others in real time.
</p>
<div>
<p>Once everyone is connected to the service—which is run via the Microsoft Word Web App—they’ll be able to follow along as you present the document. The interface supports comments being made during the presentation, and participants can create a printable
 and downloadable PDF of the document if desired.Office 2013’s new Office Presentation Service allows you to present Word documents online. You must be signed into your Microsoft Account to use this feature. When you’re ready to share your document, choose
<em>File, Share,</em> <em>Present Online</em>, and click the Present Online button to upload your document to the cloud. You will get a link that you can e-mail or share with others so they can join the presentation.
</p>
<p>There’s a lot to like about the new Microsoft Word 2013. The new features collectively will make your day-to-day work much easier to perform whatever that happens to be.

<p><b>Flash Fill: </b>recognizes patterns in your data and automatically fills cells accordingly. Say, for instance, you want to separate first and last names into separate columns. Simply begin typing the first names in
 a new column, press Ctrl+E, or click Data &gt; Flash Fill, and Excel will copy the first names (in correct order) for you.<br />

<p><b>Quick analysis</b> – Excel suggests ways to analyse and view the data, and in most cases you’ll see a preview of how Excel will lay out the analysis. The quick analysis categories are formatting (data bars, colour
 scales, icon sets), charts, tables, totals and sparklines.</p>
<p>New tools for easier charting and visualizing </p>
<p>“Present Online” to share files online</p>
<p>Automated parsing of data</p>
<p>Recommended Charts – Excel recommends the most suitable pivot tables and charts based on your data and provides a preview.</p>
<p>Chart controls – Excel instantly presents the most frequently-required chart controls (such as adding more data, formatting and chart filters).</p>
<p>Two new features, only available in Office Professional Plus and above, include Quick Explore — a way to perform cross-tab analysis of large datasets — and Power View — a way to compile data, charts, and graphs into a single
 view.</p>

This blog post is brought to you by Jane Liles Group Program Manager for the Excel team. With this post she kicks off a brand new blog series introducing all the features we have added across Excel for the release of Office 2013.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">
Note: starting with this posting therer are several more that introduce various new 2013 features.

Intro to Power View for Excel 2013
<p><a href="http://blogs.office.com/b/microsoft-excel/archive/2012/10/04/intro-to-power-view-for-excel-2013.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://blogs.office.com/b/microsoft-excel/archive/2012/10/04/intro-to-power-view-for-excel-2013.aspx</span></a></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0">
there’s a new way to have lots of data in Excel and not slow it down while also having handy things like relationships (to make your handy dandy new in-workbook cube relational). Another thing to note is that the Power View add-in comes installed by default
 in Professional Plus versions of Office.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">
Some of you may be quizzical and asking yourselves, “But… Doesn’t Excel already have graphs and charts and visualizations?” To which I would say, “Yes!!” and probably also add that with Power View, you get automatic cross-filtering of visualizations, new visualizations
 that aren’t in Excel (such as a “play” axis, maps, and cards), a free-form canvas that doesn’t have the restriction of gridlines (no more messing up alignment because you inserted a new row!), unique filtering options (e.g. sliders), and support for images.
 Plus, if you’re a data head, you’ll be excited to know that Power View sheets in Excel can also be hooked up to external data models (i.e. Analysis Services Tabular Models).<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">

Flash Fill is a new Excel 2013 feature that’s both useful and looks good in the demonstrations you’re bound to see. It’s not on any menu in the preview but works if you know what to do.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">
In Excel there’s often need to join or separate strings from cells. Flash Fill copies your actions at retyping data from nearby cells and automatically does the same for matching cells.</p>

<p><b>Enhanced Presenter View</b> makes it easier to zoom in on a diagram, chart, or other detail that you want to emphasize to your audience. And the Navigation Guide lets you switch slides, even move out of sequence,
 from a grid that you can see but your audience can’t. Your audience will see the full slide content, but you as the presenter will see the current slide, your next slide, the slide notes and a set of controls for annotation, zooming and navigation. This feature
 is great with a touch device as you can swipe to navigate, pinch to zoom and use your finger to annotate.</p>

 &gt;</p>
<p>Because you are really installing Office 365 into a virtualized environment with
<b>Office On Demand</b>, you can run Office 2013 next to an existing Office version. This is good for testing purposes, of course, and will help you get up to speed with Office 2013 in a way that doesn’t stomp out whatever familiar Office version you
 were using. New to this version, I’m told, is the ability to run Outlook 2013 side by side with a previous Outlook version, too, something that wasn’t possible previously. (I’ve not tested this.)</p>
<p>&lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p>Outlook 2013 contains the most significant improvements to the core Office 2013 applications</p>
<p>introduction of Exchange ActiveSync support means you can now benefit from having Contacts, Mail, and Calendar appointments synced in Outlook without the need for a full Exchange server — taking advantage of many popular e-mail
 services (Microsoft says the feature is a little buggy in the initial code,)</p>
<p>Facebook and LinkedIn are both baked in this time</p>
<p>new Peeks feature lets you take a look at your schedule or a specific appointment with a contact without having to go into each individual section of Outlook 2013</p>
<p>Weather bar added to the Calendar view in Outlook 2013</p>

<p>A <em>shared mailbox</em> is a mailbox that multiple users can open to read and send e-mail messages. Shared mailboxes allow a group of users to view and send e-mail from a common mailbox. They also allow users to share a common calendar, so they can schedule
 and view vacation time or work shifts. Why set up a shared mailbox?</p>

<p>As an engineering student I have a convertible tablet that I use to take notes in my various Calculus and Linear Algebra classes and I find I still have to use OneNote 2010 because of nuances between 2013 and 2010 that I can’t
 get used to and in some cases I shouldn’t have to. If you know how to correct any of this downgraded behaviour please let me know. I use my convertible tablet (HP 2670p) in laptop mode when taking notes. If I have to draw something, I lean over my desk and
 draw in landscape mode <i>without </i>twisting the screen into tablet mode.<br />
<br />
Gripes:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Under the draw menu, colour and thickness has been combined into one setting for both shapes and pen. Previously I could have my shapes as one colour and my pen as another. Now they have to be the same colour. I can understand why you went with this
 but please allow backward compatibility for those who can understand how to manage two colours at the same time. This is a clear example of “programming down” to the lowest common denominator of user without regard to advanced note takers.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Custom pen shapes and sizes were removed. Why?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>When you have “lock drawing mode” enabled and you change your colour, it deselects your shape and puts you back in pen mode. This is infuriatingly disruptive to note taking. I didn’t give the command to switch to pen, keep it as my shape!</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Full Screen mode, with the ribbon enabled, does not stay on by default. On my Convertible Tablet PC screen space is a premium so I enable full screen mode with just the ribbon enabled. With OneNote 2010 I could do this with one button. Now every time
 I select full screen in 2013 I have to select the bar at the top, select ribbon display options, then select ‘show tabs and commands’. What I select here should be remembered by default.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The button to add more space was removed from the bottom right corner. It used to live right under the down arrow on the vertical scroll bar. This is fine on it’s own but OneNote 2013 was changed so you don’t have a vertical scroll bar at all until you’ve
 typed at least one page of material. If I need to insert space I can’t do it until I’ve typed at least one page! This was the final straw so I went back to 2010.</p>
<p>Items that should have been implemented/fixed:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Infuriatingly the one major bug that existed in 2010 still exists in 2013. The bug that doesn’t switch back to your font back to the default font after writing an equation. Simply do not allow the equation font outside of equations. Please. This bug
 has been annoying the heck out of me for two years now. I find the bug even more prevalent in 2013, although this may have been coincidence.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Why weren’t extra shapes added? A positive Y axis only with a -/+ x axis, parabolas (semi-circle with shift held), right angle triangle. 3D Shapes such as cubes and cylinders, etc.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Why doesn’t the web viewer support pen drawings? Same goes for the Android App. These offerings are useless without pen support.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Exporting in 2013 has been immensely improved-- Thank you. One small bug is when I highlight text it shows as on the bottom layer in the app but in a PDF export highlighted text shows on top. I realize this is because the highlighting was done after
 the text was typed but seriously, who knows what to highlight before their going to type it?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>A fill tool (paint bucket).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>A rectangle shape that is always filled and always is “sent to back”. This will allow for quick highlighting of large sections or a better background for when neon colours are used on a graph.</p>
<p>Things I’m not sure of at all but drive me nuts:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Why can’t equations stay the same size when I type regular text on the same line as them? My font is already huge, I don’t want to make it massive. Having an integral symbol reduced to half it’s size once you start typing outside of the equation on the
 same line is very annoying.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>A text box should keep typing until the edge of the screen and then line wrap. More often than not I have to grab the edge and drag it to the right edge of the screen, however if I go too far a horizontal scroll bar appears which is not desired behaviour.</p>
<p>Edit: Added a few more items.</p>
<p>P.S. Back in the day I was Microsoft Beta Tester #299815. If a similar type of feedback/bug reporting system is available for very early betas, if not alpha builds please sign me on. I’m in Vancouver, if I have to come down to
 Washington to give my feedback I will. All I want is a note taking app that was 2010 but enriched, not downgraded.</p>

</p>
<p><b><span><br />
<strong>The Windows 8 OneNote app from the Windows Store just got even better. </strong>
</span></b></p>
<p>OneNote now lets you capture virtually any Windows 8 screen. If you find a website you want to make note of or a recipe you want to save for later, just swipe from the right to open the Charms bar, and and use the Share charm to send it to OneNote across
 all your devices. You can save it&nbsp;as a part of the currently open page or as&nbsp;a new one. You can also add a short annotation.
</p>
<p>With the app's new Camera Scan feature, you can photograph tough-to-capture documents like magazine pages or a meeting whiteboard. Camera Scan automatically crops, rotates, straightens, removes shadows, and sharpens the image to make it look more like a
 scanned document. </p>
<p>Camera Scan also includes OCR (Optical Character Recognition), which converts the words in a recipe, receipt or other hard copy document into searchable text. You can also copy and paste the text into other OneNote notes or into the Windows clipboard to
 be used elsewhere. </p>
<p>One of the nice things about these new features is how well they integrate with Windows 8 devices.&nbsp;Microsoft has had very little success using the Office suite as a carrot to lure users to adopt Windows 8 devices. This

If you start from an envelope template (you can download a template from my web site to use as a start point) then treat the merge as a letter merge, you may find it simpler.<br />

<p>Hi Sam,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to download Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant Tools, you can go to this
<a href="https://diagnostics.outlook.com/#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link
</a>to download it. Meanwhile, Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant needs network connection to function and it needs online check the configuration. So, it's not feasible to download offline version of Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant.</p>

                    <p style="margin-left: 30px">I know many discussions have addressed this but I have not found a solution.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">I regularly produce worksheets with about 100 records of text and date fields, each of which must be transposed into a 2-column table and printed to a PDF file.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 30px">To do this I have been using VBA code which works through the worksheet rows to sequentially: copy/transpose into two columns in a separate worksheet and then use&nbsp;rng.ExportAsFixedFormat Type:=xlTypePDF to create the PDF file, as
 follows:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

<p style="margin-left: 60px">Function CopyNewTable()<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sheets("Data").Select<br />

<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">It has all been working fine for several years, until someone recently noticed that sometimes the penultimate field (Description of Allegation or Incident) does not show all the text from the Excel cell. It is invariably cut off
 after about 1000 - 1100 characters.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Many discussions mention that there is a 1024 limit on cell displays, but I thought this only applied to Excel 2003 and before - 2007 should be fine. Indeed, I have found it is always possible to manually adjust &nbsp;the Excel field
 to reveal all of the text (both in the original worksheet and the temporary 2-column Excel table), sometimes totalling more than 2000 characters. Of course, I don't want to manually adjust and print to PDF 100 times on a regular basis. So I used AutoFit, as
 shown in the code above:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 60px">Sheets("Template").Rows("1:18").Selection.EntireRow.AutoFit</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Unfortunately this does not seem to duplicate the manual cell expanding that we have tried successfully.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Non of the cells is merged. All are wrapped and General formatted. I have tried cleaning text entries via Notepad before entry.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">If AutoFit will not work, I am thinking maybe I could include some code to set a customised row height for each table by getting the total word count (is there a function?) and setting row height to about 0.8 * number of words -
 based on initial calculations.<br />

<p style="margin-left: 30px">

Your error handler ?&nbsp; should have said something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1:&nbsp; Remove ".Selection" from the AutoFit line and give it a try.<br />
<br />
2:&nbsp; If you still have incorrect row height then try increasing the row height to something larger than needed before autofitting (no guarantee)...<br />
<br />
Sheets("Template").Rows("1:18").RowHeight = 201<br />
Sheets("Template").Rows("1:18").EntireRow.AutoFit<br />

<p>Hi Jim - thanks for your thoughts. I don't get any errors on the screen.... anywhere else I would find an error?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried all your suggestions and unfortunately the same result. I am wondering whether the Excel 2007 AutoFit function has some word/character limit in it which is an unintended hangover from 2003, which actually placed limits on how many characters were
 visible. It obviously thinks it is dong its job correctly. I can definitely manually adjust the row heights by dragging down the cell border at the left margin- and all the text appears, no problem. But if I double click or use Home-Cells-Format-AutoFit Row
 Height, nothing happens</p>

            Re: "I don't get any errors on the screen"<br />
<br />
I am guessing your function is called from a Sub that uses "on error resume next".<br />
(not good practice)<br />
<br />
Am out of ideas on the autofit issue.<br />

            <p>UPDATE. I have a similar VBA macro to export the same tables to Word ... all in one report, separate table on separate pages. This works fine, no cell display limitations in the Word tables. Comparing the two macros, there is no difference in the Excel copy-paste
 and AutoFit sections. So I am wondering if it has something to do with formatting in the&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">ExportAsFixedFormat.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Any suggestions as to why this should liit the cell size? Is it constrained to printing on one page?</span></p>

<h2>            Access 2010 - printing extra page</h2>
                    
<p>Have been using Access database for invoicing since Office '97 through 2000, 2003,2007 but now have 2010 and the invoice reports are printing and extra page with header and footer but the central detail is blank on the second page - first page is correct
 with all detail.&nbsp; The report display also shows the second page.</p>
<p>Don't think it is anything to do with page setup as I have tried altering margins etc. to no avail.&nbsp; No other problems with printers or programs, just with Access.&nbsp; Any suggestions?</p>

            I've only seen that when the report area falls outside the margins on the page. If the report is in portrait mode, try switching to landscape and running it again. If the issue goes away, you know that it is indeed a margins issue.

<p>I have not heard of areport doing that on its own.&nbsp; The usual cause is a footer having ForceNewPage set to Before Section,&nbsp;a stray Page Break control or a large, visible footer section.</p>
<p>It's also possible for odd data to do that.&nbsp; For example, a can grow text box with a bunch of blank characters or even&nbsp;one or more&nbsp;records that display as all blanks.&nbsp; A relatively easy way to check for this is to set the BackColor of&nbsp;the controls near the
 bottom of the detail section&nbsp;to a different color.</p>

<p>Thanks for both your replies:</p>
<p>Tried printing landscape (using printer setup and Access page setup) - no change.</p>
<p>Tried changing back colour of detail in main report and sub frame - colour on first page only.</p>
<p>I have checked and this problem seems consistent with all our print reports in Access, since upgrading to Windows 7 &amp; Access 2010.&nbsp; No changes were made to the exising database (kept on SBS 2008 server) and&nbsp;another terminal using Windows XP and Access 2003
 still prints normally (1 page).</p>

<p>Does the report have any group footer or report footer&nbsp;sections that are empty and visible?</p>
<p>If you do have footers, even if they are not empty, try setting each footer's BackColor to a different color to try to figure out what is on the second page.</p>
<p>If that doesn't help, then it probably is that the report is too wide to fit within its margins.&nbsp; Try reducing the report's width by an inch, even if you have to move some controls.&nbsp; Note you can reduce the report's width to its minimum allowed by the controls
 by dragging the right edge of the white design area way to the left.&nbsp; It will snap back to the minimum.</p>

<p>It is the report footer that is the problem, though why it should be causing and extra page print,after over 15 years of trouble free use is a mystery.&nbsp; What is different about Access 2010?</p>
<p>I have removed the report Header/Footers from the reports and all seem to function normally.&nbsp; Just hope there are no other unforseen&nbsp;repercussions.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your helpful suggestions.</p>

<p>I'm not convinced that it's A2010 that's causing the blank page.&nbsp; In my experience, it's most often because of a (mostly?) blank sectoin.&nbsp; How much of the second page displayed the report footer color?</p>
<p>Another possibility is if you&nbsp;are now using&nbsp;a different printer that requires larger margins than you specified in the report's design.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have seen quite a few reports that were designed to use minimal (1/4 inch) margins suddenly produce more pages simply
 because a new printer required margins over 1/2 inch.&nbsp; When that situation&nbsp; occurs, there is no warning other than things don't fit the same way on pages printed on the new printer.&nbsp; You can check for it by using the Page Setup window and setting all the margins
 to 0.&nbsp; When you do that, Access will automatically change the 0 to the smallest margin the printer allows.&nbsp; The only way to avoid ths issue is to design reports with margins over 1/2 inch all around&nbsp;and only buy printers that meet your reports' margin requirements.</p>

<p>When I put a back colour in the report footer it shows up only on the second page in the "detail" centre section between the page header and footer.&nbsp; I tried enlarging and reducing the report footer but it made no difference (it was already at minimum).&nbsp;
 The is nothing visible on the report footer either.&nbsp; I presume that, since they were blank, there is no problem with removing the report header/footer?</p>
<p>The only change to the network (the Access database is kept on the server) was upgrading my laptop to Windows&amp;/Access2010.&nbsp; All the printers remained unchanged.&nbsp; Other terminals running Windows XP/Access2003 have no problems with printing.</p>

<p>Removing or making the report footer invisible&nbsp;is fine as long as you are not using it tp display anything.&nbsp; And I understand that cleared up the problem of the extra page, we're just trying to pin down why it's different in A2010.</p>
<p>But, you said the report footer is blank and that it filled the entire second page, right?&nbsp; If so, it could not possibly be reduced to a minimum size, which would be zero height.&nbsp; If it is the same Height as it was when you used an earlier verion of Access,
 then something else changed.&nbsp; I was speculating that you were using a different printer, but you said that hasn't changed.&nbsp; So, thinking harder, I should have said a different printer&nbsp;or, more speicfically, a different version of the printer driver.&nbsp; As I
 said before, you could test this hypothesis by opening the report in design view, setting&nbsp;all the margins to 0 and seeing what the minimum margin values really are.&nbsp; Do the same thing on a machine that still has A2003, the same version of Windows&nbsp;and the report
 that works without the extra page and compare the minimum margins to see if they are the same.</p>
<p>Also check each machine's printer driver version to make sure they are also the same.</p>
<p>OR, you can just say the report works now, that's good enough and don't really care to figure out why the report generated an extra page when run on a new machine with A2010.</p>

<p>Sorry, I didn't make clear that when I put a back colour on the report footer I increased the size from nothing to about 10mm.&nbsp; I then got a 10mm stripe on the second (unwanted) page between the page header and page footer in the centre of page position
 normally taken by the invocie detail. It seems that this 'stripe' forced the extra page, so my feeling is that the cause is connected with the report footer and not the printer, but as we have resolved the problem we shall not pursue the reasons.</p>
<p>It is also possible that I had to download a new printer driver for Windows 7 which may have affetced this although I did play around with reducing the margins which had no effect.</p>
<p>In the end we are happy that it now works and are pleased to have resolved this.&nbsp; Thanks for all your help.</p>
