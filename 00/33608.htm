<p>The most probable cause of this is that the game was purchased while your gamertag was active on another console (at a friend's house, if you replaced your Xbox 360, had your console repaired, etc.). If this is the case, you need to complete a license transfer
 to play your games offline. This basically transfers ownership of your copy of RE4 from one console to another.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can find steps to transfer the license here: <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live/marketplace-and-purchasing/download-content" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hey Guitar Cheesus! Can you tell us what error you receive when you try to play online? Do you have issues playing online with any other titles on your console? Have you tried deleting and re-downloading the application? That is if the above suggestions
 in this thread do not apply. Keep us informed! :)</p>

<p>Re: Firewall issue - Problem resolved</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case it was (surprise surprise!): SSD failure!! </p>
<p>(Yes SSD drives are not very reliable)</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my search i found that this issue is "alive &amp; kicking"&nbsp; and NOT "history"</p>
<p>
</p><p>However as in my case it&nbsp; was triggered by unsuspected cause (virus can be another cause..)&nbsp; i wish MS let people understand the vast issues that may cause the above warning message ("Firewall setting..")</p>
<p>
</p><p>The one place that I can recommend&nbsp; for addressing the issue with detailed &amp; clarity is: UGETFIX&nbsp; (for security &amp; "respect " reasons only the name is mentioned)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately non of MS sites were helpful&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

                    I have a Dell Inspiron One that is running Windows 10. Went to do a restart the other day and it said Update Windows and restart. Now that is all it does, shows on the screen Getting Windows ready Don't turn off your computer, it shows the progress of
 the update, gets to 100% restarts and does it all over again. Just keeps doing the same thing over and over and over. Please Help!

            Hi, Jim
<br />
<br />My name is Alice and I am an Independent Consultant. I would love to help you today.
<br />
<br />Try to enter Safe Mode  to repair Windows.
<br />Interrupt the normal boot process of your Windows 10 PC
<br />If Windows 10 fails to boot normally three times over, the fourth time it enters by default in an Automatic Repair mode. Using this mode, you can boot into Safe Mode. To trigger the Automatic Repair mode, you must interrupt the normal boot process three consecutive times: use the reset or the power button on your Windows 10 PC to stop it during boot, before it finishes loading Windows 10. If you use the power button, you might have to keep it pressed for at least 4 seconds to force the power off
<br />Then you proceed to repair the computer:
<br />With a reset, all of your Installed applications are lost, but you get an option to save your files if you want. If a system image from the OEM exists-called a recovery partition, then it also gives you an option to restore it. It would make your PC load to default factory settings.
<br />Navigate to Troubleshooting section, again.
<br />Select Reset.
<br />If you select keep my files, your files would be kept. You might also get the third option-restore to factory settings-which isn’t applicable on the PC.
<br />After selecting the desired options, you are presented with a confirmation, something like this- This indicates what you have chosen. 
<br />Click on Reset and the resetting should begin.
<br />
<br />Let me know if the information has been useful to solve your Problem.

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Hi Jim.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Here are steps to recover from failed Updates or Version Update install which causes Windows to fail to start: 
<br />
<br />1) Try whichever method works here to get into Advanced Startup Options to run System Restore if this is a Windows Update, or Go Back to Old Version if this is a version update.  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest is to restart or force shutdown the PC 3 times.  
<br />
<br />If you are able to access System Restore or Go Back and it fails, skip to step 3.
<br />
<br />2) If necessary create bootable installation media to access the repair options if  not accessible by any other method:   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Boot media by powering up the PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />You may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup to turn off Fast Boot if it won't allow the Boot Menu key to interrupt starting Windows:  <a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose UEFI version of media if offered, browse to second screen to Repair Your Computer link, then Advanced Troubleshoot options to run System Restore to a point before the problem began, or choose More Options to Go Back to Old Version if this was a version Update.
<br />
<br />If it rolls back then you can hide the Windows Updates and Version Upgrade responsible until they mature by installing and running immediately the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br /> 
<br />3) If this fails try a Startup Repair, or go back to Troubleshoot Options on the previous screen to Reset your PC which will save your files while reinstalling Windows. 
<br />
<br />4) If that fails you can use the booted media to Clean Install the latest version which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>  The link compiles the best possible install of Windows 10 that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given.  
<br />
<br />There is a step to rescue files from the same bootable media:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />The media provided for the Clean Install is Version 1809 and normally the problems go away with the Clean Install, however if they don't you can find earlier version media to use here:  <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>
<br />Burn to DVD  or create bootable 8+gb flash stick installer using this tool installed to Windows:  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56485" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/detail...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Then once you're back in Windows 10, you can block the problem Windows or Version Update using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br /> 
<br />Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until it's resolved.

<br />
My name is Alice and I am an Independent Consultant. I would love to help you today.
<br />
<br />
Try to enter Safe Mode to repair Windows. <br />
Interrupt the normal boot process of your Windows 10 PC <br />
If Windows 10 fails to boot normally three times over, the fourth time it enters by default in an Automatic Repair mode. Using this mode, you can boot into Safe Mode. To trigger the Automatic Repair mode, you must interrupt the normal boot process three consecutive
 times: use the reset or the power button on your Windows 10 PC to stop it during boot, before it finishes loading Windows 10. If you use the power button, you might have to keep it pressed for at least 4 seconds to force the power off
<br />
Then you proceed to repair the computer: <br />
With a reset, all of your Installed applications are lost, but you get an option to save your files if you want. If a system image from the OEM exists-called a recovery partition, then it also gives you an option to restore it. It would make your PC load to
 default factory settings. <br />
Navigate to Troubleshooting section, again. <br />
Select Reset. <br />
If you select keep my files, your files would be kept. You might also get the third option-restore to factory settings-which isn’t applicable on the PC.
<br />
After selecting the desired options, you are presented with a confirmation, something like this- This indicates what you have chosen.
<br />
Click on Reset and the resetting should begin. <br />
<br />
Let me know if the information has been useful to solve your Problem. </blockquote>
Tried what you ask, no help. Got to Automatic Repair. It told me it could not repair my PC, go to Advanced Options. But I was unable to, all of the following would not work: keyboard, mouse, touchscreen.

            So I recommend borrowing a computer to create a USB to repair Windows.
<br />Downloading the ISO already comes with the Windows 1809 updates

<br />
<br />Then you will start with USB and you will follow the steps of this link to repair Windows without losing your files.

            I'm at the end of my rope! Tried the repair tool, no help. tried to restore and got the following message: System Restore failed while scanning the file system on the drive E:\ The drive might be corrupt. You might want to retry System Restore after running
 chkdsk /R on this disk. An unspecified error occurred during System Restore. (0x8007000e). Im only showing 1 restore point and that is for 1/15/2019 and it was critical. Tried doing the Rufus thing, but I could not find the Win10 ISO file. Trying my best with
 my limited knowledge. I have a Dell laptop also that also runs win 10 so that's the computer I have been using to communicate with you and do the flash drive for the repair tool. Really getting disgusted, cant access sign in menu or anything else except the
 F2 and F12 keys when I turn computer on. This all started on 1-18-2019.&nbsp;

<p>If you need to keep your files in tact, I highly recommend getting an enclosure to put hard drive in in order to back up your files, so just in case you cannot get the thing to boot back up, it won't be a disaster like i had to retrieve them, which I am
 in still in process of doing, if even possible, another thing to check on is log into your microsoft account and see if bit locker is enabled, if it is try to disable it somehow, if not enabled you should be okay, don't enable it.&nbsp; if it is enabled thought,
 see if your bit locker recovery key is there somewhere on your account, as you will need it in order to get anywhere with your system.</p>
<p>Bit locker should not be an option on win 10 home, but it was on mine and not to my knowledge it was also enabled, which i did not do myself</p>
<p>bitlocker has caused me huge amounts of time and money and frustration, makes no sense why it is even on there if it is not supported by win 10 home.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I too have a dell, they told me that microsoft is pushing bitlocker onto systems via update, I have noticed that the ability to disable update is not available anymore, not even temporarily, seems that microsoft must be back to pushing the governments agenda
 or just up to no good, I really like windows, but the constant barrage of updates is annoying and exactly what caused my dell to crash, it was in an update, but maybe i should say it is always in an update, atleast everytime I look at the update in the taskmanager.
 constantly running.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            windows 8  will not connect to blackberry playbook</h2>
                    <p>I have download the latest version of desktop manager for my Blackberry Playbook and installed it on Windows 8 but although it says connecting nothing ever happens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This worked perfectly on Windows 7 and on Vista on my previous laptop.&nbsp; But since having this Wndows 8 Machine there seems to be nthing but hassle.&nbsp; What a load of tosh this system is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think it is the MAC for m in future, or even Android, Microsoft are useless and never resolve anything.&nbsp; Blackberry also need putting down and finally resting from the tech game as they have done nothing for their loyal Playbook owners in years.&nbsp; There
 are pathetic.</p>

    <title>Xbox One Elite Controller - Loose Thumbstick - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> melty s  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One Elite Controller - Loose Thumbstick</h2>
                    
<p>I just wanted to post something on the community forums for anyone thinking of buying an Elite Controller, at this point I would like to advise against that. I got one in the bundle as a present for Christmas, and until today the controller was easily hands
 down the best I've ever used. Everything felt great, the paddles presented a unique approach to gameplay that added in some new tactical options when playing online, there wasn't really much more you could ask for in a controller. And then today, suddenly,
 the right thumbstick has become loose in the socket. It wobbles around when you move the controller, thrown about by gravity. If you hold the controller with the thumbsticks facing towards the floor you can see the right thumbstick fall physically down, popping
 out, whilst the left still stays in place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now this is obviously a problem. One of the things that attracted me to the controller in the first place was the thought that the sticks would not get worn out as easily, as my 360 sticks did after several years of use become a little stiff, but after only
 a week of gaming there is some kind of give in the thumbstick. It still feels okay to play, but the point is that this is a premium product, the stick shouldn't loosen up (a problem which I've heard of with the standard controller) and especially not in that
 short space of time.</p>
<p>I can assure you I'm not the kind of person that gets rough with their controller when playing either, I'm careful with hardware, especially so in this case considering this in particular is an expensive piece of kit! But even, hypothetically, if I was being
 heavy handed with the sticks, considering I can't have put in more than maybe 10 - 15 hours of gaming in the last week, someone that is particularly abusive with their controller even then shouldn't be able to wear it out in such a short space of time considering
 it's supposed to be a 'premium' product.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm going to be taking the controller in to the retailer when I have time this week and hopefully they will be able to replace it for another. I expect this is likely a defective model from a bad batch (upon Googling I've also found someone else with the
 same issue, so this isn't an isolated case.) So, considering this, if you're thinking about getting an Elite controller, it's probably best not to. Whilst it does feel like a great piece of kit all around (I was even recommending it to someone yesterday!)
 if it comes with issues (such as thumbsticks loosening) that are present in the bog standard version you might as well stick with the normal controller.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10_C&#58;Drive_UserAccounts-Delete to FIle Path History&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My name is Chris and as this is my first post, I am not entirely certain of where to begin or explain the scope of my questions, Here it goes:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Computer:</p>
<p>I have Windows 10<br />
Processor AMD A6-6310<br />
Dell Inspirion 15<br />
64 Bit Operating System</p>
<p>Office 365-Home</p>
<p>Office 365-Business</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mobile Device</p>
<p>Android</p>
<p>Samsung Note 5</p>
<p>
</p><p>Overview of last few months:<br />
March 2016<br />
Had to do a completely factory reset due to windows 10 update -- file history not configured and back uped recorvery files
<br />
to external hard drive did not save correctly.&nbsp; Imagine if you Took a stack of 30,000 files, shred them throw them up in the air<br />
and let the pieces carry them to buckets if not lost for ever. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
April 2016<br />
Had to to create a new user account due to Cortana becoming inoperable and disabling my start menu<br />
May --Settings changed to new user account, and sharing permissions within user accounts began storing duplicate files within s<br />
secondary user account.&nbsp; Then the cloud storage parent would then sync some folders and at random skip other folders from their<br />
child folder.&nbsp; Additionally office 365 for business was installed to attempt to segment between the two.&nbsp; The problem<br />
only got worse between the accounts being confused as to where to save files,abilitu to stay connected to home network.&nbsp; Office network settings would save etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<br />
June -- No update</p>
<p>
</p><p>July--Problems have snowballed.&nbsp; Spoke to Go Daddy and they informed me of whats possible going on with Microsoft 365.&nbsp; Apparently internal management is aware that office 365=business does not work with office 365 and millions of people are suffering from
 the same disruption.</p>
<p>Office 365 for business was installed to attempt to organize the difference between the two and to use for my word press website sharepoint. &nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Completed computer reset on July 30 hoped--- and believe that I need to remove the settings out of the old user account and delele it.&nbsp; Just not sure how to confirm files from that account were transfferred and then remove.<br />
</p><p>I </p>
<p>not reinstalled<br />
adobe<br />
office<br />
or office business 365<br />
<br />
I am very close to a breakdown, as I have stayed up 2 to 3 nights a week trying to figure out whats going on for last 12 weeks.&nbsp;

    <title>Grey x&#39;s on all desktop icons Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lawrence holl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Grey x&#39;s on all desktop icons Windows 8.1</h2>
                    Recently a client discover that all of their&nbsp;desktop icons (files and shortcuts) have large Grey X's in the corner on their Windows 8.1 home PC. The files are still accessible upon click through to them. They do not have a tape drive (one possible cause
 I have seen) and the shortcuts point to various locations on the primary C: drive (documents folder etc). Repairing the icon cache temporarily resolved but it seems to just come back again. They are running Carbonite as a backup, however a brief search of
 "Carbonite with Grey X's on icons" has not yet yielded anything either. Any help would be welcomed.

            I experienced the problem for the first time ever this morning in one of my laptops After tracking what I did this morning that might had caused it, I finally remembered to have installed an update for Boxcryptor. After uninstalling the Boxcryptor app,
 the grey X's disappeared from all those folder its was on. Bingo! Hope it helps!

            <p>My computer is ASUS Zenbook UX302L. I just upgrade to Windows 10 home&nbsp;64 bit. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the display drivers, the computer has built-in CPU graphics as well as dedicated Nvidia Geforce 730m. I have already updated both graphic display drivers to its latest edition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for device manager, There are no Driver errors. I also don't see any compatibility issue when installing the drivers.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am following the link provided to see if I can resolve the issue, but I think it would do any good.</p>

            <p>I have this same problem on my surface pro1 after upgrading to win10. Happened in tablet mode or desktop mode. What fixed it was reducing the "text sizing" option from 150% to 100%. Unfortnately this makes all the text on the 11" screen very small, but it
 does keep photos and images the proper size when using the WPV slideshow. You can find this option buried in the settings-&gt;appearance and personalization-&gt;display-&gt;make text larger or smaller-&gt;set a custom scaling level. This little window will let you adjust
 your scaling to 100%. Mine was set to 150% to make things easier to read on the surface screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under win8.1 this was not a problem, so my guess is that win10 Windows Photo Viewer has an incorrect scaling setting that is&nbsp;treating photos&nbsp;like text and blowing them up 150% (in my case). Should be an easy fix if they ever get around to it.</p>

<p>This worked for me!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
For some reason my computer had set it to 125 % which meant everything was weird. Now I set it to 100 % and now all the programs looks good again. I tried it before but then I did not reboot my computer after I made the change so I didn't notice any difference
 at first.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I notice that many, many people have the same problem -- and yes, indeedy, it does seem to be a glitch in Windows 10 that Microsoft needs to be aware of and needs to fix. This isn’t the only incidence of this particular question. But people have a different
 way of describing it, and so you will find different descriptions scattered around the various Microsoft forums, with wildly different official suggestions and so forth. I actually posted this same message in response to a different question elsewhere, but
 I’m hoping by posting it here a second time I will increase the chance that someone at Microsoft will see it and do something about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a workaround, but it’s not great. And before I get to it, let me say first that a solution is necessary. Windows Photo Viewer has a capability that you do not get in the new
<strong>Picture Tools/Slideshow </strong>function in File Explorer. You can select the point at which a slideshow begins. You don’t have to start every time with the first item in the file and move sequentially from there. You can start in the middle. If you
 have 1,000 photos in a file, this is important.</p>
<p>
</p><p>O.K., here’s the problem and the workaround. For some reason -- don't ask me – I certainly am no expert -- the Windows Photo Viewer slideshow function, under Windows 10, is governed by your display magnification setting. It wasn’t like this before. It shouldn’t
 be. It used to be that when you hit the slideshow button, the slideshow filled up the whole screen exactly right, regardless of your magnification settings. Matter of fact, this is the way it works with the new Picture Tools/Slideshow function – but things
 just don’t work right with Windows Photo Viewer anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, if you had your display magnification set at 125 percent before you upgraded from, say, Windows 7 to Windows 10, it continues to do so after you upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is, if you were using this sort of magnification before, the Windows slideshow also displays at 125 percent. So when you throw Windows Photo Viewer into slideshow mode, and your photos display full-screen, you see the upper left-hand corner of
 the display. Your photos are cut off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you go into settings/system/display you will see a toggle lever that says "change the size of text, apps and other items." Move the little toggle level all the way to the left, to 100 percent, and then the slideshow will display properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should mention --when I went into settings and looked at that toggle switch, it LOOKED like it was at 100 percent – but it wasn’t. I moved it back and forth and left it at that all-the-way-to-the-left position, and my computer told me I had changed the
 setting and I needed to restart. After the computer rebooted, the slideshow looked fine.<br />
<br />
Now here's the problem. When I did this, all of the type on my <span>&nbsp;</span>desktop shrank, too. And so did all the type in the menu bars, my computer programs – everything. In Microsoft Word, I find I can use the magnification feature to make what I type
 look OK again. But the type in the menus and so forth is exceedingly small. There was a reason I had my display set at 125 percent! I have a high resolution monitor, and when it is set at 100 percent, everything is really, really small. I didn’t want everything
 on my screen to be so tiny I would need a magnifying glass to see it!<br />
<br />
So hey, Microsoft – is this something in Windows Photo Viewer you guys can fix? Or is there some sort of tweak I need to make to my settings so that I can read the type on my screen AND use Windows Photo Viewer slideshow? Is there a better way?

            Thanks. Erik. I have been keeping track of updates on this thread. You and JasonK10 was correct about the windows photo viewer in windows 10. adjust the magnification does work fix the viewer, but it also makes everything too small for me to see. Anyway,
 thanks for reply, and I hope that Microsoft would fix this issue.

            <p>I think everyone is asking for windows 10 Photo to have a fit to screen option while in slideshow. It would be nice if the slideshow automatically fit to screen for images and .gif files.</p>
<p>I was able to find the old viewer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>you can right-click a photo .jpg and click properties&gt; </p>
<p>Open With (Change) and click on more apps and find "Windows Photo Viewer."</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has fit to screen options and automatically fits to screen on slideshow. I'm getting a bug though. My images are slideshowing in random order. It also still does not play animated files like .gifs</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if this helps.</p>

            <p>This is a DELL computer....purchased new.&nbsp; This computer did have a refresh, after I upgraded it to Windows 10 it got files corrupted....due to some issues...assumed by Kaspersky.&nbsp; I was sent a memory stick of the original image by DELL and reverted back
 to Windows 8.&nbsp; I chose not to use Kaspersky again and instead used Windows Defender.&nbsp; I had no issues until today.&nbsp; I did sfc/scannow command.&nbsp; It found no corruption.&nbsp; I just finished DISM</p>
<p>Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth .&nbsp;&nbsp; It said it completely repaired store and the restore was completely successful.&nbsp; However....I just tried to update Windows Defender ...it just kept searching.</p>
<p>I did a Windows update Troubleshooting tool...and again it says Windows components must be repaired...NOT FIXED.&nbsp; I thought the DISM fixes components...Doesn't it?</p>
<p>I have many posts because I have 5 devices on various Microsoft software, from Vista Pro to Windows 10.</p>
<p>I am getting disappointed that this problem is unfixable.&nbsp; I guess I could use my memory stick and reformat and refresh my complete computer....again losing everything on it.&nbsp;

</p><p>I have never used any&nbsp;registry cleaner</p>

<p>I thought. This forum was to provide a level of product support for Microsoft users. &nbsp;I have 4 active Microsoft devices. &nbsp;I have one mobile device with Apple. &nbsp;Right now I have to say I feel Microsoft doesn't care much that I have opted to buy its products
 over Apple. It is sad.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Journal Note Writer Reinstall for Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brettos  say:</h3>
<h2>            Journal Note Writer Reinstall for Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I used Journal Note Writer on a daily basis until one day it failed to open saying:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Windows Journal has stopped working</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>A problem caused the program to stop working correctly.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>The program then shuts down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To cut a long and boring failed troubleshoot story short - <strong>Is there any way of uninstalling this program and reinstalling it again to solve the problem?</strong> It would be ideal if this program could be downloaded from the Microsoft Download Page
 (I believe this may have been the case for previous versions of Windows??)</p>

            <p><span>Hi Brettos,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you are facing issues with Journal writer in Windows 8.1, then you can try repairing the Journal writer by following these steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press Windows key +X, select ‘Command prompt (Admin)’.</span></li><li><span>In the command prompt, change the directory to ‘</span><em><span>Drive</span></em><span>:\Program Files\Windows Journal’ (where drive is drive location where windows is installed).</span></li><li><span>By default the directory would be c:\Windows\System 32. To change the directory type “cd..” and press enter. This will take you to the previous folder. Once you come to the c: drive, type “cd
</span><span>Program Files” and then “cd Windows Journal”.</span></li><li><span>Once you are in the <em>Drive</em>:\Program Files\Windows Journal’ type the following command :</span></li></ol>
<p><strong><span>journal.exe /repairnotewriter</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try these steps and let us know the results.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Ben,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply. You have already been more help than the other avenues I have tried.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed your process and this was the result:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"The Journal Note Writer print driver could not be installed.</p>
<p>The operation completed successfully.</p>
<p>Restart Windows and then try again."</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I restarted Windows and tried again but got the same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried opening the program again to see what would happen (if anything) and it was the same error as before.
</p>

            <p><span>Hi Brettos,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In this case, we might have to manually delete the files and replace them with a working copy of the file. So, I would suggest you to first check if the same behavior is noticed in other user accounts. If yes, then might have to copy the file from
 a different computer. Try these steps and check:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Copy a working copy of files from a different computer and copy them to a thumb drive. Copy the folder ‘Windows Journal’ from the following location:</span></li></ul>
<p><span>‘<em>Drive</em>:\Program Files\Windows Journal’</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Rename the old ‘Windows Journal’ in your computer and paste the folder that you copied from the other computer.</span></li><li><span>Now try opening the Windows journal by double clicking the file ‘Journal.exe’ and check if it works.</span></li></ul>
<p><span><strong>Note: </strong>make sure that you copy the files from a trusted computer to make sure that you don’t copy any virus or malware unknowingly. Run a complete security scan on the thumb drive before copying the files to be on the safer side. Try
 this and let us know the results.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Sean,<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Find a "trusted" friend with Win 7 or 8.&nbsp; Follow the instructions above -- I just did it and it solved my problem.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Obviously there is something wrong with Journal. Mine has worked perfectly since installation (Win 8 to Win 8.1) and prior to that I used it a lot on XP. But today, something with the Journal print server failed and anything I tried to "print" would "print"
 to a file, but couldn't be opened. Old files that I had "printed" worked fine -- i.e. they would open in Journal.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So, after renaming the old Windows Journal folder to "Windows Journal OLD" and copying in a working copy, I have now been able to "print to Journal."<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Hope you can find a friend with Windows 7 or 8. (BTW - I copied a Win 7 version of Journal into my Win 8.1 tablet PC.)<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>God bless,<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>John.<br />

            <p>Hi Benjamin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have&nbsp; problem with journal on my surface pro 2 with windows 8.1. The problem is that I can't open some old journal files (which worked previously) which where printed from Word with the journal printer. The strange thing is that some of the old files
 work.</p>
<p>I have already contacted the microsoft surface support but I have to wait for their answer (regarding their help in the past I am not too optimistic).</p>
<p>I have read that there was a recent security update for journal (MS14-038).</p>
<p>Since the program worked before I assume that some Microsoft update corrupted the software.</p>
<p>Could you find any solution that works?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have to use the program nearly every day, so I am in need of a fast solution.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Benjamin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>not sure if that helps you. I have tried now the paste old version from my old Windows 7 notebook and it worked.</p>
<p>You have to copy the whole directory with all files and subdirectories, that means</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\programs\windows journal\</p>
<p>
</p><p>To save the old directory I have renamed it to "windows journal_bak".</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Anyway I'd like to see a REAL SOLUTION from Microsoft! This is just a workaround and I am not so happy to use a Windows 7 program with my critical data under Windows 8.1.</strong></p>

<p><span>Hi Brettos,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you are facing issues with Journal writer in Windows 8.1, then you can try repairing the Journal writer by following these steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press Windows key +X, select ‘Command prompt (Admin)’.</span></li><li><span>In the command prompt, change the directory to ‘</span><em><span>Drive</span></em><span>:\Program Files\Windows Journal’ (where drive is drive location where windows is installed).</span></li><li><span>By default the directory would be c:\Windows\System 32. To change the directory type “cd..” and press enter. This will take you to the previous folder. Once you come to the c: drive, type “cd
</span><span>Program Files” and then “cd Windows Journal”.</span></li><li><span>Once you are in the <em>Drive</em>:\Program Files\Windows Journal’ type the following command :</span></li></ol>
<p><strong><span>journal.exe /repairnotewriter</span></strong></p>

            Hey Kevin.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Which browser?  For Edge it's at at Settings (three dots at top right) then Settings link at bottom of list, then Clear Browsing History.  
<br />
<br />For Firefox it's in Settings  (three dots at top right), Privacy and Security &gt; Clear Browsing History.  
<br />
<br />Most others are found in the same place, but if you need to ask back I'll show you exactly. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
