    <title>Lock Screen Fails to Display Password Field after Inital Log-In - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Lock Screen Fails to Display Password Field after Inital Log-In</h2>
                    <p><span>Hi,</span><span> Folks!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I am having an unusual problem with logging onto my laptop which is running Windows 10 Pro. The initial log-in to my computer after
<span>startup</span> works perfectly. However, if I walk away from my computer, it will auto-lock after 15 minutes; the lock screen that follows does not have a field for password entry and I'm effectively locked out of my own device. In
<span>startup</span> works perfectly. However, if I walk away from my computer, it will auto-lock after 15 minutes; the lock screen that follows does not have a field for password entry and I'm effectively locked out of my own device. In
 case it matters, when my computer is plugged in it never goes to sleep and the screen turns off after 10 minutes of inactivity.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Presently, to resolve this issue, I am forced to restart the computer each time it locks itself. Obviously, I could disable the auto-lock function to work around this problem,
 but I prefer to keep my computer somewhat secure and a functional lock screen goes a long way.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Interestingly enough, this is only an issue when I run the Creator's update. I had this issue after updating about a month
<span>ago</span> and reverted which fixed my issue. Yesterday, I updated again hoping this problem was fixed. It's definitely not. As of this morning, I've already had to restart my computer three times.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have read quite a few posts about people switching to safe mode and then restarting their computer to fix a similar issue, but I don't think that's a
<span>viable</span> solution for me. Those posts appeared to focus on a lock screen that didn't prompt for password on initial startup.

<p><span>Has anyone else experienced
<span>an issue</span> similar to mine and, if so, how can I fix this without disabling my computer's auto-lock? Any help would be greatly appreciated.</span></p>

<p><span>The more I look online, it appears that quite a few people are having or have had issues with the password field not coming up for

<p>Same problem here. &nbsp;The only workaround ive found (besides disabling autolock) is to sign out rather than lock. &nbsp;It saves me from having to reboot the laptop - though i have to go thru the login process &amp; cant leave open work to come back to later. &nbsp;Hoping
 MS acknowledges the problem soon &amp; resolves in an update. &nbsp;Otherwise i will be rolling back from the creators update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>of note Im running win 10 pro w/ bitlocker enabled (wouldnt think that would matter...) &amp; i have an integrated bio reader (HP envy lt). &nbsp;No issues logging in following restart or logoff/logon - just when locking (ie WIN+L or inactivity timeout/sleep).</p>

<p>I've had this problem pop up a few times over a few different builds over the past year or so. In fact, it just happened again today (which prompted me to make this reply) I put my computer in hibernate, and when I go back to log in, I can't put in a password/pin.
 The field to enter it is just... not there. If I restart, the field reappears, but it's a hassle to restart windows again (along with all my open Chrome tabs). And if I were to have important unsaved work open, I could potentially lose that as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This doesn't happen every time. Just periodically, and over the course of multiple builds of windows 10. It's a minor annoyance, but one I hope might be solved. Next time it happens, I'll take a video and post it to the boards.&nbsp;</p>

                    I'm certain that Windows doesn't see correctly the disk size. Because of that in the recent years I have changed my first SSD boot drive with another, and then in the late January, with an one Terabyte spinning drive. Even&nbsp;I knew from the start that&nbsp;will
 considerably increase the booting&nbsp;and applications loading time, at least I have thought that I will not be running out of space. What wrong I was, just after around seven months the system is&nbsp;indicating &nbsp;only 309 GB free out of 930!? On this dive there are
 installed only Windows (20.6 GB) and some small size programs, (program files 3.44 GB and (x86) 5.69 GB). All of the larger programs and documents are on larger, separate drives. Even adding the around 8 GB paging files, the 8-9 for system restore, it doesn't
 summing up over 600 GB, and I'm afraid that they will be even more "growing". Even only about two-three months ago, when I have upgraded from Windows 7 Ultimate, to Windows 10 Professional, they were "on

            <p>Hi Lilly,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is your router a wireless router?&nbsp; If it is not properly-secured they may be connecting to your network through the signal it broadcasts (I can see the signals from 4 of my neighbors on my machine - two are secure and two are unsecure and if I were so inclined,
 I could piggyback my internet from their connection - but I would never do that since I could get infected through their network and because my own is a stronger and better connection and i have no need and of course because it is stealing).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Mike said, they are not really stealing your "IP address" (but they may be piggybacking off the signal being delivered to the router by the ISP through the router or they may have actually connected to the landline itself (the cable or the telephone line)
 and be connecting to the signal through that.&nbsp; In either case, I do not see how a record of their site visits would be appearing on your PC (unless by penetrating your router, they have also gained access to your local network and thus to the computers connected
 to it through it).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your router is wireless see the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>************************************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Typically, access to the router is by typing <a href="http://192.168.1.1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://192.168.1.1</a> (or whatever your gateway address is) into your browser address bar and you'll bring up the router's configuration settings. It will probably want a username and password. Sorry, I can't help you there because I have no idea what it might
 be. Try admin/admin or admin/password or administrator/admin or administrator/password or admin and no password or administrator and no password (the classic default settings). Your ISP or the router manufacturer's technical support department may be able
 to assist you with setting this up. After that, how to set up the security is completely dependent on the ISP, the router, the type of operating system you have, the type of internet connection you have and a number of other factors that I have no way of knowing
 even if you told me that information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Actually, to see if this even applies, go to Network and Sharing Center and click on Manage Wireless Connections. Select and double-click on your network. Click on the Security Tab and see if it is configured with entries in the first two drop boxes and
 dots in the Key indicating a password applies. If this does not exist, then there is no security on your wireless router. If it exists, then your network is probably secured.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you see the connection active, go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / and double click on Control Panel. Type IPCONFIG /ALL and see if you can identify this other computer connection. It should provide more information about it for identification
 purposes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your router is not secured, you need to secure it and that&nbsp;may well&nbsp;resolve the problem. If your router is secured, then you should change the router's password/key to see if that resolves the problem (and then you'll need to change the key to all your
 wireless network computers and devices to match the new one). If that still doesn't work, then post back and we'll come up with some other ideas (assuming the ISP or router manufacturer can't help you with this).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still, even if this is happening, unless they are actually accessing your computer to visit sites remotely and then reconfiguruing your setup so you have to do setup again (as a bit of added mischief), I don't see how normal piggybacking could cause the
 problems or the other site visits to show on your computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>******************************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your router is not wireless or you see the connection in Network Connections or IPCONFIG /ALL, then the problem may be either a direct connection to your wired connection from the ISP or you may be infected by malware that is allowing others to get to
 your computer itself through the internet (or acting on its own).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first is very difficult to check&nbsp;without the ISP digging up the connection&nbsp;all the way to your&nbsp;residence or monitoring activity when you are totally offline to see if any occurs&nbsp;(but I'll see if I can find a way of recording network activity and information
 about the connection in a log - or if there already is such a log available).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>***********************************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as malware goes, to check that please proceed as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, try the following programs if you haven't as they may help. I recommend you download, install, update, and run full scans with Malwarebytes:<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a> and SuperAntiSpyware:<a href="http://superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://superantispyware.com/</span></a>
 and then run a full Safety Scan from Microsoft:<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security/default.aspx</span></a>. These may or may not remove the infections, but will probably not repair
 any damage caused by them. Even if they or your current AV software seem to work or indicate you aren't infected, you shouldn't completely trust them and need to continue with the recommendations that follow (so it's up to you if you want to try them first
 or just skip over all of this and get the expert help you really need as described below).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Properly and completely removing such infections can be complex and often require manual removal procedures (which may or may not be entirely effective either). Even if they work, I'd suggest the following anyway, so we may as well start there (you can ignore
 the above removal methods if you want as this is really the way to go, but it won't hurt to try them).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It appears that somone has stolen my IP twice but, it is a landline with now router.When I get diagnosed it says that I have no IP addresss.&nbsp;I reconfigure my computer and things go back to normal. Once when I got back I saw a site that I had not visited.
 That is why I think someone is stealing my IP. How can&nbsp;find out for sure what is happening?&nbsp;IHow can I prevent this from happening again?</p>
</blockquote>
If by 'IP' you mean your IP address, you can't do that... &nbsp;Your PC settings are off (possible but less than likely) or your router is having issues- most likely settings. &nbsp;Your PC IP will be a public address (meaning anyone can use it on a private network...
 &nbsp;these numbers get used over and over again and are not addressable over the internet.) &nbsp;Your router has a private IP address that is internet routable, and cannot be used by more than one user at a time. &nbsp;It may be static or dynamic, but that depends on your
 ISP. &nbsp;Your router does NAT (network address translation) to 'route' traffic that comes to it's address to your PC's IP address.

    <title>Unable to install security update kb2920189, error code 800f0922 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> luluninot  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to install security update kb2920189, error code 800f0922</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Quick brief of my situation before my question:</p>
<p>1 - Got a malware that I could not get rid of. It was messing with my computer</p>
<p>2 - Decided to factory reset and start over</p>
<p>3 - After the factory reset, I started having trouble to install the big list of updates I had available. Kept getting the message "Failure configuring windows update... reverting changes... Do not turn off your computer"&nbsp;</p>
<p>4 - Followed the steps on&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/949358" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/949358</a>&nbsp;and managed to manually&nbsp;install almost all updates in a clean boot state, 5 at a time, until the big update list was almost
 over</p>
<p>5 - That way I could isolate the problem to find out the issue was one single Security Update, the KB2920189. This only update keeps falling to install no matter what I do (uninstalling anti-virus and anti-malware, clean boot, unplug removable media, troubleshooting).
 Error code is always 800F0922</p>
<p>6 - Troubleshooting finds the following problems: "Potential Windows Update database error detected 0x80070490" together with "Windows Update components must be repaired". But even when troubleshoot says these problems are fixed, KB2920189 still won't install</p>
<p>7 - I wanted to follow the steps displayed here&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-windows_update/unable-to-install-security-update-kb2920189-error/9a021b0b-61a4-47de-90d7-a45f98420adf?page=3">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-windows_update/unable-to-install-security-update-kb2920189-error/9a021b0b-61a4-47de-90d7-a45f98420adf?page=3</a>
 &nbsp; but they told me to start my own thread, so here I go:</p>
<p>
</p><p>What could I do to solve this problem?</p>

            Hi Lyle, that is caused by a Visual C++ runtime library corruption, setpoint uses the 2012 version of that library, you should download and install that to resolve this error . . .

            I have already downloaded this and the problem is not resolved. The problem started today after we had a power outage while I was on the computer. I have 17 different versions of Microsoft Visuals C++ runtime on my computer now you would think that one
 would take care of this issue <br />

            There are three other actions which you can undertake
<br />
<br />1. Restore from a system restore point to a point when things were working fine
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/...</a>
<br />
<br />2. If the issue has been caused due to recent Windows update - I would suggest that you uninstall the latest KB update  and hide it so that it doesn't install it automatically and wait for new update to come which will be installed automatically.
<br />
<br />To know which update got installed
<br />Windows Key+i to invoke Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Click View installed update history.  These KBs should be from the below list. Don't uninstall any other KB
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4099479" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4099479</a>
<br />Make note of KB and uninstall and block it.
<br />Uninstall
<br />Windows Key + R &gt; Type: appwiz.cpl &gt; Enter &gt; Click View installed updates &gt; Select the required updates, right click, uninstall.
<br />Block
<br />Microsoft has provided a tool Show/Hide Updates tool to block the update
<br />Download the tool from below link
<br /><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />When you run this troubleshooter, it will search for available updates and list them
<br />Select the update which you want to hide. Click Next and follow on-screen directions
<br />
<br />3. Perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/16397-repair-install-windows-10-place-upgrade.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/16397-repai...</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help. If above didn't work, I will supply more troubleshooting steps to solve this problem.

<p>What game ? Disc based or download from Steam or other online retailer ?</p>
<p>Do you have adequate HDD/SSD space ? </p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"...but the first time my game files got corrupt as i had the antivirus on"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Your AV may block the game from installing, which can be prevented by disabling the AV temporarily,</p>
<p>but it would not generally corrupt files when doing so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the games files were corrupted before the install completed (even if not corrupted having files in the install folder may</p>
<p>prevent a subsequent attempt at installing to that location) you would want to delete the games install folder,</p>
<p>and clear the <em>Temp</em> folder (which could also cause a problem) before trying to install the game again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try running Window <em>Disk Cleanup</em> to clear the Temp folder ( <em>Start Menu &gt; Windows Administrative Tools</em> folder).</p>

<h2>            Modern Setup Host has stopped working</h2>
                    <p>When I was downloading Windows 10&nbsp;I got this message "Modern Setup Host has stopped working". I am running 8.1 64bit.
</p>
<p>The computer I have (HP Envy 700 PC Series) came with Windows 8 and I upgrade it a few days to 8.1 to be ready for Windows 10.
</p>
<p>I never got the icon for the update but I went to the Microsoft Insider and got the link.&nbsp;I did&nbsp;a&nbsp;clean boot (I followed a link someone posted to use) but&nbsp;after I retried the download for 10 it showed me the same message about the Host.
<br />
This is my system info if it might be of help<br />

            <p>I am running into the same issue. I am running Windows 8.1 on a custom build PC. The Modern Setup Host successfully downloads Windows 10, continues to "Create Windows 10 Media", gets to 100% complete and an error box pops up saying "Modern Setup Host has
 stopped working. A problem caused the program to stop working correctly. Windows will close the program and notify you if a solution is available."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have closed the Modern Setup Host and attempted three times now. I have also completely shut down my PC and rebooted.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far, no luck. Please let me know a fix!</p>

            <p>I used win10 preview on old Toshiba A200 (as a test bed for claims that it will run on older PC's)</p>
<p>It ran well, and I reverted PC to Windows 8.1 pro with Media centre, with all my programs running well. I tried media creation tool and downloaded Win10 Pro 32 bit/64bit (as both choice). when I tried an install from DVD burnt from ISO that was downloaded,
 I got install failed. Not only that, It screwed up my Windows 8.1 booting for ever with no recovery.</p>
<p>I had to revert to Windows 8 pro, then upgrade to 8.1 pro. apply every patch available, and reserve win 10 again. then tried a new&nbsp;upgrade from exe file on dvd. Now the dreaded "modern setup host has failed". Booting DVD and installing clean from DVD it
 installs OK but I need a Key to activate (NOT FREE). and cannot personalise win 10 until activated. What a crock, cannot windows 10 interrogate windows.old and activate as free?????&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I forgot to say that I downloaded the Win10 Pro 64bit (choice) and burnt a new DVD for the 2nd attempt (where I got "modern host has failed"</p>

            Technically you can do a clean install and skip the Product Key and when Windows 10 is done it would be activated. This was what I heard the someone ask Microsoft and it would work but sadly it didn't. What I did was to reset to factory settings then install
 all updates and check for more updates then upgrade to Windows 10 by opening the files that are in the USB not booting it. You can only do it this way to upgrade your PC to Windows 10. If you booted it and press upgrade it will say that you need to upgrade
 through your Windows Update. If you don't mind losing everything maybe try restoring to factory setting to see if it works plus it's more or less like a clean install.

 needed to wait for the update&nbsp;or what made it different this time but if anyone else had issues from using the link from the Insider&nbsp;and it failed maybe getting the download like I did from registering to get the&nbsp;notification will work? I&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;post this
 to let everyone who helped me to try all the different things know I thank you all very much and also to let you know about my update status.&nbsp;Should I come across any further issues I will be sure to post</p>

            <p>I have cracked it on my Old Toshiba A200 (Win8.1 Pro). </p>
<p>Downloaded Language English (United States). I was installed with English (United Kingdom).</p>
<p>Went into 'Control Panel', 'Language', then 'Change Date, Time, or Number Formats'.</p>
<p>Changed everything to English (United States). [format English (United States), set 'Match Windows display language' etc. Including Current System Locale (under the 'Administrative' Tab).</p>
<p>The Failing setup I was trying to do the initial install on was&nbsp;"English (United&nbsp;Kingdom)", &nbsp;Locale&nbsp;&nbsp;"Australia".</p>
<p>Then using the 'MediaCreationToolx64.exe' program, I chose install on this PC and it went straight on&nbsp;to do a clean Install/Upgrade. (Without the dreaded "something has happened" dead end!)&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only issue I have now is I only have a 1024 x768 resolution screen, whereas when I was running the preview of Windows 10, I had a good display resolution. That's the next challenge getting an Nvidia display driver to suit.</p>
<p>Thanks go to many other's who have issues installing the Win10 preview from Window 7 writing up about the language issue.
</p>
<p>Too bad that I now have to re-install all the programs that I had running and lost when I had to rebuild back from clean install of Win 8 pro, through a million updates, then upgrade to Win 8.1 pro, and many more updates. before cracking it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Windows 10 development seem to have had blinkers on to the big wide world when you need to set language to English (US) to get of the ground.

            Has anyone found a solution to this? &nbsp; I installed 10 on my surface pro 2 and it went perfectly. &nbsp;But when I tried to upgrade on my Windows 7, &nbsp;I ran into this error. &nbsp;I getting closer to just blocking the upgrade completely.&nbsp;

    <title>Cannot install .net framework 3.5 in Surface Pro - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alexkven  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot install .net framework 3.5 in Surface Pro</h2>
                    <p>Today I got my new Surface Pro 128gb, and I needed the .net Framework 3.5 for an application. I got this stupid error code 0x800F0906, and a message that said that says there is no internet connection, when there is. The add or remove features route doesn't
 work&nbsp;either. I searched around and found out that I need to insert the Windows 8 installation disk (because your stupid downloader has failed, and is now insufficient, I guess). One problem: Surface pro doesn't come with a disk and has no disk drive. So I
 need to download the Windows 8 Enterprise trial! A 3.25 GB download, that'll take hours. So let me get this straight:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>To download the .net framework 3.5 on a Surface Pro in order to run a <u>small program</u>, I have to download the whole Windows 8 disk, all because your stupid automatic installer can't even correctly report a fricking&nbsp;internet connection? What has the
 world come to? This is insane!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Is there another way to install the framework? Like, how it worked back in Windows 7? You know, when I didn't have to download Windows to install the .net framework?</p>

            <p>Would it help to download the .NET Framework 3.5 Full Package? It's about 200MB and does not require an internet connection to install like the normal bootstrap installer.</p>

            No, this is not working, because it gives me the same dialog box as before, and won't allow me to install it the way it used to be installed. Even worse, the other way with the downloaded Windows 8 iso doesn't work for no reason whatsoever. This sucks.

            <p>Hello fellow Surface Pro users trying to install .net 3.5. If it is failing with error 0x800F0906 like above then try this, it worked for me. I have my surface fully updated and had this problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Open an elevated cmd</p>
<p>2. Run "dism /online /enable-feature /featurename:NetFx3"&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. It will begin to download files :).</p>
<p>4. Go into program features and enable the .net 3.5 features and your all set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: </p>
<p>I tried lots of things and nothing worked except this. Make sure you actually have connectivity and if for some reason it doesn't work try refreshing windows as I did this beforehand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps more than previous posts linking to that stupid&nbsp;support article that doesn't work :).&nbsp;</p>

            <p>There can be two reasons for this. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1st, load the image or disk for Windows 8 into a drive</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then extend the DISM command</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DISM /Online /Enable-Feature /FeatureName:NetFx3 /All /LimitAccess /Source<em>:imagedrive:</em>\sources\sxs</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This forces the Enable Feature function to use the local installation files from your disk image instead of try to download them. Make sure the version of image matches your version of Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then if you still have a problem you need to repair the Windows Image (thanks to

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reboot the computer and try the DISM command again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it is working the command is noticeably longer to run. Did this last night and once I was using a 8.1 ISO for my test PC it worked.</p>

            If you do a search you will find the ISO image available on line. Windows 8 will load an ISO into a virtual drive by default which can then be referenced to in the DISM command.&nbsp;In fact you only need the&nbsp;\sources\sxs folder.&nbsp;

            <p>Now it has gotten even more interesting.&nbsp; I did not get this completed and I have also upgraded to 8.1 since.&nbsp; (They did not fix tis bug in Windows 8.1 by the way.&nbsp; It still fails the same way)&nbsp; I assume I am going to now need a Windows 8.1 ISO which does
 not seem to available.&nbsp; I have tried a few of the tricks listed to get the ISO but they don't work because of the key type used by the Surface install.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This is beyond amazing that there is not a way to get and ISO for the surface install and this problems has not been resolved.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>How does one go about escalating this to Microsoft?</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might be experiencing this issue due to a driver conflict causing graphical artifacts and screen flickering when playing games. Conflicts are usually caused by damage driver files or improperly updated drivers. Since you mentioned that you have already
 hidden the problematic Intel driver update but still having flickering issues, we suggest that you
<em>perform a clean boot</em> to isolate the cause of the issue. An incompatible app or program can cause your screen to flicker and this troubleshooting method is designed to isolate if this issue is caused by a startup program or service. For steps on how
 to perform a clean boot, you can refer to the following link: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Sound stopped working - can&#39;t set default device - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> makeshiftwings  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sound stopped working - can&#39;t set default device</h2>
                    Hi all.&nbsp; I've got an Asus P5B-E motherboard with an integrated SoundMAX sound card, and Vista Ultimate.&nbsp; My sound was working fine, but I decided to update my sound driver to the latest version.&nbsp; After that, the sound stopped working.&nbsp; Here is basically
 what happens:<br />
<br />
- Boot up with no driver installed, and Windows auto-detects the sound card and installs the default High Definition Audio Device.&nbsp; The volume control has a red x, and if I open the Volume Mixer it says "No audio device is installed."&nbsp; If I go to Playback Devices,
 I can see speakers and SPDIF, and both of them are enabled and say "Working", but when I click on either, the "Set Default" button remains grayed out and I can't click it.&nbsp; If I right-click on them and choose "Disable" or "Test", nothing happens.&nbsp; If I switch
 to the "Recording Devices" tab, it shows my recording devices but then hangs and I have to manually kill the task.&nbsp; (Process Explorer shows that it's stuck in a loop spawning new rundll32.exe processes).<br />
<br />
- I install the SoundMAX drivers, and it tells me to reboot the computer.&nbsp; After rebooting, Device Manager shows that it installed correctly and it says "The Device is working".&nbsp; No yellow exclamation marks.&nbsp; The driver correctly notices when I plug speakers
 into the back and pops up a speaker configuration window.&nbsp; But the volume control remains exactly as before, except now the Speakers and such say "SoundMAX Integrated Audio" instead of "High Definition Audio Device".&nbsp; But I still can't click Set Default and
 it still hangs on the Recording Devices tab.<br />
<br />
Here are a few things I've tried:<br />
<br />
1) Uninstalled/reinstalled the sound card drivers multiple times, using every version of the Vista SoundMAX drivers I could find (including the ones that were originally on there and working fine), and a few XP ones just in case.&nbsp; Deleted all SoundMAX files
 and every registry key with the word "SoundMAX" in it before reinstalling.&nbsp; I tried installing using the setup program, and by doing it manually through Device Manager.<br />
<br />
2) Tried installing the Realtek generic HD drivers.&nbsp; These didn't work at all (Yellow exclamation mark in Device Manager).<br />
<br />
3) Messed with the Windows Audio and Audio Endpoint services, starting and restarting or disabling and re-enabling; no change.<br />
<br />
4) Followed some advice on the web that had me manually reinstall my Plug and Play Software Device Enumerator.&nbsp; No change.<br />
<br />
5) Disabled and enabled the sound in BIOS.<br />
<br />
6) Reinstalled chipset drivers and flashed BIOS to the latest version.<br />
<br />
7) Ran scandisk and sfc, deleted all the audio files in system32 and ran sfc to replace them with fresh versions.<br />
<br />
8) Unplugged and plugged in the speakers and tried all the other jacks.<br />
<br />
I've done a lot of searching on the net but can't find many people who have the same problem (Seeing their devices but not being able to click Set Default).&nbsp; Anyone have any ideas?<br />

            makeshiftwings, I would like you to try the following and tell me what your results are:<br />
<br />
Start your Windows up in safemode and test your audio device, tell me if it works, if it does then we might be looking at a driver issue, if it does not then you might have a hardware issue:<br />
<a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/323ef48f-7b93-4079-a48a-5c58eec904a11033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Start your computer in safe mode</a><br />
<br />
Next I would like to know, is this an embedded audio device on your motherboard or is it a PCI or external one?<br />
<br />
Try a system restore, this will usually roll back all system changes (drivers, parts of registry, system data), and reset it back to before you started having this issue:<br />
<ul>
<p><br />
The System Restore tool</p>
<p>If the issue that you are experiencing started occurring recently, you can use the System Restore tool. By using this tool, you can restore the computer to an earlier point in time. Using the System
 Restore tool may not necessarily help you determine the issue. When you use System Restore to restore the computer to a previous state, programs and updates that you installed are removed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To restore the operating system to an earlier point in time, follow these steps:
</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Click
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Start</span><span>, type
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">system restore</span><span> in the
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Start Search</span><span> box, and then click
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">System Restore</span><span> in the
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Programs</span><span> list. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Continue</span><span>.
</span></li><li><span>In the
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">System Restore</span><span> dialog box, click
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Choose a different restore point</span><span>, and then click
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Next</span><span>.
</span></li><li><span>In the list of restore points, click a restore point that was created before you began to experience the issue, and then click
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Next</span><span>.
</span></li><li><span>Click
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Finish</span><span>.</span></li></ol>
<p>The computer restarts, and the system files and settings are returned to the state that they were in at the time that the restore point was created.
</p>
</ul>

<h2>            The payment option on an existing subscription was declined, blocking this purchase.</h2>
                    While playing a game that came with Xbox Game Pass my game crashed so I restarted my Xbox and let it cool down and when I tried to open the game back up it said: Sign in or renew the subscription. I thought my Xbox Game Pass subscription had expired. I
 tried to renew it, but it said: The payment option on an existing subscription was declined, blocking this purchase. I don't fully understand what it meant by that.

<p>Hi,&nbsp; I have owned and played the Microsoft game Pandora's box for over 10 years and it&nbsp;is time to make a back up copy because it is well played and i am waiting for the day the disc will no longer work. The game is a hard one to find for sale</p>
<p>The back up copy installs without problem but when it comes to playing the game it closes&nbsp;and&nbsp;i receive the following error message:-</p>
<p>microsoft visual C++ runtime library. abnormal program termination</p>
<p>C\program files\microsoft games \ pandora's box \ pandora exe</p>
<p>I have searched the forums for help with runtime errors and most people are signposted to the software maker that appears to be causing the problem.&nbsp; In this case as it is a microsoft game i hope you may be able to help me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help much appreciated</p>
<p>thanks</p>

<p><span>Hi Stromydays_uk,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to access the link below and download the Pandora Box update and install it and
 check if it helps you fix the run time error issue. This contains the latest modified file of Pandora.exe.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Lynne 57, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to the forum and it's a pleasure assisting you today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know how important it is for you to be able to get your emails and deliver them as well. You can rest assured that I'll do my best to help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>For our initial troubleshooting step,&nbsp;please reconfigure your account in Windows Live Mail. Do this by removing then re-adding your account. It is possible that there is a problem with&nbsp;the settings that's
 why you encountered the error. Also check if there are emails stuck in Outbox , if there are,&nbsp;kindly&nbsp;delete them.</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">For instructions on how to modify your account in Windows Live Mail, please visit this&nbsp;</span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/mail-add-email-account-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span><font color="#0033cc">link</font></span></b></a></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<font color="#000000"><font>
<p><font><font><strong>Note:</strong> Before removing an account, check that the messages you want saved are available when you sign in to the web version. If some of your messages are available only in the mail client, export your messages
 before removing the account.</font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, if you're still unable to to get back online after reconfiguring your account, I've provided steps below on how you can re-establish the connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1. Make sure that&nbsp;your default browser is Internet Explorer.</span><br />
<span>2.&nbsp;Check your computer’s Internet Connection. Verify if Internet Explorer is offline.</span><br />
<span>a) Open Internet Explorer browser.</span><br />
<span>b) From the menu bar, click <strong>File</strong>. (If menu is not shown, press
<strong>Alt</strong> button on your keyboard)</span><br />
<span>c) Uncheck <strong>Work offline</strong> by clicking on it.</span><br />
<span>d) From Windows Live Mail, click <strong>Send/Receive</strong> button. If you are being asked to go online, click
<strong>Yes</strong>.</span><br />
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Hello&nbsp;floresrox
<div><br />
<div>Try unchecking the "Log with secure authentication" in your account logon properties. it worked for me when I was getting similar messages as described in this post.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Appreciate if community gurus can throw more light on this aspect if I am not clear enough.</div>
