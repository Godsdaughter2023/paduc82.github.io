<p>Strange, I've not check this feature in my past days with Win 7. But on your mention I try to do it.</p>
<p>My COMMAND PROMPT also did not respond on (alt+enter) even with Admin privilege. But I did not get any message.</p>
<p>Compatibility Tab of CMD.exe properties is disabled by default_Why?</p>
<p>What's the different bloick the COMMAND PROMPT to run in "Full screen" mode in Win 7.</p>
<p>Although it's not a biggie.</p>

<h2>            MSKLC .Net framework error</h2>
                    When I try to install Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator I get an error saying I do not have .Net framework. When I download it from the page, it tells me it is already installed. I tried repairing it, but that did not help. I read that the problem occurs
 because the program only looks for .net framework v1.1 and not higher versions. How can I fix this?

            <p>That's really not the purpose of Movie Maker... so unsurprisingly the answer is "no" there is no batch processing of videos.&nbsp; There are other programs that can do a batch convert and resize (Freemake Video Converter is one example).&nbsp; I believe you can also
 script things like applying a grayscale effect in something like VirtualDub and/or AviSynth... but I'm not 100% sure, and it is really outside the scope of this forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To do what you want in Movie Maker, you would have to load one video, apply a Grayscale effect and then save the movie.&nbsp; Then you would clear the project, and repeat with the next video.&nbsp; But that obviously isn't a batch process.&nbsp; I suppose you could try
 to do it with macros or scripting... but again, outside the scope of this forum.</p>

<h2>            Xbox 360 2 rings, power brick yellow light&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>My xbox had been working but then one day my fan got loud as hell and it shut off and got 2 rings, i opened it and thoroughly dusted it so dont say thats the problem. it might just be overheated and screwed but my power brick has had an amber light for a
 while and i read that means the brick is overheating. could a bad brick possible cause 2 red lights? should i buy another powerbrick or is there no chance that it isnt due to my brick? Yes i have considered buying a new console but i am hoping it can be as
 easy as buying a new cord</p>

<p>Nothing is wrong with the brick. If there was something wrong with the brick it would have a red light. Two red lights means that your console is to hot.

            <p>Hi Mohit,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you want to install Windows 8.1 on your laptop but it asks you to convert the drive to GPT before installing Windows 8.1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest you to make a backup of all the software’s that you have and make a note of the license key if applicable. As you are converting the MBR drive to GPT so it will delete all the data you have on the disk.</p>
<p>You may convert MBR drive to GPT by using some 3<sup>rd</sup> party Application which claims to convert the drive type without you losing any files.</p>

<p>I have followed your instructions but cannot find the version of Outlook, the only options on the screen being new, reply and mark as read.&nbsp; My email address is a Hotmail one.&nbsp; The trouble started when my Windows Store mail app, which I'd been using for
 over 4 years stopped working although another email account (Yahoo) is working fine.&nbsp; After about 2 weeks the app started receiving all my old emails but wouldn't send and still remains in this situation.&nbsp; I had tried the Outlook app years ago but found it
 a little too fussy for my purpose but in desperation I returned to it.&nbsp; When I set the laptop up I used my brother's email as being a complete beginner I had yet to set up my own.&nbsp; The Outlook app went immediately to the Yahoo email and I couldn't access my
 Hotmail account by any means.&nbsp; Finally I added my email to the Yahoo account and eventually moved everything across and I think the account is working in both the receipt and sending of emails.&nbsp; Having come to the technology of emails etc late in life I am
 unsure how&nbsp; my Windows mail app and Outlook are connected.&nbsp; Therefore if possible I would like the Windows app working again but am afraid that any attempt to fix it ie: reloading it again would affect the Yahoo account working on it and the connected Outlook
 account.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I am still receiving emails on the Windows app will my Outlook account be safe to use in the foreseeable future because I would hate for that to fail too?&nbsp; If it is any help I bought the laptop in January 2013 and loaded all the apps in the
 weeks that followed, cautiously and with the help of a Windows manual being a complete beginner.&nbsp; I would be satisfied in knowing that my email address will be safe for use on the Outlook account even though I prefer the Windows app.

            Hi Susan,<br />
<br />
<br />
If your concern is with losing any files or emails with your account, then you don't have to worry if you are using IMAP or Exchanged server. IMAP is the recommended method when you need to check your emails from several different devices, such as a phone,
 laptop, and tablet. To know more about POP and IMAP, you can refer to this <strong>

    <title>windows 10 mapped network drive icons changing location address - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> roberthembree  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 10 mapped network drive icons changing location address</h2>
                    I have a network location ( i.e. //networklocal/stuff ), I can map the drive in windows 10 and it would become ( z:/stuff). Located on this network drive is a program that needs a "working local drive" to be able run ( z:/stuff/program.exe). Once I create
 the desktop icon and make sure the paths are set for the mapped drive (z:/stuff/program.exe) not the network path (//networklocal/stuff/program.exe) the icon will work flawlessly. The issue I am having is that once the computer is restarted it changes the
 icon from the mapped path to the network path, thus making the icon unusable until it is changed back to the correct path by hand. How can I make it so that the icon wont change when the computer is restarted?

<h2>            Power supply smells like smoke, is really hot and making a loud noise.</h2>
                    <p>I contacted Microsoft today over chat to let them know my sons Xbox One Power Supply smells like smoke, is hot and is making a loud noise. &nbsp;I'm somewhat concerned that something is wrong but to my dismay Microsoft told me it is out of warranty. Honestly, I&nbsp;don't care if it is out of warranty or not, if this device has some catastrophic melt down I'm going to be blaming Microsoft and their poor customer service. &nbsp;I am so sick of Microsoft and their crappy customer service considering how much I spend on games, devices, etc. &nbsp;I guess Microsoft is so big that they don't care about any possible damage due to a faulty product. &nbsp;Huge disappointment.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Battery with Yellow Triangle Warning Symbol on new laptop</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I searched here and elsewhere and found a few leads, but no answer that I could directly translate to what I am seeing here. Hope I haven't overlooked something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see a yellow triangle with an exclamation mark on the battery symbol in the notification tray of Windows 10 Home.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The laptop is brand new, ex factory, just set it up and had this symbol from day one. I ran the in built battery diagnostics from Acer which came up with "good" condition for the battery. There is no further explanation by windows what migh be the issue.
 Only the exclamation mark. The laptop behaves as expected, no battery issues, no charging issues.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no info when hovering over that symbol, all that I get with all the right and left clicks is the battery settings an power plan options. No hint there about anything causing any issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really don't see any problems with this new machine, just this warning symbol makes me wonder. Does anyone have a clue what this means, and how to get rid of it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot!</p>

<h2>            Game boosting and achievement boosting. </h2>
                    
<p>I just wanted to open a discussion about boosting for leaderboards an for achievement points. To be honest what is the deal with people who have to do this? Do saying you earned game points you didn't make you a better
 gamer? I know someone who has 80000 gamer score he has achievements in all these games but you can tell he unlocked these achievement through means not known to me. When an achievement is unlocked online you can see a date when you unlocked it when your on
 xbox.com. He has the summer and spring achievement in Texas heat for full house poker with no date. Now the only way you can play texas heat is online. So if he has no date on this he had to get it through means not ethical. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not bringing this up to call this person a cheat. The reason I am bringing this up is to talk about what is ethical in online gaming. All of us who are in this community have played games where we know for a fact
 that the person has either modded the game or boosted their score up on the leaderboards. This to me is sad that people have to do this. The only person who is being cheated when you boost is yourself. You are losing the great stories that many games have
 because you don't want to spend the hours of game play unlocking the achievements the way they were meant to be done. Also when you boost on the leaderboards you are only hurting yourself because you are losing the hours of game play that not only you share
 in the community, but you also lose skills that you could learn by just simply playing the game. So this is to anyone who has the feeling they have to do this; you are just hurting yourself. &nbsp;Feel free to comment as I really want to open this topic up for
 a true discussion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He was talking about achievements that can't be earned offline, those have to have dates on them. Therefor, they are (almost certainly) modded if they have no datestamp.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But if I recall correctly, there's already two topics on boosting being cheating. Is this topic different?</p>
<p>Either way, you said something about missing out on the story if you boost achievements. I don't see how, since you can't boost story related achievements.</p>

<p>OP you are using terminology loosely. If someone has an online achievement earnt offline the term boosting is incorrect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hack/modded/gamesaved - unlocked achievements or leaderboard score without playing the game</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Boosted - got mates to stand still while you shoot them or beat them in races - can work for achievements and leaderboards</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The discussion about whether boosting as I describe it is ok or not has been done to death in other threads. I think the general feeling in the community is leaderboard boosting and hacking is never ok. Achievement boosting gets a mixed response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not sure anyone can defend profile hacking where thousands of achievements are unlocked without the game having been played.</p>

<p>To be honest I don't want to discuss cheating or boosting as much as the ethical implications on it. Not many people take the time to think about that. One good question I read on here was, "Is using a fight stick that has turbo online cheating?" To me anything
 that gives a player an unfair advantage over others in online is cheating. Modded controllers, boosting leaderboard points, using a mod to change the game values and yes turbo button controllers. Also What I said about losing story lines comes because the
 person I talked about not only boosted his online achievement scores but is single player games as well. In a month time he went from 25000 odd points to 85000 odd points. Some of the games the game play would be hours upon to do; while others no one can be
 found online doing it. As a result the ethical implications are that I for one do not want to be in a game with him. The other is that he missed out on some great gaming stories such as fall out 3. Which is one of the games he did not have completed in this
 time. Now to be honest I know the program he used to boost his achievement scores. I have seen the disk in wal-mart for less than 20 dollars but it is something I myself would never use.
</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;If we talk ethics for a while instead of just calling people out maybe the people doing these things will learn that what they are doing is wrong. Just because you can do something doesn't mean you should. For instance; if you happen to walk in to a gas
 station and see the register unattended but it is open, should you take the money? The answer is no, but most people today would. It is the same with cheating on a game most people would. Besides hurting themselves it can do such damage as *** up the servers.
 Some of the cheats I have seen can even *** up others game play, and for what because you do not like them? &nbsp;The ethics are simple these games are online to be a test of skill, but if you have to be unscrupulous to win then you are not going to get any better.
</p>
<p>&nbsp; These are just my views read them if you wish. Respond if you wish, but please think about this as an ethical discussion not one to call out gamers. &nbsp;Although there should be a place to call out the cheaters on what they are doing.

<p>Or that person have no life at all.&nbsp; There is alot of easy 1000 point games out there. But we don't know whole story. If is a no lifer. Then that person need to get a job. And if he or she hack it. Then they should be reset of 0. And sayed they cheated there
 gamerscoer.&nbsp; I have alot achievement with no date stamps. But most of them where earned before I joined LIVE.</p>

                    Is it worth the dnload being as old as it is? N the price it is on demand? I'm getting skyrim and I wonder if it will help with the story? Or u could suggest something better on demand?

<p>Old doesn't come into it, it one of the best games available on the 360. &nbsp;yeah, not everyone liked, so you'll have people telling you it's rubbish, but you get that with every game. &nbsp;i dunno how much it is, so can't really comment, but like most GOD titles,
 you will probably be cheaper picking it up in store. &nbsp;Add to that, you'll get the GOTY version which has most of the DLC included such as - Shivering Isles ,KotN and a few of the small pieces of DLC. &nbsp;which when you look at how much it will cost you to purchase
 them separately on LIVE it's a no brainer that you should order this from elsewhere and get the full package.</p>

<p>I'm not knocking you for saying it's rubbish, after all, not everyone is going to like every game, however, how can you possibly say a game is rubbish after only playing it for 5 minutes?&nbsp; Especially a game that has 100's of hours worth of content attached
 to it.&nbsp; I disliked the game initially too, but it's a whole different kettle of fish once you get your character going.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you use this guide?&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/networking/nat-error-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/networking/nat-error-solution</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Whether you are wired or wireless, it doesn't really matter with NAT issues, as the NAT is part of your routers Network translation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you having issues connecting to online games?&nbsp; Have you enabled UPnP in your router settings?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is another suggestion too:&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Disconnect all of your devices from your home Wi-Fi network.&nbsp; If your console is in 'Instant on', turn it off completely.&nbsp; Power cycle your router.&nbsp; Wait about 5 minutes for your router to re-establish a connection to your ISP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When your router is reconnected, turn on your console and connect back to Xbox Live.&nbsp; Making sure that no other devices (laptops, tablets, phone's, Smart TV's etc.) are connecting to your router.&nbsp; Do the network test. Does your console report an open NAT?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it does, great, now reconnect all of your other devices to your network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are still having issues, could you please provide us with the make and model of your router please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

            Hello!<br />
<br />
Do you have multiple devices doing NAT on your network?&nbsp; Such as a modem/router from your ISP and another router connected to that one?&nbsp; Double NAT is a very common cause of having a strict NAT type.

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just a reminder that if you did not set up a static IP address for your console when you set up port forwarding then you are eventually going to have to set it up again. The Ip address to the xbox will change on its own over time if a static IP was never
 set up. Hope this helps!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you still have UPnP on? If so, turn it off, it won't work with a port forward.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you give your console a static ip address?</p>

<p>Yeah the people at Comcast said to open the ports then turn UPNP on so I turned off the port forwarding and it fixed it so thank you!</p>

<p>I'm not sure why this would happen. Possibly, the account has been hijacked or reverted in some way during the upgrade process. You can try generic credentials like "admin" to sign into the account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, it sounds more like someone changed your password internally somehow. If this is the case, you may need to fresh install your previous version of Windows. If you have any files on your computer that you'd like to save, you'll need to fish them out
 by use of a few methods.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You'll need to let me know what resources you have available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't have any precious files, you can simply proceed to fresh installing your previous version of Windows. When doing this, I'd like you to follow the instructions provided in the Advanced Troubleshooting method to ensure the cleanest possible recovery
 here. </p>

<p>
</p><p>If you can, please prepare your Windows 10 installation disc ahead of time—you'll need it to properly perform the upgrade&nbsp;to Windows 10&nbsp;once the previous version of Windows has been installed and activated. All of the information on how to create a Windows

<h2>            Can RDP traffic cause a lot of bandwidth utilization&#63;</h2>
                    I only have a 1mbps connection and running a cloud. Mostly I connect to it using RDP on the cloud server, and stream a movie since cloud servers have a great deal of bandwidth, since I am using RDP connection to do this, audio sometimes comes delayed.
 Anyway, I only do this just to see if the RDP traffic would cause so much bandwidth to my internet connection.

<h2>            TDR windows 7 &#34;display driver stopped responding and has recovered&#34;</h2>
                    I need help. My Lenovo Z470 keeps having black screens then recovers. It states that my Intel HD 3000 driver has a problem and sometimes my nvidia GT 540m driver or kernel module. Often times, the application that was running while having a black screen
 crashes. I have tried reinstalling my laptop with both Windows 7 and 8. On windows 7, my screen recovers but on Windows 8, it doesn't and results to a VIDEO TDR FAILURE. I have tried the registry fix "TdrDelay" = 8. I already tried reinstalling the GPU drivers
 both from the laptop manufacturer's website and the GPU manufacturer's website.

            <p>Hi Armen,<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This behavior can occur due to&nbsp;the following reasons:</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>a. You may need to install the latest updates for your display driver.</p>
<p>b. Visual effects or too many programs running in the background may be slowing your PC down.</p>
<p>c. The GPU is taking more time than permitted to display graphics to your monitor.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to try the steps in the article and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello j jens,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please confirm the most recent KB update that your computer is trying to install. To check, refer to the steps below:
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click on <strong><em>Start</em></strong>, select <strong><em>Control Panel</em></strong>.<strong><em><br />
</em></strong></li><li>Click on <em>System and Security</em><strong><em>,</em></strong> then click on
<strong><em>Windows Update.</em></strong></li><li>On the left pane, select <em><strong>View update history</strong></em></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>Furthermore, there are many reasons why you might receive an error message when updating on Windows 7,
</span><span>but common errors can be fixed by following the steps in this <strong>

<p>Usually that error occurs when Windows Update offers a hardware driver update which are things you never want to install from Windows Update:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you mean you are seeing something like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/357f7bd2-8031-4f8a-aafc-da8ea26b2498" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/357f7bd2-8031-4f8a-aafc-da8ea26b2498" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>That message is telling you that the driver update offered from Windows Update is an older or lesser version than the currently installed driver or has a lower compatibility rating than the installed driver.&nbsp; That means you probably don't want that update
 and you should be glad the installation is failing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is generally not a good idea to accept hardware driver updates (video, audio, network, printer) offered by Windows Update and if you ever see them it is best to hide them so you never see them again.&nbsp; Only get hardware driver updates from your hardware
 manufacturers WWW site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just because Microsoft offers you a driver update does not mean you have an out of date or afflicted driver and it certainly doesn't mean you have to install the driver updates MS offers - it is generally best NOT to install hardware driver updates offered
 by Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Accepting hardware driver updates from Microsoft is one reason there are so many topics in the community that start with "Windows update broke my computer...".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me assure you with 100% certainty that these ideas for things to try that are usually suggested by the Microsoft engaged alleged "experts" will not help:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Safe Mode</p>
<p>Clean Boot</p>
<p>DISM</p>
<p>SFC&nbsp; (System File Checker)</p>
<p>Windows update Troubleshooter</p>
<p>
</p><p>One rule of thumb (especially for hardware drivers) is "if it ain't broke don't fix it" so if you are not having a problem with hardware devices (video, audio, network, printer) don't accept or install those driver updates offered from Microsoft.&nbsp; If you
 are having a problem like that you should only get driver updates from the hardware manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you see and can recognize those hardware driver updates offered you should right click and hide them:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ac1f86e4-1fca-471b-a37b-14ae2736c025" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Pretty soon you might have quite a few hidden hardware updates:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f5f3b09b-cddc-49aa-8381-d29660edc24a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f5f3b09b-cddc-49aa-8381-d29660edc24a" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows has a way built in to not allow these kinds of updates and I'm not 100% sure it works as advertised but this is a safe adjustment that may prevent a whoops event in the future and how you might undo them if they happen:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7 has built in ways to disable driver updates from Windows Update that you can read about here:</p>

<h2>            Why does my screen keep losing my colour profiles&#63;</h2>
                    I have an ACER laptop with window 7 and I am a Photographer so I need an accurate screen for colour and brightness, I have loaded a colour profile using a Colorvision Spyder2 and when I start up my laptop it loads successfully however when it goes to sleep
 or I get a flash screen it loses the profile and the screen goes lighter. Is there any way of stopping this happening?<br />
Thanks for any Help.<br />

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Are you using any other third party software to manager color profiles or calibrate the monitor?<br />
2.&nbsp;Are you using any photo editor software which might manage/access the color settings of your system?</p>
<p>3. Which version of Colorvision Spyder2 are you using?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems&nbsp;that the available versions of Colorvision Spyder2 software has no information about its compatibility with Windows 7. Download its installer and installing it in Windows Vista Compatibility mode and check if it works fine. To do so, follow the
 steps mentioned below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Download the installer (setup file) of ColorVision Spyder2.</p>
<p>
<span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Right click on it and select Properties.</p>

</span></span></span>Select the Compatibility tab.</p>
<p>
<span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Put a check mark on the option "Run this program in compatibility mode for:”.
</p>
<p>
<span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Choose Windows Vista Service Pack 2 from the drop down list.</p>
<p>
<span><span>f)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click Apply and then OK.</p>
<p>
<span><span>g)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Double click on it to reinstall the software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: </strong>Boot your system in clean boot mode and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>Try following the KB article to perform Clean Boot.<br />

<h2>            Error code&#58; 0xc0000034</h2>
                    <p>My laptop has come up with a blue screen with the message</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recovery</p>
<p>Your PC/Device needs to be repaired</p>
<p>The boot configuration date file is missing some required information</p>
<p>File:\BCD</p>
<p>Error code: 0xc0000034</p>
<p>You'll need to use recovery tools. If you don't have any installation media (like a disc or USB device), contact your PC administrator or PC/Device manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe laptop came pre-installed as I have no disc or USB. I am unable to get any further on the laptop than the message displayed above. I do not have a disc drive. Am I able to download a file to USB on another laptop to fix this problem and how do
 I go about then running this to fix laptop when it will not allow me to access files etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>update:</p>
<p>I continually pressed on the F12 key as it was loading after turning on and came up with some options but I don't want to lose the files I have on the laptop by accidentally doing a complete restart to factory settings. Should I just take to a computer specialist?</p>

</p><p>You will likely need installation media created onto a USB thumb drive.... from a working computer.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>First you must download the Media Creation Tool to a working computer. &nbsp;You then double click on the download to open it. &nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Select create installation media for another computer</span>. &nbsp;Plug in your USB and answer
 questions appropriately. &nbsp;After this, you will have installation media on a thumb drive. &nbsp;It can be used to Repair/Upgrade/Clean Install Windows on your broken laptop. &nbsp;Installation media is a must have in nearly all circumstances.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Wayne</p>
<p>Thanks for your advice - I'm not very good with technology, however your instructions seem pretty straight forward and believe I should be able to give them a try - my only concern is whether doing this will restore my laptop to original settings, therefore
 deleting all the files and photos on my laptop. Is the way you have explained able to fix the problem without losing the files? Unfortunately I had downloaded all my photos from my phone on there recently and had only just bought an external hard drive to
 transfer them all on to, but this has happened now before I was able to transfer everything (and I have deleted all the photos off my phone).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had read in the forum about pressing the F12 key continuously and when I did this it came up with 'Boot menu'</p>
<p>HDD/SSD &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;:TOSHIBA THANSNF256GMCS</p>
<p>LAN2 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; :IPv4</p>
<p>LAN1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; :IPv6</p>
<p>
</p><p>Enter Setup</p>
<p>HDD Recovery</p>
<p>
</p><p>From there I wasn't too sure which one to choose for fear of losing everything. Should I do anything from this menu or download from the link you have given me and do it that way? Your expertise would appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>&nbsp;PS my laptop is a toshiba</p>

    <title>Disable CORTANA altogether - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ques tion  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disable CORTANA altogether</h2>
                    I have absolutely no use for CORTANA, and wish to have it off forever, but MS seems to insist I use it. &nbsp;I have Windows 10 on a brand new Asus T102 HA tablet. As I was setting it up, I selected NOT to use Cortana, but it shows up on my both my local account
 and on my sign-up. &nbsp;Having only 64 GB (and really only 35 left!!!) on the SSD, I really want to get rid of all apps and bells and whistles such as solitaire and xbox and more, but&nbsp;but MS seems to insist I keep these. &nbsp;

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Cortana is also integrated into Windows Search. And you really can't reduce the Windows 10 Footprint by removing services without losing a lot of important functionality for your tablet. Added Windows 10 already uses compression to reduce the OS size.
<br />
<br />
You can find information use BING or your favorite search engine about how to possibly reduce the OS size however I do not recommend doing so.<br />
<br />
Best to use OneDrive (or similar Cloud Storage) and/or an&nbsp;SD card or USB drive to add storage capacity.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. <br />

            Thank you Rob. your reply is really helpful. &nbsp;It is a pity I cannot (so it seems) remove all the things I have no need for and will never use (such as x-box). &nbsp;I use the Micros SD card to store data, as using cloud is not feasible for me. &nbsp;I travel to
 the boondocks too often, places that many times lack even electricity! &nbsp;That means I have to have my Office on the built-in SSD. &nbsp;I can install and run my Bible software on the SD card which is helpful, With the OS and Office, and Adobe Reader on it the SSD
 gets a red flag when I look at its Properties. &nbsp;And for my situation the extra $$ to go to 128 or 256 GB SDD is not feasible.&nbsp;

            <p>With Cortana integrated with it, I find it odd that Windows did give me the option not to use it, ... and understand now that NOT using it does not mean it is disabled! &nbsp;:?! &nbsp;:)</p>
