            I would use a tool like Macrium Reflect to clone the disk to the new one. This would be the best way to move your content to the new disk.

            Hi Harlie
<br />
<br />You have 2 options, close the drives or clean install Windows 10
<br />
<br />If the new drive is of the same or greater size and you can connect both drives to your PC then you can clone the drives. The up side of this approach is all your data will be copied across along with your installed 3rd party applications.
<br />
<br />However, a much better option is to backup tour date, clean install Windows 10, restore your data and clean install your 3rd party apps. This is a much longer process, but will get the best out of the new SSD and will result in a more stable and responsive system
<br />
<br />1.
<br />Clone the drive
<br />
<br />You can use a utility like the free Macrium Reflect to clone the drives:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://macrium.com/reflectfree" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://macrium.com/reflectfree</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />2.
<br />Clean install Windows 10
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br /> 
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

            Right-click the start button and choose "Disk Management". Find your current C:\ drive, right-click it, and choose "Shrink Drive". If you can shrink the C:\ drive to the point where it can fit on the new, smaller SSD, then Macrium Reflect should be able
 to clone the drive.

            I would physically disconnect the old SSD for a few days. Once you are satisfied that your install is still good, reconnect the old disk, use Disk Management to delete all partitions, then do what you want with the old SSD.

<h2>            Skype status keeps being wrong after a contact switched devices</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A strange situation occurs, and from a technical point of view I think I know what is likely to be wrong, but I can't find out how it can best be solved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The situation: </p>
<p>A contact of mine used to (only) use Skype on a Samsung S5 phone. During all that time, the online/offline status for that contact showed correctly in my Skype on iOS (iPhone 7, latest Skype AppStore version) as well as in Skype on my Mac (Skype version
 7.59 (37)).</p>
<p>Last week Friday, that contact switched phones to an iPhone 6. After logging in there, I still receive messages from that person, but the online/offline status is consistently wrong.
</p>
<p>On my OS-X installation, for days it kept saying "Last seen 11/24/17 6:49" (almost beyond a doubt the last time a sign in was done on the Samsung) while after that time, many logins were done on the iPhone. On OS-X, the status for that person is now always
 'Offline', while in their iPhone it properly shows 'Active'. Signing in and out to this version of Skype doesn't help.</p>
<p>On my iOS version of Skype, it is a little bit better, but not much. Basically the same phenomenon occurs, but sometimes it seems to better remember the "last seen on..." date-time stamp. However, here too it keeps getting 'stuck' on a wrong status. When
 I log into Skype iOS while they are connected too, I see their status as "Active" but then, for hours after they have already left (and really are not online anymore) it still says "Active".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that the Skype clients I have one way or another 'look' at the status from Skype on the contact's Samsung, and not that of the iPhone.
</p>
<p>We tried a lot of things like reinstalling, deleting the contact, re-inviting etc. nothing solves it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I came across a (seemingly) great command that may well be able to solve it, being /remotelogout (combined with /showplaces for checking the connection status) and then signing out and in to purge the data. I tested it on my Mac and it turns out I had 15
 connections in the /showplaces output, of which 13 were gone after doing the /remotelogout and then signing out and back in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We wanted to try the same on the contact's iPhone, but sadly we get the notification that the command is not valid. :(</p>
<p>To the contrary of what I read on the Internet, these commands really do NOT work in the current App Store version of Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone tell me how this can be solved, if possible, from the contact's iPhone?
</p>
<p>One option would be to sign in to a desktop Skype installation and then do a /remotelogout and log that Skype out, but the person in question doesn't want to install it on the work laptop. Another could be to sign in on Skype on the Samsung and then log
 out, but that phone now doesn't have a SIM card anymore, so maybe this does not work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there other ways to achieve the same and/or can anyone tell me if they know of a way to solve this?
</p>
<p>Alternatively: does anyone know a way to issue the /remotelogout command in the iOS version of Skype?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone???</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you kindly in advance and with kind regards,</p>
<p>-O.</p>

<p>Hello <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/bb09e0a9-c2dd-43ef-8b21-517e57b4a289" title="Mystery Madman">
<p>
</p><p>We actually do not suggest our customers to sign in to multiple devices at the same time as it will cause misrouting of calls and messages, as well as incorrect display of statuses.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, /remotelogout is no longer working. However, you can do password reset as doing so will log you out from the devices you are logged in. You can also advise your contact to log out of Skype if will not use it for a while, instead of just closing
 the skype application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have further questions, please do not hesitate to reply to this post. <br />
Thank you!<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot for your answer!</p>
<p>Actually as of this morning (without action having been taken by my contact) the issue was gone and all was (and still is) working as normal again :)</p>
<p>I assume some form of server side maintenance task automatically cleared out the stale data.
</p>
<p>Either way: I'll be sure to remember the password reset trick, as well as making a mental note to make sure to always sign out of devices, especially when making a permanent switch from one to another. :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again, and with kind regards,</p>

            <p>Hi there,</p><p><br /></p><p>Is it only your son's account that is unable to broadcast, or is it all accounts (even yours) on the console that is unable to broadcast?</p><p><br /></p><p>Reason I ask, Mixer's <a href="https://mixer.com/about/tos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">terms of service</a> does not allow for users under the age of 13 to use the services.

            He is fourteen.&nbsp; I have a Microsoft account but I didn't try to broadcast on the Xbox one.&nbsp; Does the account determine accessibility by the birth date he enters?

<h2>            Windows couldn&#39;t  connect to the Group Policy Client Service</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Group Policy Client Service</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I purchased an HP 22-2130na computer for or five weeks ago and have had problems with Windows since.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer was loaded with Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem first occurred a couple of days after I first started using the new computer.&nbsp; I had loaded additional software the day before, namely: Microsoft Office 2016, Adobe Photoshop Elements 11, Family Tree Maker 2012 and Roxio Creator 2009 as well
 as downloading Norton 360.&nbsp; Everything seemed normal when I switched on and signed into my user account to install files from my old computer.&nbsp; Having completed mine&nbsp;I decided to do the same with my wife's user account.&nbsp; This was when I received the message
 'Windows couldn't connect to the Group Policy Client Service.&nbsp; Please contact your system administrator', namely me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted HP support.&nbsp; They advised it was a software problem and couldn't help, but suggested four options:</p>
<p>1. Delete user and set up new user account.&nbsp; I tried this.&nbsp; I first received the error message that user could not be deleted as user was not signed out, but I had signed out. &nbsp;Despite this error message it deleted the user account anyway.&nbsp; I then tried
 to reinstate the user account, but nothing happened for several minutes before the error message We're sorry but something went wrong.&nbsp; This user wasn't added to this PC.&nbsp; Code 0x80070426' appeared,</p>
<p>2. HP could restore computer to factory settings.&nbsp; I was reluctant to do this as Microsoft Office 2016 was purchased for life of machine only, and I was unsure whether it would be possible to download it again even though it was the same computer.</p>
<p>3. Contact Microsoft for assistance to sort out the registry problem.&nbsp; It was inferred that this would necessitate reinstallation of software and so was reluctant to opt for this option for same reason as under 2.&nbsp; I subsequently read something on the internet
 to the effect that Microsoft were no longer supporting Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Contact the vendor.&nbsp; This would only mean getting a new computer which would have been loaded with the same Windows version and the same problem.&nbsp; Again there could be problems downloading Microsoft Office 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The contact at HP said that it was possible to Google the problem to get a fix for the Registry issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was not confident about doing this so I got my son to use the fix posted by PLX.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This worked after a fashion and he was able to set my wife up as user again but this time as an administrator rather than as a standard user which appeared to have prevented my wife's access previously.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, problems still occurred in Windows with Windows Explorer, specifically I was unable to access Windows Update to check the update settings, and when the previous updates had occurred.&nbsp; PLX had suggested that the registry problem was a result of automatic
 updates and restarting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided that the best option was to upgrade to Windows 10, which I understood would create its own registry and therefore eliminate the problems with the registry experience under 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a couple of attempts I was able to successfully upgrade to Windows 10, although due to the download speed on&nbsp;my broadband connection it took a total of six hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything seemed fine again.&nbsp; The following day a Microsoft update occurred, and although set to automatic I was requested to install the updates, and noted and the time that it was only set to update Windows, not Microsoft Office.&nbsp; I clicked to update,
 intending to ensure that Microsoft Office updates were set to be installed later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The next day I turned on the computer I was back to square one.&nbsp; I received the message 'Windows couldn't&nbsp; connect to the Group Policy Client Service.&nbsp; The may affect standard users accessing heir account'&nbsp; This may not be the exact wording but unlike he
 8.1 message it did not suggest contacting the system administrator.&nbsp; Again this issue appears to have been generated by the Microsoft updates of the previous day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This message now greets me every time I log on, but fortunately it is not affecting my wife's user account as she is an administrator and not a standard user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am however prevent from using some windows services, specifically I am unable to access Microsoft Update via Settings, which appears to be the correct way under Windows 10, so I am still unable to ensure that I am receiving updates to Microsoft Office
 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also occasionally there seems to be a problem with start up.&nbsp; This morning my wife signed in but just got a black screen.&nbsp; I manually switched off the computer and switched it on again she was able to sign in without problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to me that there is an inherent problem regarding registry in both Windows 8.1 and now Windows 10.&nbsp; I am not aware whether the same fix used for Windows 8.1 will apply to Windows 10, but as that fix did not completely solve problems with 8.1 I am
 reluctant to consider trying it on 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anyone aware of a permanent solution to this problem under Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not a&nbsp;computer expert but it seems to me that Microsoft should be issuing an update or download that will resolve this registry problem and its affect on Windows services.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry this is so long winded but I felt it necessary to go through the events so far, as hopefully there may be a clue as to why this is happening on this computer.&nbsp; I haven't identified any posts where this has occurred on Windows 10 elsewhere.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;Hi Harshavardhan</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for your advice.&nbsp; Method 1 appears to have worked and corrupted files were repaired.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can now access Windows update, Google Chrome appears to open without undue delay, and I did not get the Group Policy Client Service error when I logged on this morning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I now appear to have a different problem.&nbsp; When I tried to download/install updates I received the message that there were some problems installing updates, but would try again later, and if I kept seeing this message to quote&nbsp;0x800705b4.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The message is there each time&nbsp;I have looked but don't know whether further attempts have been made to download/install in the meantime.&nbsp; Perhaps&nbsp;I have not left it long enough.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Harshavardhan</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your earlier response.&nbsp; I have tried Method 1, but no problems were found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem now is that although I can access Windows update, which is set to run automatically, and I have been able to extend it to apply to all Microsoft products, the message is that 'No updates are available.&nbsp; We'll continue to check daily for newer
 updates.'</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I check update history it states the none have been installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I select the check for updates button it just continues checking for updates with no result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not try Method 2, as I am not confident trying to modify the Registry,&nbsp;but if this is likely to be the only option to correct this problem, I will have to get my son to do it as he is much more conversant with computers than I.</p>
<p>

<p>I tried method 1 - no problems detected</p>
<p>Then method 2 - no problems detected through the "restore health" subcheck.</p>
<p>Then I restarted my PC and logged in.&nbsp; My problems were corrected.</p>
<p>My problems were:&nbsp; guest users could not log on, Google Chrome took many minutes to load, right clicking on photo files took minutes of the right-click window to open, similarly for trying to create a new folder.&nbsp; Now all works smoothly.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I originally started this thread. &nbsp;I no longer have problems with Windows Updates or those from HP, but I continue to receive the message 'Windows couldn't connect to Group Policy Client', which was my original problem. &nbsp;This message is received every 10
 to 14 days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As my wife and I are now both set up as 'adminstrators' it does not have the same effect as originally, but it still affects our ability to open Google Chrome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Google Chrome either takes any time up to an hour to open, or does not open at all. &nbsp;If the latter applies, running the
<strong>sfc/scannow</strong> scan prompts Google Chrome to open, even though no integrity violations were found. &nbsp;Sometimes I also run the&nbsp;<strong>Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth</strong> scan, which detects no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although this temporarily resolves he issue, after 10 to 14 days the message recurs and I repeat the procedure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clearly, this should not keep happening, and the reason for the message occurring in the first place needs to be addressed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anyone aware of a solution to stop this message occurring?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Harshavardhan,</p>
<p>&nbsp; I'm using Windows 8.1, and when I tried Method 1, I got the message "This file does not have a programme associated with it for performing this action. Please install a programme or if there is one already installed, create an association in the Default
 Programmes Control Panel." Huh?</p>
<p>&nbsp; I've been experiencing this problem &amp; more for several months now (every few days) &amp; I'm slowly going crazy. Windows Live Mail not opening started it all, &amp; doing a repair thru the W Essentials troubleshooter sometimes helped, but now I feel I'm just making
 things worse &amp; digging a deeper hole for myself.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Could you explain the message I quoted, because I haven't a clue as to what it means, or how to go about doing what it suggests. I spend more time trying to fix problems than I do actually using this PC!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers, Denise</p>

            <p>Hi Denise</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm the guy who started this thread. &nbsp;I am not an expert in any way and have relied on Harshavardhan and his colleagues in resolving the problems I have had initially with Windows 8.1 and subsequently with Windows 10. &nbsp;Without wishing to tempt fate I have
 currently managed to resolve the problems I have been experiencing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not understand why you are receiving the message you are when using the sfc scan. &nbsp;The message is similar to one I have received in the past when trying to open a file within Windows where the file type is not recognised so it is necessary to select
 a program within which to open it. &nbsp;As you are not within the Windows environment when accessing Command Prompt (Admin) you should not be receiving this message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am assuming you have pressed the Windows Key and the x key at the same time which brings up a black menu from which you have selected Command Prompt (Admin). &nbsp;This may produce the query 'Do you want to allow this app to make changes to your PC?' &nbsp;If so,
 click yes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next you will get a black screen with the a cursor blinking at the end of text which reads 'C:\WINDOWS\system32&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next to this type sfc/scannow and press Enter. &nbsp;Note that there is no gap between the letters sfc and the forward slash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This process will take a little while, if it finds any integrity violations it will fix them and inform you it has done so, if it doesn't find any you will get a message to this effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regard to Method 2, I have found that accessing Command Prompt (Admin) to run the DISM commands by the same way as under Method 1, does not always work. &nbsp;The alternative is to type Command Prompt in the search box. &nbsp;This will bring up a menu in which
 you will see the words Command Prompt in a blue shaded area, right click on the mouse within this shaded area and Command Prompt (Admin) will appear as an option, left click on this. &nbsp;Why the method worked and the other didn't I don't know, particularly as
 it appears to get you to exactly the same place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When typing each of the DISM commands, as written in the previous message does not work. &nbsp;According to the Microsoft web-site they should read:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth</span><span><br />
DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth<br />
DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>When typing these commands note that there is a space before each forward slash, the commands do not work unless the spaces are there. &nbsp;You need to do each command separately and pressing Enter. &nbsp;Wait until each command has finished before starting the next.
 &nbsp;Be patient as the commands appear to stop for a time before eventually completing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I was having &nbsp;issues with the Mail &amp; Calendar app I set up a new user account and it did solve the problem but only temporarily.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Method 3 I used which seems to have resolved my problems, given to me by one of Harshavardhan's colleagues, was as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, starting from Command Prompt (Admin) type:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted</span></p>
<p>Press Enter</p>
<p>Then type:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers |Where-Object {$_.InstallLocation -like "*SystemApps*"} | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Press Enter</span></p>
<p>You will now need to restart the PC<br />
</p>
<p><span>This latter Powershell command was provided to me to solve my Mail and Calendar app problems, which it appears to have done, but currently I am no longer receiving the 'Windows couldn't connect to the Group Policy Client Service' message either.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Another method to access powershell, is to type Powershell into the search box and right click on the shaded blue box that appears and select Command Prompt (Admin). &nbsp;If you access Powershell by this method you will not need to use '</span>PowerShell
 -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted' command as you will already have accessed Powershell.</p>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<p>I used the sfc, DISM RestoreHealth and the powershell commands, in that order and then restarted my PC. &nbsp;I did not see if the first worked before trying the next and so on, as I had done previously. &nbsp;Also I did not on this occasion use the DISM CheckHealth
 and ScanHealth commands either, but I would assume it would have achieved the same result had I done so. &nbsp;For me the solution was the additional use of the powershell commnd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps, as I said I am not an expert, but this worked for me.</p>

            <p>Hi Ron,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much for all the info - you've really gone to a lot of trouble! My problem, however, stops me from even getting to base.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm able to select Command Prompt (Admin) &amp; that's as far as I'm able to go. <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Nothing</span> happens for between 5 &amp; 6 minutes, and then I get the message that I quoted in my original post. If I wasn't being recognised as administrator it would make more sense (I think), but this doesn't seem to be the case, so it looks as though Command
 Prompt.lnk needs a programme associated with it (?).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I can sort this out, then I'll certainly be using your suggestions &amp; experience, Ron, &amp; I want to thank you again for your time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Denise</p>

            <p>Denise I hear ya!! :-). My issue is exactly what you're saying. Ron thank you for your time in trying to help. This is much appreciated even if we not got to the bottom of it. If anyone knows how to fix I would also be very grateful. I don't know why it
 suddenly broken. I think its this Windows 10. I wish I'd never changed to it now :-). Thanks again to all the helpers out there!

</p><p>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can create bootable usb or DVD using the below link:</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you do a factory reset on the computer, you can still upgrade to Windows 10 as it is already reserved,</p>

</p><p><span>Thank you for posting in Community, we appreciate the time and effort that you have invested in to fix the issue.</span></p>

</p><p>The reason that you have not been able to proceed with the repair and only end up installing Windows 10 is due to that reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Coming to the&nbsp;agenda to create System Repair Disk, I would suggest that you follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<p>1. Open <strong>Control Panel, </strong>locate and select <strong>Backup and Restore (Windows 7).</strong></p>

            <p>To whom it may concern:</p>
<p>I followed Rakesh's instructions, but when you down load the file, if is an execution file that goes right into install Windows 10.
</p>
<p>I get two choices install Windows 10 and Create media for another computer.</p>
<p>I never get to see a link that says Repair your Computer.</p>
<p>I created the Media DVD disk and tried to start the system with the DVD disk.</p>
<p>I Disabled all boot drives except CD rom drive all I get is Boot disc Failure, insert System Disk.</p>
<p>Which I do not have because I downloaded Windows 10.</p>
<p>I wonder if I could use a System Disk I created on my Laptop?</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Gary,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform you that you will have to&nbsp;choose the option <strong>Create media for another computer</strong>, once created, insert the&nbsp;USB drive or DVD onto the system. When you start the computer you will find the above mentioned link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also you cannot use the System Disk created from your laptop into the other device as the system properties and functionalities that is stored in that disk will not be same as the one on your other device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Microsoft Hello wont automatically dismiss the lock screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jneubrander  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Microsoft Hello wont automatically dismiss the lock screen after waking from sleep</h2>
                    <p>I have the setting turned to automatically dismiss the lock screen, but this operates properly only after a fresh boot or restart of the whole computer; in these cases, it will take me straight to my desktop after recognition. But, if I press Win+L to log
 out, it will merely recognize my features but still require that I swipe to dismiss the Lock Screen. The same aberrant behavior is seen if the screen times out and either goes into sleep mode or screen saver mode (requiring a manual swipe to return to desktop
 after recognition occurs). This is not my preference at all. Is there a way to fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only workaround that is still vastly annoying is to utilize hibernation. When returning from hibernation, recognition takes me straight to my desk top, but this means I cannot use my screen saver or see my lock screen. The reason that matters is I would
 prefer my lock screen to scan for me for some minutes before it goes to sleep; if i return quickly, it will still be scanning for me and then as I sit down, it will take me right to my desktop. However, with hibernation, I wait for it to boot up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated. Thank you!</p>

            Yes. I did it again anyways, to no avail. This does not seem to be an error or malfunction, but rather a design in the functionality. I am hoping there is an override. I know of at least one other poster that has posted similar sentiments.

<p>&nbsp; OK; for the second time: this doesn't seem to be a malfunction of software. This seems to be a built-in setting. Please recreate my steps outlined above and you will experience the same outcome as me.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Do we then <strong>both</strong> need to run a software tool, or try to troubleshoot? No. Because there is likely no malfunction, but proper operation which unfortunately I don't appreciate. I am looking for someone who knows a work-around via settings
 (if it exists) so the computer behaves as is least inconvenient, as per my initial post.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>I read somewhere else this is by design because Windows Hello is very very quick and this to avoid you unlocking the computer directly after locking it.</p>
<p>To test it, lock your PC and move away from the camera for about 30 seconds and then test again. It works for me.</p>

<h2>            Brand New laptop - but browsing&#47;internet SLOW - help</h2>
                    <p>Didn't know where else to post this question...I just got an Acer Aspire E 15,Windows 10 Home,4GB DDr4 memory,1000 GB HDD storage,Intel Core i3-7100u processor,the machine itself seems good...however,the browser inclided(MS Edge)is practically useless,it
 REFUSES to let me download Chrome or Firefox(!),took 3 hours to download Opera which loads sites VERY slow and takes several page resets to load at all.The Opera main page loads normal but when I try to go to any other site then it SLOWS.<br />
I don't know if I need to upgrade to a higher internet speed or if its some other issue(my previous computer that died a few days ago was over 9 years old).I'm using the AT&amp;T basic 768kbps and if this is the problem I'd like to know for sure so I can just upgrade
 but I'm confused(and not very computer savvy AT ALL).I don't understand why I can't download the other browsers either.</p>
<p>I would appreciate any help.Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Sonja,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Slow browsing and downloading concerns can be related to incorrect network configuration settings. If the issue is confined to using the mentioned browsers, it could be a result of profile or Windows Update corruption. Let us review some things to correctly
 address the issue. Kindly answer the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Do you get a specific error message along with downloading or browsing the Internet?</li><li>How are you connected to the Internet? Is it wired or wireless?</li><li>Do you encounter the same difficulty using another profile?</li><li>What specific steps have you taken so far?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We will be waiting for your reply so we can move forward to resolving your concern.</p>

            Apparently is was the Windows 10S system which I didn't realize was restricted to only the Edge browser...which still didn't function even when I uninstalled Opera(which had stopped working).When I ordered it I just assumed it had the same Windows 10 as
 my mom's laptop.The Windows 10S even interfered with her computer and we couldn't run both at once so it looks like I have no choice but to return it.Really disappointed and do NOT like the so-called 'streamline' version of 10 and unless there are still laptops
 available with the original Windows 10 I won't be buying another one.

            The simple answer is no, when you load a form a web session is started for you, if the window or browser is closed the data is lost. This is a security feature to stop other users accessing the data you have entered on the form, sorry!

<h3> dragondavewr  say:</h3>
<h2>            KB890830 Malicious Software Removal Tool x64 Update- July 2013  &#40;20.7 MB&#41;</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
Do I need to install this OLD update which came out on July 9, 2013 even though I have already installed the JULY version 2 times AFTER the date July 9, 2013?<br />
<br />
However, it is possible that I have reverted BACK to old System Restore Points so that I really don't have a present version like it seems that the UPDATE HISTORY says I have 2 later versions which were installed on July 18 and July 23.<br />
<br />
Help Please,<br />
Ken<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I did not know that I was posting 2 messages that were the same to the same Group Area.&nbsp; I was trying to post the same question in 2 different Help Areas thinking that I might have a better chance at a response.&nbsp; In case people from 1 group did not answer,
 maybe the other different group might have 1 person that would answer.&nbsp; I did not know that the different areas of posting spots would just show up as a combined message area.<br />

</blockquote>
<p><br />
Ideally, you would never, EVER use System Restore to "undo" a Windows Update, [1]&nbsp;Service Pack, or IE upgrade (which often leaves the system in a "confused" or "torn" state)! Instead, uninstall the update, Service Pack, and/or IE upgrade &amp; reboot. If that doesn't
 correct the problem, <em>then</em> try System Restore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Translation: If you used System Restore after 23 July 2013 and you're prompted to install the July 2013 MRT when you run a manual check for updates, yes, it'd be best to install it (again).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you wish, you can always run the MRT manually =&gt; <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/malicious-software-removal-tool-details.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            PA Bear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IF I do install the KB890830 file for July 9, 2013 will it do away with any versions that came out on July 18 and July 23 so that I will have to download them again and install them separately?&nbsp; Does that particular file only come out ONLY 1 time a month?<br />
<br />
Secondly, how would I even go about uninstalling a KB file obtained in Windows Update so that I could properly uninstall it and so that I can reboot and reinstall a new time?<br />

            <p>There have been times when Microsoft has released a revised Malicious Software Removal Tool after the second Tuesday of the month - however, July 2013 was not one of those months.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Translation: The MRT you downloaded on the 18th was the same one that was released on the 9th - and the one you downloaded on the 23rd was the same one that you downloaded on the 18th. And if you download it today, it'll still be the same one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: A new/updated MRT is scheduled to be released on Tuesday, 13 August 2013. It will include all of the things the July 2013 version would have detected (and more). May was well wait till Tuesday when the new MRT will be available via Windows Update.
 [1]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS: The MRT doesn't really install - it just downloads, runs &amp; then goes away - so you cannot uninstall it. For that reason, you'll never find KB890830 listed in
<strong>Installed Updates</strong>. [2]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>==============================================================<br />
[1] The August 2013 version may not be available via the Download Center until later in the month.</p>
<p>[2] The Aug-13 MRT will be KB890830 as were the Jul-13,&nbsp;Jun-13, May-13, Apr-13, etc., etc.,&nbsp;versions.</p>

<h2>            Why won&#39;t my USB 3.0 port recognize my device&#63;</h2>
                    While my laptop is on, and I plug my device into the USB 3.0 port, my system won't recognize it. However, when I shut down my laptop, plug in my device, then start up my laptop, my system will recognize the device. Any advice on how to fix this would be
 greatly appreciated.

<h2>            Annoying  Runtime Error message keeps popping up.</h2>
                    <p>I keep receiving this message, and do not know what to do about it, but it is very irritating indeed:
</p>
<p><strong>Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Library.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Runtime Error!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Program: C:\Windows\system32\8671\msconfig.exe</strong></p>
<p><strong>This application has requested the Runtime to terminate it in an unusual way.</strong></p>
<p>Can anyone suggest what needs to be done?</p>

<p>I never did wind myself up to doing a reset, so the runtime error message continues to pop up remorselessly. HOWEVER I discovered by chance that if I pull out the laptop's external power supply cord (which, by the way, is the official Dell p/s as supplied
 with the Dell XPS 13 that this error is occurring on) <strong>the error message immediately disappears!</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 goes to lock screen on two finger swipe down</h2>
                    <p>Hey There,</p>
<p>Last week my laptop started going to the lock screen every time I use two fingers to drag downwards.&nbsp; This is the normal motion to simply scroll the screen up and down, so this is a very annoying problem! I reset my touchpad settings and the problem did
 not go away. I am using a windows 10 pro, and I forget the exact model of the laptop, but it is a tablet/laptop and is only about 6 months old.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I change this?</p>

<h2>            Uising Microsoft MSVC 1.52 under Windows 7 64 bit</h2>
                    <p>Is there any way I can install and run MSVC 1.52 under Windows 7 64 bit? I need to run this app to support&nbsp;a number of&nbsp;16 bit DOS apps and I am getting fed up carrying two laptops everywhere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would it run under Windows 7/64 PRO in XP mode or is the issue more to do with the 64 bit platofrm not supporting 16 bit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            64bit Windows does not support 16bit applications natively.<br />
<br />
Assuming the program works under Windows XP, you can try XP mode since it will be running the 32bit Version of Windows XP.<br />

<h2>            Error Code 0x89231022</h2>
                    <p>So my friend started game sharing with me about two months ago, and everything was working fine. I was able to download his games and use his xbox live gold, no problem. About two weeks ago his xbox subscription ran out so he went out and bought another 12 months. This morning, we were all together in a party playing together and everything was fine. I get off for about 8 hours and when I get back on I try to join the party again but xbox instead&nbsp;prompts me to join gold. Strange, I thought, he just renewed it. He had not been on all day either, so I knew he couldn't have removed me or changed any settings. Whenever I tried to join the party, it would give me the error code "0x89231022" which is apparently only associated with not having xbox live. Everything works for him on his xbox, what's the matter with mine?&nbsp;</p>
