                    <p>
</p><p><span>Dear Sir/Madam,</span></p>
<p><span>We are using “Windows 10 Home Single Language 64” Bit original operating system. As you know that there is one command (secpol.msc) we use for time locking
 or time changing. But the problem is&nbsp;when we using this command in” windows 7” operating system it is working, but when we using this command in “windows 10 Home Single Language 64 Bit” it is not working. On the other hand this command working in “windows
 10 Pro”. Our problem is, it is not working in “Windows 10 Home Single Language 64 Bit” operating system. We required that command on “Windows 10 Home Single Language 64 Bit” operating system.
</span></p>
<p><span>So, please help me about that problem and give solutions for the same.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>how to take ownership of entire folder in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hunterdust  say:</h3>
<h2>            how to take ownership of entire folder in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I recently had a complete crash of Windows 10. I used the opportunity to get an SSD to do a fresh install, but kept the old hard drive (which was fine) as well as an even older hard drive from a previous computer (that had Windows 7) in the machine. Basically,
 I got a new computer that I stated using in May 2017. At that time, I took the hard drive out of my previous computer and put it in the new one. Then, when Windows crash, I kept both of those in, as well as installed the SSD. So now there are 3 drives with&nbsp;
 total partitions (not including boot partitions, etc.)<br />
<br />
Here is the odd thing...before the crash, I had absolutely no problem accessing any file on both drives. Including files from the oldest hard drive that were Windows files that would otherwise have been protected. But now that that drive is twice removed from
 being having actual Windows system folders, it is off limits to me. I am simply trying to temporarily move everything to the newer HDD o I can reformat and repartition that one before moving everything from the newer to the older one to reformat and repartition
 THAT one. But it is not letting me. I am doing all the steps of taking ownership of the folder, and it even says that I have ownership of it.&nbsp; But the FILES are still off limits to me. The show up in my explorer window, and the sizes show up as correct. But
 if I try to open it, it gives me an error. And if I check the properties, it shows 0 bytes. I CAN take ownership of each file individually, and then it works. But there are hundreds.<br />
<br />
The dumbest thing about this is that there are PICTURES. And some videos. They were never anything that would have been protected. And again, two weeks ago before the crash, I was able to access them all I wanted despite it being from a previous drive then
 as well. In fact, there are photos and videos that I can't get to that were put IN that folder since it was no longer my main Windows folder.<br />
<br />
How am I supposed to definitively take total control over everything in that folder. This is what happens when I try. It shows like it is going to let me, but when I click Apply or OK, I get the error message shown in the picture. And it will give me that error
 message for every file in that folder or sub-folders, unless I cancel to stop it. And then I have to back out entirely by cancelling the entire way back, thus putting me back at square. But the folder DOES show that the Administrator account (which I am using)
 is the owner and has full rights to it and everything in it. But that is apparently a lie.<br />
<br />
This is so stuck that even booting into Ubuntu with a flash drive will not allow me to copy the files. At first, I was getting an error message about it not being able to copy. But now, when I even just try to open that entire partition in whatever Ubuntu's
 explorer is called, it just closes the entire window.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Why is windows putting any restrictions on a drive that is not a boot drive and has nothing to do with the current Windows install? And more importantly, why is it doing it NOW, when it didn't do it for the last 17 months before the crash? And why would it
 think that JPGs and MP4s are files that need protecting..but only SOME? Only a couple folders on that partition are giving me trouble. The others...all the same types of files, photos and videos...are coming up fine. IT just randomly decided after the fresh
 install to block access to THOSE folders.<br />
<br />

            Hello! Sorry you are having this issue. Hopefully we can fix it.
<br />
<br />This is quite the post, so I'll ask a few questions. 
<br />
<br />1. What have you done so far to try to fix it? 
<br />
<br />2. Have you tried to use cmd prompt "takeown" commands to take ownership? 
<br />
<br />3. Do you have a restore point to before the crash? 
<br />
<br />Let me know

            Hi hunterdust
<br />
<br />Taking ownership of files and folders in Windows can be a laborious task!
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download a reg file, When that downloads, unzip that, then right click the reg file and choose Merge, then confirm the merge
<br />
<br />That reg file will add a new entry to the right click context menu in file explorer - Take Ownership
<br />
<br />Then you can right click that parent folder and choose 'Take Ownership' and you will have access to all those files, once that command completes . . .
<br />
<br />On this page, scroll down to the Here's How' section to get that reg file . ..

            To answer all the posts at once...<br />
<br />
I have performed all the actions listed in any given site about taking ownership. And it seemingly worked. But it is not applying to files and subfolders even though I have checked the box to do so.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Zackary...I have not seen any info on doing this with the command prompt. Can you give you instructions? I am familiar enough with the command prompt to know how to get there, just what commands and where to use them.<br />
<br />
Also..the crash is no long in issue. It was a full on crash of Windows. Restore points didn't work. Repair didn't work. But that doesn't matter at this point because I have reinstalled Windows from start on a brand new SSD drive. But now that I thin aout it,
 it wouldn't have mattered before anyway since even before the crash the drive in question was used solely for media storage, or programs that didn't require installation. So even under my old setup, that drive had System Restore turned off. But this is what
 also makes it so crazy. Since it WAS just media storage, why is my NEW Windows install putting ownership restriction on those folders when the last Windows installation (both Windows 10) didn't.<br />
<br />
One question that just popped into my head. Would it matter where the drives are? Things got a little hectic when I added a third drive, especially with having to get mounting brackets, first for the SSD drive and then for one of the hard drives to put that
 in my empty 5.25" back. I thought I got it right to where Drive 0 is my SSD. But maybe not. (It boots OK.)<br />
<br />
so, is it possible that I accidentally put that old hard drive into the 0 port, and that that would matter? I don't see why it would, but that is the only reason I can think of as to why I could get to those files two weeks ago before the crash, but not now.
 Even though both times, that drive was not my main drive and those files/folders were owned by my old login from 2 years ago...from a different computer.

            Hey, so I dont believe drive location matters. I only think that because I have several drives ive switched around so no big deal there. 
<br />
<br />First, without cmd prompt you can try this: <a href="https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/take-ownership-folder-windows-10-using-file-explorer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/take-ownersh...</a>
<br />
<br />With command prompt, you can try this: 
<br />
<br />Open the cmd prompt as admin and type: 
<br />
<br />takeown /F &lt;filename&gt;
<br />
<br />For a folder: 
<br />
<br />takeown /f &lt;foldername&gt; /r /d y

<p>I try that, but that is when I get this message. I click on Yes. But it still doesn't do it. The files&nbsp; inside the folder are still not changed.<br />
<br />
I'm noticed that that folder is also showing as Read Only...but when I go to change that, it says "Access denied" for the files inside the folder.</p>
<p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>OK...here is what I have encountered so far. It doesn't seem to be JUST an ownership issue. These are the steps I have to take to get access to each individual file in the folder. (Doesn't work for the folder itself</p>
<p>
</p><p>Properties</p>
<p>Security - Advanced</p>
<p>Disable Inheritances to all (to get rid of the mess of users from the old computer)</p>
<p>Add - Select Principle</p>
<p>Add Administrator to the list and check the Full Control box.</p>
<p>OK out</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only then do I get access to that individual file.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
I may have fixed it. I did the above steps for the the two main folders that were giving me problems. Except those had already had the old users cleared out so I didn't have to do the disable inheritances. But, I did delete the Administrator account that I
 had tried setting up last night and stared over. This time, instead of choosing to apply the changes to This folder, subfolders and files, I changed it to just This Folder and files. And for whatever reason, that worked.&nbsp; Just the opposite of how it is supposed
 to. Even the folders within those folders work now. When I first clicked on them after doing that step, it said I had to get access to them. But just clicking on the option in that box to do so made that open. And all the files are there.<br />
<br />
So, I don't know if the "Fix was deleting the Administrator account I put in last night and starting over, or making it on his Folder and files. That makes no sense though since it should be better to make the change apply to the subfolders as well.<br />
<br />
So, right now, at least I can access them. Let's see if I can copy them so I can do what I set out to do last night which was to reformat that old drive.</p>

            It seemed to. I had to do it for each folder, which was annoying. But doing it for a couple dozen folders was a hell of a lot better than the thought of having to do it for several hundred files inside those folders. I don'tr know why choosing "This folder
 and files" was better than This folder, subfolder and files", but doesn't matter now. I've been rearranging all my files between the three drives for the last day or so, and since I did it, none other have given me any problem. I still get a "This is a system
 file" warning when I try copying a file from one of my old drives to another old drive. But when I tell it to do it anyway, it does it. I have to go and delete all those files eventually anyway. I only saved those folders so I could see what was installed
 on my old computer so I can get them again. But I guess just taking a screenshot of the folders is all I need to be able to do that.

<h2>            Regular BSODs, please help with dumps</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If possible, I could use a bit of help with some BSOD issues. First, a few clarifications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- specs (there will be dxdiag/msinfo/dumps for detailed info): 8700K, Gigabyte 1070Ti, 16 GB DDR4 Adata 3000 MHz XMP, MSI Z370 Gaming Plus motherboard with latest BIOS, all running stock as they came from the box.</p>
<p>- this is not a new Windows install. I plan to do one soon, although it will take time to reinstall everything so I will have to use this install for a few more days until I have time. I had an FX 8350/GTX 970 etc. config before, upgraded a few days ago.</p>
<p>- I'd love to know what's causing the issues so I don't install it on the fresh Windows.</p>
<p>- things I did: updated all drivers, ran sfc /scannow and dism /restorehealth etc. commands (came fine), ended up running driver verifier too, last dump was under verifier. Nvidia latest driver installed with DDU.</p>
<p>- went through some torture/stress testing with MSI Kombustor and AIDA64. Nothing bad happened.</p>
<p>- ran memtest64 for 10 loops or so, no issues, now I know I should probably leave it to work for days, but I kind of need my PC to work these days and it's a bit out of question unless things get desperate</p>
<p>
</p><p>The crashes occur mostly due to Assassin's Creed Origins. I rarely get to one hour of play before it either crashes to desktop and sends reports to Ubisoft or BSODs. Other games seem fine. I had 2 BSODs as I tried to reboot the PC after AC:O crashed. The
 BSOD causes seem diverse enough, with wcifs.sys, ntoskrnl.exe and wof.sys mentioned by Whocrashed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Downloads (dumps, msinfo, dxdiag):</p>
<p>https://1drv.ms/f/s!AlyBPrVBi3PnmTy7p0he2GzGibJu</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for your help. Anything that can help me identify what I should avoid to achieve stability would be of tremendous help.</p>

            We are volunteers willing to help you try to resolve this issue. I am Rob, a 10 time and dual award MVP specializing in Windows troubleshooting and Bluescreen analysis.
<br />
<br />If you are over-clocking anything, especially video, STOP!
<br />
<br />This seems to be mostly heat related which does not always mean excessive temps as a single component could be too sensitive to even the normal levels of heat. Ensure all fans are working.
<br />
<br />Memory and 1 minidump : 
<br />BugCheck A, {8, 2, 0, fffff80026321b0c}
<br />Probably caused by : Wof.sys ( Wof!WofIsDataInFilesystemEx+102 )
<br />
<br />Other minidump:
<br />BugCheck 18, {0, ffffc40465a3c080, 2, ffffffffffffef81}
<br />Probably caused by : ntkrnlmp.exe ( nt!ObfDereferenceObjectWithTag+105c47 )
<br />
<br />Both of those are Windows components which mean something else drove them into Fault.

<br />
<br />1. Check with Nvidia and the game's support, drivers, and forums for known issues. Your description and the DMP files point to heat-related issues. 
<br />
<br />Nvidia - Drivers - Use OPTION 1 to manually enter your driver info to get most current drivers.

<br />
<br />2. Kaspersky seems to be involved so I would fully uninstall it and then run its Removal Tool to prevent trouble causing remnants. Use Windows Defender which in Windows 8/8.1 &amp; 10 is a full antivirus.
<br />

<br />
<br />3. Check with MSI Support, their online docs and drivers, and ask in their forums about any known issues.

<br />
<br />4. Run the memory tests (see methods below though your previous checks are probably sufficient).
<br />
<br />5. As needed use ALL the methods in the troubleshooters below.
<br />
<br />6. After ALL the above if needed run Driver Verifier to see if it can indicate a CAUSE (see Driver Verifier methods below).
<br />
<br />-----
<br />
<br />This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : 
<br />
<br />Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their names (and update BIOS and chipset drivers).
<br />
<br />DriverView - Free - utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.
<br /><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</a>
<br />  
<br />For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current. Right Click Start Button - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.
<br />
<br />Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard
<br /> if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers 
<br /> you have.
<br />
<br />Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples) (as rollback) and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset, and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)
<br />
<br />Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.
<br />
<br />Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.
<br />
<br />Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at Device Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.
<br />
<br />Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.

<br />   
<br />====================================================
<br />
<br />Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory. So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show a problem.
<br />
<br />To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.  &lt;-- best method

<br />
<br />For the Windows Memory Diagnostic Tool.
<br />
<br />Type in Cortana's search box -&gt;  Windows Memory Diagnostics 
<br />at top of list - click it. in Windows 8/8.1/10 the name is "Windows Memory 
<br />Diagnostic".
<br />
<br />================================================
<br />
<br />After doing ALL the updates you can, and if the issue continues, then run

<p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I mentioned, there is no overclocking involved. CPU, RAM and videocard run at stock settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I doubt heat is an issue, as the CPU has a half-decent aftermarket cooler (CNPS10x Optima from Zalman) and it rarely spikes at 70-75C only to immediately fall back to 60-ish - gaming load). The videocard is cooled by Gigabyte's Windforce 3 cooler (https://www.gigabyte.com/Graphics-Card/GV-N107TGAMING-8GD#kf)</p>
<p>The card can go through GPU stress tests easily without issues. It barely reaches 80C in Furmark type of load. Problem is that once I run Assassin's Creed Origins, there's bound to be a BSOD. CPU can also endure through stress testing easily, like running
 Prime95 for an hour. I can also run AIDA64 stress tests on both CPU and GPU no issues. Also this is pretty much a new system, so there's no dust, components are new and clean.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All fans are working. Drivers are all up to date for sure, just downloaded everything last night.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, I cannot seem to crash the PC without running Assassin' Creed Origins, yet I didn't do enough testing to be 100% sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I will just reinstall Windows fresh in the end and keep software to a very basic minimum, see if AC:O still BSODs it. Would have loved not having to do that, and go through reactivating and reinstalling all this software.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for Kaspersky, yeah, there's a chance it could pose problems. I do hope that's not the case though, I love their products and using the default Defender seems quite bad after paying for KIS licenses for more than 10 years now.</p>

            Try uninstalling Kaspersky as that alone may be enough as it really can stress the system.
<br />
<br />Heat-related does not always mean that the temps are beyond specs as one single component like a resistor, chip, or capacitor could be too sensitive to lower that specs and fail.

</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Step 1: Try
<strong>Safe Mode</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Safe mode is the configuration of Windows, when it is running on only basic set of drivers and all the startups are disabled. To know more about
 safe mode, follow the article below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode</span></span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue is resolved in safe mode, follow step 2 after restarting the computer in regular mode.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>Step 2:
<strong>Clean Boot</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate
 software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. To know more, follow the article below:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><em><span>Note: After troubleshooting, refer to this section ‘<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>’.</span></em></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Step 3:
<strong>Run the System Maintenance troubleshooter</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Run System Maintenance troubleshooter to diagnose the exact issue.
</span><span>This troubleshooter will detect and resolve the basic issues or settings which might cause this issue.</span></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span><br />
Follow the steps mentioned below.<br />
<br />
<span>&nbsp;</span>a. Press “Windows key + W”.<br />
<span>&nbsp;</span>b. Type “Troubleshooter” without quotes in the Search box and hit enter.<br />
<span>&nbsp;</span>c. Select “System and Security”.<br />
<span>&nbsp;</span>d. Select “System Maintenance” under System options.<br />
<span>&nbsp;</span>e. Follow the on-screen instructions to run the troubleshooter.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2: Run the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe)</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore
 corrupted files. It will scan your system files and to repair missing or corrupted system files in Windows. To run the SFC scan, refer to the Microsoft article below.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3: Install latest driver</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to install the latest graphic driver available for the graphic card model that you are using, by downloading it from the manufacturer’s
 website itself. Make sure you select the correct operating system and architecture.</span></p>
<p>

<h2>            Driver irql not less or equal while formatting</h2>
                    Some days ago when I boot up my computer, it would ask me to actived windows and go to settings. I could still use it but had no internet even though my wifi works. Yesterday I decided to format it, but didn't realize it wasn't plugged so it shut down
 at the middle of the process and now it's in a loop of autorepair

            <p>Hi Mari,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your computer is in auto repair loop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This might be caused due to various reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows files corrupted.</li><li>Driver issue.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>What is the make and model of the PC?</li><li>Do you have the reinstallation disc for Windows 8.1?</li><li>Did you shutdown the computer, in middle of installation?</li></ul>
<p>You may try to use the reinstallation disc to format install Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please follow the below&nbsp;&nbsp;suggestion to disable automatic repair from starting if your computer fails to boot into windows.</p>

            <p>Dear Ruth,<br />
<br />
I am having the exact same problem on Win 10. All available Windows Updates are installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran 'sfc /scannow' and the only corrupt file it found is opencl.dll which is related to a graphics driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also ran 'Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth' but at the end it said that the source was missing and I don't have a Win 8 CD or the like to use as source.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Erik</p>

<p>
</p><p>Figure it can't get any worse so I copied that file out into another directory.&nbsp; When back, selected a file and then&nbsp;"Send To" and all is well.&nbsp; I guess the funky file with 0 length was causing my problem.&nbsp; Hope this helps others.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Since it happens with the higher requirement games it may be that your system just does not have the hardware specs to properly play them - games can really stress the system. And you can't fix hardware with software.<br />
<br />
Check with the games makers' Support, documented requirements, and ask in their forums about known issue with hardware specs such as yours.<br />
<br />
Check with&nbsp;System//Motherboard&nbsp;Maker's&nbsp;Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, diagnostics, and ask in their forums about any known issues (be sure to ask in their forums).<br />

Be sure and check the hard drive and cabling.&nbsp;Read&nbsp;and try the methods in the BCCode: 154<br />
section below.<br />
<br />
Have you added hardware recently or updated drivers? Be sure to look in&nbsp;Windows Updates to see if any drivers were updated there. Other lessor possibilities include antivirus/anti-spyware/security programs.<br />

==================================================<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : <br />
<br />
Run DriverView -&nbsp;<strong>set&nbsp;VIEW to Hide&nbsp;Microsoft drivers </strong>- update&nbsp;those without
<br />
Dump in their names (and&nbsp;update BIOS and chipset).<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address of the driver,&nbsp;description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the <br />
most&nbsp;current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down <br />
the make and&nbsp;complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's <br />
tab - write down the&nbsp;version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do <br />
anything as MS is far behind&nbsp;certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -
<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the driver&nbsp;stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard<br />
if&nbsp;3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers
<br />
you&nbsp;have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and<br />
then&nbsp;Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their <br />
latest versions.&nbsp;(Look for BIOS, Chipset,&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's <br />
site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT&nbsp;after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing&nbsp;actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed&nbsp;(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot
<br />
- check to be sure it is&nbsp;installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - <br />
heck manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

====================================================<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even <br />
for sticks&nbsp;that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system
<br />
behind slower memory.&nbsp;So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for <br />
those even if all memory tests fail to&nbsp;show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

For the Windows&nbsp;Memory Diagnostic Tool.<br />
<br />
Type in Cortana's search box -&gt;&nbsp; Windows Memory Diagnostics&nbsp;<br />
at top&nbsp;of list&nbsp;- click it. <strong>in Windows 8/8.1/10 the&nbsp;name is "Windows Memory

<br />
After doing ALL the updates you can, and if the issue continues, then run <br />
DriverVerifier.&nbsp;<br />

<p><br />
WINKEY + X - RUN - type in -&gt; verifier /reset&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hit enter to disable</p>
<p><br />
Use BlueScreenView to see if there is a driver specified in the error message. <br />
Also check with&nbsp;MyEventViewer at the time of the BlueScreen.<br />
<br />
If DriverVerifier creates a minidump upload it and post the link here so we can <br />
analyze it.</p>
<br />
Hope this helps. <br />

<h3> stanislav stratil  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 x64 - Realtek ALC888 Crackling sound</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I remember, when I was previously on Win 10 (and also on Win 8/8.1) I had this "crackling" sound issue. So, I want to ask, is it already fixed? I really would like to upgrade, but I want to have clean sound, without any occasional crackling, like in
 Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this issue will not be fixed, I just cant upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And yes, I tried any possible fixes and I had updated drivers, but the problem was still there. I think its something built in win 8/10 which is causing this issue, cause in Win 7 its ok.</p>
<p>I actually have old motherboard with integrated sound card, its "nVIDIA nForce 6100-400/405/420/430 (MCP61)". But Win 10 upgrade manager is saying everything is ok for upgrade. - Its a lie.</p>

<h2>            How do I install cmd.exe&#63; I accidentally deleted the program.</h2>
                    <p>The other day I decided to move command prompt to my desktop(not too smart) and having my recycle bin set to automatically delete items is not a good thing when there are essential programs around.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could anyone tell me what I can do to re-install this program?</p>

            Hi Ameer
<br />
<br />Many users have reported this, it is caused by a BIOS update that has been applied to your laptop.
<br />
<br />HP can override the Windows logo screen wither with a black screen or more often they will put the HP logo on that screen with the spinning dots
<br />
<br />This is nothing to worry about and will not affect the good running of your system . . .

<p><span>Hi Cameron09kenzie,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Which player are you using to play the video?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Are you able to play saved avi files without any issues?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Xvidcore.dll is installed on your Windows computer when you install the XviD codec and this issue may occur if the codec is damaged or corrupted.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You need to install this codec in order to play the XviD movies and videos on your system. After installing the codec, you can play your XviD movie and
 video files using any media player that currently exists on your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try the following steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:
</span></strong><span>Try to re-register the files</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on start and in the start search bar type
<strong>cmd</strong>, right click on the command prompt icon in the programs area and then click on run as administrator.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>At the command prompt type
<strong>regsvr32</strong></span><span>
<strong>Xvidcore.dll </strong></span><span>and then press enter.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span>
 Download and install the latest </span><span>xvid codec on the computer</span></p>
<p><span>You may search online for xvid codec and install it.</span></p>

    <title>Is anyone else experiencing freezing after latest update&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lastkatstanding  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is anyone else experiencing freezing after latest update&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>We updated our 360 elite (the black and silver one with the external hard drive) a few days and ever since it's been intermittently freezing at random times, something it never has done regularly before. We have had the occasional freeze, but it's done it
 at least three times in the last couple days. &nbsp;The kids updated their xbox 360 slim a day or two ago (the new shiny white one that makes noise whenever you hit the buttons with the internal hard drive) and they too have been having intermittent freezing issues.
 That one has never had any issues with freezing before.</p>
<p>These are easily fixed by power button restarting, but are kind of annoying. So far they haven't froze during game play or DVD play but we use the systems more for our &nbsp;streaming apps such as hulu, amazon, nick, and iheartradio.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anyone else been having issues since the latest update?</p>

<p>Yes, my Xbox 360 is now showing three red lights so I follow the steps in the troubleshooter and it then clears the flashing red lights but then starts up with a frozen screen like this [View:http://youtu.be/oyd6G2aE5nM:550:0]</p>

<h2>            Data Error &#40;Cyclic Redundancy check&#41;</h2>
                    <p>HI</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a back up external disc. &nbsp;I was not able to do any backup now as it returns errors.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guessed it was a video folder and files that I copied recently that was causing it. When I tried to delete it, it shows an error that it is not able to read from source. Tried to delete the folder using "rmdir" at the command prompt. Can't be deleted with
 errors "Data Error (Cyclic Redundancy check)".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ran a chkdsk on the volume but always hangs at 2 % ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any way of deleting the folder? Or if I reformat the whole disk, will it help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,<br />
<br />
</span><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Communities. <br />
<br />
I understand how frustrating it could be when things do not work as expected. Please do not worry I will try my best to resolve it.<br />
<br />
Before we start troubleshooting on the issue please provide us with the additional information by answering few questions mentioned below, this will help us to troubleshoot better.</span><span><br />
<span><br />
1. Have you made any recent changes to the computer prior to this issue?<br />
2. Does the issue occur only with Windows store app or the issue occurs with other apps as well?</span></span></p>
<p><br />
<b>Method 1<br />
</b><span>I would suggest you to reset windows store and check if that helps.<br />
</span><span>a. Press Widnows logo key + R<br />
b. Type "Wsreset.exe" and press enter.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2</span></b></p>
<p><span>Run the Windows 8 App Troubleshooter. The troubleshooter automatically fixes some issues that might prevent your apps from running, including suboptimal screen resolution and incorrect security or account settings:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab</a></span></p>
<p><b><span><br />
Method 3</span></b></p>
<p><span>If you are using any Proxy connection, then try disabling the proxy connection and check.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps to disable proxy:</span></p>
<p><span>a. Click the <b>Gear</b> box at the top right corner in internet explorer.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Click the <b>Tools</b> button, and then click<b>Internet Options</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Click the <b>Connections</b> tab, and then click<b>LAN settings</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Uncheck the “Use a proxy server for your LAN check box”.</span></p>
<p><span>e. Select and check "Automatically detect settings" under "Automatic Configuration"</span></p>
<p><span>f. After above step try downloading app from Windows store and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 4:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Run a system file checker scan and then try to create system restore points check if that helps. Refer the following steps to run SFC scan.</span></p>
<p><span>a. Move the mouse pointer to bottom left of the screen where you see preview of start menu and Right-click to bring up a list of Windows settings.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Click on <b>‘Command Prompt (Admin)’</b> to bring up elevated command prompt. Note: Click<b>‘Yes’</b> if it prompts for permission.</span></p>
<p><span>c. In the command prompt type in the following command:<b>‘sfc /scannow’</b> and hit enter.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 5:</span></b></p>
<p><span>You may start the computer in clean boot and check if the issue persists. Follow these steps to start the computer in clean boot.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 1</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>a. Press the ‘<b>Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b. In the ‘<b>Run</b>’ window type ’<b>MSCONFIG</b>’ and click ‘Ok’.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Click the ‘<b>Boot</b>’ tab and uncheck ‘<b>Safe Boot’</b> option.</span></p>
<p><span>d. On the ‘<b>General’</b> tab, click to select the option ‘<b>Selective startup</b>’, and then click to clear the option Load startup items check box.</span></p>
<p><span>e. On the ‘<b>Services</b>’ tab, click to select the ‘<b>Hide all Microsoft services</b>’ check box, and then click ‘Disable all’.</span></p>
<p><span>f. On the ‘<b>StartUp</b>’ tab, click ‘<b>Open Task Manager</b>’. In the Task Manager window under startup tab, right click on each startup item which are enabled and select ‘Disable’.</span></p>
<p><span>g. Click ‘OK’, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 2</span></b><span>: <b>Enable half of the services</b></span></p>
<p><span>a. Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Click the <b>Services</b> tab, and then click to select the<b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Click to select half of the check boxes in the<b>Service</b> list.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Click <b>OK</b>, and then click<b>Restart</b>.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 3</span></b><span>: <b>Determine whether the problem returns.</b></span></p>
<p><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the<b>Service</b> list.</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the<b>Service</b> list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></p>
<p><span>If only one service is selected in the Service list, and you still experience the problem, the selected
<b>service</b> causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 4</span></b><span>: <b>Enable half of the Startup items</b></span></p>
<p><span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the<b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box
 in either step.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 5</span></b><span>: <b>Determine whether the problem returns</b></span></p>
<p><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the<b>Startup Item</b> list.</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the
<b>Startup Item list</b>. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></p>
<p><span>If only one startup item is selected in the <b>Startup Item list</b>, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem. Go to step 6.</span></p>
<p><span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the<b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box
 in either step.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 6: Resolve the problem.</span></b></p>
<p><span>After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box for the
 problem item.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 7</span></b><span>: </span></p>
<p><span>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.</span></p>
<p><span>a. Press the <b>‘Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b. In the ‘Run’ window type ’<b>MSCONFIG</b>’ and click ‘Ok’.</span></p>
<p><span>c. On the ‘<b>General</b>’ tab, click the ‘<b>Normal Startup</b>’ option, and then click ‘OK’.</span></p>
<p><span>d. When you are prompted to restart the computer, click ‘<b>Restart</b>’.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 6</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps in the link:</span></p>

            <p>Method 1, 2 and 4&nbsp;didn't work for me and as I dont use a proyx method 3 is irrelevant,too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 5 is plain ridiculous.</p>
<p>I want to reinstall Mail, etc, which couldn't get updated through the app store.<br />
The supposed fix for that was a reinstall of the app which results in the "0x8003cf0" error.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's really disappointing and quite discouraging, that Microsoft has this Kind of problems in the app store, especially as these are preinstalled apps...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bought a Windows 8 PC after 10 years of exclusive Mac use, because I liked the new Windows look etc. But now I remember why I bught a mac in the first place...</p>

BAD answer... No one should have to re-install an entire OS to fix something like this.... this is an outright BUG.<br />
<br />
It happened when I upgraded from Win 8 to 8.1<br />
<br />
I have TONS of programs and applications.. many of which I no longer have activation keys for.. plus not to mention to time it would take to re-install everything.
<br />
<br />
MS should have a very simple, and easy tool that RESETS the entire Metro-UI... even back to default settings if need be...<br />

            <p>TallBearNC: It is not called Metro-UI. That was only in the pre-release.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I keep a seperate folder for all the software I install, everytime windows 8.1 hick-ups. I store the license keys as text files allongside.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I inform my family that I'n not avaiable for two days and then I reinstall Windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the only way to keep a Microsoft Windows systerm running on the long term. As I've bin through my 20th or so installation of Windows 8.0 I'm getting quite good at it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know life is short and all that but you might want to try something like GNU-Linux and realize that Microsoft actually is doing a fair job.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Btw Microsoft gives no support on the product. It only offers this lousy end-users board so expect to recived some confusing to down-right wrong information here. Trust no-one</p>

            <p>I found an easy solution. Bought a 16TB USB 3.0 raid array. Set it to raid 0 (for max space). Used novastor backup business professional (comes with the raid array), and backed it all up</p>
<p>
</p><p>erased c, d, and e drives/arrays. Installed 8.1 from scratch using uefi boot model. Once up, I replaced most ms drivers with updated drivers for my HW, then I redownloaded and installed, without a hitch, all the windows 8.x store apps, games etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then i reinstalled all my other programs. Like u, I keep</p>
<p>a text file, and a printout hard copy of all my activation keys, "cd keys", etc</p>
<p>
</p><p>then restores ally docs , pics, saved game data, steam &amp; origin, etc along with the iTunes library and my 7 tb of music, tv, and movies... Plus all my steam/origin games (as steam / origin will just verify files vs redownloading everything)</p>
<p>
</p><p>i did all this 2 days after my last post... I've never had a single issue since. I still do a full backup of all drives once a month with incrementals in between and an image backup of C: (physical image of drive on the sector level so I get all the boot,
 partitions) once a week (my data on C is only 200gb) everything runs on D/E. C is just the OS drive. &nbsp;Plus each time nova store backs up, it backs up exactly what system restore does. So I no long use sys restore. I have a nova store recovery DVD &nbsp;that can
 reimage C, do repairs.. Restore com and registry and driver changes&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>normally I don't agree with a tech blindly saying "reinstall"... BUT windows has some SERIOUS issues when going from 8 to 8.1. To save ppl hassle, I recommend a full back up, wipe, clean 8.1 install, then restore what you need&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>since 99% of windows issues, if I were to have an issue, novastor can erase and reimage C in 30mins and I'm up and running.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Yeah I know it's not metro ui anymore... It's just called windows 8 (or 8.1). Silly IMO. Without that metro screen , win 8 looks similar to win 7. So yea I still call it metro despite the renaming .. And as long as most pll know what I'm referring to , it's
 all good ;) </p>
<p>
</p><p>a fresh install of 8,1 is VERY stable. The whole memory management system got an overhaul .. Along with other stuff</p>
<p>
</p><p>i would not run Linux even if u paid me 100k/y. Completely lacks the gaming and business software I require. The ONLY unix like OS I respect is Apples OSX as it has a UI far better than Linux (I've yet to see and decent Linux desktops/UIs)... And OSX has
 FAR more gaming and business support &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In 2000, I installed win2k and that was upgraded , over time all the way up to win xp sp3 over many computers and I rarely had OS issues. Since win 2k, if someone regularly must reinstall windows to keep it running well, they are doing something VERY WRONG</p>
<p>
</p><p>otherwise. Unix , Linux, etc belongs in a room running servers. If the Linux community could get a decent desktop and UI and make it do configuring the system as simple as windows and OS X THEN the public would go for it and software companies would to</p>
<p>
</p><p>windows and OSX really don't fail and crash that often when install fresh. The main mistake ppl do it enable write back caching on the windows system drive. All it takes it a lock up, power failure.. And windows is toast. &nbsp;As long as u keep windows system
 to read only and data drives to write back , you will have few issues&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>other than my 8 to 8.1 upgrade, I've NEVER had to reinstall windows since windows 2000 came out (unless I had a Hardware failure)</p>
<p>
</p><p>if you are having to reinstall windows 8 20Xs, you either have bad HW, a bad driver(s)... Or something off cuz windows is NOT that delicatev</p>
<p>fyi, I'm actually an Apple fan ... My non gaming stuff runs in OSX &nbsp;on my apple desktop and my win box is strictly a high end gaming rig<br />

<h3> windows10 is awesome  say:</h3>
<h2>            The thrustmaster ferrari 458 italia will not load on to windows 7</h2>
                    <p>When I plus the Ferrari 458 italia wheel into the USB port, windows 7 says it cannot find a driver for it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So when I go through Steam to Play Need for Speed and I try to change the controller options such as steering or the pedals, it does&nbsp;do anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I even tried downloading the xbox for windows ultility and it does not notice the wheel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thrusmaster says it supports games that have the xbox controller for it, is Need for Speed Shift one of those games that doesn't have it&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also why does Windows 7 not see the wheel when thrusmaster says it already has the drivers for it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help here would be appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks</p>

            I had the same problem. Try going to the Control Panel, and select Windows Update. If there are optional updates (not being language packs) select them and install. This worked for me, apparently somewhere in the optional ones are the drivers for xinput.
 Hope it helps.&nbsp;

            <p>ok I know this is an old thread but just incase anyone else looks , as long as it shows up in control panel under printers and devices then its working fine , the trouble is when you go into a game it dosnt show up as a thrustmaster wheel it shows up as
 an xbox controller so if you select that as your controller it will be working fine&nbsp; hope this helps</p>

<p>Hey Leute, ich habe seit gestern ein großes Problem mit FM 4. Wenn ich auf Karriere gehe, kann ich mir ein Auto aussuchen, das ich gesckenkt bekomme, nachdem ich dieses Auto ausgewählt habe, erscheint ein Fehler:
<strong><span>Die Datei konnte nicht gespeichert werden, bitte versuchen sie es später erneut</span></strong>. Der Fehler kommt, wenn ich mir ein neues Auto kaufen will, ein Auto umlackiere bzw. irgendwas verändere! Die Autos
 in meiner Garage sind mit einem schwarzen Rechteck überdeckt! Doch jetzt kommt der Oberhammer! Wenn ich ein neues Design kaufen will oder ein Auto im Versteigerungshaus, kommt der Fehler:
<strong>Ihr Spielerprofil kann derzeit nicht vom Server bestätigt werden.</strong>
<strong>Bitte versuchen sie es erneut</strong>. Was soll das? Ich kann theoretisch nichts mehr damit anfangen! Gibts dafür ne Lösung? Wenn ich mir einen neuen Spielstand machen sollte, besitze ich dann noch meinen VIP-Pass? Kann mir da jemand weiterhelfen?
 Danke im Vorraus!</p>
<p>LG En3rgY StuFF</p>

<p>Der VIP Pass wird mit deinem Gamertag asoziiert, also musst du dir da nicht den Kopf zerbrechen.</p>
<p>Das Phänomen mit den "Rechtecken" in der Garage hab ich auch schon in der Club-Garage festgestellt.</p>
<p>Meiner Meinung nach scheint es Probleme mit den Turn 10 Servern zu geben, denn es kommt öfters zu Problemen mit dem Abgleichen von Bestenlisten oder dersgleichen. Gestern sackte sogar das Turn 10 Forum für paar Stunden ab.</p>
<p>Sichere am besten deinen alten Spielstand auf nem Stick ab und versuche es mit einem neuen. Ansonsten versuchste das Spiel später nochmal mit dem alten Speicherstand zu starten.</p>

<p>If anyone was a fan of International Track and Field back on the PS1 like myself, their ears will perk up every time they hear the mention of an athletics or olympics game!<br />

Memories of button bashing taken to new levels while trying to set insane world records, and going through control pads like no tomorrow!<br />

I'm hoping this will be a button basher, but with a bit more of the fun aspect that was lacking slightly from the Beijing game 4 years ago.&nbsp;<br />

    <title>MSVCR71.dll Missing on new Windows 10 loaded laptop. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jard928  say:</h3>
<h2>            MSVCR71.dll Missing on new Windows 10 loaded laptop.</h2>
                    <p>When trying to use my portable hard drive on my new Windows 10 loaded HP laptop I get "MSVCR71.dll missing".&nbsp; When I use the same hard drive on my Windows 7 loaded laptop, no issues.&nbsp; I am not super tech savvy and have had the new HP laptop for a few weeks.&nbsp;
 Was wondering if there is a quick fix or if I should just bring it back and let the BB Geeks fix it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found some information on Windows 7 but it didn't really help me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks to anyone who can help!</p>

            <p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">MSVCR71.dll is a very old Windows runtime file which was required by XP Media Centre/Center, so not sure why connecting to an external drive would need it unless its a media drive?</span></p>

            <p>I had a program that would not start on Windows 10 because it only had later C runtime files.<br />
<br />
I simply got a copy of the file and dropped it into the folder that holds the program that refused to run. Fixed, no need to register or interfere with the Windows system folder.<br />
<br />
I understand this is probably not an answer to the external drive problem - unless a particular program throws up the error, like the HDD manufacturer's drive encryption or backup software, written in C+. In that case - if I did not know the program causing
 the problem - I would put MSVCR71.dll into C:WindowsSystem32 (for 32-bit Windows),&nbsp; and also in C:WindowsSysWOW64 in my case as I am using 64-bit Windows.<br />
<br />
I got it from &nbsp;<a href="http://www.dll-files.com/dllindex/dll-files.shtml?msvcr71" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dll-files.com/dllindex/dll-files.shtml?msvcr71</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;and of course did a virus and malware scan on it before and after unzipping it
 and moving it to the program folder.&nbsp; </p>
