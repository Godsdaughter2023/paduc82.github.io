<h2>            Skype has lost my skype contact info</h2>
                    <p>Twice in the last few months, my skype account has closed down and I have had to try to log back in. When I go back in, it no longer has any of my skype contact list or skype history. How do I get that restored? I am on Windows 10.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Please be advised that all your Skype contacts and&nbsp;chat conversation&nbsp;are tied to your account and can be accessed across different devices as long as you are
<strong>signed in to the correct account</strong>. In line with that, it is possible that you are signed in to a different Skype account which explain why your contacts and Skype history is missing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For testing purposes, please try to&nbsp;<strong>sign out</strong> and <strong>sign in</strong> again using the credential (<strong>Skype name</strong>) when you initially created your Skype account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also check how may Skype accounts are associated with your email address. Please see the steps below.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Go to this <strong><a href="https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.</li><li>Enter your email address and select&nbsp;<strong>Continue</strong>.</li><li>We'll show you all the Skype accounts associated with that email address.</li></ul>

<h2>            &#91;BUG REPORT&#93; New Windows 10 photo app sometimes opens two windows when opening an image</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am facing the same issue as reported by <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/software-apps/15642-windows-10-photo-app-open-double-window.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this</a> guy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes when I open an image in Windows 10 Explorer, the <strong>new photo app opens two windows!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>1. A window showing the actual image I wanted to view (good)</p>
<p>2. A window showing "collection" (bad)</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is really annoying! I just want to see my picture, not opening some other ****.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please fix it @Microsoft!</p>

            <p>I have the same situation. When I want to open an image, Win10 opens also the photo collection. And it's very irritating. In my case, I don't have any private photos in this computer, but if I would have some, then you open an image and the collection shows
 up showing everything. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Not good. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess this behaviour is by design, but it's not good. </p>

<h2>            Microsoft Photos 1.0.1703.13001 Crashes After Clicking Edit a Second Time</h2>
                    <p>I really like the Windows Photos app. It lets you browse photos instead of selecting them one by one, and the Enhance tool is awesome. But after editing a photo, clicking Save, clicking next, and clicking Edit again, it crashed every time with this error.
 Note that when I originally opened the app, this wasn't happening, and I noticed that the Enhance icon was on the toolbar and the "Automatically enhance my photos" setting was on. I experimented with turning this setting off and the icon disappeared from the
 toolbar. I liked having it automatically enhance, so I turned it back on again, but now the Enhance icon never shows up even though the setting is enabled. And that is when the crashes started. I reset the app but had the same problem. I uninstalled and reinstalled
 the app but still have the same problem. After all this and wishing it would just go away, I spent hours downloading and trying other apps and programs that would meet my needs, but none of the ones I tried had the browse feature; you could only edit individual
 pictures, which is a pain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

    <title>NumLock key messes up alpha keys on desktop with full size keyboard. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> okie eagle  say:</h3>
<h2>            NumLock key messes up alpha keys on desktop with full size keyboard.</h2>
                    When the NumLock is on for my full size keyboard for my PC, the auxilliary number pad using U, I, O, P, J, K, L, and : turns on along with the dedicated number pad on the right hand side of the keyboard.&nbsp; I'm sure that this is a setting for windows but
 I can't find it.&nbsp; I'm running Windows 10.&nbsp; This is very irritating and I'm hoping that someone can point me in the right direction.

    <title>Windows 10 Notifications - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> giantoctopus69  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Notifications</h2>
                    Is there a way to view old notifications? Something happened to the sound on my computer (it sounds all scratchy now). I noticed a notification popped up just before the sound on my computer got all messed up but I just clicked on the notification to delete
 it without reading it. Is there an archive or something so I can check old notifications from the past week or are they gone forever once you click on them?

<br />Oh, a side-note, any notifications you click will not appear on the Action Center, so unfortunately they are gone. There is no history maintained for notifications that are clicked on. My apologies.

<p>Oh man. So they are gone forever? Blast.</p>
<p>I noticed something when I was downloading a file and I remember it said something about my "realtek driver" but I wasn't really paying attention to it. I just wanted to get rid of it. Now the sound on my computer is all scratchy so obviously something happened
 and that was what the notification was trying to tell me. Oh well. I was hoping I could find it and read it properly to see what happened.</p>

            giantoctopus,
<br />
<br />That sucks, I can help you and try to get that fixed. Just a simple troubleshooting step, really. Right-click the sound icon on the bottom right of the taskbar, then click Sounds (April 2018 Update, 1803) or Playback devices (Fall Creators Update 1709 or lower).
<br />
<br />If you've clicked Sounds, click on the Playback tab. Whether you're using speakers or headphones, whatever uses that Realtek onboard audio, double-click on it. Go to Advanced. What is the sample rate and bit depth under Default Format, in that dropdown menu?
<br />
<br />For the more complicated part of things...
<br />
<br />You could also just simply uninstall your driver and reinstall it in Device Manager, just simply right-click the Start button and go to Device Manager in the menu. Find your Realtek High Definition Audio (?) driver under the Sound, video, and game controllers category. Before you uninstall it though, I'd like to know the Hardware Ids so I can help you get it reinstalled. Double-click on the Realtek audio driver the same category. A new Properties window should appear. Go into Details. Under the property dropdown menu, expand the menu and find "Hardware Ids" then click on it. Right-click those, copy, then paste them over here.
<br />
<br />After you get the hardware IDs, you may safely go into the Driver tab and get it uninstalled.
<br />
<br />Let me know.

                    <p>I've just used a key to upgrade my laptop from Win10 Entertainment to Win10 Professional, but now I want to know how Microsoft remember our device activation status.</p>
<p>I found my device on <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Is there the place Microsoft stores my activation status? Or store in other place (like Cloud) I can't access to?</p>
<p>Still I have another question. If I re-install Win10 Entertainment, will my laptop keep activated? I mean, will Microsoft&nbsp;remembers my activation status of Win10 Entertainment&nbsp;and Win10 Professional?</p>

            <p>When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license
 you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key. </p>
<p>Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate.
</p>
<p>So, there is no need to know or get a product key, if you need to reinstall Windows 10, you can use your Windows 7 or Windows 8 product key or use the reset function in Windows 10.</p>

<p>Right click on Internet Explorer in the menu that pops up.</p>
<p>Select Properties.</p>
<p>In the Target window erase all of the text back to "C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe" quote marks included.</p>
<p>Open Internet Explorer and change the home page to www.google.com.</p>
<p>That fixed it for me and allowed me to go to Internet Explorer settings and change the homepage to www.google.com.</p>
<p>Google Chrome browser imports preferences from Internet Explorer so it catches the home page from IE.</p>
<p>After you get control of Internet Explorer you can smooth out the rest of your computer.</p>
<p>In Google Chrome go to settings and change the home page. Also set Google Chrome as your default browser so that new pages do not open in Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>Firefox ignored Internet Explorer settings after changing it's home page which it also initially got from Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>The other browsers use this method to enhance security when IE is set up right.</p>

<h3> trohlfs  say:</h3>
<h2>            .EXE-BAD IMAGE</h2>
                    Everytime I open any program or log onto my screen, I get a error message that says:<br />
<br />
(file name).exe-bad image<br />
<br />
c:\windows\system32\d3d10core32.dll is either not designed to run on windows or it contains anror. Try installing the program again using origional installation media or contact your system administrator or the software vendor for suport.<br />
<br />
I am the administrator. I have also run the SFC\SCANNOW twice and it says it has found corrupt files but was unable to repair&nbsp;some of them. When I open the CBS.LOG (either from command promt or placing text file on desktop) there is nothing listed. I also cant
 restore my system.<br />
<br />
Any ideas would be greatly appreciated. Thank You<br />
<br />
P.S. After I get the error message, I click ok and then the program opens ad sems to run fine.&nbsp;

Go through these general malware removal steps systematically - http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware<br />

If you can't do the work yourself (and there is no shame in admitting this isn't your cup of tea), take the machine to a professional computer repair shop (not your local equivalent of BigComputerStore/GeekSquad).&nbsp;Please be aware that not all local shops are
 skilled at removing malware and even if they are, your computer may be so infested that Windows will need to be clean-installed. If possible, have all your data backed up before you take the machine into a shop.

    <title>Green Screen of Death and Lagging - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> echodadog17  say:</h3>
<h2>            Green Screen of Death and Lagging</h2>
                    <p>For the past couple of months, my Xbox has been acting up. The dashboard lagged&nbsp;when I&nbsp;tried&nbsp;to&nbsp;move the controller, when I&nbsp;tried&nbsp;to pull up snap, or games would randomly not play and say "not ready yet" and that it needs to finish installing, even though I had recently played it and it had been installed for months or years. Typically I could fix these problems by hard resetting my Xbox. But now, the problems have gotten worse. For the past couple of weeks whenever I turn on my Xbox, I get stuck on the "green screen of death". It just keeps loading, and I'll wait for ten minutes to an&nbsp;hour before an error screen pops up. Then, I'd choose the option "restart your Xbox" and nothing will happen, so I'd hard reset it again, or sometimes I'd unplug it&nbsp;and wait about a minute to turn it back on. Then, after completing this process around five more times, it will either finally turn on after waiting for around twenty minutes, or I'd just give up. On the

            <p>Also, I'm currently trying to turn my Xbox on right now. At first I was stuck on the green screen of death and so I&nbsp; hard reset it a couple of times, but right now it isn't even emitting a signal to the tv when I turn it on. I tried unplugging it and hard resetting it, and I checked the hdmi cord plugged into the tv, but it still&nbsp;doesn't send any signal to the tv. The home button on the console is lit up&nbsp;though, so I know it's on but I don't know what to do. Please help.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But I regret the problem is still there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I tried to download Windows 10 hoping that this will clean-up my laptop but I received a Windows message that because of a computer problem Windows can not be downloaded.</p>
<p>So I have to continu with Windows 7</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions ?</p>

<h2>            Black ops 3 won&#39;t install</h2>
                    <p>Every time I try to download black ops 3 my Xbox keeps saying "Installation Stopped" even though I have a good connection and download speed. The disk is brand new&nbsp;as I've just had to replace a heat damaged disk. I've tried everything that is on the Xbox website and nothing has worked</p>

<h2>            Didn&#39;t Microsoft learn from their debacle called Windows 8&#63;  Windows 10 is going to be just like it&#33;</h2>
                    <p>When is Microsoft going to start listening to their users?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The whole reason that I never went to Windows 8, or a lot of my friends never went to Windows 8 is because they radically changed the format from the XP/Windows 7 format to a totally foreign, hard to cope with and understand format!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your a business - which I'm not, the last thing you would want to have to do is to have to totally relearn an operating system - that's time and money!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, they're doing it with the everyday user as well!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The LAST thing I want to have to do is stumble for 3 months trying to learn a new, and totally different and difficult to understand operating system!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't CARE how wonderful they think their innovations are and how it combines this device, Androids, iPhones and Aunt Polly's prized cow within Windows!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I like the XP / Windows 7 format!&nbsp; I don't want to change from that!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Windows 10 turns out to be a "better" version of Windows 8, FORGET IT!</p>

            <p>You don't have to "relearn" anything? Nothing is moved, nothing is done in a radically different way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only noticeable difference an average user should notice is a bit of a UI change and that there is a "Settings" application along with the control panel, and the start menu is a little reorganized.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, just like I said to someone else, there is already loads of previews/videos/examples of windows 10 as it stands right now. Go look it up. If an upgrade from 7-&gt;10 would take you 3 MONTHS to "stumble" through, something is wrong with what you're doing.</p>

            <p>I totally agree with Joseph Large's point. I have been managing with Windows 7 for several years now, but there is nothing in it that is better than XP and much that is missing. In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>XP retained the ability to run MS-DOS programs in native mode, which was really important for an old programmer like me.</li><li>Windows 7 could do that, but only with extra software, such as Virtual Machine and XP Mode, which are
<ul>
<li>not available to all versions of W7<br />
</li><li>complicated to install and use, </li><li>easy to crash, </li><li>and apparently impossible to repair.</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>For those of us with a significant investment in old but still adequate software, this Microsoft propensity to change what does not need changing is a major reason for customer dissatisfaction.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>By all means add optional new features, but do not get rid of the old and well-tried.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And especially do not do it just to be in fashion!</p>

            <p>Hey Joseph,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I agree with most of what you say about the inconvenience caused by continually upgrading to new versions of operating systems.&nbsp; I don't like it much&nbsp; either.&nbsp; Been using windows since 1.something.....it was a skinny DOS version.&nbsp; Since then I've had pretty
 well had every upgrade on one of my boxes.&nbsp; As far as I'm concerned they could have stopped after Windows 98SE.&nbsp; The last version was as bug free as it is possible to make software, IMO.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; The big problem with software perfection is they can't keep selling the same version to people over and over again.&nbsp; That would seriously cramp their corporate money grab and they couldn't pay the shareholders off.&nbsp; So they "upgrade".&nbsp;&nbsp; Occasionally they
 will write some unique code that will make it seem like all the money you pay is actually worth it.&nbsp; I haven't seen any real innovation since XP changed the way Windows handled data storage to work more like NT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Changes to functionality haven't really materialized.&nbsp; Windows 8.1 doesn't do anything that my 98SE couldn't.....but it does do it faster thanks to 64bit software and a Pentium processor that goes faster than I can think.&nbsp; Electronics technology has improved
 since DOS.&nbsp; Microsoft is a business.&nbsp; Windows has been improved as much as the technology and the marketplace will allow for the time being.&nbsp; The latest kick is re-arranging the components so you have to relearn the command placements.&nbsp; They probably hope
 that they can change the functions around so much that we will eventually think that Windows is something new.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :P</p>

            <p>I think you're overreacting Joseph.&nbsp; I'm 78 years old now, build my own computers and have upgraded each operating system from Windows 3.1 to the Windows 10 Technical Preview which I currently have installed on two computers.&nbsp; An upgrade could be likened
 to rearranging your furniture, buying a new car or some new clothes.&nbsp; Having a new look on your computer monitor is refreshing and gives you a small challenge to learn something new.&nbsp; A side benefit is improved resource utilization, much improved security
 and protection from malware, speedier processing and ability to take advantage of new internet options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Take a chill pill, upgrade to Windows 10 and enjoy what Microsoft has given us to enjoy.&nbsp; Getting it free is a big bonus.&nbsp; Along with the new OS spend a few bucks to upgrade your hardware, and hook it up to a 28 or 30 inch 4K or UHD monitor.&nbsp; You'll like
 it if you just give it all a fair chance.</p>

            <p>I agree with you. "IF" you "Know" Windows, you know that it is still there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've used the technical preview through 7 or 8 builds now and it's still Windows. Sure, it looks different and, yes, they are playing to the tablet and phone crowd (which I think is great, Go WindowsPhone!) but the desktop is coming along nicely. Even for
 a release version, the desktop is rock solid and outperforms XP or W7 (so does Windows 8 &amp; 8.1 for that matter.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Build 10130, the start button on the desktop mode&nbsp;is getting more like the Windows 7 type, not quite as functional but for most folks, they would be able operate without too much freaking out. Another cool feature is that you can select whether it comes
 up like the traditional start menu, full page, or resize it to somewhere in between. The Start Menu seems to be a pretty important issue this time around, I think it will end up being fairly customizable to suit from the older user crowd to the newbee's (that
 don't know any better) and all points in between.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And Microsoft&nbsp;appears to have&nbsp;been good at listening to the feedback, too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I like the ability to switch back and forth between desktop and tablet modes. Some of the "Apps" are alright. I prefer full "Programs" but, they just&nbsp;don't seem to&nbsp;make programmers like they used to.</p>

<p>I disagree with you, Zxxl. I am even older than you, have been designing and programming in Microsoft operating systems since MS-DOS in 1988 (with 1k RAM and 5" floppy drive) and on all brands and sizes of computer, operating system, and programming language
 since at least 1967. </p>
<p>
</p><p>To my mind there are two major classes of reason for using computers:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>"TURING</strong></span>": accepting the
<strong>challenge </strong>of making a machine do something complicated that you could not easily or speedily do yourself;</li><li>"<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>GATES/JOBS</strong></span>":
<strong>entertainment </strong>and communication.<br />
</li></ol>
<p>The first class is what I personally am interested in. The second is what drives the computer industry to appeal to a mass audience. Microsoft clearly does understand that - after all the first class is what their own technical staff are into, and they do
 attempt to provide for it by entitling some version of each of Windows "Professional".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What would be really nice is if they could make two technically-compatible classes of operating system :</p>
<ul>
<li>one for the technically-minded, slow to change, with all the compilers and other technical paraphernalia, with a simple visual interface and a strong command-line system, without all the fashionable gimmicks but with the inbuilt capability of accessing
 the in programming;</li><li>the other, apparently changing every year, with all those lovely graphical and communication features that Apple do so well.</li></ul>
<p>Or perhaps just insert another level in any Windows, intermediate between the GUI and the command-line - like switching the transmission system in a car between automatic and sports (semi-)manual?</p>

            I hear you bsh53.&nbsp; Hadn't thought much about it since I'm in the GATES/JOBS camp and my computers are for entertainment only.&nbsp; I reckon for your purposes a bare bones OS would be more appropriate.&nbsp; I was in the Air Force when we started the conversion
 from paper personnel records to computers.&nbsp; I wasn't on the programming end but was a user in the Personnel career field.&nbsp; Later on after retirement I worked in a civilian business that converted to a computerized system with the main frame in the corporate
 office and work stations at the retail level locations scattered around the country.&nbsp; We did use a Windows OS coupled with another program for the business needs.&nbsp; Windows 10 is quite suitable for my daily computer needs and I figured it would be suitable
 as a system for other users as well.&nbsp; <br />

            What it all boils down to is, if you want to be stuck in the slow lane with your Windows 7 and previous versions while everyone else is speeding past you and enjoying the new look and feel of Windows 10, so be it. Some people, like Joseph, just don't accept
 change and are stuck in their ways and that's cool. But ignorance is bliss...Don't knock it before you try it. I've been running 8.1 dual booted with 10 and I'm very happy with it. I actually LOVE the new look of the start menu also. I've had Windows3.1 on
 up to 10. I think my worst experience was with Windows Me, XP and Vista, 7 wasn't bad but Windows 8 blows all previous versions of Windows out of the water and 10 will too. &nbsp;

<h2>            different machine id, same pc, no hardware changes</h2>
                    <p><br />
Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had purchased a custom indicator (Ninjatrader software) from a third party <br />
vendor. Ninjatrader implements Microsoft's method of assigning a machine id to <br />
the pc's hardware- motherboard, bios chip, ect. for copyrighted purposes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that my machine id changed unexpectedly, without any known <br />
updates or changes to my pc's hardware. Ninjatrader claims that they have no <br />
control over this. Now I have to contact the vendor and have a new license for <br />
the software re-assigned to that id.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to prevent this from happening again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Nicholas</p>

<h2>            Wild Tangent Game App</h2>
                    I have had wild tangent games app on my computer for a long time. Upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10 and no problem. Then on Feb. 13 2016, my computer updated and now the app won't open. I've uninstalled and installed several times including deleting
 all of the games off of my computer. I've also deleted the updates from the 13th and still won't open. Can someone help me out? I would really appreciated it. Thank you very much.

</p><p><span><span>Try the following methods and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 1: Run the App Troubleshooter</strong></span></span></p>
<p>If you have problems with an app from the Windows store, try this app troubleshooter.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 2:</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If issue persists then there might be a chance that the Maps app may be broken due to a licensing issue with the Store. To get these apps working again, you need to follow these steps:
</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Open powershell as administrator</span></li><li><span>Run the command <strong><span>Get-appxprovisionedpackage –online | where-object {$_.packagename –like “*windowscommunicationsapps*”} | remove-appxprovisionedpackage –online</span></strong></span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>To launch Poweshell, try the following steps</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span>Open Start.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Type Powershell</span></span></li><li><span><span>Right click on Powershell and click on Run as Administrator.</span></span></li></ul>
<span><span>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Do reply with the results. Hope this information was helpful.</p>

            The offending control or controls are something or part of something you have installed. I would start by uninstalling software that does not specifically note Windows 10 as a supported OS.

<h2>            SOLVED&#33; &#34;Bad Image&#34; error when opening any software. MSIMG32.dll 0xc000012f</h2>
                    <p>Hi :)</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>My problem has already been solved. What helped, was to go "recovery options for windows 10" install the "Windows 10 media creation tool". Instead of creating a new installation media, I chose the option to "upgrade this PC now". At the time
 of writing this, 24 hours have passed without the error showing again. For links and more information, please read this post and Douglas' answers below. I owe a special "thank you" to
</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I factory reset my Windows 10 laptop after having issues with it. Most times i turned it on after "sleep" or "hibernate" it would wake up to a black screen saying something along the lines of "Repairing Drive C:".</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the first things I did with my freshly reset PC, was to attempt an installation of "Google Chrome". When running the installer, I was met with the following message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em>"Chrome Update - Bad Image"</em></p>
<p><em>"C:/Windows/SYSTEM32/MSIMG32.dll is either not designed to run on Windows or it contains an error. Try installing the program again using the original installation media or contact your system administrator or the software vendor for support. Error status
 0xc000012f"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I've had similar error messages to this before I reset my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the help of different forums, I ran a "sfc /scannow" test. Its log file concluded with several files (3 or so) that had "mismatching hash numbers". I tried "Repairing" my PC through Windows' "Advanced Startup" without any help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is with this information that I'm guessing that several files of my PC are "corrupt". I ended up reseting my PC again yesterday in hope of this being fixed, but it didn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate the fact that you've read this far. I accept all solutions and help. Thank you in advance :)</p>

<div>I have the same problem of "phillbrett68".&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I can run Windows Mail in cmd by&nbsp;c:\Program Files\Windows Mail\winmail.exe. Then Windows Mail start in the Task Manager and a new folder created in&nbsp;\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows Mail. Data is stored inthere. I am wondering Windows Mail is working behind
 in Windows 8. But I can't see the program itself and use it. That's why I ask this question anyway to show the winmail.exe or the actual program.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I think the program is there and running smoothly but it is forced to hide.</div>

            <p>My Windows 8.1 <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">does </span>have winmail.exe installed. I didn't install it myself it just "appeared". The file has SH attributes so I have to disable 'Hide protected operating system files' in File Explorer to see
 it or use a cmd prompt like so:</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\Users\Rick&gt;ver<br />
Microsoft Windows [Version 6.3.9600]</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\Users\Rick&gt;attrib "c:\Program Files\Windows Mail\winmail.exe"<br />
A&nbsp; SH&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C:\Program Files\Windows Mail\WinMail.exe</p>
<p>
</p><p>autoruns shows that winmail.exe starts at logon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>autoruns "Jump to Key" shows <em>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components\{44BBA840-CC51-11CF-AAFA-00AA00B6015C</em>}</p>
<p>There is a variable <em>StubPath </em>with the value <em>'"%ProgramFiles%\Windows Mail\WinMail.exe" OCInstallUserConfigOE'</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>The parameter <em>OCInstallUserConfigOE </em>looks like it has something to do with Outlook Express.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Previously I was using Windows Vista Ultimate x64. Prior to doing a <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
clean install</span> of Windows 8.1 I exported the messages and contacts from Vista to a USB drive. I did not try to install the old Vista winmail.exe (like others have tried) because I knew it would explode one day. At the time I installed Windows Live Mail
 (from the Windows Essentials package - which has since been de-supported ) then I imported messages from the export made earlier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assumed that Windows Live Mail had to install pieces of Windows Mail, Outlook Express and Outlook in order to import from those formats.</p>

    <title>S4B external communication - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            S4B external communication</h2>
                    <p>Hello All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having issue with S4B external communication with Skype client in my Organization.</p>
<p>We're using Skype for Business Server 2015</p>
<p>In general communication works but in very strange way.</p>
<p>The main problem is that invitation from S4B not reaching Skype contact - what causing lack of Status view and cannot IM directly from contact list (status is still Pending).</p>
<p>Communication works when you found contact in Skype Directory and from View contact card IM is choosen - status of external contact is viisble and chat is possible. When we add this external contact to list - mystic invitation is sent to external contact
 - status of external contact is not shown at contact list and shows Pending status (waiting to accept invitation). Cannot double click to open a conversation windows because of Pending invitation msg.</p>
<p>Funny thing is that when we right click on contact and choose Contact card and choose IM from there communication is possible but status is still not shown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The question is - how to make it work in proper way - invitation reach external contact, we can see external contact presence and chat/call without issues and workarounds?<br />
As communication is working I believe that everything is proper configured, but why invitation is not reaching external contact?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reading and suggestions :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>R</p>

            <p>Hi Paul,<br />
<br />
We've tried to go through the same process from the website you've provided and can't replicate the problem.<br />
<br />
The object name should be your "<strong>Computer Name\Administrator name</strong>".</p>
<p>If your computer name is <strong>PC</strong> and administrator name is <strong>
Admin</strong>, the object name will be "<strong>PC\Admin"</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly try again with the information we provided.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us updated and we will be glad to assist you further.</p>
