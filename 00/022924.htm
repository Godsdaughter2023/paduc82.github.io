<h2>            OneNote</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I try syncing my OneNote it keeps asking me to sign in (I do and the email and password are correct) but it still won't sync and it keeps telling me to sign in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the error it comes up with;</p>
<p>
</p><p>" We need the password to sync this notebook. (Error code: 0x52E) "</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help? I know that the password is correct since when I do enter it incorrectly it tells me that it is incorrect</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>Hello Madi,<br />
<br />
<br />
This error may sometimes occur due to a conflict with multiple Office credentials. If your Office is up to date, try removing the Office credentials from Credential Manager by doing the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Type <strong>Credential Manager</strong> in the search bar, then press <strong>
Enter</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Windows Credentials</strong>.</li><li><strong>Remove</strong> the Office credentials under <strong>Generic Credentials</strong>.</li><li>Restart your computer.</li><li>Launch OneNote, then enter your credentials.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, let us know which <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/About-Office-What-version-of-Office-am-I-using-932788B8-A3CE-44BF-BB09-E334518B8B19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">version of Office</a></strong> you are

            Just making sure, the device you have is the <a href="http://experiencemobility.net/?p=607" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>t<span>he Samsung i760</span></strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>... correct?&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I'm assuming that after you replaced the hard drive that everything was a fresh install so you had to install WMDC.&nbsp; Did you remove any partnerships that were on your device?&nbsp; If not, remove the partnership, soft reset and connect again.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
If that does not work then let's try this:<br />
Click Start &gt; Start &gt; Settings &gt; Connection &gt; USB to PC. <strong>Uncheck</strong>
<strong>Advanced</strong> <strong>network</strong> functionality and reconnect your device.&nbsp; See if it will start the sync process and establish a new partnership so you can sync.

                    I use OneNote 2016 for storing files and often link to them in other applications by using the right click&gt;Copy Link to Page command and pasting the result in my calendar or other app.&nbsp; This worked great until a recent update. Now, when I select the link,
 Windows explorer opens, not the linked Onenote page.&nbsp; I use OneNote on three PC's, all running Windows 10.&nbsp; I have confirmed the Choose default apps by protocol in settings is pointing to OneNote 2016...&nbsp; please help as this really makes OneNote much less

<p>
</p><p>Welllll ... it's been about&nbsp;15 years that they've used my program and it's still occurring despite my best efforts. They often know that they have screwed up, but don't feel comfortable in deleting ANYTHING, unless I have created a button that says "Delete
 this Record". I've also explained the use of the [Esc] key when you see the little pencil symbol. ~Sigh~</p>
<p>
</p><p>So yeah, I have had the database window hidden since the beginning, and have tried to keep things like Action Queries safely hidden using a "Usys" prefix in their name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now the plan might be to display this kind of information as a means of daily / weekly data maintenance giving the user a chance to clean up a bit?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've included a "Selected" field in each of the tables that seem to be prone to this, thinking OK, I'll let him decide what is junk by selecting it, and then deleting the data where "selected = True"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this crazy talk? </p>
<p>Would I have to design a form/subform for each set of records?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

            <p>You should start with the database design. Apparently tblSuppliers.Company can be null. Why? That's a violation of a business rule that says that we will only have records in that table with a certain number of fields always filled out. Of course Company
 would be one of those fields.</p>
<p>You did not set the Required property of that field, so the mess is on you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you work on validation. Apparently weird values can be entered for Company. Certainly you can think of some illegal company names. So in the data entry form in the Company_BeforeUpdate event you can test for illegal company names (e.g. the ones where
 IsNumeric is True) and reject them:</p>
<p>If IsNumeric(Me.Company) then</p>
<p>&nbsp; Msgbox "Yo! That's not a company name", vbExclamation</p>
<p>&nbsp; Cancel = True</p>
<p>End If</p>
<p>You can also test for suspect company names (e.g. the ones with numbers in them) and prompt the user to confirm:</p>
<p>If Me.Company Like "*#*" Then</p>
<p>&nbsp; If Msgbox ("That's an unusual company name. Are you sure?", vbYesNo or vbQuestion) = vbNo then Cancel = True</p>
<p>End If</p>
<p>
</p><p>Third you need to look at the user interface with fresh eyes. Is it as easy and self-explanatory as it can be? Ask the users why so many data entry errors happen.</p>
<p>For example are the forms built in a consistent manner, such as always the labels to the left of the input controls and aligned the same way.</p>

            <p>Thanks Tom, and I will be implementing some of your suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume that you are talking about using the AfterUpdate property of the "CompanyName" textbox, right?</p>
<p>and that "Cancel = True" is, in effect the same as pressing the [Esc] key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trust me&nbsp;when I say that&nbsp;displaying a&nbsp;MessageBox is probably futile. These guys have told me that they don't even read most of them, and just hit the [Enter] key (which has the same effect&nbsp;as clicking the "OK" button.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have started on that form/subform idea that, at the very least, will save me some time playing detective when I stop in there.

<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/17906a73-cc4d-4b6a-a46b-053ceba97a9a" /></p>
<p>The subform uses that SQL string as it's recordsource ... so no need for a saved query.</p>
<p>The [Delete Selected Records] button will build another Delete Query SQL string (again, no saved query)</p>

            <p>No, I am talking about the control's BeforeUpdate event, which conveniently is a cancellable event. Cancel=True then stops the edit from being committed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If people want to be obstinate, they can, nothing I can do about that; it's a matter for company management. But with the above code you WILL NOT be able to enter numeric company names (and of course that is just ONE example of what is possible with good
 validation code). Also, I can change the second block of code to:</p>
<p>&nbsp; If MsgBox("That's an unusual company name. Are you sure?", vbYesNo Or vbQuestion
<strong>Or vbDefaultButton2</strong>) = vbNo Then Cancel = True</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will prevent trigger-happy users from entering bad data that they did not explicitly acknowledge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also we can add ModifiedByUser and ModifiedByDate fields, so we can publish Hall of Shame records from time to time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can also set the Default property of the OK button to False, but frankly I would rarely do that. Instead I would make sure I have the required fields and validation code in place so that when you hit Enter and it clicks the OK button, that record is either
 valid or it cannot be saved. ¡No Pasarán!</p>

            <p>Just one question - I have nothing to add to Tom's advice about the problem itself but; what on Earth do you have against stored queries? Queries are the bedrock foundation of any decent Access application! You obviously shouldn't have a proliferation of
 redundant or useless queries, but this sounds tailor-made for some useful ones! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Users should not (as you clearly know) be looking at query datasheets, but there's nothing wrong with having stored parameter queries as recordsources for Forms, even datasheet forms, to display this kind of data. Sure, you can create a SQL string and set
 the Recordsource property of a form to that string - but that's just extra work, extra bloat, worse performance, and a much harder maintenance job if the SQL needs changing. What's not to like about doing it simply?</p>

            <p>Well John, </p>
<p>My experience has been that stored queries are MORE work, IMO to maintain than SQL stored in the form's RecordSource. Let me explain how this philosophy evolved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;predominate reason I might be a bit "unconventional" in the way I designed this app,&nbsp;was that&nbsp; it's first design in was in&nbsp;1995. I went out and bought a retail version of Access 2.0 to design a relational database to help&nbsp;my NAPA parts customer out of
 a bind ... and they have stuck with me ever since.&nbsp;I guess that makes me a&nbsp;Professional Partsperson, and a hobby "programmer".</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'm sure you're aware that there was no MDE capability in the retail version, and my&nbsp;entire design was completely exposed. Users got poking around, screwing things up ...&nbsp;then called me to fix it. They, or I could change the query, and oops ... now the form
 or report&nbsp;doesn't work. So yeah, hiding the SQL in the form fixed that for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>All-in-all, though, this has been&nbsp;a sometimes challenging, but&nbsp;mostly a rewarding&nbsp;learning experience,&nbsp; one that I have enjoyed for many years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as "bloat" goes, the present size of the FE is about 8MB, and down under 7MB if I compact it.</p>
<p>The BE is about 2MB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the customer's request,&nbsp;these 4 tables&nbsp;get "re-initialized" at the start of every school year (late August), which probably helps to keep the file sizes down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Lets use 2005-2006 school year&nbsp;for an example of record counts:
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>TableName</td>
<td>RecordCount</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>tblRepairOrders</td>
<td>964</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>tblLabor</td>
<td>1080</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>tblPartsRecd</td>
<td>1181</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>tblPartsSold</td>
<td>3926</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
There are about&nbsp;12 other&nbsp;linked tables, with data that does not change (from a repair history perspective) from year-to-year. There are about 30 forms (including sub-forms, dialogs, etc.) and about a dozen reports.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The bottom line is that it works, and they're reasonably happy using it. ;)</p>

            To answer your original question, the following function will do it:<br />
<br />
Public Function OpenTempQuery(strSQL As String)<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim qdf As DAO.QueryDef<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Static n As Integer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; n = n + 1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' delete temporary querydef object if exists<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Error Resume Next<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CurrentDb.QueryDefs.Delete "Temp" &amp; n<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select Case Err.Number<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case 0<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' no error<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case 3265<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' temporary querydef does not exist<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' ignore error<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' unknown error<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox Err.Number, vbExclamation, "Error"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End Select<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' create temporary querydef object<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set qdf = CurrentDb.CreateQueryDef("Temp" &amp; n)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CurrentDb.QueryDefs("Temp" &amp; n).SQL = strSQL<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' open query and then delete temporary querydef object<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.OpenQuery "Temp" &amp; n<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' delete temporary querydef object<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CurrentDb.QueryDefs.Delete "Temp" &amp; n<br />
<br />
End Function<br />
<br />
By virtue of the Static variable the&nbsp; function can be called as many times as you wish, while leaving each datasheet open.&nbsp; This in fact is why I originally wrote it for use in my own work as an Environmental Planning Officer, as it gave me a cheap and cheerful
 way of answering <em>'what if?'</em> questions by including different criteria each time.&nbsp; It's not something I'd include in a distributed application, however.&nbsp; In those I'd always include a structured interface for querying, presenting the results in forms
 or reports.<br />

            <p>Thanks Ken, and you're right. Based on everything discussed in this conversation, I've decided that:</p>
<p>1.) The client probably wouldn't likely use such a query anyway ... manually deleting displayed records.</p>
<p>2.) IF I proceed&nbsp;with the form/subform approach, it will likely be me sitting down with the client for a couple of minutes and consulting with him as to doing the clean-up. I think it's still a good idea, because I will be able to do it quickly, with a couple
 of button-clicks.</p>
<p>3.) I've just taken a hard look at tblPartsInventory, and (by the nature of changing needs and parts obsolescence) there's a TON of useless information in there. With his permission, I'd like to delete anything with 0 on-hand, 0 sales, or 0 receipts within
 the last year. </p>
<p>
</p><p>There are about 4,000 records that meet that criteria right now. I don't notice that affecting things like "cboPartNumber" lookups ... but I'm working on an i7-2600 with 8GB ram, whereas he has been living with a 10-yr-old WinXP box. I've read something
 recently about designing combo-boxes that don't auto-fill until you've typed 3 characters, which is supposed to lessen the load significantly.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>A validation rule, and a TRUE Required property will come into play however the data is entered or updated, and certainly should be used where they can be.&nbsp; It's fairly limited, however.&nbsp; In some cases a CHECK CONSTRAINT will be more appropriate to ensure
 valid data, and like a validation rule operates at table level.&nbsp; It provides validation not only within the context of an individual row, but over a set, so is far more flexible.&nbsp; It's a more advanced technique than a validation rule as it requires some DDL
 code to be written.&nbsp; Moreover, in Access it cannot be executed in the SQL view of the query designer like other DDL such as a CREATE TABLE statement, but has to be executed in VBA code.&nbsp; Once you have the hang of it though, it's not very difficult to do.</p>

<h2>            Powerpoint won&#39;t allow me to type in the notes section.</h2>
                    I am trying to add notes to my slides. Every time I begin typing in the notes section, the cursor moves up onto the slide after a couple keystrokes. How do I get it to stop moving away from the notes section.

 selection lists unusably longish and cumbersome to&nbsp;use.&nbsp;And what's most annoying: it usually offers one of these strange fonts as default and thus ALWAYS requires&nbsp;me to click and scroll...</i></p>
<p>

<b>I read the above question after searching in the "search" box at www.microsoft.com site. &nbsp;My search was "protected system fonts" . &nbsp;This poster received a rather snide response from someone who signed as "Microsoft Office Andre" &nbsp;and was further identified
 as Andre Ziegler. &nbsp;This nasty little response dismissed the question as needed to be asked in the Microsoft Office forums. &nbsp;Ok, Andre, here it is. &nbsp;Oh, and by the way, if you are a representative of Microsoft Office, shouldn't you have just answered his question
 rather than insist that he repost? &nbsp;Ok, I'm reposting.....I want to know how to delete the "protected system fonts" &nbsp;I assure you that no one that uses this computer (only me) has any need for a language that is not English. &nbsp;I assume these fonts would be
 used to communicate with a non-English speaking user if they needed software instructions or computer instructions in their language.....that's just not going to happen here.</b></p>

<b>If you are perversely insisting on having these fonts remain; and if you are, I really need to know why. &nbsp;At the very least you should be able to instruct those of us who do NOT want to have to scroll through a huge list of fonts when you're using any of

            There are some fonts used by the Operating system for its own uses and you cannot delete them. &nbsp;The list of fonts that show up in word is a default list and you cannot hide them.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>But you can make a font as default, by click on the small arrow on the bottom right of Fonts section. Choose the desired font and other settings and click on set as default. That should take care of the default fonts.</div>

 since before there WAS Windows.&nbsp; I know how to change the default font....duh.<br />
<br />
As you so eloquently put....."used by the Operating system for its own uses"....&nbsp; For God's sake you're not talking to a 6-year-old.&nbsp; The operating systems isn't a proper noun, it doesn't need to be capitalized.&nbsp; It isn't a sentient being; it doesn't have ..."its
 own uses".&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Not only is it demeaning to be given the runaround -- that's a Microsoft Office question, so you should post there, then when I post in the Office section to be told that is an Operating System issue -- but the runaround does not answer the question.&nbsp; There
 is no programming reason that all the Operating System&nbsp; fonts have to be in a "default list" within Word, so that and the user "cannot hide them".&nbsp; Are you telling me that even though Word is one of the most customizable word processing programs ever put on
 the market, you cannot control which fonts you see for selection?&nbsp; Why not?&nbsp; I neither want nor need a single default font.&nbsp; I want the small set of fonts from which I would work.<br />
<br />
The fact that some font is needed in Egypt or Russia or the nation of Wingdings should not determine whether I have to see that font.&nbsp; Any smart programer should be able to have an "opt in" or "opt out" system regarding the system fonts from which I select.<br />
<br />
Microsoft used to be responsive to customers.&nbsp; Why should I get this runaround now?<br />

            Which fonts have you tried to uninstall without success? Although there are some "Windows core fonts" that it might be unwise to uninstall (because applications are based on the assumption that they are available), I can't imagine that there are more than
 just a small handful (fonts used in the application UI) that would be "protected."

First, let me thank you for your attention to this matter.&nbsp; I believe you will agree with me that 95 (ninety-five) is not what most people would call a "handful".&nbsp; I did my best to separate out and count the fonts that could not be deleted.&nbsp; I definitely missed
 a few, and I also see some I could identify as necessary, i.e., MSGOTHIC.TTC.&nbsp; However, I compiled a list that ranges from APARAJ.TTF to VRINDAB.TTF and even includes "Plantagenet Cherokee Regular".&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Please, please can you help?<br />
<br />

            <p>Well, I was dubious about Plantagenet Cherokee (since I'd never heard of it), but sure enough, according to
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/font.aspx?FMID=1628" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/font.aspx?FMID=1628</a>, apparently it's supplied with Windows 7 (and includes the Cherokee Unicode range). Aparajita is Hindi, Vrinda is Bengali, MS Gothic is Japanese, etc., confirming your statement about their being
 nonroman fonts. I just pulled up Word 2010 on my Windows 7 laptop and can confirm what you're seeing (in Word's font list)--made even more annoying by the fact that you can't choose to display the font names in a single font.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/product.aspx?PID=161" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/product.aspx?PID=161</a>, these fonts are installed by Windows 7, not Office, which makes it clear that this is not a Word/Office question. It also, sadly, means that there's probably no way around the problem by reinstalling
 Office and omitting "international features" or "support for nonroman scripts" or the like.</p>
<p>There may be a solution, but, if there is, it will be found in a Windows forum. I could move this thread to Windows, but given the length it has already reached without a solution, it might be better for you to start afresh with a question at
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_install-windows_7?page=1">

<p>I'm sorry I can't be more helpful--or more encouraging!</p>

            In my initial post, I explained that I found the original question in the Windows forum.&nbsp; That question was written by a user named Michael.&nbsp; In the response he got from Microsoft Office Andre aka Andre Ziegler, was the directive to put this in the Office
 Forum because it was not a Windows issue.<br />
<br />
So you see, this runaround has already been done.&nbsp; While I certainly don't blame you for reading the lengthy initial message that explained this, I'm afraid your helpful intention reaches another road-block.&nbsp; I'm absolutely beyond frustrated here.&nbsp; So much
 so, I'm considering leaving Microsoft to snide little Andre and his non-helpful friends. I just can't believe how far Microsoft has fallen from the company Bill Gates started.&nbsp; I've been a Microsoft fan since MS-DOS was first introduced.&nbsp; This is about the
 end for me.....this nonsense about the fonts is inexcusable.<br />
<br />
Please, if you know of anyone that might actually deign to help me, I would be a Suzanne S. Barnhill fan forever :)<br />

            I'm afraid all three links point to exactly the same place, instructions to Show/Hide the fonts within the Control Panel.&nbsp; Yes, there is a Windows feature to hide fonts not within your language set.&nbsp; However, there is one glaring problem.&nbsp; It doesn't work.&nbsp;
 The only thing that hides is it grays out the icon of the 95 fonts I wrote about.&nbsp; The fonts remain and for the grand insult, the fonts remain in the Word pull-down list.&nbsp; Ta-da!&nbsp; It seems that Microsoft doesn't consider it important to actually have Windows
 features work for their own programs.<br />
<br />
There is something glaringly wrong with your statement that I might have to live with all these fonts.&nbsp; Doesn't it seem a little backwards that because Windows features doesn't work with its own programs that the CUSTOMER who paid $ has to live with Microsoft
 mistakes?<br />

<p><br />
That's the solution! <strong>Edit the registry</strong>. Directions (from memory, it's been a couple of years since I did this):</p>
<p>1) Before you do, <strong>copy the fonts from Windows/Fonts</strong> to a separate drive (USB/Flash, external drive, CD-ROM, anything BUT your computer's hard drive) so that you have a copy in case some application wants to&nbsp;use Batang, for example. You want
 to be able to reinstall it. And don't save them in a folder on your computer but instead on some external drive so that&nbsp;Windows doesn't get confused and bring them back into your system.</p>
<p>2) Run <strong>RegEdit</strong> and find the section that lists the fonts. Delete the entries of fonts you don't want to appear in your font menus. Just make sure you retain those that are the usual Windows fonts (Arial, Times New Roman, MS Outlook, MS Serif,
 MS Sans Serif) and common fonts used on websites and in documents (Tahoma,&nbsp;Verdana, Georgia, Calibri, Cambria, etc.).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's a link to an archived section of our website that lists Windows system fonts. Although the info is 10 years old, these still are the basic system fonts but there may be more since this list was created.
<a href="http://www.pubcom.com/tools/tools_systemfonts.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pubcom.com/tools/tools_systemfonts.htm</a></p>
<p>3) I think you then need to <strong>reboot the system</strong>. (Doing this from memory, sorry)</p>
<p>4) And then you should be able to delete the actual font files from the Windows/Fonts folder. When you deleted them from the Registry, they essentially became "unprotected" allowing you to delete the actual font file.</p>
<p>I agree with you: this is a royal PITA (pain in the annatomy). I don't want Khmer, Ethiopian, Cherokee, Lao, Thai, and a bazillion-and-one dialects of Indian, Chinese, Korean, and Japaneses fonts on my system. (It's great that these language fonts are provided
 by MS&nbsp;for folks who speak those languages. But I don't and therefore don't need those fonts cluttering up my computer.)
</p>
<p>Why&nbsp;Windows installs them&nbsp;by default is beyond my reasoning. And why they are PROTECTED system fonts is even more irrational (you can't delete them from the Fonts folder or fonts control panel). When Windows is installed, the user should be given the option
 of installing the fonts of various languages.</p>
<p>I have to also install Adobe's Creative Suite and when I'm done, the total font list from Windows 7, Office 2010, and Adobe Creative Suite is just under 1,000 fonts. That's a lot of time spent&nbsp;loading into my computer's memory, and a long scrolling font
 menu in&nbsp;all my applications.</p>
<p>There's got to be a better way, eh? &lt;g&gt;&nbsp;</p>

<h3> ballybeg  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Access 2010 dtd is prohibited error on xml import</h2>
                    Hi all, for years I have been using the Application.ImportXml method to import and process a small (45 kb) xml file.<br />
<br />
The file includes DTD definitions and since upgrading to office 2010 I get a "dtd is prohibited" error.<br />
<br />
I have found a work around by stripping out the dtd but it is a real pain.&nbsp; Is there somewhere I can adjust the security of the importxml process?<br />
<br />
Must say Access does not handle XML very well out of the box.&nbsp; Put attributes in the xml and then the pain begins<br />

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The ImportXML method allows developers to import XML data and/or schema information into the Microsoft Access database engine, since it doesn't accomodate
 DTDs, strip out the DTD, as you mentioned. you can use the XML Task to achieve it, here is a similar post related to it which you can refer to.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When you applied Application.ImportXML method, you can specify the second optional parameter ImportOptions and set its value to acAppendData in AcImportXMLOption
 enumeration.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Such as:</span></p>

<br />Since Skype account is attached to your Microsoft account, then Microsoft account will also get closed if you close your Skype account which means all your Microsoft services will be impacted. Hence, it is not recommended to close a Skype account.

            Hi Larry
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Since October 2016, Skype accounts are now linked to Microsoft Accounts just like other Microsoft Services such as OneDrive. Due to this change, it is no longer possible to delete your Skype account without also closing your Microsoft Account. 
<br />
<br />The best thing you can do is no longer sign into that account and use the available options of transferring your contacts and credits to the new account. 
<br />
<br />If you wish to continue:
<br />
<br />Before you close your Microsoft account, let's make sure you aren't leaving anything important relating to Skype behind:
<br />
<br />    Sign in to Skype.  
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/myaccount</a>
<br />
<br />    Follow the steps in this article to verify that: 
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/12412" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/help/12412</a>
<br />
<br />        Important information such as files and contacts are saved.
<br />        Your Skype Credit balance has been used. Once your account is closed, you can't get it back. 
<br />        Active subscriptions have been cancelled so you donít continue to get charged. If you have Auto-recharge enabled and cancel your account without first cancelling your subscription, you will continue to be charged until your account has been permanently closed in 60 days. Learn how to disable Auto-recharge.
<br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/faq/FA633" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/faq/FA633</a>
<br />
<br />You can close your Microsoft account by following these steps:
<br />
<br />    Go to our Microsoft account closure page (<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=523898" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=523898</a>). You may be prompted to sign in or verify your password.
<br />    Make sure you are signed in to the Microsoft account you want to close and select Next. 
<br />    In the Select a reason drop-down list, choose the reason you're closing the account. 
<br />    Select Mark account for closure.
<br />    Your Microsoft account will be closed in 60 days. We wait 60 days before permanently deleting accounts in case you change your mind or need to access something before it's gone. You can change your mind any time during the 60 days, just sign in (<a href="https://go.skype.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/myaccount</a>) to cancel the closure.

    <title>Updates Failing&#47; Screen Timeout - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> baseagle121  say:</h3>
<h2>            Updates Failing&#47; Screen Timeout</h2>
                    <p>After attempting to update to the latest build last night and this morning (6/29-6/30), My computer (MacBook Pro Retina) running the Windows 10 Insider Preview Pro x64 continued to cancel the updates. &nbsp;After trying several times and waiting several hours
 for the final attempt to complete, I restarted my computer.</p>
<p>Each time I reboot my computer through the boot menu to access my Windows partition, Windows tells me it is restarting, and it sends me back to the boot menu. &nbsp;this continues about 5 times, and it allows me into my computer. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As of this morning, after the update finished (theoretically) installing, my screen continued to turn off. &nbsp;After moving the mouse around for about 10 seconds, the screen turns on for about 1 second, then shuts off again. &nbsp;The keyboard remains lit, so I
 know it's not my computer shutting down. &nbsp;Was there an issue with the latest build that was released? &nbsp;Is there a way to fix this issue without forcing me to reinstall the ISO? &nbsp;I don'y know what the latest build that worked for me was, all that I know is
 that it used Project Spartan instead of Edge.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>What is the make and model&nbsp;of your computer? </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As you are unable to boot to desktop I suggest you to do a <strong>Automatic</strong>
<strong>repair</strong>. The Automatic repair can detect and fix the issues that prevent the computer from starting normally. You will need the Windows&nbsp;10 Technical Preview installation disc to perform an Automatic repair. If you don’t have a Windows&nbsp;10 Technical
 Preview disc, I suggest you to download the Windows&nbsp;10 Technical Preview ISO from the link given below.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Download Windows&nbsp;10 Technical Preview ISO </span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/preview-iso" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/preview-iso</span></a>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>After you have a Windows&nbsp;10 Technical Preview installation disc, follow these steps: &nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>When your computer starts, wait for the manufacturer logo to check the option for boot menu, it will usually be
<strong>F12. </strong></span></li><li><span>The boot menu key might differ with each manufacturer. If you are unable to find the boot menu key, you may refer the user manual.</span></li><li><span>Restart the computer, when the manufacturer's logo is displayed, keep pressing the Boot menu option key to enter the boot menu and change the boot option to
<strong>CD\DVD</strong> ROM. </span></li><li><span>After you boot your computer using Windows DVD or <strong>System Repair</strong> Disc, a black screen appears with gray text "<strong>Press any key to boot from CD or DVD</strong>". Press any key.
</span></li><li><span>Select the correct time and Keyboard type. </span></li><li><span>Click <strong>Repair</strong> your computer in the lower left corner </span>
</li><li><span>Click on <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>, <strong>advanced option</strong> and then click
<strong>start up repair</strong>.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>Once you have successfully performed the <strong>startup repair </strong>
you can go ahead and try to install the updates and drivers from the manufacturer's website. Once you have successfully booted to desktop follow the steps given in the link below.</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>Make sure that you have installed the latest version of all drivers installed on your computer. In order to install the latest derivers follow the steps given below.</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press <strong>Windows Key + X</strong> Key.</span></p>
<p><span>b) Click on <strong>Device</strong> <strong>Manager</strong>. You will see a list of drivers installed, right click and uninstall it.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Install the driver from the manufacturer website.</span></p>
<p>

<p>Without being too pejorative, what changed 2 weeks ago?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you burn a CD, are they .cda files or .mp3 files? Is the CD player you are using to play your burned CD's mp3 compatible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mentioned a Folder. When I use WMP to burn MP3 files, it does not automagically make a Folder. It would help to know just how you are telling WMP to burn the disk. Do you know what your Settings are? Can you share?</p>
<p>

<p>Hang on. Slow down. First issue: Older gentleman, CD player in car..</p>
<p>
</p><p>My troglodyte younger brother's car CD player only does .cda's. not MP3's. Just sayin'.</p>
<p>
I sincerely doubt that the Files themselves were corrupted. Your first assignment might be to find the Path to the Files in question. Happy to help if needed.<br />
</p><p>
</p><p>My preferred method is to use Windows FILE Explorer. I launch Windows FILE Explorer, use it to navigate to the files I want to burn to a CD. I highlight the files that need to be burned. I click on 'Burn" in the Menu Bar in the top of the Window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on 'Burn', a window pops up:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/33310e92-41a6-4e81-b852-a0554d7e4587?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/33310e92-41a6-4e81-b852-a0554d7e4587?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Notice that Windoze defaults to 'With a CD/DVD player.'. This is good. Take the default and click on 'Next.'</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/79ce9ee8-4258-49f2-bd2b-ce8d9d7b124b?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/79ce9ee8-4258-49f2-bd2b-ce8d9d7b124b?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Notice that in the above screen shot, there is a 'desktop.ini' file. This is good.</p>
<p>Notice that there are no other files. That is because none were selected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So. let us try again. Navigate in File Explorer to the Drive and Folder that has the music to be burned.</p>
<p>Select the files by highlighting.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0e13ffaa-3f2f-4257-9362-ff83eccbb95c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0e13ffaa-3f2f-4257-9362-ff83eccbb95c?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>In the example above, the files are copied to the CD drive as Temporary Files. Almost always, there is this irritating balloon at the bottom of the window that is useless, but it looks like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f44457b9-702e-47b4-b762-c2de86adae94?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f44457b9-702e-47b4-b762-c2de86adae94?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Click on it if you want. Most times it does nothing, and we have work to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Call me crazy, but I only want to waste time on stuff that actually works.</p>
<p>So, that means, we are here, in Windoze File Explorer:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/75ac779b-ca49-4732-b2a7-df0b2a0069a3?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/75ac779b-ca49-4732-b2a7-df0b2a0069a3?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>We selected these files, and told Windoze to Burn them. Windoze put the files in to its 'Burn' bag, i.e. the CD/DVD drive. (Drive D: above) We told Windoze to burn the files as MP3's, not CDA's. The good news is that more MP3's will fit on a disk. The bad
 news is that older CD players only accept .CDA files, which means only 78 minutes per disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if your mileage varies in any way.</p>

            <p>A lot depends on how you initiate Outlook in your code and where the code is running; is it inside Outlook or an external application?</p>
<p>Instead of using the OOM, you could also use Redemption which (due to the way it is programmed and addressing Outlook) won't raise any security prompts;<br />
See; <a href="http://addins.howto-outlook.com/dimastr_redemption" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://addins.howto-outlook.com/dimastr_redemption</a></p>
<p>For further support with your code, it'd be better to ask in the Outlook Dev forum;<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for slow reply. I still thing you're using Edge, not Internet Explorer. I've seen other print issues with Edge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try accessing Yahoo Mail with Internet Explorer. See if that lets you download and print the attachment.</p>
<p>-- - -- - -- - --</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Access IE11 in Windows 10:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You also have IE11 installed on Windows 10 and can use IE11 instead of Edge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using Edge and want to use IE11, click on&nbsp;the 3 dots at the upper right corner&nbsp;and select Open with Internet Explorer.</p>

<h2>            Can Excel figure out how many days left in the month based on todays date</h2>
                    <p>I have this forula in column C given to me by the Excel Gurus;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=IF(LEN(A4),MAX(0,800-SUM($B$4:B4)),"")</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That basically tells me (in C)&nbsp;how many parts I need to ship <strong>based on my running total in B to reach 800</strong></p>

<p><strong>Question: Now for D, </strong>&nbsp;If I have an answer in C15 &nbsp;of 525, and todays date is Oct 15, 2012, Can Excel figure I have 16 days left and devide 525 by 16 and put the answer in D, telling me the average I need to ship daily till I reach the 800
 Number in the formula and change as thr date changes toward the end of the month?</p>

<p>Of course the 16 days would change based on <strong>todays date</strong> and the
<strong>remaining days in the month</strong>.</p>

<p>Somehow I don't think this will work, but one can always hope.</p>

<h3> pierafumagalli  say:</h3>
<h2>            The Italian Grammar Checker Is Not Working in Office 2013</h2>
                    I have downloaded and installed the Language Pack for Italian 2013 to go with my new 2013 Office on my new computer. My old computer, running Office Word 2007 with the Italian language pack for 2007 worked beautifully. Now that old computer is crashing
 on and off, and I had to buy a new computer with a new Office and a new language pack. The new 2013 Italian language pack does not check grammar, although it catches spelling mistakes. Anyone who speaks Italian knows that spelling is not an issue (Italian
 spelling is much easier than English); however, the grammar checker is not working AT ALL and it is needed. I took some screen shots of the way the grammar checker worked in 2007 and have been getting help from Microsoft technicians who can't seem to fix this
 issue. So far, I have clocked in 16 hours with Microsoft technicians and the case has been escalated three times. Currently, the technician is watching me as I type this in. I cannot believe that the excellent features of the Italian Language Pack 2007 (grammar
 checker) have been dropped from the 2013 version. How can they call the Italian Language Pack 2013 a grammar checker if no grammar checking is going on? I do not believe this is intentional. The 2007 grammar checker was a good service (although not perfect--no
 electronic grammar checker is). It was much better than the English grammar checker. So what happened to it? I cannot believe that Microsoft wants to intentionally drop this valuable feature.<br />

            Did you download the Language Pack for Italian that has the same "bitness" as your version of Office.&nbsp; The latter is almost certainly 32-bit and for that you need the X86 version of the language pack.

            Yes, I am using the 32 bit versions for both. Just to make sure, I verified this with the MS technician. Thanks, but this does not seem to be the problem.

            <p>You could have saved some money by installing Office 2007 and the language pack you already had on your new computer. You would of course have had to uninstall Office 2013 first (you could re-install it after 2007). Office 2007 is compatible with the latest
 Windows versions and many would say it's a lot less trouble than Office 2013.</p>

            This is a great idea. Unfortunately, I downloaded the 2007 Italian language pack from the MS store, and it is no longer available for download. So how can I get it now to install on my new computer? My old computer is crashing on and off, and I may be
 able to get in there and copy the language pack--but I don't know how. Any suggestions?

            If the language pack installation file is still on your old computer, you can transfer it to your new one. If not, you are out of luck, I'm afraid. As far as I know, language packs for Office 2007 are no longer sold by Microsoft.

            Another question: My Windows 7 operating system is 64-bit, but my Office Word--which was sold to me along with the computer-- and Language Pack are 32-bit. Could this be creating problems?

            No. The 32 bit version of Office is the appropriate version for most users.<br />

            <p>Although I could not imagine that the entire country of Italy would be without a reliable grammar checker for Word 2013, I decided to search in Italian for information about this. I found a blog started in 2013 concerning this issue. The last post was April
 20, 2015, with a simple question asking if the issue had been resolved. The simple answer: No, unfortunately not yet. Then, &nbsp;when I called Microsoft today, a high-level technician admitted to me that this is a "known issue." So there is no working grammar
 checker in the 2013 Word Italian Language Pack which is sold as a spelling and grammar checker. I did find out that the 2010 version works (according to the blog), and unlike the 2013 version, it is still available for sale. The technician said that they will
 give me a callback tomorrow and help me uninstall and install, etc. I have to say that the technicians I have spoken to have tried their best to be helpful, and I really appreciate that. Since years ago I discovered that the 2007 language pack worked with
 my 2003 Word, I would like to find out if the 2010 language pack will work with my 2007 word. If not, I will have to buy the 2010 Word, too.

            <p>This weekend (9/25/2015), I visited a Microsoft store and discovered that the Italian language pack for Office 2016 does not work either. The technicians kindly downloaded an Italian language pack so that I could try it out.
<strong>THE ITALIAN LANGUAGE PACK FOR OFFICE 2016 DOES NOT CHECK GRAMMAR.</strong> It also seems that now the spell checker is broken ("adddesso" comes up as correct). The technicians at the store told me that Microsoft will fix bugs only if many complain.
 If anyone else out there has this problem, PLEASE contact Microsoft and complain. You can complain here or on the Italian blog:<br />

    <title>Opening a Bluetooth SPP connection in Windows Mobile 6 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Opening a Bluetooth SPP connection in Windows Mobile 6</h2>
                    Hi all,<br />
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<p><span>I am working with an app (which I did not write) that’s expecting data to come in from a remote sensor via the RS-232 serial port on my WM6-based handheld field computer (Trimble Nomad).
 Instead, I want the data to arrive via Bluetooth, and have set up a Bluetooth serial port profile device on COM 9. The app allows me to set the COM port where data should arrive, so no major problem there.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The problem I am having is establishing the BT connection, as the app does not expect to use Bluetooth, and generally the device isn’t connected to the remote sensor prior to the sensor
 sending data. With no BT connection preestablished, the app doesn’t get the data when the sensor sends it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I’ve found a stopgap solution: I connect a terminal emulator from the handheld to the BT device on the remote sensor, which establishes the BT connection, and then quit the terminal emulator
 without disconnecting, and thereafter data flows as intended - usually. But it’s very inelegant.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Does anyone have a better idea for connecting a SPP bluetooth device from WM6? Perhaps a small utility?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks!</span></p>
<p><span>BC</span></p>

            I would suggest that the best place to ask that question is in the mobile device section of the MSDN forums were you will have the opportunity to talk with other developers.&nbsp; Hipefully one might be able to help with the routine you need to write.<br />
