<h2>            Links from online bank not opening in Internet Explorer 8</h2>
                    I am signed into my online banking and none of the links will pop up. I'm sure it's some security setting but I cannot find it.

<p>Click<em> Start</em> or tap the<em> Windows key</em> and type<em> default programs</em>&nbsp;then hit<em> &lt;enter&gt;</em>. From here you have two avenues.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p>In the new window click<em> Set your default programs</em>. If your 2007 Office programs are now&nbsp;listed in the<em> Programs</em> list on the left, select one (e.g. Word 2007) and then click<strong>
 Set this program as default</strong> at the bottom. Repeat for the other Office 2007 programs.</p>
<p>If your Office programs are<em> not</em> listed, click the<strong> Back</strong> button in the top left and move to Method 2.</p>
<p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>
<p>In the new window click<em> Associate a file type or protocol with a program</em>. In this new window scroll the list down to<em> .docx</em> and double click it.</p>
<p>If the Word 2007 application is&nbsp;listed in this<strong> Open With</strong> dialog, double click it. If it is not, browse to</p>
<p>%PROGRAMFILES%\Microsoft Office\Office12</p>
<p>... and select<em> winword.exe</em>. Repeat for other Word document and template types (e.g. .docm, .dot, .dotm, .docxml, etc).</p>

<h3> wcmlsx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mouse Cursor disappears in PowerPoint 10</h2>
                    In my PowerPoint 10 presentations, on slides with video, the video slide bar and mouse cursor will disappear after about 5 seconds, even though I have set the Arrow Options to Visible. After this happens, and I check the Arrow Options menu, it has changed
 back to Automatic. This does not happen on a slide without video. <br />
<br />
This is happening on a laptop with Windows XP and a desktop with Windows 7

            Yes I can repro that (I assume by powerPoint 9 you mean 2007 which is actually PowerPoint 12)<br />
<br />
Try Slide Show Tab &gt;&gt; Untick "Show media controls" and see if that helps.<br />

<p>
</p><p>I had also unlink my Microsoft account then when I rebooted and went back to insider preview builds it worked for me, I have dne this on 2 systems we use for testing and its worked. Obvs be careful editing the registry and prob best to backup these keys

            I think you would need to be able to get at the data that underlies the graph on the web. There is no way I know that converts a graph (as a graph) back to underlying data. You could copy (or take a screen clip of) the graph and paste into Excel, but this
 would just be a "dumb" image.<br />

            I think i did mention that data can be taken which is text but not graph. <br />
So i think you just answered for sake of it ... Sorry.. <br />
If so confident on the answer can you provide the link which SAYS SO.<br />

<h2>            Why does font size 10 look so small on Outlook for Mac 2011</h2>
                    When I compose an email I have the default font set to Arial size 10 but it looks ridiculously small. If I increase the font size anymore - recipients looking at the email in Outlook on a Windows PC see it as really big. Why is this and how can I fix it?

            The new, WebKit based editor in Outlook uses pixels.&nbsp; The difference is that pixels will typically render much smaller on your device that the same point (search "points vs pixels" for a deeper explanation).&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I use size 14 which is equivalent to Entourage 2008's 12.&nbsp; Just up your font size.&nbsp; As long as your receiver is in a relatively modern e-mail client (anything in the last 10 years), they won't see anything odd.<br />

<h2>            Why can&#39;t i launch web page Favorites from SkyDrive app in Windows Phone&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have the latest version of Windows Phone (Tango). Why am I not able to launch web sites from my "Favorites" folde in the SkyDrive app. When I click on them it just takes me to a page showing the Title of the URL, Location: Favorites, Size: 1 kb, Date Modified:
 5/17/2011, and Shared With: Just me. I have tried everthing I can think of but still can't get the SkyDrive app to launch the web sites in my Favorites folder.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I go into IE on the phone and go to the SkyDrive website, I am able to launch them just fine. Seems to be a problem with the App itself.</p>

            <p>Because the phone doesn't understand the .URL file type, which is what those Internet shortcuts are. When you visit the webpage, SkyDrive can change them to a clickable link. The SkyDrive app doesn't do that.</p>
<p>SkyDrive sync of my IE favourites and Bing Maps places are two things I'd love for Windows Phone. The best thing to do is put this in the

<p>Hello Graham,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The above memory error messages can be very generic and don't always identify the real or specific cause of the issue. However, if your file is large or contains a large amount of features, it is possible you are running
 low on available memory error.&nbsp;</span><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you mention that you're using a lot of graphs on the older version of Excel, I'd like to clarify if you're encountering the error message only while using/inserting graph on Excel? Also, you need to determine if the error is specific to one workbook.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You've mentioned that you're already using 64- bit version, Is it 64- bit version of your Windows 10 or is it Microsoft Excel 64-bit version?&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the possible troubleshooting steps to resolve your concern is to use <em>
<strong>Microsoft Excel 64-bit</strong></em>.&nbsp;If you already installed the 32-bit version, but want to install the 64-bit version instead, you must uninstall the version you don't want before installing the version you do want. For more information, please
 check this article:&nbsp;<br />

<p>Hi Antoneth,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thanks for your interest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought a new computer this year removed the free Office that came with it and installed the 64 - bit Office 365, which I already have a subscription for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This particular error only happens in Excel. I'm actively using only 2 XL files, the main one is about 900K, smaller than ones I've had in past versions of Office, and the problem happens in both files. The other one is much smaller, and I haven't used it
 recently except to check if this fault happens, but it was created from the larger one quite a long time ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best wishes,</p>
<p>Graham.</p>

<p>Issue: The Office applications on my phone are current, the licence says "View Only". I cannot see a way to activate the application with my subscription. On the About&nbsp;screen there is only a button that says "Get Office 365", which then takes you to an option
 to purchase Office 365 Personal or Office 365 Home. Anyone else have this issue? or anyone got solution?</p>

<p>Hi Sjan365,</p>
<p>To clarify the situation, can you provide us the information below?<br />
1. A screenshot of the message regarding “The Office applications on my phone are current, the license says "View Only".”<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; To upload screenshots, click <b>Use rich Formatting</b> in this thread and select
<b>Insert/Edit Media</b>.</p>
<p>2. Does the problem only occur to the files which are opened from SharePoint Online? &nbsp;Can you edit local documents?</p>
<p>3. Did you encounter any error signing with the Office 365 Work or School account?</p>
<p>4. Can you edit the SharePoint Online files directly via browsers or other devices?</p>
<p>5. Please refer to this article <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Read-only-and-compatible-files-for-Word-Mobile-for-Windows-10-78dac09f-fd0a-49d9-ba67-fae751827124?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>here are my responses...</p>
<p>1. the licence issue seems to have resolved itself (see attached image), it is good that the application does check the account and update the activation of the application, but some more obvious indication that the licence status like a popup message or
 a text message would be good.</p>
<p>2. n/a - 3. n/a - 4. n/a</p>
<p>5. this answers the question about opening and editing .txt files. why microsoft has to tinker with this is beyond me. l know ms wants to make a lean app for the windows phone but such basic removal of function borders on moronic. i know the search engine

<p>jerry, the reason i marked your answer as "helpful" rather than "answered" is because of the second part where you pasted a helpful link, whereas i would have preferred an answer, which should be "no - but can find additional information and then paste the
 link", that would be an answer, however i thank you for your response.</p>

<h2>            Unable to open .dat file in Office 7 WORD</h2>
                    <p>I work with Windows 7 and the Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007 program. </p>
<p>When I receive files with the 3-letter extension .dat&nbsp;(attached to emails), I am unable to open the files.</p>
<p>None of the "free" downloads on microsoft.support page are actually free. Each one wanted a credit card/Paypal payments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I open .dat files with my Windows 7/Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007 program?</p>
<p>Which programs create .dat files? Are they Macintosh programs or are they created by a newer version of Office WORD &amp; Excel?</p>

<p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When&nbsp;user creates a new record. Access sends an email message with&nbsp;a hyperlink to database and record ID in Subject line.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"&lt;a href=""" &amp; "C:\Users\" &amp; GetLogOnUser &amp; "\Documents\NC Reports\NonConformanceReport_v1.3.accdb" &amp; """&gt;" &amp; _<br />
"Click here to access the NCR Database" &amp; "&lt;/a &gt; "</p>

<p>The recipient clicks on the Hyperlink, it opens the database and start-up Form.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I want is to include&nbsp;Record ID i.e. OrderID in hyperlink and sent it back to database as search criteria. So, when the recipient click on the Hyperlink in email it not only open the Form but also display that record.</p>

            I'm pretty sure you will have to add the path to msaccess and the /cmd argument like I suggested. Did you try enhancing your &lt;a&gt; tag with this extra syntax?

    <title>2 Skype Accounts causing Merging Problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fikavc  say:</h3>
<h2>            2 Skype Accounts causing Merging Problems</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have this issue now since the start of Skype being introduced as a Windows 10 app.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What is the case?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>10 years ago, when Skype wasn't a Microsoft product, I made an account. Simple as that. For the sake of easyness, let's call this one OldSkype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple of months ago, without my permission, without my agreement, my Microsoft account 'generated' a generic empty Skype account based on the e-mailaddress which is being used as my current Microsoft account.</p>
<p><strong>FRUSTRATING...</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Because in no way I can unlink/remove this generic, empty Skype account. And the OldSkype, the 'real' account which I'm using I can't connect to my Microsoft account in any way.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>OK, then don't use the automatically generated empty Skype, no?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, that's what I've been doing. But the problem now is that there is a Skype icon in the tray since last week. When I click on it, it opens up Skype and obviously it opens up the generic empty Skype account. Since it's the one linked to my Microsoft account
 (which I never asked for)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a nerd. I like things polished. So I was like, no big deal, let's just remove the Skype icon from the tray and issue fixed...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot remove the Skype icon from the tray. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Everytime I go to Skype for Windows 10 (App from Microsoft Store) or download it from my Microsoft Account Portal (Web Portal) it automatically signs me in on the wrong account.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What do I want?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Not much. Remove the automatic generated Skype account which is empty.</p>
<p>Add my real 'OldSkype' to my Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What do I want even more?</strong></p>
<p>A business like Microsoft should give his users the choice. You choose for us. You bruteforce your ideas upon a community who not always want these ideas. Some of them are brilliant, some of them are for the sake of the Muffin God... complete retarded...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it really that hard to not automatically generate a Skype account and ask ANY user when they open the software if they have an old account?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For SURE when it's software you guys didn't even make. You bought it. You bought Skype. You keep messing things up with software you buy. Your merging processes are off... far off...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Stop using dumb AI-scripts to automate merging processes and give your USERS, your COMMUNITY the goddamn possibilities to FIX things themselves when your AI-merging scripts messing hings up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I heard from another conversation* that most likely you cannot do this. You cannot unlink/remove the self-automated-generated empty account anymore and nor can you link the
<strong>OldSkype account</strong> to my Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me put it this way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IF... and only IF... you are going to make a bridge-breaking decision which is NOT reversible AT ANY GIVEN POINT...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You MUST... INFORM your community and stop using the 'non-reversible' scripts, they don't work. They do for 95% of all the cases, GG, you win the Internet. But for the 5% of your community they mess things up. And if that 5% of your community cannot fix
 it because you CHOSE to make it impossible for fixing than this is so called 'Bad Management'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry, this is so frustrating and it enrages every fibre in my body.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to advise me how I can 'experience' a good and working Skype with all my contacts, history, media...</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>TL;DR Version</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1. Why did Microsoft chose Skype account &amp; Microsoft accounts to be merged into one account without my permission?</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Why did Microsoft chose not to give me any option when I opened the Skype for Windows 10 app for the first time? Account was created by opening the Skype for Windows 10 (didn't even had a login screen, or whatever)</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Why did Microsoft chose not to inform their users (Notice in the Windows Store App, notice upon opening Skype for the first time)</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. Why do you create software which is not capable of being flexible. Why not make an option 'remove this Skype-Account' and/or 'Replace your Skype-Account'</strong></p>
<p><strong>5. Why? Microsoft... Why? In not a single of these 4 questions and actions you took, there is not even one single spot of logic. It just makes no sense at all.</strong></p>

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Skype is part of Microsoft. So, your Microsoft account can be also be used to access Skype. When your Microsoft account has been logged in to the Skype website, our system will automatically generate a new profile.</p>

</p><p>Second, to delete your account, you can refer to this FAQ link: <strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA142/how-do-i-close-my-skype-account?q=account+deletion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How do I close my Skype account?</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>When you close a Skype account, the Microsoft account associated to it will also be deleted.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Your account will be closed in 30 days. We wait 30 days before permanently deleting accounts in case you change your mind or need to access something before it's gone.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can change your mind any time during the 30 days, just </span><a href="https://go.skype.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">sign in</a><span> to cancel the closure.</span></p>

<p>That's what I keep doing. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't change the fact that Microsoft is at fault here. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I quote myself:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>TL;DR Version</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1. Why did Microsoft chose Skype account &amp; Microsoft accounts to be merged into one account without my permission?</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Why did Microsoft chose not to give me any option when I opened the Skype for Windows 10 app for the first time? Account was created by opening the Skype for Windows 10 (didn't even had a login screen, or whatever)</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Why did Microsoft chose not to inform their users (Notice in the Windows Store App, notice upon opening Skype for the first time)</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. Why do you create software which is not capable of being flexible. Why not make an option 'remove this Skype-Account' and/or 'Replace your Skype-Account'</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The answer on point 1 is since it's business strategy. I don't agree with it, but I can see their motivations.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Questions 2 to 4 are just showing that Microsoft doesn't know how to properly roll-out software changes. That they didn't think about them thoroughly<strong>.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Automatic account creation upon opening of any software (what-so-ever) is just a plain bad idea. For sure when you obtained software with accounts who were created before the Microsoft Account era.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't take a bright mind to realise that automatic account creation would interfere with old accounts from the Pre-Microsoft Skype era. If this is unclear to you, I'll do my best to explain what has happened and why it is bad on so many levels.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I create a Skype-account to contact family living at the other side of the globe. ~10 years ago or so.
</p>
<p>2. Microsoft acquires the Skype software. </p>
<p>3. Microsoft launches Windows 10 as a service.</p>
<p>4. Microsoft wants an all-in-one experience and creates the 'Microsoft Account' (which I like btw)</p>
<p>5. Microsoft automatically generates a Skype account based on the e-mailaddress which you use as your Microsoft Account</p>
<p>6. I have now a Skype-account from the Pre-Microsoft era which I'm uncapable of linking to my Microsoft Account
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If these steps were to be presented in school, and the teacher would ask any student what went wrong, the answer would be:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. They skipped 2 steps</p>
<p>2. They forgot to ask their community if they already had an existing Skype account and if they wanted to use that one for their Microsoft Account.</p>
<p>3. They forgot to add an option in the Microsoft Account settings to remove a Skype account and link another one.</p>
<p>4. Step 3 should only be a thing in 2 cases. Either because people didn't read and it's a foolproof mechanic. Or because they forgot to ask the user if they had already an existing Skype Account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I always read things. I am not the type of person who randomly clicks next because I think it's boring to read all the windows and the default settings will be okay. Heck, I even read ToS from all software I use and games I play.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The sole reason about my frustration, is not the fysical work-arounds (the one you mentioned, common sense, to be fair) I can easily work around it. No big deal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it's the frustration that Microsoft didn't ask anything and just assumed I needed a Skype account. How hard is it before assuming things to ask one simple thing:</p>
<p>
</p><p>'Hello, we are about to automatically generate a Skype account for you. This is part of our all-in-one Microsoft Experience business strategy. Before we generate one automatically, we want to ask if you already have a Skype account, and if so, do you wish
 to link that one to your Microsoft account'</p>
<p>
</p><p>So hard, right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And because they didn't, and they assumed, they assumed wrong. And because of their poor assumptions, I have 2 Skype Accounts and the even more frustrating part about this is, they made this wrong and poor assumption and yet they do not give the end user
 a cure to fix something which they break in the first place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it would be entirely my own stupidity that I end up in such a situation, I kind off could understand. The sad point is, it isn't.</p>

    <title>Phones Dead Why Make MY PC RUN LIKE A PHONE&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tk-tim  say:</h3>
<h2>            Phones Dead Why Make MY PC RUN LIKE A PHONE&#63;</h2>
                    <p>With Microsoft all but admitting defeat with their latest news about getting out of the phone business then why, I ask you, are they still insisting on making my desktop operate like a phone?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now don't get me wrong, there are a lot of nice little things in Windows 8 and Windows 10 for those that use a device with a touch screen.&nbsp; I enjoy my Surface while traveling.&nbsp; But, when I'm back in my office trying to run business applications, I find the
 OS really gets in the way.&nbsp; Not so much the OS, but the interface.&nbsp; Let me explain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you read the posts, complaints, and suggestion about Windows 10 you quickly come to the conclusion that it really all boils down to two things.&nbsp; One, the Start&nbsp; Menu and two the look of a flat lack luster menu system.&nbsp; Sure there are bugs and issues where
 things don't work, but these can be fixed.&nbsp; But you cannot fix a design issue. So lets look at these two things and what MS should do:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Start Menu</strong>:&nbsp; For any user, this is probably the most critical feature of the OS.&nbsp; So, why all the issues?&nbsp; First, it depends on how you're using the system.&nbsp; If you are using Windows on a touch screen then you probably enjoy many of the
 features of the new Start Menu.&nbsp; If you're just reading emails, social media'ng, using the Internet, FB'ng then you're probably happy.&nbsp; Most likely 90% (or more) of the consumer market probably fit into this. &nbsp; They run a few applications and many find it
 easier and better than any other version of Windows.&nbsp; Fine, no argument there. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The second group of people are the so called power users or business centric users.&nbsp; These users, for example, will be using their computer for much more.&nbsp; They might have 100's of applications loaded, operate in a domain, and do much more than the average
 consumer or simply they may use their PS to operate a business.&nbsp; This group of users isn't or doesn't want nor require all the social media and apps which Windows 10 offers.&nbsp; Basically, in these cases the user finds the interface lacking.&nbsp; I suppose, there
 are those that will argue how they can do all in Windows 10, but lets be real clear here.&nbsp; If anyone at MS really looked at this, they'd boil it down to at least two user camps.&nbsp; Those that want a Metro Apps interface and those that want a Menu Interface (as
 in Windows 7).</p>
<p>
</p><p>You don't have to take my word for it, if you read the feedback, it doesn't take long to discover exactly that.&nbsp; So then why doesn't MS offer you a choice?&nbsp; Offer something that a user can turn on where they can select the new Menu System or a Win32 Traditional
 Menu?&nbsp; Why is it so hard to accept this simple fact?&nbsp; They have the source code to do exactly that and the average intern can see these are the at least the two basic Use Case requirements from reading consumer feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Look &amp; Feel</strong>:&nbsp; Just like the Start Menu, you love it or hate it, but just like with the Start Menu Microsoft can offer more than one style can they not?&nbsp; Many find the flat appearance tough to read and work with while on the desktop.&nbsp; Again,
 it is fine for others like me when I use my Surface, but on my desktop it just doesn't work as well as something like an Aero Theme would.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Summary</strong>:&nbsp; Microsoft has lost the tablet war and phone war, I would argue that tablets are dead anyway because of cell phones.&nbsp; iPhone and Android devices pretty much have killed the tablet market.&nbsp; Sure, there are still many tablet users
 but sales have slowed as users have adopted and embraced their cell phones.&nbsp; You can do everything on the Smart Phone that you can do on a tablet, just with a smaller screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What isn't dead is dual devices, all in ones, and desktops/laptops.&nbsp; Devices like the Surfaces which acts like a tablet or laptop has a growing place in business and are very popular with consumers.&nbsp; Sort of like having the best of both worlds.&nbsp; All in ones,
 with touch screens have another appeal in the consumer market.&nbsp; Lastly, the traditional PC or Laptop.&nbsp; The PC will be around for years.&nbsp; You cannot run the world on a Smart Phone.&nbsp; You're still going to have PC's no matter how many cell phones are sold.&nbsp; You
 will have PC users and businesses using PC's and these can and will be verify profitable for MS.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, if you're MS and you're going to compete, in this market then you can see why you'd want a touch centric menuing system and a flat look that renders on these devices.&nbsp; But, those rules don't apply to many desktop users.&nbsp; So why alienate desktop users?&nbsp;
 MS has the source code to do both.&nbsp; I suspect one would argue that it would increase costs, but alienating businesses is costly too.&nbsp; Much more costly than adding back something that you already have and maintaining it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have heard many say, MS should offer a version of Windows for business.&nbsp; But, that hasn't worked in the past.&nbsp; Microsoft tried that with Windows 2000 and then they tried Windows Me as a consumer product and most recently the Surface RT.&nbsp; All failed and
 I am not suggesting that approach.&nbsp; What I am suggesting is for MS to make Themes available.&nbsp; Themes or Styles is really what the requirement is.&nbsp; Yes, the new Start Menu is an XAML interface whereas prior Start Menu's were compiled C++ programs, but there
 is not anything saying a Theme or Style cannot also include the menu system.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>If&nbsp; MS fails to recognize the simple fact they are alienating many PC users then they will continue to have problems converting desktop user that prefer a more traditional interface, or businesses that do too.&nbsp; You have to remember, many of us in business
 don't get a free update to Windows 10. &nbsp; Therefore, if my company wants to upgrade to Windows 10 we have to pay for it.&nbsp; The way it stands today, we will not upgrade our installed Win7 base.&nbsp; On the good side, it will save us millions but costs MS millions
 in sales.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Without the backing and upgrading form the business customer will be costly for MS, especially when you give away the OS to consumers.&nbsp; Is there that much money to be made from the Windows Store and Cloud computing?&nbsp; You could argue that if MS gets a hold
 of your data, email, pictures, etc. by giving you a free tool to access it then they can control and charge you monthly a fee for maintaining it.&nbsp; After all, none of us use a computer or cell phone, for that matter, solely for the menu system or style.&nbsp; We
 use the device for access to data.&nbsp; Data about what to buy, where to eat, sales, marketing, etc.&nbsp; Just like Excel, you don't use it because you like the menu and only use it for that.&nbsp; Excel is worthless and only becomes useful when you put data in it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is MS looking at the access device now as throwaway with whats being important is the data?&nbsp; For he that holds the key to the data kingdom will rule the world?&nbsp; If this is true, they might be ahead of the pack.&nbsp; After all, if you can make hardware for less
 than $100 with a free OS, it is hard to make money.&nbsp; However, if this cheap access device is now disposable then what become valuable and profitable is keeping the data.&nbsp; If you can secure and wrap this up in one central place then you can charge monthly service
 fees to access it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Only time will tell, but meanwhile why abandon your business customer and others when you can simply offer themes?</p>

<h2>            Reinstall of Microsoft Office Enterprise 2007 encounters error during reinstall</h2>
                    I had to uninstall Microsoft Office Enterprise 2007 due to apparent corruption of the Excel app. &nbsp;I was able to uninstall, but cannot&nbsp;re-install. &nbsp;After kicking off the installation, it runs for a several minutes then generates the following message: &nbsp;MICROSOFT
 OFFICE ENTERPRISE 2007 ENCOUNTERED AN ERROR DURING SETUP. &nbsp;There is no further information and and the only option is a 'Close' button. &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I had some similar difficulty Uninstalling Office 2007, also. &nbsp;I ran the Fix It utility, which fixed some problems, then the Uninstall completed. &nbsp;I ran Fix It for Installation troubleshooting, but no problems detected was stated. &nbsp;However, I experience
 the issue above when attempting to run installation. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I only deleted the Microsoft Enterprise program. &nbsp;I left any update install files in place, as I was told I could do this. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can someone tell me what the next steps are?</div>
                </div>

            <p>Never mind.&nbsp; Problem resolved.&nbsp; I had multiple issues involving a corrupted file which interfered with Outlook installing.&nbsp; My set-up was also outdated.&nbsp; Once Outlook was installed, had to run a fix utility to get it running.&nbsp; Did another Office removal
 and then reinstallation first.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some things done were to remove the MS Outlook Connector, which it looks like let the install function run.&nbsp; Also ran the Installation Wizard, from an MS download.&nbsp; It was No. KB942388-v3.&nbsp; Also ran a "Hot Fix for Windows" package.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my two days of&nbsp;struggle with this issue found a neat site on Chrome that had all kinds of downloads of fixes and tools for Microsoft.&nbsp; Even more than Microsoft itself offers.&nbsp; &nbsp;

 open any workbook, open a blank workbook and then go Tools &gt; Options and on the Calculation tab make sure the Manual Calculation option is checked.</span></p>
<span>If you think it is external links causing a problem, then when you have one of these workbooks open, you can go Edit &gt; Links to see what external references this workbook has. You may be able to break any links which are not needed. Failing that, it will

            <p>It must be a big file with lots of pictures and links.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In general, internal links should not be creating such issues.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Can skype be made to work with tel hyperlinks in Excel or Sheets&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've seen stuff online where you can use hyperlinks in Excel or Sheets to make phone calls from hyperlinks.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a huge database that I want to use as a phone list where I click on the hyperlink, and in WIN 7, it will go to a dialer and make a call.&nbsp; No dialing, this would save me much time and ensure no misdials.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, I use this "formula" in Excel and have it set to Skype,&nbsp;=HYPERLINK(CONCATENATE("tel:",C10)) and it starts skype but does not call the number in cell C10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Is there a way to do this free, or is there a way to do it with Skype even if I have to pay?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Can it be done with Google Sheets?</p>

    <title>Why does Word introduce line breaks when saving an RTF document&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xavil&#243;pez  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does Word introduce line breaks when saving an RTF document&#63;</h2>
                    <div>I'm using a template system based on RTF + Velocity. In my RTF's I've got several [VTL](http://velocity.apache.org/engine/devel/vtl-reference-guide.html) sentences, such as:&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; #foreach($item in $somevar.someProp)Some may-be RTF text #end</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If I open the RTF file with Word (2007) and apply any lesser change somewhere else in the document, I sometimes get VTL sentences broken :&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; #foreach($item in $somevar.som</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; eProp)Some may-be RTF text #end</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This causes the template engine to choke on the sentence, and having to open the RTF with a text editor to restore the split line every time is quite annoying. Note this does not always happen, it seems to be specific on some files. It also doesn't have
 anything to do with line length, there are other lines longer than the one that gets split.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Does someone know why might Word be doing this, or how to avoid it?</div>
                </div>

            Thanks for your answer, Webster. Unfortunately, I don't think the VTL reference can help here, it's Word that is splitting lines. Unless there was some Velocity setting/construct to be used to circumvent the issue.&nbsp;

<p>Hi Alex,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To close a service request you have to get in contact with the agent that is on the case with you, ask them that you would like to close it, after they have a confirm from you they will
 close it on their side and you will be able to close it on your side. </p>

    <title>Possible to update pivot tables in different sheets from same data - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Possible to update pivot tables in different sheets from same data source</h2>
                    <p>I have a few pivot tables (some in different worksheets, some in one sheet) in one Excel file.&nbsp; All these pivot tables extract data from the
<u>same</u> data source (saved in the same file).</p>
<p>Question:&nbsp; When I update my source data with additional data, is it possible to refresh
<u>ALL</u> pivot tables (regardless whether they are in the same worksheet or in different worksheets) with just 1 click?</p>
<p>I tried Excel 2010 "Refresh All", but it just refresh the pivot table in current worksheet with the additional/new data.</p>
<p>If it's possible to refresh all pivot tables (in different worksheet) in Excel 2010, is it possible to do the same in lower version, say Excel 2007/2003?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

            You could do it with a macro like this
<div><br />
<div>
<div>Sub UpDate_Pivots()</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Dim i As Integer, j As Integer</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; For i = 1 To Sheets.Count</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For j = 1 To Sheets(i).PivotTables.Count</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sheets(i).PivotTables(j).PivotCache.Refresh</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Next j</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Next i</div>
<div>End Sub</div>
