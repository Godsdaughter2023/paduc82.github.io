            <p>Thats correct. However I have now used the 'Map Custom Fields' box to move 'email' across to 'name' and that seems to transfer the addresses. Not ideal in the way it appears but it will do as I'm losing the will to continue. Thanks for your help.</p>

<h2>            Opt out of windows insider program</h2>
                    I am trying to opt out of the windows insider program. I set the option to remove from insider updates after a stable release which was the fall creators update. But I am still getting the insider updates. Can you help with how to remove completely from
 the insider updates. Also when ever I try to remove from the insider updates from windows setting Stop Insider Preview Build and select the option Remove from Insider program once the next build is public. It say restart the computer to select the option.
 Once the restart is done nothing happens. When ever I press enter for new line in the message box it automatically refreshes the page.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to verify, do you want to remove the insider program? If you want to remove the insider program, here's an article that you can visit to see how to do it:
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10584/windows-10-stop-receiving-insider-builds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Stop receiving insider builds for Windows 10</a></strong>.</p>

<p>It sort of depends where you are on the Insider food chain.&nbsp; If you are on 16299.15/19, then it is very easy to Stop Insiders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if your PC has already moved to the new Insider build(s), then it is a different ball game.&nbsp; Since the Fall Update, Insiders have moved to 17017 and just yesterday, Insiders is at 17025.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You tell us your current build, you will get better info on how to proceed.</p>

    <title>CMYK Profile In Publisher 2013&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeremymotyka  say:</h3>
<h2>            CMYK Profile In Publisher 2013&#63;</h2>
                    In previous versions of Publisher i was able to change the printing profile to CMYK, and on Publisher 2013 i cannot. Is this a feature that will not be included in the final version of Publisher? Or is there a way to fix this issue?

            <p>Dear Raju,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your answer is NOT correct! Because even if you do what you said in your answer to Jeremy, then the file is still saved in the RGB-format and NOT in the CMYK-format! So I would say, just try it, and you will see that&nbsp;your answer is NOT correct.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I really hope that Microsoft will correct this problem in future updates ...</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Actually the correct answer for Publisher 2013 is to File...Export...Save for Another Computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, if the CMYK photo was inserted into a Picture Placeholder as a <strong>LINK</strong>, and NOT simply inserted onto the Page or into a Picture Placeholder, then the CMYK color mode will be preserved when&nbsp;using the method of&nbsp;exporting to another computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are correct that it will not work the way it was first suggested, but the KEY to the whole thing is that the photo MUST BE inserted into a Picture Placeholder as a
<strong>LINK</strong>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To do this correctly you&nbsp;first INSERT&nbsp;a PICTURE PLACEHOLDER. Then select INSERT PICTURE, browse to the folder where your CMYK photo is saved, select the photo (DO NOT DOUBLE CLICK ON IT)&nbsp;and before you click on the INSERT button, click on the down arrow
 next to the word INSERT on the button and select <strong>LINK TO FILE</strong>.</p>

<p>Then, if the CMYK photo was inserted into a Picture Placeholder as a <strong>LINK</strong>, and NOT simply inserted onto the Page or into a Picture Placeholder, then the CMYK color mode will be preserved when&nbsp;using the method of&nbsp;exporting to another computer.</p>

<p>You are correct that it will not work the way it was first suggested, but the KEY to the whole thing is that the photo MUST BE inserted into a Picture Placeholder as a

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To do this correctly you&nbsp;first INSERT&nbsp;a PICTURE PLACEHOLDER. Then select INSERT PICTURE, browse to the folder where your CMYK photo is saved, select the photo (DO NOT DOUBLE CLICK ON IT)&nbsp;and before you click on the INSERT button, click on the down arrow

Thank you for posting this information. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a point of clarification can you export as a PDF and preserve the CMYK color mode? Any special settings for the PDF?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you Export...Save for Another Computer, in what file format are you saving the file for the other computer?</p>

            DavidF,
<div><br />
<div>In my workflow with outside clients who work in Publisher, they will send the Publisher file as I explained (linking the photo rather then embedding the photo) preserving the CMYK color mode of the photo. They will usually send a PDF which I will then
 use as a guide in re-creating their document / advertisement using Adobe InDesign.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Yes, their PDF does not preserve the CMYK, but my concern is getting the photo as a CMYK especially If they have used some sort of stock photo already in a CMYK color mode. I want it coming to me the way it came from the source without the client going
 into Photoshop or some other photo editing software to change anything. They are basically showing me what they want using what they have found/bought for me to polish into a final advertisement.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Let me play with the PDF settings in Publisher to see if I can get the CMYK color mode to stick.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also, the file format that the client sends is still Publisher, but ALL I really want from them are the original photos. I'll throw out the Pub file. As a further note, Publisher does not preserve the file name of the photo but instead names it using a
 template of image0, image1, etc. when it packages the project. I'm not really concerned with preserving the filename of the photo when received, I'll usually end up changing to something which matches my file-naming protocol.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This linking-photo method works most previous version of Publisher, not just 2013. Granted in Publisher 2010 it was easier to do this, but you know how Microsoft thinks they know what the commercial world needs in order to make the world more Microsoft-like.
 Adobe is the same way, but go figure. They are the ones making the software.</div>

            <p>DavidF,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OK, After some trial and error you can generate a CMYK PDF this way (understand that I have Acrobat Pro installed and I am not sure if the same menu choices will apply if you only have the free Acrobat Reader installed)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, this only works if the CMYK&nbsp;photos are LINKED inside of Picture Placeholders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Select File...Print<br />
Select as the printer Adobe PDF<br />
Under the printer will be a link entitled Printer Properties. Select it.<br />
On the next screen click on&nbsp;the Default Settings and select PDF/A-1b-2005 (CMYK)<br />
Make sure the box "Rely on System Fonts only...." is UNCHECKED<br />
Click OK<br />
Click PRINT<br />
Select a filename and location to save the file<br />
Click SAVE</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Enfocus Pitstop I can actually measure the inks and the coverage and anywhere I click on the photos the values come up as mixtures of CMYK. I tested this also using a&nbsp; Publisher file with&nbsp;embedded images (not LINKED) and using&nbsp;the Standard Default setting
 under PDF Printer Properties and the ink mixtures are then RGB. The PDF/A-1b-2005 (CMYK) selection is the only way I could find that this works.</p>

sc,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for both your responses. I think they will be helpful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many to most Publisher users are not going to have Acrobat and will be limited to what they can produce with Publisher. If you have time would you redo your experiment but this time produce a PDF use the built-in PDF tool?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>File &gt; Save &amp; Send (or Export for Pub 2013) &gt; Create PDF/XPS &gt; and on the Save dialog below the save as type field click the 'optimize for' options button. In the options choose 'high quality' or more likely 'commercial' and under pdf options and then check
 or uncheck 'ISO 19005-1 compliant (PDF/A)' and 'Bitmap text when fonts may not be embedded'. Then test the resulting PDF to see if the color values remain as they did when you conducted this experiment using Acrobat. I am hoping that 'ISO 19005-1 compliant
 (PDF/A)' is the same as PDF/A-1b-2005 (CMYK) in your test. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again for your time and contribution. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[edit] After posting it occured to me to also add that in most cases printers do not want to receive a Publisher file from clients. Many do not even have Publisher so sending as a properly formatted PDF is the ideal in these circumstances. That is why I
 am pushing for a way to create a PDF.</p>

<p>Tried it that way and the resulting color space is RGB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Evidently there is a big difference between the specifications set by PDF/A-1b-2005 (CMYK) and ISO 19005-1. Using the method you suggested there were no switches or options to preserve the original color space.</p>

            <p>Dear DavidF,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I followed your discussions a little bit, because I am the one who started this discussion. But whatever you say, nothing will work!!!
<strong><u>The ONLY THING that will work</u></strong> is, if Microsoft puts back the CMYK conversion button that was available in Publisher 2007 and 2010 !!! But for an obscure reason&nbsp;MS removed this button in Publisher 2013 and that means that I cannot uses
 PS 2013, because my commercial printer does not accept files that are produced&nbsp;in PS 2013. But up to now Microsoft has refused to solve this problem, even though&nbsp;many people mailed them and I also have sent them a letter (to their headquarters in Redmond).
 So it&nbsp;is&nbsp;better to stop this discussion, because whatever you say ...&nbsp;<strong><u>IT SIMPLY DOES NOT WORK !!!</u></strong>&nbsp;<strong><u>Because&nbsp;only Microsoft can solve this problem, by putting back the CMYK conversion button in PS 2013&nbsp;!!!</u></strong>
<strong><u>So my advise is: STOP USING PS 2013 and use PS 2007 or 2010 again</u></strong>, because when you do that, the results will be perfect!</p>

<h2>            Outlook &#40;Office 2013&#41; Problem with Exchange ActiveSync</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>since tuesday my Outlook seems to be unable to sync my outlook.com E-Mail Account (Exchange Active Sync). Although no Errors are thrown and the syncing is displayed as success incoming E-Mails are not recieved. Outlook attempts to send outgoing E-Mails in
 an infinite loop but they don't leave the outbox. I haven't tried Calendar and Contacts yet. As all my other devices are working fine i asume the Exchage Account (possibly .ost) is corrupted in Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I simply try to connect in the account settings i get a positive response. If I try to repair the account through outlook I get a network connection error.
</p>
<p>The other 3 E-Mail Accounts: 1x Exchange + 2x Imap are working fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this issue known? Is there a simple solution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p />

 to like the answers I gave on the form and won't give me access to my Hotmail ( they think I am the hacker!!).&nbsp; They have the wrong email address which I am trying to change (three contacts to Microsoft for this).&nbsp; I have been through hoops but I cannot get
 anyone to help me or contact me.&nbsp; I understand that they are busy but this is taking it a bit far now as they promise to get back to you within 24 hours.</p>

<h2>            MS Project 2010 incorporates subprojects.  How does it do that&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I tried to download MS Project 2010 to see how it works.&nbsp; So far, for various reasons, I still have not been able to download the trial version, but I am thankful to you for answering my questions even if I don't have the program yet.&nbsp; I believe that the
 best thing&nbsp;that this new version of MS Project will provide to me is that I can take the schedules that others have built, and put them into a shell of a schedule that I have built.&nbsp; Can you explain how this works?&nbsp; Please keep in mind that I plan to use MS
 Project for scheduling because the engineers all wanted an easy program to build their own schedules.&nbsp; I will take their schedules (Once I get the program loaded!!!) and put them together - with dependencies, and ... what other ways are they connected?&nbsp; how
 does their input affect my outlining (WBS)?&nbsp; </p>
<p>For example:&nbsp; </p>
<p>1. top level is the project</p>
<p>1.1 2nd level is the 1st phase of the project - design</p>
<p>1.1.1. 3rd level is the discipline - electrical design.&nbsp; I will have 5 different titles at this level because 5 different people are going to give me their schedules which will be the list of details of their work.&nbsp; So how do I make the schedule for the
 electrical designer part of the same schedule that will be from the architect?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for providing me with this explanation, using the terms one uses for building schedules in MS Project.&nbsp; This answer is critical to whether I will purchase MS Project 2010.&nbsp; Especially since I have been having a heck of a time just downloading the
 trial version.</p>

            <p>Hi Charlotte,</p>
<p>There are two ways to incorporate a schedule into another one: either you only insert a link to the other schedule (then you can even modify and save the inserted project as such) or you actully insert the tasks and resoruces into your project (practically
 as if you did a copy/paste)</p>
<p>In 2010, by all means, open the Project ribbon and click the Subproject button (first from the left). In the Insert Project window, browse for the project to be inserted , make its name appear in FileName, then decide which type of insertion you wnt by checking
 or unchecking "Link to Project"; now click Insert.</p>
<p>The inserted project's tasks are inserted above the currently selected task,a nd its outlien position can be changed like any other inseted task.</p>
<p>Greetings,</p>
        </p>

            Charlotte,
<div>Wow! Fantastic story! I wish all our posters could provide that level of "entertainment" when they post. I don't mean to make light of your predicament, it's just so nice to hear the full story for a change. Most of the time we just get a snippet, often
 very poorly written, and then we have to try and &nbsp;figure out what the user really needs/wants. Thank you for sharing your story, we can all relate.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Just for reference, my old HP Deskjet printer's external power supply died recently. I'm not really impressed with the new printers on the market so I wanted to keep my printer but a new power supply would have cost about $70 - way to much. I googled my
 HP power supply part number and found several places that sold used. I picked one up for $10. My printer is back humming along.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Now let's see if we can help/guide you. You mention that you are concerned about using time at work to learn how to use an application you already SHOULD know how to use. Why do you feel you "should" already know how to use Project? Do you already have
 experience or is this a learn-as-you-go type of thing? I suspect it may be the latter, in which case I again can't stress enough the idea of getting some formal training. For on-line training, you might take a look at MSProjectExperts.com. I have no idea what
 training costs but it is probably the best you will find anywhere. If that just isn't in the cards for you, at least take a look at,&nbsp;http://project.mvps.org/mike's_tutorials.htm. The tutorials were developed by long time MVP, Mike Glen.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Now on to some of your issues. You say the engineers will not be required to understand Project but yet you want to set up a structure so the engineers have access to update their schedules. It is either one or the other - either the engineers (et al)
 need to get trained on how to use Project, or they should NOT mess with it. One of the worst things you can have is users messing with Project when they have had no training. In the company where I worked, formal training was required for all cost account
 managers (CAMs). They were engineers, business people, etc., anyone who was a CAM for their part of the overall program schedule. In addition to learning the "dos" and "don'ts" of Project itself we also had a set of corporate ground rules in a formal earned
 value environment. You may not have that level of formality but it you expect your engineers to touch their Project schedules, they MUST be trained, or you are going to suffer big time. If they are not trained for Project, I would get their inputs via mark-up
 of a hardcopy schedule or input via Excel, whose data can be imported into Project if the Excel spreadsheet is set up in the proper format.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If your engineers do get trained on Project, then yes, a subproject/master linked structure can be used. I will again emphasize though that extreme discipline is required to insure it works and doesn't not get corrupted. Setting up individual folders within
 the same directory will work fine, and yes, your users will be able to edit their schedules, as will you if you have write permission on that folder. Your IT department may have to help with that. However, you as the overall project scheduler should be the
 only one with write access to the master file. Keep in mind that only one person can have write access to a given schedule at any given time. For example, you can open the master and see everybody's schedule but you will not be able to do any editing if one
 of the engineers is updating his/her schedule.</div>
<div><br />
<div>By default a dynamic master will show the critical path through the whole structure, unless you set the option to show multiple critical paths (File/Options/Advanced tab).</div>
<div><br />
<div>Got it?</div>
<div><br />
<div>John</div>

            Hi there!<br /><br />Yes, unfortunately the classic version of Skype won’t work after September so, they’re encouraging users to upgrade but many users have reported having difficulties with the new version.<br />So, if you want to keep your version just ignore the email for now.<br />According to Skype: Updating to version 8 of Skype is not mandatory at this time, but support for version 7 of Skype (also known as classic Skype) will be ending in September 2018<br /><br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34841/upgrading-to-the-latest-version-of-skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34841/upgrad...</a>

            <p>Hi Jacob</p>
<p>Presumably the macro runs when a new file is opened from the template?&nbsp; If so, put something like this at the end of the macro:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Application.DisplayAlerts = False<br />
ActiveWorkbook.SaveAs "C:\My File.xlsx", xlOpenXMLWorkbook<br />
Application.DisplayAlerts = True<br />
</p>
<p>Setting DisplayAlerts to False stops the warning from being displayed.</p>
<p>Obviously replace the path &amp; filename with something appropriate.&nbsp; If you want to prompt the user to choose the file name &amp; path you will need to adopt something like
<a href="http://peltiertech.com/WordPress/robust-vba-save-as-technique/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this</a>&nbsp;to retrieve it.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

            <p>When you create a document from a template, a reference is created from the document to that template so that items such as macros that are stored in the template are available for use with that document.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you subsequently save, close and then re-open the document on the machine that has the template, the reference to the template is re-created.&nbsp; However, if the document is opened on a different computer on which that template is not available, then the
 reference to the template cannot be created.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore, if you need the macros to be available wherever the document is opened, they will need to be created in, or be imported into the document, which will need to then be saved as a macro-enabled document with a docm extension.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note, even then, the macros may not be available if the document is opened on a machine that has the macro security set so that macros are disabled without notification.</p>

</li><li>[[[You might also wish to compare this path to the two template entries in <em>
Word options</em>, <em>Advanced</em>, {right at the bottom} <em>File locations</em> -

    <title>OneNote 2013 - problem with linked notes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gregory62  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote 2013 - problem with linked notes</h2>
                    <p>I am running MS OneNote 2013 on a MS Surface Pro 3 with Windows 8.1 Pro.&nbsp; The notebook I am working in is on OneDrive and on my computer; i.e., it is not a "local notebook."&nbsp; (I sync manually, but not very often).&nbsp; With that as the background, here's the
 isssue:&nbsp; I frequently use links between the notes in my OneNote notebook. What happens is that after having clicked on a link to go forward to another page, when I then hit the back arrow to return to the original page, I often (but not always!) find that
 I am sent to some entirely different page in my notebook.&nbsp; This is rather frustrating.&nbsp; But, then, if I hit the back arrow several more times, it eventually brings me back to the note from which I started.&nbsp; In other words, it makes several mistakes, but if
 I persevere, I finally end up back to the original note.&nbsp; The strange thing is that this bug (if it is a bug) is not consistent:&nbsp; many times the back arrow performs properly and brings me immediately back to the original note.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have others had this problem?&nbsp; Is this a bug, or am I doing something wrong?&nbsp; Could it have something to do with not syncing to the OneDrive very often?&nbsp; (I normally use OneNote offline).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help!</p>
<p>Greg</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not an expert in Access but the best way I found to do this is by linking the spreadsheets in Access.&nbsp; You will have to link each spreadsheet individually at first but you only have to do this once.&nbsp; Once the links have been established to the various
 worksheets the links are automatically updated when a refresh is initiated in Access.&nbsp; I don't have Office 2013 so I cannot tell you how to do it.&nbsp; Follow the link below to learn how to link excel workbooks into Access if you're interested.</p>
<p>

<p>

<p>John</p>

<p>Well, not much to go on.&nbsp; I want to say write a loop BUT some things to take into consideration...</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1</strong>. Are all the workbooks in one folder?</p>
<p><strong>2</strong>. Do the all have the same columns and the same data types?</p>
<p><strong>3</strong>. Are the tables you want to put them in already created or do you want them created on the fly?</p>
<p><strong>4</strong>. Does this operation have to be repeated or is it a one time deal?&nbsp; (If one time I wouldn't worry about creating a loop.)</p>
<p><strong>5</strong>. Regarding the Workbooks...</p>
<ul>
<li>Are the column names at the utmost top?</li><li>Is there more than one worksheet per Workbook that needs to also be imported?</li></ul>
<p>As you can see not just *how can I*, we need a wee bit more information if you need help writing that loop.<br />

                    My hard drive crashed and I had to install&nbsp; new one.&nbsp; I had NO problems reinstalling Office 2010 - my key worked fine, but now when I go to use to programs and activate Office 2010 I get the Office 2010 Error:&nbsp; This is not a valid Office Product Key.&nbsp;

            Great, you want to have only 1 unactivated copy of Office 2010 on your computer. Uninstall either the trial (most likely) or the purchased copy (if the trial is for the same bundle)<br />
<br />
After you uninstall the "extra" copy of Office, run a "repair" to fix file associations then try to activate again:<br />
<br />

Here are the simple answers to the invalid product key message. There are other things to check if these don't solve the problem:<br />
<span>Invalid Product Key - "This is not a valid Office product key. Verify that you have the correct key and retype it."</span>
<p><span>More details please.<br />
<b>Which Office bundle did you buy: Home and Student, Home and Business, Office Pro?</b></span></p>
<p><b><span>About the computer itself:</span></b></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Is this a new (from the manufacturer) computer</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Are you re-installing Office on the same computer</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Are you trying to transfer the license to another computer</span></p>
<p>
<b><span>What form of license did you buy?</span></b></p>
<ul>
<li><span>a Retail Boxed CD that allows 2 or 3 concurrent activations&nbsp; (how many do you have)
</span></li><li><span>a Product Key Card that allows 1-user / computer activation</span></li></ul>
<p>
<b><span>Where did you buy it from?</span></b></p>
<ul>
<li><span>retail electronics store</span></li><li><span>online electronics store</span></li><li><span>an individual online (ebay, kijiji etc)</span></li><li><span>online download</span></li><li><span>installed at the computer factory</span></li></ul>
<p>
<b><span>Did you get it as part of a special discount program?</span></b></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Home Use Program, HUP</span></li><li><span>Academic / University discount</span></li><li><span>Military discount</span></li><li><span>other?</span></li></ul>
<p><b><span>Exactly where did you get the Product Key you used?</span></b></p>

<li><span>Inside the big-ugly-yellow-plastic-CD Box</span></li><li><span>a Product Key Card</span></li><li><span>online purchase confirmation email&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>sticker on the computer</span></li></ul>
<p><b><span>EXACTLY what steps are you taking to install and activate Office.</span></b></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Did you activate the factory installed trial</span></p>

<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>There are a few possible causes. They boil down to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>simple typo or misreading of Product key</span></li><li><span>other simple user mistakes / misunderstandings</span></li><li><span>technical problems like incorrect Windows Access Rights</span></li><li><span>conflicts with other software</span></li></ul>
<p>The tool in KB 836178 walks you through a trouble shooting procedure for Office 2010 Product Keys</p>
<p>This behaviour may occur for one or more of the following reasons.:
</p>
<ul>
<li>You have a Trial V<span>ersion of Office installed that is “intercepting” the activation attempt, uninstall it first</span></li><li><span>Check the numbers and letters on the product key:
<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the number eight (8) can resemble a capitalized B,<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the number zero (0) can resemble a capitalized O or Q<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the number six (6) and letter G<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the letters VV and letter W<br />
Copy the product key from an email message to avoid typing errors.</span></li><li><span>Make sure that you are not using a product key from an older version of Office. These product keys will not work with Office 2010.</span></li><li><span>Office 2010 Product Keys do not Contain following Characters:<br />
Numbers: 0 1 5<br />
Letters: A E I L N O S U Z </span></li><li><span>If you are using a product key from a sticker attached to the bottom of your laptop, or on the back of your desktop computer, look VERY CAREFULLY at the sticker.
 They are usually the stickers for Microsoft Windows Product Key and will NOT <span>
&nbsp;</span>work with Office 2010.</span></li><li><span>If a Product Key Card was purchased at a retail store and activated at the register, do not use the key that is inside the card to unlock Office 2010. You must
 logon to the website listed on the card and follow the instructions to obtain the actual product key for the version of Office that you purchased.</span></li><li><span>A product key for an Office 2010 stand-alone product (such as Microsoft Visio Professional 2010) will not be accepted as a product key for an Office 2010 suite.

<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><u>About MSDN or TechNet Product Keys </u></b></p>
<p>They are genuine Microsoft product keys for retail licenses, but not for Retail sale. They are intended for a particular product channel either the Microsoft Software Developer Network (MSDN) or TechNet for IT Professionals who pay a
 subscription fee. The main purpose is for evaluation purposes. It is for one person only to use and no one else. Unfortunately, regardless of the licensing terms, persons still abuse the program, either giveaway product keys or resell it on auction sites.
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>What probably happened is, you bought an MSDN licensed key, which carries up to 10 activations unlike full packaged retail licenses which only carry 1 activation. The person who sold it to you probably sold it to 10 other persons. Somewhere
 along the way, one of those persons might have installed it on a second system, activated it, because it went past 10 activation threshold, Microsoft detected it that it was being abused and blocked the key from further use.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><u>Validate Now:</u></b></p>
<p>You can confirm that your software is genuine now. It’s quick and easy:
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/genuine/validate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/genuine/validate/</a> Click the 'Validate Windows' button. If the validation check fails, then you are going to have to buy your product again. You should contact
 the vendor for a refund. Depending on where they are in the scam cycle they may give you the refund or they will string you along with delays. You should also contact your credit card company to cancel the transaction or to at the very least give them a heads
 up on the scam so that they can deny the scammer any further sales.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You may also want to report the vendor to 
www.microsoft.com/piracy .</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>If it is a legitimate purchase, then you are possibly having a known problem with Windows 7.
<span>&nbsp;</span>There are 3 possible causes, 4 possible fixes:</b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>First confirm that you are not making a simple typing error.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Second, it may be an access rights problem. There are 2 possible fixes for it. Either activate using "Run As Admin" or "Take Ownership" of the problem drive folders and registry entries. I have provided links to several articles for these
 types of fixes. Pick one that you can follow and try it.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Third do a phone activation</p>

<h2>            Cannot delete contacts from skype address book</h2>
                    <p>Am I missing something here?? No matter what I do, I'm unable to remove any of the Skype contacts in my Outlook account. I'm using Outlook on my laptop but took this screenshot from my browser to show you the 4 (un-removable contacts):</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/00edb89f-4f07-4b05-9302-5c042f3a3213?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/00edb89f-4f07-4b05-9302-5c042f3a3213?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I tried:</p>
<p>&gt; Adding then deleting the contact in Outlook</p>
<p>&gt; Closing/Refreshing the Skype address book in Outlook after deleting</p>
<p>&gt; Adding then deleting the contact in Skype on Windows 7 and Windows 10</p>
<p>&gt; Tried above steps on both Windows 7 (Skype Classic) and Windows 10 (Skype from the Microsoft Store)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm at wits-end with this...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate any suggestions,</p>

    <title>Quickoffice 3.8 Pre-installed - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Quickoffice 3.8 Pre-installed</h2>
                    How, on my N95, do I upload documents into the N95 so that I can use the QuickOffice pre-installed to edit it?<br />
It seems that editing is the only thing this version of QuickOffice can do. But there's no instructions as to how to get documents into the N95 so that editing can be done.<br />
<br />
If it can't, then it seems it is a pretty useless piece of software.<br />
<br />
I believe I was conned when I bought the N95, as one of the reasons I bought the phone was to replace my PDA - and then I find it doesn't (unless I buy an expensive upgrade to QuickOffice 5).

And thus spake zarathrustra:<br />
How, on my N95, do I upload documents into the N95 so that I can use the QuickOffice pre-installed to edit it?<br />
<hr />
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<br />
<br />
Two points.<br />
<br />
First of all, the pre-installed QuickOffice only allows you to <i>view</i> documents, not edit them AFAIK.<br />
<br />
Second, the ways of getting the documents there are multiple and easy:<br />
<br />
1) Connect in mass storage mode and copy over to the memory card<br />
<br />
2) Transfer via BlueTooth or infrared via OBEX push<br />
<br />
3) Send by e-mail<br />
<br />
4) Post on the web and download using the built-in browser<br />
<br />
5) Use PC-Suite to transfer by BT, IR or cable<br />
<br />
6) Take the memory card out, put it in a card reader and copy files over to it that way<br />
<br />
7) Can't think of more off-hand but I'm sure there are many more ways<br />

            Thanks for that copious response grschinon; much appreciated.<br />
<br />
I perhaps confused the offer of a Quickoffice upgrade of an editing package as that of the installed package - you are right: no editing on that.<br />
<br />
Your advice on tranfering documents focused my mind - I perhaps shouldn'd have had to ask for that assistance. Your info guided me to find what had been sitting under my nose - I'd not seen the Nokia 'disk' in Windows Explorer before this. Now I have, I agree
 that transfer is easy.<br />
<br />
On a tangental point: am I correct that there is not, in fact, any removable storage on the N95 8GB? I certainly can't find anything in the phone, and the instruction booklet doesn't mention anything.<br />
<br />
Oh: it was Zarathusta who spake; not I (I'm often confused with my celibate cousin).

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Yes, you are correct that there is no removable media on the N95-2, which is one of the reasons I stick with my N95-1 with an 8GB microSDHC card. When they're available, it should also work with 12 and 16GB cards. The soon-to-be-released N96 does, however,
 have 16GB on-board <i>and</i> a microSDHC slot that will work with the same cards as the N95-1, giving you a theoretical maximum storage of 32GB once the bigger cards are released.<br />
<br />
In theory, microSDHC cards should be able to go up to 2TB but it'll probably be a while before we see that kind of capacity for sale...<br />
<br />
Sorry for the confusion with your "celibate cousin". Visions of space stations and of apes throwing bones around came to mind for one brief instant there :)

            Once again, thanks grschinon.<br />
<br />
Alas, I've been conned by Nokia - so I'll never trust them again; nor 3 (having paid for Internet access, they're now cutting me off for using it too much - I who used about £2 pcm on my previous PAYG mobile!).<br />
<br />
No removable media; no QuickOffice (effectively); no Spiderman (not that this really fusses me, but irritates as another example of their conning); and (for me) a non-intuitive interface (perhaps my fault).<br />
<br />
Space is nice, especially the inner kind.

            I'm sorry you feel that way.<br />
<br />
The complete specifications for the N95-2 are available <a href="http://europe.nokia.com/A4494366" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> and it's easy to find the user manual from there. It obviously won't give you an accurate look at how it handles but it
<i>does</i> let you know exactly what the phone can do. When choosing a new phone I
<i>always</i> download the user manuals of the models I'm considering in order to compare them before making a choice.<br />
<br />
Of course, there's no accounting for taste, so if you don't get on that well with S60, nothing anyone will say will make it any more palatable for you.<br />
<br />
As for the movie missing and 3 cutting off your Internet access, I hope you don't allow that to affect your judgement of Nokia. 3 would have done that regardless of the brand/model of phone you choae from them.

            I was just being an irritable old fool.<br />
<br />
Yep, I should have read the manual and not trusted the salesman!<br />
<br />
I wasn't aware the interface was fixed for S60 (my ignorance). I'm not sure which mobile my son has, but his interface is much more intuitive (it's not an iPhone).<br />
<br />
Yes, I appreciate 3 &amp; Nokia are different. But somewhat symbiotic in their interfacing with the customer - such as the Spiderman non-offer.<br />
<br />
I made too big a leap from a simple PAYG - just used as an emergency contact - to an all-singing, all-dancing phone.<br />
<br />
I'll probably get used to the N95 and a year from now wonder why I fussed at all (at least, that's what I hope).

            I think you will get used to it.<br />
<br />
As far as I'm concerned, I may be technically conversent but I'm also extremely conservative. For example, I didn't buy a mouse or any multimedia stuff like a sound card or CD-ROM drive for my computer until pretty late in the day, I was still using good ol'
 MS-DOS until about 1997. Even now that I've graduated away from Microsoft altogether (I use various flavours of Unix: FreeBSD, Solaris, Linux etc.) I still find it a drag to have to move away from the keyboard to grab the little critter and therefore use an
 interface that allows me to do as much as possible still with the keyboard.<br />
<br />
The point is, that S60 is the system I get along best with now. I used to use older S40 Nokia devices and when I wanted to go 3G I tried all sorts, even a Sony-Ericsson, but came back to an S40 phone, the 6280. I'd also had my eyes on the N95-1 for a while
 but had never been able to afford one SIM-free. Turns out I got one free with a contract at the beginning of this year. I was lost to start with but it all began to make sense. Even if there are a few features of S40 that I miss, the advantages of S60 outweigh
 that completely. I wouldn't go back to an S40 device now, not a Sony-Ericsson for that matter :)

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I created a shared mailbox in Office 365 &gt; Admin &gt; Groups &gt; Shared Mailboxes, and added my own account to the members of this shared mailbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now can I send and receive emails of this shared mailbox? I don't see any information about this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to create a new email from my Outlook (web), click "Show From" but I'm unable to modify the from address at all. There's no shared mailbox in the From list neither.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I use the shared mailbox and send and receive emails as it?</p>

<p>Hi DataSN.io,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generally, if you are a member of this shared mailbox, you can send emails as it and receive from it.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you received an email from shared mailbox, you can find it in your own account Inbox folder.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For your issue, after created the shared mailbox, you may also check whether you have added yourself as one member for this shared mailbox: Go to Office 365 admin center-&gt;Groups-&gt;Shared mailbox.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/42ef7d71-f9e7-457d-b26c-bc53b4f6f17f?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/42ef7d71-f9e7-457d-b26c-bc53b4f6f17f?upload=true" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, you can check whether you are in Send As list in Exchange admin center-&gt;recipients-&gt;shared. Normally, once a member is added, he has been also assigned full and send as permissions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dbf6ec77-738f-4822-90f9-1dbf9255c7eb?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dbf6ec77-738f-4822-90f9-1dbf9255c7eb?upload=true" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When sending from shared address, on Outlook web App, the first time you use, you need to add the address to the
<strong>From</strong> list via: Right-click on the From address, choose <strong>Remove</strong>-&gt; type the shared address, the next time you reply from the shared mailbox, its address will appear as an option in the From list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            There are no filters applied to the table, or to the other tables on the worksheet.&nbsp; The table will not grow when sorted, so it won't be overlapping the other tables if the sort were executed.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that I can sort this <span style="font-style: italic">same</span> file, using the same procedures, when using the desktop app; however, the web app forbids me from doing so.<br />

<h2>            Matching Created and Last Modified times, but 75 mins editing time - how&#63;</h2>
                    I'm examining a Word 2010 document and noted it has some odd metadata, which I cannot explain.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The Created date and time is exactly the same as the Last Modified date and time, but the document is being reported as edited for 75 minutes. How could this have happened? The Last Modified time is roughly when work on the document finished. If the document
 was saved with a new filename when work on it was finished, this would have created a new document which has matching Created and Last Modified time stamps, but the Total Editing Time would be zero.</div>
<div><br />

<div>Created<span> </span>01/08/13 15:35</div>
</div>

</div>
<div>Does anyone know how the Total Editing Time is calculated which can explain this? Isn't Total Editing Time only recorded when you save. If you close a document without saving, it keeps the Editing time since the last save?</div>

<p><br />
I received the email via email. I didn't create it myself. The document should have been authored by a single person. The maximum time available to work on the file was 3 hours, so I would not expect it to report back that it had been edited for longer than
 that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am interested in understanding how Word documents&nbsp;create and record&nbsp;this metadata, so I can provide an explanation for that which is recorded in this particular document. It is pretty puzzling and I have not found a way I can replicate it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe&nbsp;Total Editing Time is only updated when the document is saved, and for the Creation time and Last Saved time to be the same, it implies that no time has been spent on editing the file - so editing time should be zero.</p>

            <p>Anyone have any suggestions on what might have happened to the document to collect this metadata? In my own tests, I found that Total Editing Time is zeroed when using Save As to create a new document. I didn't notice Copying and Pasting text into a document
 bringing its editing time with it. The editing time remained as for the target document.</p>

<p>Anyone have any suggestions on what might have happened to the document to collect this metadata? In my own tests, I found that Total Editing Time is zeroed when using Save As to create a new document. I didn't notice Copying and Pasting text into a document
 bringing its editing time with it. The editing time remained as for the target document.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This might happen because the dialog box after pressing &nbsp;'save as' button, before pushing the save button, was left open for the particular amount of time which was reflected in total editing time however the last modified time and created time was identical
 because of save as operation.</p>

<p>Hi Mechelle,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What do you mean by “Outlook Online”? Do you mean that the emails are not showing on Outlook Web App(OWA)? Besides, you said that when it was forwarded to Gmail account it displayed fine. Did you check the email via web, or Outlook client?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From my opinion, the embedded images are not contained in the emails, they are being loaded from a website and the email is being displayed using HTML, which is loaded using IE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help you resolve the issue, please try the following instructions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1 . Search <strong>Internet Options</strong> in Start menu and open it. Navigate to
<strong>Advanced</strong>, click <strong>Reset</strong> button and follow the prompts.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/30cbe011-b944-45b3-8388-d701edcac5de" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/30cbe011-b944-45b3-8388-d701edcac5de" /></a></p>
<p>2 . Open Outlook and navigate to <strong>Files</strong> -&gt; <strong>Options</strong> -&gt;
<strong>Trust</strong> <strong>Center</strong> -&gt; <strong>Trust</strong> <strong>
Center</strong> <strong>Settings</strong>. Uncheck the box “<strong>Don’t download pictures automatically in HTML email messages or RSS items</strong>”. Click OK.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ac95961e-458c-47d7-b18c-ac9130a77877" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ac95961e-458c-47d7-b18c-ac9130a77877" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, please feel free to contact me and let me know the detailed scenario, like whether you can see the pictures in Gmail accounts via Outlook client or web and others situations. And please let me know the detailed version number of Outlook
 client.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Rick</p>

<p>
</p><p>The Outlook online is -&nbsp;https://outlook.office.com/owa/.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I stated in my original email, I already tried the second option - restarted computer and the images will still not display.&nbsp; Just to be very clear - images are not displaying online (at the above address) or in Outlook that I open on my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Chrome to open Outlook online and my gmail account.&nbsp; I can see the images fine in my gmail account when I forward the emails from my Outlook account.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was not an issue until the last windows update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if there is something else that I can try.</p>

<p>Hi Mechelle,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please first try the second point in my last reply and see if there is any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to my experience, the issue may occur when the BlockHTTPimages registry value is set to 1. So, you can try to modify the registry. Note: Before you modify it, please back up the registry for restoration in case some issues occur.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please follow the instructions below to modify the registry:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 . Press Windows <strong>Key+R</strong> to open a Run dialog box and type <strong>
regedit</strong>, OK.</p>
<p>2 . Find: Key: <strong>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\x.0\Common </strong>
</p>
<p><strong>DWORD: BlockHTTPimages</strong></p>
<p><strong>Value: 1</strong></p>
<p>3 . Right click the <strong>BlockHTTPimages</strong> key and Delete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, please let me know the type or your account(like Office 365), the detailed version of Outlook client and Windows OS. Meanwhile, you can try to set up the affected account on other normal PC to see if the issue
 persists..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Rick</p>

<p>This is very similar to what I'm seeing on my system which is Windows 10 (Version 1709, build 16299.125), coupled with Office 2016 (Version 1711 (Build 8730.2127) Click-to-Run).&nbsp; Images are not displayed in email if they are embedded HTML links. If the image
 is embedded into the message they display just fine.&nbsp; If I reboot my system they display for a while and then a few hours later they don't work again.&nbsp; I've tried re-creating my profile (same effect, works for a while then not), uninstalling and re-installing
 Office (same effect works for a while, then not).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The listed registry key doesn't exist on my system so that can't be it.&nbsp; This all started after the November 2017 Windows 10 patch yet appears to be hit or miss as other systems with this patch within the organization are perfectly fine.&nbsp; This appears to
 be a common issue lots of people are seeing so it's surprising it's now gone nearly 45 days without a peep from Microsoft on when or if this will ever be fixed.</p>

<p>I got with Lenovo and everything from their perspective is good, all drivers are up to date, hardware is functioning as expected, etc.&nbsp; They say it is an MS issue and I have to agree, although it seems to be randomly affecting people.&nbsp; We have 5 people in
 our office and two of us have the issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure if this will help but -&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. On my android phone using the standard corporate email application, images display fine after clicking the link to display images.</p>
<p>2. When I forward to my gmail or yahoo accounts, images display fine.</p>
<p>3. Images will not display and cannot be saved from either Outlook 2016 or Outlook online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did do the Office update that was released yesterday and no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have anything else that I can try, I would be happy to do so.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Mechelle,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To further exclude whether the issue is related to Outlook client, please check the points:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1 . Compare the Windows and Outlook client detailed version number between the normal PCs and affected PCs. And let me know&nbsp;their version number.</p>
<p>2 . Send a test email with a picture which inserted a hyperlink to yourself using your affected account, and check it on Outlook client and OWA to see if there is any difference.</p>
<p>3 . Open Outlook client in <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026478/outlook-open-outlook-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
safe mode</a>,and log in OWA in different web browsers to see if the issue persists.</p>
<p>4 . Use your affected account to sign in OWA and Outlook client on an unaffected computer to check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, please let me know the type of the affected images, whether they are linked images or others?&nbsp; Meanwhile, I suggest you use SaRA to try to fix the problem. You can download it from this link:
<a href="https://diagnostics.outlook.com/#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://diagnostics.outlook.com/#/</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know the results once there is any updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Rick</p>

    <title>Calendar on Home Screen of Nokia 6303 Classic - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Calendar on Home Screen of Nokia 6303 Classic</h2>
                    
<p>I've just got one of the 6303 Classics and synced my Outlook calendar with the phone but now on the Home Screen it only displays one appointment rather than all i have that day like my old Nokia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there anyway i can get it to display more appointments on the Home Screen as i can't seem to find an option for this?</p>

<p>The 6303 classic uses an s40 operating system, and due to the limited capacities of this system, the space on the active standby is limited to that kind of display. You could rearrange the active standby and set calendar to be on the second bar from the
 top. I think that box has enough space for two or three tasks to be shown.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only Nokias that show the calendar events for the whole day are phones with the s60 operating system, which your old phone seems to belong to.</p>
