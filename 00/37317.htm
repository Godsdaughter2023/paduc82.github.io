<h2>            Why are all of my Xbox games and apps disappeared&#63; &#40;Read more in the description&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I was using my Xbox One and decided to go to my games because, you know, I wanted to play a game. It then said:
<strong>"When you install games, you'll see them here. Why not find some now?"&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>It said the same thing for apps. I still have the usage bar working, as it still says I have used 43.9%. Has this happened to anyone else? Does anyone have a solution?</p>
<p>Thank chu!!</p>

<p>first , just try and sign out of your profile then right back in.....if that dosent fix it , try this below......</p>
<p>go into settings and accounts and remove all the profiles , (make sure you have the email and password to get them back ) after you remove the profiles , shut the xbox down by holding the xbox logo on the console for 8 seconds till it powers down , while
 it is off , unplug your modem and router for 30 seconds to clear them also , plug the modem and router back up and when they are online , turn the xbox back on , when it is all the way up , re add your main profile ...it may sit there and sync a little while
 but all SHOULD be good afterwards ...</p>

            <p>Hello Stephen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description you are trying to create a power plan which can save the power consumption. A power plan is a collection of hardware and system settings that manages how your computer uses and conserves power. Power plans can save energy, maximize
 system performance, or balance energy conservation with performance. The default power plans—Balanced and Power saver—meet most people's needs. But you can modify settings for existing plans or create your own plan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to use the default power plan then you may refer to the steps provided in the below mentioned&nbsp;article.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh825711.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Set the Default Power Plan</strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to create or customize power plans you may refer to the steps provided below.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can create your own plan and customize it to suit your needs. For example, if you frequently use a laptop to give presentations, you can create a plan that keeps the display turned on during the presentations and ensures that your computer stays awake.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Open <strong>Power Options </strong>by pressing <strong>Windows key + X</strong> and selecting
<strong>Control Panel </strong>from the list, clicking <strong><span>System and Security</span></strong>, and then clicking
<strong><span>Power Options</span></strong>.</span> </p>
</li><li>
<p>In the <strong>left pane</strong>, click <strong><span>Create a power plan</span></strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>On the <strong><span>Create a power plan</span></strong> page, select the plan that's closest to the type of plan that you want to create.</p>
</li><li>
<p>In the <strong><span>Plan name</span> box</strong>, type a name for the plan, such as "<strong>Giving a presentation</strong>," and then click
<strong><span>Next</span></strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>On the <span>Change settings for the plan</span> page, choose the display and sleep settings that you want to use when your computer is running on battery and when it's plugged in.</p>
<div><strong>To keep your display turned on during presentations </strong>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Change the <span>Turn off display after</span> setting to <span>Never</span> for both
<span>On battery</span> and <span>Plugged in</span>.</p>
</li></ul>
<div><strong>To keep your laptop awake during presentations </strong>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Change the <span>Put the computer to sleep</span> setting to <span>Never</span> for both
<span>On battery</span> and <span>Plugged in</span>.</p>
</li></ul>
</li><li>
<p><strong>Click <span>Create</span>.</strong></p>
<p>If you're using a laptop, your plan appears under <span>Plans shown on the battery meter</span>. If you're using a desktop computer, your plan appears under
<span>Preferred plans</span>. The plan that you based your new plan on is moved, and appears under
<span>Additional plans</span>.</p>
</li></ol>
<p><strong>Additional Information:</strong></p>
<p>For more information related to Power plans you may refer to the article mentioned below. This link contains all the relevant information related to Power Plans.</p>

            Sorry Ramesh, but I think you've misunderstood me. In Vista, the power settings were automatically applied when I was plugged in or unplugged. It doesn't happen in Win 8. I want to know if I can do this.

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Vista, Windows 7, nor Windows 8/8.1 have the ability to automatically switch power plans. So either</p>
<p>your System Maker included a utility to do so or you added a 3rd party program that would switch</p>
<p>for you.<br />
<br />
</p>
I use the free version of BatteryBar to monitor my battery.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
BatteryBar - Free version available<br />

<br />
Other good programs :&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Power Scheme Switcher<br />

<br />
You might also want to check with the System Maker and any forums&nbsp;as many use their own<br />
proprietary software to monitor the battery and their could be known issues with your battery.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.

            Hi Phil8240,<br />
<br />
It is not recommended to turn off Volume Shadow Copy. It manages and implements Volume Shadow Copies used for backup and other purposes. If this service is stopped, shadow copies will be unavailable for backup and the backup may fail. If this service is disabled,
 any services that explicitly depend on it will fail to start.<br />
<br />
Let us know if there is some issue that you are facing because of Volume Shadow Copy, so that we can help you troubleshoot the issue.<br />
<br />
However, if you still want to disable Volume shadow copy than follow the steps as below:<br />
<br />
1. Click on Start, type services and press enter.<br />
2. Locate the service "Volume Shadow Copy" and right click and click "Stop".<br />
3. Close Services windows.<br />

<h3> johncrespin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#59;t Use Windows 8.1 Mail App with a local account.</h2>
                    <p>I only login to my Windows 8.1 Desktop using a local account. Until last week, when I clicked the Mail option from the Start Screen (which I have set up to go to my non-Microsoft email account) it opened up just fine &amp; dandy and showed me my normal Inbox.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, if i click the Mail option, it asks me to sign on with a Microsoft account which i DO NOT want to do. There is no option to bypass this and sign-in with my local account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can i set up the Mail app to sign in with a local account? I can use the webmail option via a browser for my email provider but that's not the point: I prefer using the Mail app and it seems an update has been applied that prevents me from doing this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can i revert back to NOT needing to sign in with a MS Account?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            PC locksup &#38; freezes whilst gaming</h2>
                    <p>ok enough is enough,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been in talks with Gigbabyte support staff about this matter and we have put it down to the OS.</p>
<p>I am using an upgraded version from Win7 Pro 64 to Win10 Pro 64.<br />
</p>
<p>Over the past couple of months everytime i play a PC game, at random times my PC lockups &amp; freezes to the point i have to do a hard reboot. NOT HAPPY!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Get your windows 10 **** sorted ASAFP! This is really ridiculous...</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC details <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/user/CombatKiller/saved/#view=m2Cj4D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here!</a></p>
<p>Before you all ask.... &nbsp; &nbsp;YES!!! &nbsp; All my drivers and software are up to date, and i reinstalled the OS a month ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what i can make out, i think the problem is due to the cross functions of DirectX 11 &amp; DirectX 12.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But i dont know im not a programmer, but that would be my guess.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Im going back to Win7, as this is friggin stupid.</p>

            <p>To avoid having to read the same suggestions you have had from other sites or Gigabyte it is best to post</p>
<p>every fix you have already tried. Whatever your issue is, it's not a bug in Win10<em>.
</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"From what i can make out, i think the problem is due to the cross functions of DirectX 11 &amp; DirectX 12."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Nope! DirectX does not work like that. Games use specific DX files (there are many). There is no real interaction between them, and they don't conflict. If it were possible you would have had issues all along.</p>
<p>There are only a handful of games that use DX12 and I don't have any of them, but I expect that as with
</p>
<p>DX10 and DX11,&nbsp; that if a game uses DX12 effects it will not use DX10/11 effects at the same time, so there</p>
<p>is no potential for conflict with games that are exclusive to one of these DX versions.</p>
<p>- DX9 was different.&nbsp; DX9 games that also have an option for DX10 or DX11 effects generally allowed you to select some DX10/11 effects in conjunction with the majority DX9 effects. Still no potential for conflicts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Obviously your hardware is suitable for Win10 and games that use DX11 or 12 (as well as DX9/10), and</p>
<p>your psu is overpowered if anything, so this is not a <em>likely</em> (but no&nbsp; new hardware is not immune
</p>
<p>to being faulty) source of the lock-ups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Lockups can also result from software conflicts, and things such as automated software update settings as well.
</p>
<p>You may want to consider any software or mods (if modded games are locking up)&nbsp; you have installed around the time the lock-ups started happening.</p>
<p>Anti-Virus and even you&nbsp; communication software have potential for conflicts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running from Clean Boot is useful for troubleshooting potential conflicts with
<em>Services</em> and <em>Startup</em> programs.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- Lockups can be caused by too high temps as well. Have you monitored the cpu and gpu temps at the</p>
<p>time of the lock-ups ?</p>
<p>- Are the BIOS settings at default ?</p>

            <p>Thanks for the responses, i didnt think anyone would actually respond to me.<br />
<br />
This is what i know, i had install win10 about 1 month after its release and had absolutely no issues at all. It wasnt until i upgraded my GPU from a GTX660 to a GTX960, did i start having issues whilst playing games.<br />
</p>
<p>Im playing Black Desert Online (BDO for short) and it seems at no particular point does it lockup &amp; freeze, its very random.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the reason why i had thought it could have something to do with DirectX 12, is because my OS is DirectX 12 and so is my GPU, but the game isnt, im not a programmer but my guess is that the game its built in DirectX 11.<br />
Plus giving the fact that i am also having issues with my USB's, i have no friggin idea on **** is going there, that boom-boom noise that you get when you plug something in and then a pop-up box saying "windows cannot detect your USB device, please trry reconnecting
 it" or something like that.<br />
<br />
Now i have NOTHING plugged into my USB ports so ****??? I have also disconnected the plug USB 2.0 Front Bus, so its got me stuffed. When i contacted Gigabyte about it, they told me that Windows 10 has its own USB drivers from microsoft built in and there is
 nothing they can do about that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i dont know if its probably just a bad install or wat ever the case i dont know, ill use windows 7 for now as i have a couple of months left on the free upgrade before it ends, so it gives me time to test it out if its really my hardware or the OS.<br />
<br />
The only thing that shitting me off is the fact that my PC freezes up and i cant do anything, nothing works and i dont get a BSOD at all, so i really cant get or obtain any data at all or any sort of reference for me to be able to troubleshoot this myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dont get me wrong tho i like win10 but im seeing a lot of people on the gaming threads with DirectX 12 GPU &amp; Windows 10 having heaps of issues. because either the game or OS isnt compatibale in some way.<br />
<br />
Just like that M.Soft Rep said in their post after mine, try installing under a different compatibability mode, well that raises red flags for me, and he/she isnt the only one i have heard that from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But i guess we will see, ill use 7 for a month or so, then upgrade to 10 before the due date. If im wrong then ill have issues with 7, if im right, then it has to be the DirectX 12, as i know they have changed the architecture for it inside the OS, which
 some how in some way its interferring with other things too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But lets see, ill report back in a month or 2 and see.</p>

            <p>If the problems only started after upgrading your gpu from GTX660 to GTX960 there
<em>may</em> be an issue with</p>
<p>the new card<em>. </em>Just out of curiosity which Nvidia driver are you using ?
</p>
<p>- You haven't said if you have monitored the gpu and cpu temps, or if you have tried Clean Boot.<em>-</em> If the problem is with only the one game reinstalling the game may help.</p>
<p><em>"Dont get me wrong tho i like win10 but im seeing a lot of people on the gaming threads with DirectX 12 GPU &amp; Windows 10 having heaps of issues. because either the game or OS isnt compatibale in some way."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, well unfortunately froums are all about problems, so you are unlikely to read posts from people who</p>
<p>are not having issues. I have close on 200 games from '98 to present. Disk based and download, and</p>
<p>they all run as well on Win10 as they did on Win7.</p>
<p>Not to say I didn't have to stuff around with a few of them at first eg- run the Steam 'verify integrity of game cache'</p>
<p>tool and re set the resolution and a&nbsp; few other things I don't recall atm, but there are no major issues with Win10</p>
<p>other than the dread DRM Blocking malware MS introduced with Win10 that prevents many disk based games from</p>
<p>launching. I don't have a personal problem with this as I've always used noCD fixes with my disk
</p>
<p>based games anyway, but I reckon MS has been heartless in not providing an on/off switch for this 'feature',</p>
<p>and worse,&nbsp; not providing a proper error message so people are made to run around in circles trying to get</p>
<p>the <em>'run as admin'</em> option to work. I have more details on this malware in my post&nbsp; in &nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-gaming/login-as-administrator-warning/56cf28ad-c7e5-432f-89ab-d22e08a06544"> --this thread--.</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- Back on DirectX . I already outlined how DX works above but...</p>
<p>It's a common misconception that Win7/8/8.1 has only DX 11, and Win10 has only DX12.<br />
Win7/8/8.1/10 all have<em> all</em> of the DX - 9,10 and 11 files.<br />
</p>
<p>- The following is a list of the Direct X .dll's you will have when the files are up to date.<br />
Go to the Windows / System 32 folder, (and SysWOW64 if you have 64bit). &nbsp;<br />
They are in alphabetical order and will start with d3dx9 - 24 &gt; 43 . Then d3dx10 - 33 &gt; 43 &amp; finally d3dx11 - 42 &gt; 43.<br />
There should also be - d3d9, d3d10 and d3d11 (among others).<br />
These come before the D3Dcompilers - 33&gt;47.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Win10 currently has only two d3d 12 files. One in System 32, and one in SysWOW64 .<br />
- There are more DX files, but these are most of the graphics related Direct X&nbsp; .dll's</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, a clean Windows install may not have all of the DX files (Win7 didn't ), so you still need to</p>
<p>run the DirectX Web Installer to make sure DirextX is up to date</p>

<p><em>well that raises red flags for me, and he/she isnt the only one i have heard that from."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is one of the unfortunate things with these forums. The Support Engineers tend to be cut and paste</p>
<p>specialist who often post irrelevant suggestions. I don't fully understand their MS connections, and have no</p>
<p>idea what Support Engineer truly translates too (maybe phone support off line ? ) but my understanding is</p>
<p>they are also volunteers. While their cut and paste response is often helpful, it can wildly off mark as often as not.</p>
<p>- Not to say that I don't also get things wrong, or have anything approaching all the answers.</p>
<p>Answers to questions regarding the vagaries of the PC are rarely straight forward as we would hope.</p>
<p>- However, your first post has a bit too much rant and not enough useful information.
</p>
<p>We fully understand the frustrations people experience (it never stops personally either. PC's are like that),
</p>
<p>but&nbsp;to help yourself&nbsp; you need to provide us with good detailed information, and responses to our questions .</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- You didn't mention your USB issue previously, and I'm afraid I've never had to deal with this, but have</p>
<p>you looked in Device Manager to see if there are any yellow exclamation marks, or other flags in</p>
<p>the USB section ? If so uninstall and reinstall the driver for the relevant port or device.</p>
<p>- Also check the keyboard and mouse section for any flags. </p>
<p>- Note too that if you are using a recent Logitech LGS version that it may use Apples&nbsp;
<em>'Bonjour' .</em> </p>
<p>This software has always been trouble. I stopped updating my LGS at version 8.55.137&nbsp; because</p>
<p>&nbsp;this was the last version that did not include Bonjour (unless they have removed it from more recent</p>
<p>versions that I've not tried).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em>"So i dont know if its probably just a bad install"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>- It is quite possible to have a dodgy upgrade. I had two goes. The first one had issues with the Start menu</p>
<p>and Task Bar as well as getting stuck in 'update' loops. I canned Win10 for two weeks and had another far
</p>
<p>more successful upgrade on the second go.</p>
<p>Are you using a clone of your original Win7, or a rollback ? </p>
<p>If you have a clone of Win7 you can swap between it and Win10. I cloned my Win7 before the first attempt</p>
<p>and used it the first couple of months after doing the Win10 upgrade again, so I could swap back and fourth.</p>
<p>I have each OS on separate SSD's and changed the boot order in BIOS when I wanted to swap to the other OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- Anyway. Gotta go. It's dinner time here in Oz.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Oh so your an Aussie, aye!<br />
Cool, me 2 :D</p>
<p>
</p><p>All i know is that i have installed Win10 on many PC's, both upgraded and fresh installs for cutomers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what i have found in my personal experiences, the PC's that i built and installed an actual fresh copy of Win10 for my customers, i very rarely if not, none have ever came back complaining about any issues with their systems at all. (Some builds
 have also been for gamers)</p>
<p>
</p><p>But as far as the upgraded machines, i have customers returning back to me complaining about problems with their PC's after a month or 2. Example. I have an actual lady comming sometime this week to drop off your laptop, because her USB Disk Drive isnt working,
 her laptop doesnt have a builtin optical drive, so therefore i have to now sit down probably for hours trying to work out what in the **** is wrong with it and she upgraded from win8 to 10.<br />
Another example, i just got told 4hrs ago by a friend in America, that she has installed win10 like 4 times already and going on her 5th, because she is having a "Start Menu, critical error" and she upgraded from 7 to 10. And there are many other examples to
 i could give, but you get the point.</p>
<p>As you mentioned yourself BossDweeb, that you had to reinstall win10 a couple of times before you could get it to work properly.</p>
<p>So this indicates to me, that there is a **** of a lot of conflicts converting from 7/8 to 10. Now i havent really been up to date with everything like i normally am, but from what im seeing its appearing that doing an actual fresh install instead of an
 upgrade is the better option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, after all of this info &amp; facts that i have gotten since the release of win10, Microsoft really havent done their jobs properly and put systems or criteria in place in order to make people want to upgrade to win10.</p>
<p>But like i mentioned before, i really do believe probably by the end of next year, or after a SP or 2, Win10 is going to be rock solid, like Win2000 NT &amp; WinXP once was. But at the moment as of right now, i cant sit around and wait for that day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran Win7 for roughly 5+ and had absolutely no issues at all in those years, now 10 comes along and its starting to be a pray &amp; hope of an install system now, its like keep installing and work the law of averages into our favor!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyhow, i have been pushing my Win7 now hard and only had 1 problem, which was easily solved by "CTRL + ALT + DEL" I logged off and relogged in and everything was sweet again. But this problem could of been due to the fact i hadnt installed all the updates
 at that point in time.<br />
But i guess we will see after a month how it goes.</p>

            <p>(As we drift well away from your topic )</p>
<p>- My main concern with Win10 is automated updates, and big updates such as the 1511 update.</p>
<p>Being the control freak that I am, I don't much like automated anything, other than AV definitions<em>.
</em></p>
<p>My issue with the big updates is they may all re-set my user settings to default as the 1511 did.</p>
<p>Only a nuisance, but one I'd rather do without.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"...but from what im seeing its appearing that doing an actual fresh install instead of an upgrade is the better option."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>- Yes, judging by your experience a clean install does sound like the go, and it is the obvious best practice choice.</p>
<p>Prior to Win7 I was firmly in the clean install camp, and would not have tried doing a Vista (never had Vista anyway) to Win7 upgrade, but with so many games and software installed I really wasn't up to doing everything over again,</p>
<p>when trying out the Win10 upgrade.</p>
<p>It's looking like I was among the lucky ones (there would be many millions) with my second attempt.</p>
<p>- I have an abiding respect for Murphy's Law, which is why I would never attempt to do an 'upgrade' without</p>
<p>first cloning my trusty old Win7. This is also the reason I didn't just jump in and upgrade. I did a lot of prep first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- My Win7 was installed in 2010. In 2012 I made a clone of it to run on a new machine (reactivated with new key).</p>
<p>Both machines were completely different - AMD cpu / Nvidia gpu&nbsp; &gt; Intel cpu / AMD gpu</p>
<p>(shock horror. A big no no in the XP days ).</p>
<p>The Win10 upgrade was done on the Intel machine from 2012 , but is now in use on a newer Intel/Nvidia
</p>
<p>machine (Two year old. Second hand, but a sweet machine ). </p>
<p>The 2012 Intel machine did have some Win10 specific drivers (chipset , Intel ME ) for the AsRock motherboard,
</p>
<p>or I may not have risked an upgrade on that machine.</p>
<p><br />
While I did uninstall all motherboard drivers before 'moving' Windows to new machines, I didn't have</p>
<p>all the Windows Updates installed when doing my first Win 10 upgrade attempt. </p>
<p>After doing the 1st upgrade I read somewhere that you should have all Windows updates installed before doing</p>
<p>the Win10 upgrade, and from memory, this would be the only thing I did differently on the 2nd go.</p>
<p>- I did the upgrade using the Media Creation Tool, not via Windows Updates, which I understand to be the</p>
<p>least reliable method (which puts those who get the 'forced' update in an even more perilous position than</p>
<p>those who choose to update).</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Laptops. I think there are a higher proportion of laptop/notebook users coming to strife than PC users,</p>
<p>but my perception may be skewed due to the large number of laptop/notebook users .</p>
<p>
</p><p>There seems to be a<em> lot</em> of people upgrading on machines that are not really up to it.
</p>
<p>(And laptop/notebooks do loose driver support from the mfg sooner than PC components.)</p>
<p>This is partly MS's fault as they do approve machines that don't have a Win10 specific graphics driver,
</p>
<p>eg- Intel HD3000,&nbsp; but a lot of people are allowing themselves to be seduced by the 'free' offer and

<h2>            SPEAKERS</h2>
                    All of a sudden my speakers are not recognized by Windows 10/Edge. Says they are not plugged in. Speakers work fine on other devices. Reloaded Drivers several time. Did the Help route several times. Even had Geek Squad take a look. Bought a Roccat Juke
 and it does not work. Plug it in and the speakers give the speaker sound of being hooked up, but no sound.

            Are you kidding me? Your response was hardly anything short of help. I've tried everything and when I said that I made sure I was putting in my password correct I didn't stutter! You people don't seem like you care about your customers because I no longer
 have a computer and its windows 10's stupid fault! I'm in so much distress and have no idea what to do and you give me a hardly any help!&nbsp;

            Same &nbsp;issue. I spent two long, full days on my old backup laptop scouring forums, googling the issue, etc. finding no feedback that helped. I tried logging in on safemode, turning off my wifi, hardwiring to the wifi. I checked the keyboard was set to US.
 I tried to reset to an earlier version (which required my password and accepted it there) but it only put it back to the day of the upgrade. &nbsp;I got to the command prompt and tried resetting my password from there and added a new administrator account, but
 neither effort worked. &nbsp;I spent hours, literally, waiting "in line" for answer tech chat help. I tried calling and when the guy forwarded me to another tech my call got dropped. I finally got to a Microsoft AnswerTech online chat and listed all the efforts

            Sorry this happened to you. I just restored my computer to factory settings... Yeah my advice to anyone who comes across this and didnt get windows 10 i say dont get it! its too buggy right now and you dont want this happening to you. As far as microsoft
 helping you, they dont give a rip about us! Dont expect help because all the help you are going to get is stupid replies like check your keyboard language and turn your wifi on and off. Like that does anything!&nbsp;

            I'm in the same boat as the rest of you. Upgraded to Windows 10 and now I can't get into my laptop because of this password incorrect error. I run a business and my laptop is needed on a daily basis and not having it for a week now is insane. I've called
 Microsoft countless times and I just get the, "oh, just reset your password," people. I'm sure there are people who work for the company who actually know how to fix this, but they won't let me talk to them. Resetting/restoring is not an option for me. Maybe
 I'll take my laptop to Best Buy and see if they can get into it for me. Not sure how much longer I can trust Windows. In the meantime, if anyone in this forum figures this out, please share, as I will make sure I do if I find the fix. Thanks.

            I can't even complain about my situation compared to you. I didn't care about losing my stuff cuz it's easy for me to get it back but you have valuable stuff in your computer. To be honest, if I had money and a lawyer I would sue Microsoft because this
 is entirely their fault. I don't know what best buy and people like geek squad can do but I would ask them if they have a way of getting into your laptop. I really really really hope you get into your laptop because I hate the fact that so many of us had to
 put up with this. I cried because I couldn't get into my laptop because it's one of the only nice things I have and I was deprived of it. Nobody should be deprived of what they are entitled to. I really hope you get your laptop back and if you do post it here
 because I take delight knowing one less person is suffering&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Memory_Management</h2>
                    <div>Alienware 18</div>
<div><br />
</div>
For the past couple months I have been getting the memory_management error, but largely brushed it off since it was not my computer at the time and it wasn't frequent, as my windows 8 computer subsided to the automatic repair loop (whole other story entirely),
 I decided to attempt to fix the issue on my functioning computer before it got out of hand. I installed an Alienrespawn&nbsp;recovery on my hard-drive, then I went on to restore&nbsp;my computer to factory settings the only way I knew how: settings, change
<span>pc</span>&nbsp;settings, update and recovery, recovery, and remove everything. As I went through with the recovery, around 33 percent my computer gives me an error message and I'm unable to restore my computer. I have tried restoring multiple times under both
<span>pc</span>&nbsp;settings, update and recovery, recovery, and remove everything. As I went through with the recovery, around 33 percent my computer gives me an error message and I'm unable to restore my computer. I have tried restoring multiple times under both
 'clean the drive fully' and 'just remove my files' both with more or less the same result. And now, after attempting to restore my computer and failing, I can't access windows! If I click 'continue to windows, it just freezes for a few seconds, goes to automatic
 repair, then takes me back to the same screen for restoring windows, same with turning it off then back on. And to top it all off, when I try to use the Alienrespawn&nbsp;disk I installed on my hard-drive, it doesn't work because it requires a hard-drive of 5535625090
 GBs. I'm not kidding. I know that this is probably not resolvable by myself, but as I am getting desperate I would like some suggestions on what I should do. I can't call dell support, but I do have the resource dvds that came with the computer, although it
 seems to be ignoring them. I could take it to a technician, or I could buy windows 7 operating system, make the computer windows 7, then use my recovery disks for windows 7. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this, but I feel like I've tried everything. Any help would
 be greatly appreciated.

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
It sounds like you have a hardware issue, possibly memory. If you can remove some<br />
and see if you can get it to run. If not swap the memory removed and the memory<br />
that was left in. Of course it could be other hardware.<br />
<br />
Check with the System Maker's Support or a real computer shop (one that does its<br />
own in-shop service).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Also check with the support for your AlienRespawn&nbsp;disk.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. </p>

            <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had a similar problem. Thankfully, I was able to find the solution. It is a specific driver. If you are having the same problems please follow these steps:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
1) Go to Device Manager (Windows Key+X, select it)&nbsp;<br />
2) Under the "Mice and other pointing devices" list find "USB Touchscreen controller", or the driver that's not your mouse/touchpad.&nbsp;<br />
3) Right click to select "Properties", click the "Driver" tab, and click "Roll back".&nbsp;<br />
4) After confirming, this will remove the driver from that list but bring up a bunch of new ones under "Human Interface Devices", where the touchscreen stuff logically should live.&nbsp;<br />
5) Make sure that all the other drivers are updated EXCEPT "USB input device". This is the one that moves it all to the mouse drivers.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>After a restart the driver didn't automatically reinstall like they usually do. If it does, run the "Show or hide updates troubleshooter"&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">found here.&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to think this is an issue from eGalax Touch, which is responsible for the driver, but if you do a search for "egalax touch acts like mouse" this is an issue dating back to Windows 7. Either a) Microsoft should stop doing business with
 them, b) Microsoft should provide a fix for how the driver interacts with the OS, or c) let the consumer know that there is an issue and how to fix it. Because it's the SAME ISSUE.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

 drill. The drill of checking to make sure my monitor (Acer 27 inch) is on the latest driver...Still awaiting any assistance of --&gt;&nbsp;and then what to do after you've checked your driver....Peace.

<h2>            SSIS Connection manager not saving changes.</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an SSIS issue with a package level connection manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Visual Studio Professional 2012.</p>
<p>The connection manager is&nbsp;a&nbsp;Dynamics CRM Lookup Connection Manager&nbsp;with provider Native OLE DB\SQL Server Native Client 11.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>For this connection manager I am using&nbsp;SQL Server Authentication and am connecting to a database. Lets call this database DB1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to update DB1 to DB2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do this, then&nbsp;test the connection. The test result returns successful following this I click 'OK' which then supposedly saves the connection manager updates and applies them to the SSIS package.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However the package is NOT updated and when I re-open the connection manager the old DB1 information is shown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any idea why this behaviour is occurring as I urgently need to update this connection manager without removing and re-creating it.</p>

<h2>            How to change Windows 8.1 boot logo back to UEFI dell OEM boot logo</h2>
                    Hi, I have a Dell laptop that I love to use. But then I got a virus from IE, and so I had to restore my computer. I didn't have an OEM recovery disk, so I used the Windows 8.1 Media creation tool. I got the right version but when the restore process was
 done, The Dell boot logo shows but then the screen goes black then shows the blue boxes windows logo. Could o change it back to the OEM logo my laptop cam e with?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Media Creation Tool gives you a generic ISO download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want everything exactly&nbsp;the same as it was from Dell, you will have to buy the Dell Recovery Media from Dell and reinstall using that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers.</p>

<h2>            Differences between Windows OS sold in different countries</h2>
                    <p>I have a question about windows 7 and 8.</p>
<p>Are there any differences between Windows OS sold in America vs. Europe?</p>
<p>If I change the language pack, display language, etc. will I have the identical product to the one sold in another country?

            <p>Some key differences between European and American distributions, the European do not come bundled with Windows Media Player or cannot install media components such as Media Center. These are designated either as Windows 8 N or Windows 7 N.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can add display languages by installing additional language files. When you install language files, you can view wizards, dialog boxes, menus, Help topics, and other items in
<span>Windows</span> in a different language.</p>
<p>There are two types of language files:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span><span>Windows 7</span> Multilingual User Interface Pack (MUI).</span>‌
<span>Windows 7</span> MUIs provide a translated version of most of the user interface. MUIs require a license to be used and are only available in
<span>Windows 7</span> Ultimate and <span>
Windows 7</span> Enterprise. If you are using <span>Windows 7</span> Enterprise, contact your system administrator for information about installing additional languages.</p>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Please note, Language Packs are free for all editions of Windows 8.</strong></p>
