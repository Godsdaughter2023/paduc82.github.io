    <title>How do I find and replace multiple sentences that begin with same word - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I find and replace multiple sentences that begin with same word but end with different word&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I need to remove approximately 800 lines of text (single sentences) dispersed throughout a 450 page document.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each line I want to remove begins with "Folder list: Library/" and then the remaining&nbsp;text is different for each line of text.&nbsp; Each sentence ends with a pargraph marker (hard return).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way to perform a find and replace?&nbsp; I want to replace the entire line with just a hard return.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

                    I have been trying to call mobile numbers in Namibia from Skype for Business never go through. I do not have a similar problem with other country mobile numbers. Why is this the case?

<p><span>Hi </span><span>LJay1</span><span>,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I know, user can make outbound calls to Namibia if he/she has the Domestic and International Calling Plan license. For your reference:

<p>
</p><p>Therefore, if you don't have this license, you cannot call mobile number in Nomibia, please click this

<h2>            Outlook not syncing all events with google calendar</h2>
                    I am using Office 2007 with Outlook as my mail client. My platform is Win 7 64. &nbsp;I am using Google Calendar Sync (o.9.41) to keep both my Outlook and Google Calendar matching. However, both Birthdays and Holidays in Google Calendar refuse to show up in
 Outlook. If I go and add and event in either one and run the sync it shows up in both. If I delete one the same happens. However, when I added into Google the Holidays and Contacts, Birthdays &amp; Events they show up just fine in my Google Calendar. Any explanations
 I what I am doing wrong or should be doing differently I would appreciate any input offered. Thank you.

            <p>Thanks for your response. I am running the 32 bit version (Office 2007).&nbsp; For Google Calendar Sync, I do have two-way sync set up.&nbsp; After beating my head against the wall for most of yesterday until a software developer provided me with part of the answer.&nbsp;
 Inadvertently,&nbsp;by accident I happened to&nbsp;stumble upon the balance of the solution.&nbsp; I will try and list out&nbsp;the steps below and hopefully it will be of help to somebody else dealing with the same issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open Google Calendar.</p>
<p>Unsubscribe from the "US Holidays" calendar.</p>
<p>Select " add by&nbsp;URL" &nbsp; under "Other&nbsp; Calendars" ( left sidebar on main calendar page )
</p>
<p><span>Enter "http://www.markthisdate.com/calendar/US_Holidays_622.ics"</span></p>
<p><span>Select option " Add&nbsp;Calendar" and this will add holidays to your main calendar .&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>Open Outlook and go to your calendar.</span></p>
<p><span>Keep your Outlook calendar open and returned to&nbsp; your Google Calendar</span></p>
<p><span>Click on the dropdown arrow next to "Us Holidarys" and select "Calendar Settings"</span></p>
<p><span>Dbl-Click on&nbsp;the URL listed&nbsp; and you will be asked "<b>Do you want to open or save US_Holidays_622.ics from www.markthisdate.com?".</b></span></p>
<p><span><b>Select "Open".</b></span></p>
<p><span>Return to Outlook and you should see a new Calendar added called "US Holidays".</span></p>
<p><span>Right-Click on the calendar and select "View in an Overlay Mode to have it combined with the main calendar.</span></p>
<p><span>In essence, it appears that Outlook imports the above ics file. Anyway, this solution worked for me.</span></p>

<h2>            Outlook&#47;Hotmail cuts off my emails when I send them</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was migrated from Hotmail to Outlook recently. I am having MANY issues with this.&nbsp; My biggest issue is that when I send emails, only a bit of the email actually gets sent (usually the beginning part). This makes all my emails look unfinished and its completely
 unprofessional and frustrating. I have given it a few weeks as had hoped it would be resolved but weeks on this is still happening. I also spell check my emails sometimes and when I hit send an un spellchecked version (again usually only a bit of it!) gets
 sent.&nbsp; I'm applying for jobs at the moment so this is not something that can go on.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas? If this continues I may have to move to Yahoo as its completely unworkable as it is.

            <p>Hi <font color="#0072c6">lisasoph1</font>,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I know how frustrating it is to have an issue in sending your emails. I will be glad to help you with your issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I recommend that you clear your browser's cache and temporary internet files to make sure that they are not causing your issue. This is often caused by a corrupted file in the browser.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">For assistance in clearing cache and cookies on various browsers&nbsp;refer to this&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Clear-Your-Browser's-Cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>link</span></a><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, we’d like you to provide us the answers to the following questions that I have enumerated below. These will help us to investigate your concern:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>• Does the issue happen when using a different computer? </p>
<p>• Do other Hotmail accounts encounter the same issue when using your computer?
</p>
<p>• Does the same thing happen when you access your account from the same computer with a different browser?&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if you have more questions. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Sergs P.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have the same problem.&nbsp; I wish to migrate back to the old Hotmail.&nbsp; These truncated messages have caused a lot of embarrassment.&nbsp; The messages get truncated so only the top portions get sent.&nbsp; The messages do not properly get saved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Deleting cache is not going to help as this happens with other computers other than mine.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like the other gentlemen, this is totally unprofessional making Hotmail or outlook totally unreliable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every time I send an email, I take a chance that whether the email get sent in its entirety.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please fix this problem.....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            ok it seems that there are several of us that have answered his questions. The problem still persists. I have ENTIRE emails missing minus the greeting. This is absurdly unprofessional and the epitome of incompetence. its been months of people having this
 issue and yet it still is a problem, many of the people above were polite about this and its clear that does nothing. This outlook BS that was pushed onto this community was bad enough as is now we are finding out that it was an unreliable buggy network that
 has been pushed onto us. Way to pay back your loyal clients. This unreliability in addition to incompetence and utter disrespect to your client base is disgusting. address this issue now. it happens with lengthy emails. no attachments. it juts cuts the entire
 thing.&nbsp;

            Hi Faheemuddin,<br />
<br />
You can <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-US/article/Install-and-use-different-versions-of-Office-on-the-same-PC-6EBB44CE-18A3-43F9-A187-B78C513788BF" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">install and use different Office version at the same time</a></strong>
 on the computer. However, there are conditions that need to be met to install them properly on your computer.<br />
<br />
When installing Office with different version, it is recommended that you install the older version before the latest one. In your case, Office 2010 is already installed and you can proceed installing Office&nbsp; 2016. Both Office versions should also run same
 32 or 64 bit version.<br />
<br />
To activate your Office 2016, you may follow our Office support page about <strong>

    <title>Emailing CSV from Excel changes formatting for recipient. How can I - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jphogan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Emailing CSV from Excel changes formatting for recipient. How can I prevent this&#63;</h2>
                    When I open a CSV file in Excel 2010 and click the "E-mail" button, it opens up an new email message with the file attached. When the email is received, the formatting has changed. It is taking all of the cells in a row and putting them into just a couple
 of columns. <br />
<br />
For example, I'll have a CSV with Columns "First, Last, Email, Address, City, State, Zip". The recipient gets a CSV with the first cell containing all of these headings in single cell. It does that for the information in subsequent rows too. I have tried this
 with Windows XP as well with the same result. <br />
<br />
Any help is appreciated! Thanks!<br />

            Thank you for your response and help. I'll give you as much information as I can. Feel free to ignore whatever has no bearing. :)<br />
<br />
1) It happens with multiple users. I have only tested it on users with Office 2010, but one user had Win XP and the other had Win 7 and it was the same issue.
<br />
<br />
2) I'm not exactly sure. I am exporting data from a site which downloads it in a CSV. The goal is to be able to download &amp; open the file, then select email from excel and have it sent as an attachment.
<br />
<br />
Here's the odd thing: when I select to "save as" the file, the "save as type" box is auto-populated with "Unicode Text (*.txt)" rather than "CSV (Comma Delimited)(*.csv). With any other CSV (and with the same file AFTER I email it to myself) the "save as type"
 box is auto-populated with "CSV (Comma Delimited)(*.csv)" which makes me think that, although it's a CSV, it somehow a different file type.
<br />
<br />
3) This process works fine. It also works if I right-click on the CSV icon and select "Send to &gt; Mail recipient".&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
We have to do this process numerous times per day, so the hope was that we'd be able to download the CSV, open it, and click to send it through email without having to do those couple extra steps every time. I don't understand why this process would change
 the actual formatting of the CSV. <br />
<br />
Thanks for your help! If you know what might be done, I would love to hear it. <br />

            Thank you again for your response. Unfortunately, I am looking to solve a very specific issue. While your solutions do technically work for emailing the file without changing the formatting, that is not exactly what I am really trying to accomplish.
<br />
<br />
When I select to download the file from my internet browser, I want to be able to open it, review it to verify accuracy, then email it on to the next recipient.
<br />
<br />
I can certainly re-save the file or convert, but I am hoping to avoid those extra steps each time. It seems as though there may not be a solution for this. Thank you for your time.

            <p>jphogan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try downloading your file to you hard disk.&nbsp; Then open it in notepad.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A "CSV" file doesn't have any formatting.&nbsp; Each line could represent multiple columns and the separator is usually a comma - which is why it is called a Comma Separated File.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generally excel does this behind the scenes so to speak if the file has a .csv extension.&nbsp;&nbsp; It sounds like&nbsp;Excel isn't doing it for your other users&nbsp;- but it also sounds like the file hasn't changed from when you downloaded it.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I can replicate this problem.</p>
<p>The file arrives in an email as a CSV attachment (Outlook).</p>
<p>Opening the file (double-click) launches Excel and data is separated by commas in columns.</p>
<p>Using the 'Save and Send' as an email attachment in Excel strips the commas and sends a 'Unicode text' version of the file.</p>

<h2>            17110 Update Caused Total Machine Failure</h2>
                    The update hung at 98% for hours. Power cycling the machine brought up a message that c:\windows\system32\config\systemprofile\desktop could not be located. I ended up with a blank desktop, no start menu when right&nbsp; clicking the windows start button, no
 quick access functions when left clicking the start button, Open Action Center doesn't work. In short I have no way to get to Settings to get it to roll back. Repeated attempts at restarts have not worked. Suggestions to force a roll back would be appreciated.
 The machine is pretty much a brick at this point.

<h2>            Nokia N95 8gb.Fake or not&#63;hard to guess</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi and thank you for reading this. As my topic name says, i have in my posses a nokia N95 8GB phone. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have some issues with it though. I can't tell if its a fake or not. I tried numerous things as.. checking the "*" , it has
 6 edges,when i type *#0000# it says Nokia N95 8GB (12.01) V10.0.021 / 04-30-2009 / RM-320 .And on the back of it under the battery it says Model: N95 8GB Type: RM-320 . I guess the IMEI from the back of the phone is : 354835/01/568410/4 . &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Also it
 has all the languages installed as both when you write a SMS, and language menu. most of the codes symbian works, i also tryed the 2 ways of formating , it deleted all but with no effect. The way that it bothers me is that, it HAS a card slot, it doesn't identify
 the 8GB hard memory, and it lacks alot of settings , as like "Nokia PC suite" fron connectivity, in fact the only way to connect has "bluetooth" and its cool in a way because from its FTP profile i can navigate as like partitions. Also it doesn't have the
 install application software on it, so the ".sis" files cannot be installed lol. I am confused as ever before.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>here is a well documentent explanation by one of our top residents grschinon</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is said that imitation is the most sincere form of flattery. Except when it is used to deceive people and rob them.<br />
<br />
There have been replicas made of some of the higher-end Nokia models, in particular the 8800 Sapphire Arte and 8800 Carbon Arte, both of which have a £1000+ price tag on them in the
<a href="http://shop.nokia.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0034ff">Nokia Online store</font></a>, and then sold on eBay represented as the original Nokia product being sold at a discount price.<br />
<br />
This short guide should help you avoid falling into the trap that scammers have laid for you.<br />
<br />
First of all, just look at the price. There's no such thing as a free lunch and if something looks too good to be true then there's a significant probability that it simply
<em>is</em> too good to be true. I recently saw multiple cases of people buying what they thought to be genuine Nokia 8800 Sapphire Artes but turned out to be Chinese fakes. One of them said that he paid $450 for his. Purely on that basis I would have left
 that phone well alone. $450 is less than a quarter of the phone's normal retail price and it therefore cannot be anything but a fake.<br />
<br />
Secondly, the photos. Most online auction sites allow photos of the item for auction to be posted in order to give potential buyers an idea of what they're bidding for. Always be wary of sellers who only provide photos that come directly from
<a href="http://www.nokia.com/press" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0034ff">Nokia's Press Site</font></a>. You are not seeing a photo of the actual device being sold, you are seeing generic photos used for publicity's sake. Insist on seeing photos of the phone
 being sold and if the seller doesn't want to send you any then walk away. Obtaining such photos serves a double purpose: firstly you get to see the actual phone. Secondly, you can return the phone as non-compliant if it is evidently not the phone on the photos
 that you were told <em>were</em> photos of it.<br />
<br />
Thirdly, the IMEI number. The IMEI number is a 15-digit unique number that identifies the phone in question. Insist upon having it. Then go to
<a href="http://www.numberingplans.com/?page=analysis&amp;sub=imeinr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<font color="#0034ff">this page</font></a>, enter that IMEI number, and you will be told exactly what model phone has that IMEI number. If it's not the model that's being sold then the seller is trying to pull a fast one on you. Of course, it could be that
 the seller does communicate the IMEI number of an authentic Nokia phone to you but sends you a fake with a completely different IMEI number. In that case, the phone shipped to you is obviously different from the one promised and you can return it and annull
 the sale.<br />
<br />
Fourthly, if the phone is being represented as the "Chinese version" then it almost certainly is a fake. Nokia does have a production plant in China so "Made in China" isn't at all grounds for rejection, but "Chinese version" is. While it's true that there
 is a genuine "Chinese" version of many Nokia phones (they have neither WiFi nor 3G capability as demanded by the Chinese government), it's not something a seller would shout about. If they do say that it's a "Chinese version" phone then the chances are that
 it's not a Nokia at all and it's more like a "Chinese fake".<br />
<br />
The four points above assume you don't have access to the phone yet because you're buying it online through an auction site or just an online retailer. A few things you can look at if you can get your hands on it before buying are as follows.<br />
<br />
All new Nokia phones respond to the code *#7780# entered on the keypad by asking you to confirm that you want to revert to factory settings and asking you for a lock code. If the phone you're looking at doesn't do this then it's not a Nokia.<br />
<br />
Try and get the firmware version currently installed in the phone. To do this, enter *#0000# from standby. There's no way to validate formally the information you'll see but one thing that means the phone you're looking at definitely
<em>is</em> a fake is the date of the firmware revision in American format, MM-DD-YYYY, "02-22-2007" for example. If you're unsure, note down exactly what you see and ask on these forums.<br />
<br />
Finally, ask if you can plug the phone into the USB socket of your laptop computer with the provided cable (assuming one is provided). There's no need to install any software on your laptop, all you want to see is how the phone reacts. A genuine Nokia phone,
 when connected to a USB port, will give you the options "Default mode", "Printing" and "Data storage" for some models and "PC Suite", "Mass storage", "Image transfer" and "Media transfer" for others. Or combinations thereof. Options frequently seen on fakes
 and <u>never</u> on genuine Nokias include "webcam" and "comport". If the phone you're looking at displays either of these two options then it's definitely a fake.<br />
<br />
There are many risks involved with the purchase of an expensive piece of equipment like a high-end mobile phone. Many of them can be eliminated by not trusting auction sites with a reputation as shady in that area as the one that comes to mind first of all,
 who <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/07/14/ebay_tiffany_ruling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<font color="#0034ff">went on the record condoning the sale of counterfeit items in the name of "consumer choice"</font></a>. The risks diminish significantly if you purchase either online or in a real store but from somewhere that has a good reputation and
 a good returns policy. However, the only way to be 100% certain that you're getting the genuine article is to buy it directly from Nokia. If you do get yours from your mobile network operator then it will also be a genuine Nokia albeit
<a href="http://linux.sgms-centre.com/nokiafaq/branded-phones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0034ff">tampered with</font></a> by the operator.</p>

<h2>            Product key invalid after new hard drive installed</h2>
                    I purchased Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007 online&nbsp;for my laptop and it has since crashed. A new hard drive was installed with everything redone. When I go into Office it asks for a product key I put the one I got and it says the key is incorrect.
 Ive been able to use Microsoft Office since I got it back, I just bypass the prompt to enter a product key. I tried to open a document this morning and it wouldnt let me do anything to it but print. HELP what can I do???

            <p>After it is newly installed, Office gives you a limited time to enter the product key to prove you have a legal key. Typically that is 25-30 uses.&nbsp; It has now gone into limited function mode, acting as a reader applciation only.&nbsp; You have to provide a valid
 product key to get full function.</p>
<p>In theory you should be able to reinstall and activate Office on a computer that has been "upgraded" with a new HD.</p>
<p>Since your valid key is not working, your best approach is to do a phone activation. Don't enter any requested information, eventually the phone system should give you the option of talking to a service rep. They can tell you the reason behind the rejection.</p>

            <p>Hi Ronald,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ideally, Wi-Fi Sense connects you to more Wi-Fi networks. You'll get connected to open Wi-Fi hotspots that Wi-Fi Sense knows about. And if you share access to a Wi-Fi network with your Outlook.com contacts, Skype contacts, or Facebook friends, you'll get
 connected to Wi-Fi networks they've shared using Wi-Fi Sense. You and your friends get Internet access without seeing each other's passwords.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you wish to change the options for Wi-Fi Sense in Windows 10, you may refer to the following steps in the new operating system:</p>
<p>a) Select the <strong>Wi-Fi network</strong> icon in the taskbar &gt; <strong>Network settings.</strong></p>
<p>b) Select <strong>Wi-Fi</strong> &gt; <strong>Manage Wi-Fi settings</strong>.</p>
<p>c) Under <strong>Wi-Fi Sense,</strong> change one or both of these settings if you like:</p>

<p><span>VERY disappointed to see all Windows 10 *by default* shares your router's Wi_fi keys with your entire contact list, facebook friends etc. (Google 'Windows10' 'Wi-Fi Sense') I had to change up my router's SSID's to include _optout in case someone visited
 with a Windows product and unknowingly shares my router keys with everyone else. What security hole bull</span></p>
<p>Any thots?</p>
<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Actually it doesn't work the way you describe. Typical hyperbole. Yes it allows anyone on your contact list with Windows device to connect to you network( assuming they are close enough to your router. ) They do not however get your wi-fi password. Now while
 I agree this should be shut off as the default it doesn't do what you say it does. And also you DO have the option to shut it off. If it was a forced feature&nbsp;it's be&nbsp;more of an issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>When you share Wi-Fi network access with Facebook friends, Outlook.com contacts, or Skype contacts, they'll be connected to the password-protected Wi-Fi networks that you choose to share and get Internet access when they're in range of the networks (if
 they use Wi-Fi Sense). Likewise, you'll be connected to Wi-Fi networks that they share for Internet access too. Remember,
<strong>you don't get to see Wi-Fi network passwords</strong>, and you both get Internet access only.
<strong>They won't have access to other computers, devices, or files stored on your home network, and you won't have access to these things on their network</strong></em></p>

<p>
</p><p>Have you any comprehension of how easy and fast it is to brute force attack most passwords? Serious hackers use FPGAs now. I've probably hashes on the rainbow tables of my servers that would crack 90% of the people in this area.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you ever heard of war-driving? The very idea of it is to compromise wifi networks from the street. The process of hacking a network starts with something small IP address, SSID, and Internet login token is a great place to start.&nbsp;</p>

                    So youtube changed their comment system. Now to get alerts you have to use google+. But whenever I try to look at my alerts it will not let me and says that i enabled&nbsp;compatibility mode and that I need to take it off. I just dont know how to disable ot
 on the RT version of internet explorer. I know i could probably use the deaktop version but i rther just use the rt version and i was wondering how i could fix this problem.

    <title>Disappearing and jumping text boxes and images in table in MS Word - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michaelb1234  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disappearing and jumping text boxes and images in table in MS Word 2016</h2>
                    <p>I've already spent hours with tech support on chat trying to submit this bug. multiple support techs have taken over my desktop and seen the problem. The software is up to date and working as normal and it is definitely a bug that has to be worked around
 and not a unique error. Since i've been unable to get microsoft to give me a way to actually send them a file that repeatedly reproduces the bug&nbsp; i'm going to post it here and maybe someone will elevate it to someone who will recognize it as a problem that
 needs a code fix.</p>
<p><a href="https://1drv.ms/w/s!AmmMCx22CudvmwhacjcUpJXIW-hG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">File example of images and text that jump when zooming or scrolling or clicking on text box.</a></p>
<p>Note that you need to open this document in the desktop version to work with the objects in the table and see the issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is that images and text boxes disappear when i zoom, scroll, click on the text, or many other actions that cause the screen to redraw. They don't actually go away and will print, but make reading and editing impossible for the "disappeared" items
 until they decide to reappear on their own. It's a major hassle for building marked up image tables.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When they "disappear" their outline can be seen at the top left corner of the page when the original location is selected, so it appears the problem is rooted in the layout references and for some reason the page is being used instead of the cell. This problem
 also seems to be more prevalent when the table crosses pages, but i'm not sure if it is exclusive to that. Other issues with using objects in cells, perhaps related only to grouped elements, is that when you use the drag handles to resize objects in a cell
 they often go haywire, jumping to a size that's way off, or becoming super large and losing selection so they are no longer editable and undo or closing the file without saving is the only recourse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't remember having these same problems doing the same things in old versions of word, like 2010 or 2013. 2016 in general seems to be very buggy and so intertwined with default styles and assumed auto-formatting that it is very difficult to format and
 work with on complex documents. I spend more time un-editing words "help" and learning how to work around problems than writing the actual document.</p>

<p>As I do not see the issue here, I would suggest that it is probably an issue with your display\graphics driver and you might try changing the setting for hardware graphics acceleration under File&gt;Options&gt;Advanced&gt;Display.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However I would suggest that you always insert images so that they are in-line with text and if you need to add text or other elements to an image, you do that in a dedicated graphics application, or, use SnagIt from www.techsmith.com to take a screen capture

<h2>            what is a &#34;successful sync&#34;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was told that my Hotmail acct may have been compromised. Is there a way I can learn more about how you know it was compromised and the details of what computer/ or location of the computer if you can determine to that specificity?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone please explain to me what a "successful sync" means. The successful sync part of my recent activity was from countries all over the world, so I'm guessing that's what caused HM to send me the email
 about my acct possibly being compromised. I want to know if anyone can tell me what exactly caused that successful sync from other countries. Was it something I did? Was it really another person trying to pry into my account? The successful sign ins were all
 from the US, probably me. It's the "successful sync" that are from other countries. Can anyone tell me what successful sync means?</p>
<p>Is there a way to determine what specifically I did or did not do to cause the "successful syncs"?</p>
<br />
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks so much.</span></p>

<br />Successful sync means they connected to the account and synced. Unless you were in the other countries when they syncs happened, it was likely a hacker that got into your account.

<h2>            Display of Combo Box - Multiple values&#47;columns shown.</h2>
                    <p>I'm doing an assignment where I have to build a small 'Game' database with players who own games and can loan them out, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having trouble with my combo box in the form for inserting 'Game' - games owned by specific people.</p>
<p>With the <em>name</em> specifically.</p>
<p>In my Gamer Table, I have (fields):</p>
<p>- Game_Bar_Code</p>
<p>- GameTitle</p>
<p>- Price</p>
<p>- Genre</p>
<p>- NumberOfPlayers</p>
<p>- Owner</p>
<p>- Publisher</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've gotten the combo box so that you can select the first name and corresponding last name (from a separate table of people/gamers), but it only displays the first name as the bound column is 0 - being the first name.</p>
<p>(SELECT [Gamer.First_Name], [Gamer.Last_Name] FROM Gamer ORDER BY First_Name, Last_Name; )
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to have it display both first and last name in the same box?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            The following is an example of how you can set up a combo box of personal names, in this case of employees:<br />
<br />
ControlSource:&nbsp;&nbsp; EmployeeID (for a bound control; leave blank if the combo box is an unbound 'navigational' control)<br />
<br />
RowSource:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName &amp; " " &amp; LastName FROM Employees ORDER BY LastName, FirstName;<br />
<br />
BoundColumn:&nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br />
ColumnCount:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2<br />
ColumnWidths:&nbsp; 0cm<br />
<br />
If your units of measurement are imperial rather than metric Access will automatically convert the unit of the last one to inches.&nbsp; The important thing is that the dimension is zero to hide the first column.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, you can concatenate the names so that the last name is first, which would be better with a large list of names as it allows the user to enter the initial characters of the last name and progressively go to the first match as each character is
 entered:<br />
<br />
RowSource:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SELECT EmployeeID, LastName &amp; ", " &amp; FirstName FROM Employees ORDER BY LastName, FirstName;<br />
<br />
However, selecting a person purely by name is not really satisfactory, as personal names can be legitimately be duplicated.&nbsp; I was once present at a clinic when two patients arrived within minutes of each other, both female, both with the same first and last
 names, and both with the same date of birth.&nbsp; To differentiate between two or more individuals of the same name, you can include data from other columns in one or more further columns in a combo or list box's list.&nbsp; The following is an example from my NotInList
 demo in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
Note that if you are using an earlier version of Access you might find that the colour of some form objects such as buttons shows incorrectly and you will need to&nbsp; amend the form design accordingly. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link copy its text (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
In this little demo file the open form differentiates between individuals by address by setting the RowSource property of a combo box to:<br />
<br />
SELECT Contacts.ContactID, FirstName &amp; " " &amp; LastName,<br />
ConcatValues(", ",AddressLine1,AddressLine2,City,Region,PostCode) <br />
FROM Regions INNER JOIN (Cities INNER JOIN Contacts <br />
ON Cities.CityID = Contacts.CityID) <br />
ON Regions.RegionID = Cities.RegionID <br />
ORDER BY LastName, FirstName;<br />
<br />
To concatenate the address data into the second column, suppressing any Nulls, the following function is called:<br />
<br />
Public Function ConcatValues(strSeparator As String, ParamArray arrVals())<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' Pass this function a character or characters<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' to be used as the separator followed by the values to be combined<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' For example: strFullName =<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' ConcatValues(" ",FirstName, MiddleName,LastName)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim X As Integer, strLine As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For X = 0 To UBound(arrVals)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Not IsNull(arrVals(X)) And Trim(arrVals(X)) &lt;&gt; "" Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strLine = strLine &amp; strSeparator &amp; arrVals(X)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' remove leading separator character(s)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ConcatValues = Mid(strLine, Len(strSeparator) + 1)<br />
&nbsp; <br />
End Function<br />

<p><strong><span>Already I have installed and activated my Office Enterprise 2007 in my old laptop. some 6 months back, I have formatted my laptop, and at the time of&nbsp;re installation, I lost the Product key. But for installation I used
 some other key from my friend. But as I have already registered &amp; activated my Office 2007 suite, I had no issues when I entered the other key, which I got from my friend. But now I want to transfer this license to my new laptop. So Now I want to know the
 process for retrieving the original product key &amp; also the process of transferring the license from one laptop to another laptop.</span></strong></p>

<p>Hi everyone, im not a techie chap so any easy to understand help would be grateful.</p>
<p>Last 5 weeks or so since the last update my E7 emails have been deleting themselves when they feel like it but only on my pop3 mail??? My live mail has been fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have deleted both mail accounts and re set them not accepting the terms page. Also tried a reset on the phone but nothing is helping. Any ideas please.</p>

            Do you currently download your pop3 from another program like outlook maybe. It just has to do with the settings of the program. If the progam is not configured to leave mail on the server then after downloading, the messages will be gone. When you then
 synchronise with your e7 there are no messaages so all are removed from the phone. I had the same prob. The setting has to be configured from your mail client or service provider. Live mail is left on the server until you delete it. Try deleting a recent message
 online in you live mail account then sync with your handset. That message should also be gone from the hanset after the sync.
