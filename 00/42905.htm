<h2>            Teredo IP address error.</h2>
                    
<p>I played Star Wars Battlefront on Day One of launch with no problems for about 6 hours, went to play again the following day and my Xbox had updated to a new home screen and every time i joined the game i would have errors saying the connection to the game
 were bad and unable to play. I checked multiplayer connection under Settings and all of a sudden i had "Cannot get a Teredo IP address" as a error message. I followed every step to fix said issue to no avail until i finally changed the IPv6 to IPv4 and it
 worked. Success! Wrong... It then gave me a "High Packet Loss" error. Again, i followed the steps and nothing worked. I played with my router settings and got that to resolve until eventually i tried to play anyway and strangely i had lost the criteria to
 play multiplayer. I renewed my subscription to fix this and then came back to the previous issue of not receiving a Teredo IP. I have been trying for four and a half hours now to get this to work the day after it worked perfectly to my absolute confusion not
 to mention severe frustration and am at a loss. What can i do to fix this that i haven't done already?</p>

            <p>Greetings Sunelf!</p>
<p>Appreciate if you can post up the make and model of your router and your modem as well (if this is not combined into a single device).</p>
<p>Can you also tell us which of the following features you have configured and which are currently active:</p>
<p>- UPnP</p>
<p>- Port Forwarding/Virtual Server</p>
<p>- Port Triggering</p>
<p>- DMZ</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
        </p>

<p>When this happens to me, I usually clear my Mac address. I will write down all my info, IP address, gateway, etc and then I will go to network settings and enter everything in manually. When it comes to clearing your Mac, it will let you know that its time
 for your console to reset, once it resets, test your multiplayer again. Also, if you have two wifi, 2.4 or 5, I would choose 5.

<p>Thanks for getting back to me. Sorry, i forgot to answer the bold questions. Err.... Oops? lol.</p>
<p>My Router is a Fritz!box 7272</p>
<p>ISP: Internode</p>
<p>UPnP was not activated the first day it worked but it is now currently activated.</p>
<p>I given my xbox port forwarding through IPv6 with all ports open. (IPv6 tab under Internet&gt;Permit Access, Advanced View)</p>
<p>Port Triggering? That's a new one for me. Never seen that before so i assume it's off?</p>
<p>DMZ i know about but can't figure out. (I'm computer handicapped. It's a serious issue that i need to fix. Rehab will fix this right?)</p>
<p>I had IPv6 support enabled and the setting 'Always use a native IPv6 connection' as it is default on the router but i turned IPv6 off altogether and then i got a High Packet Loss error. So that didn't help. I then changed it to: Always use a native IPv4
 connection (recommended). (First a native IPv4 connection is established. If a 6RD server address was learned through DHCP, a 6RD tunnel is established. Otherwise the device will attempt to establish a native IPv6 connection (Dual Stack).) &lt; That part was
 literally copied and pasted. :P This seemed to work for all of a good 5 minutes and then the High Packet Loss error came back and i had 900 ms Latency. I'm usually at around 100 Latency, 0% Packet Loss. I will try the Mac address changes. However, 2 wifis?
 5? I don't know what that means but if it pops up during the Mac reset, i'll get to that as it comes. Thanks guys, appreciate this so much! :D</p>

<p>DMZ stands for Demilitarized Zone and it is used to place a PC or consul outside of any firewall meaning it has no protection which is fine for the Xbox.</p>
<p>To do this first you need to give you Xbox a static IP Address.</p>
<p>1) Go to Settings – Network – Network Setting</p>
<p>2) Select Advanced Settings and take note of the IP Address, Subnet Mask Gateway and both Primary and Secondary DNS</p>
<p>3) Select IP Settings – Manual </p>
<p>4) Enter an IP Address which should be something like 192.168.x.2 where x is the third number of the IP Address that you wrote down and the forth is any number in the between 1 – 255 and select enter (1 is normally used by the modem)</p>
<p>5) Enter the Subnet Mask from step 2 and select enter</p>
<p>6) Enter the Gateway from step 2 and select enter</p>
<p>7) Enter the Primary DNS from step 2 and select enter</p>
<p>8) Enter the Secondary DNS from step 2 and select enter</p>
<p>9) Once this is done it will check your connection and if all is well hit B to save the settings</p>
<p>10) Using a web browser go to your routers configuration settings and enable DMZ and enter the IP Address you just assigned to your Xbox this should then place it outside the firewall.</p>

            <p>A Teredo server is listening on network port 3544 (UDP) and the FRITZ!Box is, by default, configured to block port 3544 for security reasons.</p>
<p>So with this in mind you would have to login to your FRITZ!Box web utility interface and disable the option: "Teredo filter enabled". </p>
<p>For this to work, you will have to take more sure "Advanced View" is enabled on the user interface of your FRITZ!Box.</p>
<p>- Click "Filters" in the "Internet" menu.</p>
<p>- Click on the "Lists" tab.</p>
<p>- Disable the option "Teredo filter enabled".</p>
<p>- Click "Apply" to save your settings.</p>
<p>I would also make sure IPv6 is completely disabled for all interfaces on your FRITZ!Box.</p>
<p>At this point, make sure only UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) is enabled, as the feature to forwarding (automatically) network ports used by Xbox Live.</p>
<p>Don't forget to "Apply" your configuration and reboot your gateway afterwards.</p>
<p>Post back and let us know how that goes.</p>

<p>Hey. Thanks for all the help guys. I tried all the things you guys said but nothing would work. I would solve the Teredo issue but then get a High Packet Loss issue so i kept going in circles. Though, i turned my xbox on today and ran the test multiplayer
 connection test and it worked! I don't know why but it did. It broke itself and then fixed itself. So whatever settings i have now are not getting changed like, ever! Thanks again for the help. I hope this never happens to anyone else but if it does, you guys
 will be able to help i'm sure. Thanks heaps! &lt;3</p>

            Can I get my free Windows&nbsp;10 upgrade even if I didn’t reserve? 
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Yes. The easiest way to get the free upgrade is to reserve, but you can upgrade even if you don’t reserve.</p>
<p>Once Windows&nbsp;10 is available, we’ll begin notifying devices that their free upgrade is available. Just open the Get Windows&nbsp;10 app to schedule your upgrade. Note: Some notifications will go out as soon as Windows&nbsp;10 is available; others may go out in the
 weeks or months following.</p>
<p>
Can I reserve even if I didn’t get a notification? 
</p><div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Yes. You can reserve your upgrade at any time on any compatible PC by clicking on the Get Windows&nbsp;10 app or the Windows Update control panel.</p>

            My recommendation to users going forward is not to pounce on every new Windows 10 Feature Update that is released. If your system has been working just fine with the current version, wait it out a while or skip it all together. If there is some specific feature in the update you want, then thats an exception, but these feature updates are becoming more difficult to install on older devices; and it sometimes makes you wonder if the inconvenience is worth the hassle just to keep doing the same thing.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />If you look at whats considered the flagship features of Windows 10 1709, they are aimed at newer generation devices like the new Surface Book 2. Otherwise welcome features like Story Remix, which you have to upgrade to 1709 to get, could be supplanted with third party alternatives.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />There are some compatibility issues with Windows 10 version 1709 and certain hardware or software. There is no explanation why a lot of these problems are happening in Windows 10 1709, but the release is significantly flawed. Software and Hardware that once worked in previous versions, just suddenly stops working in Windows 10 1709 after an upgrade and sometimes loses functionality or stability.
<br />
<br />Just to touch back on why I personally think it might be broken. When Microsoft starts preparing for a new release, it goes through a process called refactoring. It seems this is introducing some significant code changes that breaks certain protocols and API's required by older apps and drivers. Considering the Windows Driver Model has not changed much in its near 30 year history not mention the application programming interfaces such as Win32, this might be culprit. 
<br />
<br />Microsoft might be making plans to leave behind WIN32 soon, as evidenced by the edition called Windows 10 S which only uses Store apps. 
<br />
<br />If you do decide to upgrade.,.
<br />
<br />Please be advised some users are reporting issues with the Windows 10 1709 update. Make sure you backup before attempting to upgrade:

            If you need new features, yes.
<br />
<br />Microsoft provides many options to get the latest feature upgrade manually. You can use any of:
<br />Upgrade assistant
<br />Media Creation Tool
<br />ISO File
<br />to get Fall Creators update right now. 
<br />You can use the following guide having detailed Instructions on how to upgrade to the latest Feature upgrade i.e. Fall Creators update using all the three methods:
<br />How to upgrade to Windows 10 Fall Creators update right now

<br />Media Creation tool has an Edge over the Upgrade assistant in my opinion as it offers a greater degree of flexibility of downloading and using the ISO file so that one can deploy it on multiple computers.

<h3> xenithpocknell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10, The Drive Where Windows is Installed is Locked, and other errors</h2>
                    <p>Okay, so, for the past few hours I have been scouting around for solutions to all of the problems that suddenly have risen from the depths of my computer, and I have yet to find an answer that resolves it. It's best I explain the whole story, as whilst I
 do know quite a bit about computers, I feel I have missed something, and in some cases just don't know what is happening entirely.</p>
<p><br />
This computer has been running fine, with no issues, for several months.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It all started when a file called SppExtComObjHook.dll (located in c:\Windows\Temp), which kept appearing as a virus according to AVG, so I thought 'this should be an easy fix, I'll consult the internet'. The internet told me (on one forum or another) to
 just create another txt file in notepad and call it SppExtComObjHook.dll, so that the original SppExtComObjHook.dll couldn't create itself on bootup (as even if I removed the file via AVG, it kept coming back every time I booted up). So I did that, but when
 I tried to save the txt file I created to c:\Windows\Temp, I got a message telling me I needed administrator privileges and to 'contact the administrator' for permission. I thought 'Well, this is a bit weird (and frustrating), as I am the only user on my PC,
 I'll consult the internet again'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, back to the internet. After about half an hour of searching, I came across a solution which said to change the ownership of the folders in question to my username (which would be my email for my Microsoft account). So, I went into 'This PC' and right
 clicked on the C: drive (which is where my operating system is installed, by the way). Went into properties &gt; advanced &gt; add (to add new permission). I then added my username, and gave me 'full control' of everything, weirdly the ownership of the entire C:
 drive was to something called TrustedInstaller (or TrustInstall, TrustedInstall, something like that) (I should also mention that I changed the properties of 'System', 'User' and 'Administrator' to 'Full control' too, just to be safe). It does it's thing,
 as expected, and then tells me (I cannot remember this word for word unfortunately) something along the lines of 'You have changed ownership of these files to you, these files need to be closed and reopened for the changes to take effect'. I took this to mean
 (probably because I'm a ****) that I should restart my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I restarted my computer, a pink/purple-y screen appeared, with a spinning circle. This continued, and continued, and showed no sign that anything was about to happen. I looked it up, and couldn't really find anything to match that description. I opened
 up my computer (after turning it off and on again a lot) and took out my other hard drive (D:\) which I use for spare storage space. Turns out that the computer was trying to find the operating system, and boot from the D:\ drive, which was very strange.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the D:\ drive unplugged, I turned the computer back on (I also messed around with the load order first, the same pink screen happened). And I get the message 'Please reboot and select proper boot device. Or insert installation media and press a key'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After restarting the computer, going into the bios and messing around the the boot order again, I decided to do as it said, and inserted the installation media (a CD).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>From there I have tried all of the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried clicking install &gt; custom installation &gt; select partition 4 (C:\ drive.) - I get the error 'Windows cannot be installed on this disk. The selected disk is of the GPT partition style'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried clicking 'Upgrade my PC' option aswell, this just tells me to restart my computer, and install it from my current operating system, which is no use obviously.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried going into 'repair my computer', and launching automatic repair. This did nothing, and gave me no log only a 'Automatic repair failed to repair your computer'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried going into 'Reset my PC' in 'Repair your computer. I obviously want to keep my files so I clicked that option, and got 'The drive where Windows is installed is locked. Unlock the drive and try again.'</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried running chkdsk c: /r - The first thing this told me was that the disk's 'Type of file system is NTFS' - which contradicts the earlier statement in custom installation that tells me 'the selected disk is of the GPT partition style'. It then ran its
 various checks. I did get a 'Windows has made correction to the file system. No further action is required.', but the problem still persists, and the only error that I could see was 'Failed to transfer logged messages to the event log with status 50.'</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then ran sfc /scannow, and got the message 'Windows resource protection could not perform the requested operation.'</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried running diskpart &gt; list disk &gt; select disk 0 &gt; list partition &gt; select partition 4 (which is the primary partition) &gt; active (to try making it the active partition' and all I got was 'The selected disk is not a fixed MBR disk. The ACTIVE command
 can only be used on fixed MBR disks'</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried hooking up the hard drive to another rig. All the files are where I left them, so the operating system is not gone completely. I removed the username I added in the permissions for that disk from the permissions list, in the hope that that would
 fix the problem (it did not).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's everything I have tried so far. I will continue to attempt any solution I can think of or find, but I am clueless as to the problem, or the solution, and am in desperate need of assistance. If anyone knows a solution to this, please let me know, thank
 you! :)</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can understand that must make you feel upset and we will work toward fixing this situation for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for mentioning the different steps you have tried to resolve the issue, we appreciate your effort.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you have an installation media, I suggest you to perform a system restore using the installation media to restore Windows back to an earlier point in time, called a restore point.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Connect the installation media you created to your PC, and then turn it on.</li><li>On the initial setup screen, enter your language and other preferences, and then select
<strong>Next</strong>. If you're not seeing the setup screen, your PC might not be set up to boot from a drive. Check your PC manufacturer's website for info on how to change your PC's boot order, and then try again.</li><li>Select <strong>Repair your computer</strong>.</li><li>On the <strong>Choose an option</strong> screen, select <strong>Troubleshoot &gt;
</strong><strong>Advanced options</strong> &gt; <strong>System Restore</strong>. </li></ol>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><em>Note: </em></span><span><span><em>When you use System Restore to restore the computer to a previous state, programs and updates that you installed after the restore point has been created will be&nbsp;removed.</em></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>Let us know the result, we will be glad to help if you need further assistance.</span></span></p>

            <p>Hello, thanks for replying!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did that exactly as you said, going to Repair your computer &gt; Choose an option &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced options &gt; System Restore, and got the following message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"To use System Restore, you must specify which Windows installation to restore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restart this computer, select an operating system, and then select System Restore."</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">There is no option for selecting an operating system when I restart, as it will either go to the initial setup screen (if the installation media disc is in) or goes to the "Please reboot and select proper boot device." screen (if
 disc is not in).</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">I am focused on why my hard drive is 'locked', as I believe that to be the main problem (as I said before, when I try an reset the computer and choose 'Keep my files' option, I get the message "The drive where Windows is installed
 is locked. Unlock the drive and try again.".&nbsp;</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Is there any way I can 'unlock' the drive? Not that I know how it got 'locked' in the first place (is this due to me changing the ownership? - which is concerning that I cannot own my own computer without it doing this.) As that
 might just resolve the whole issue, or at least allow me to reset my PC and keep all my files.</p>

            <p>I would like to add to the list of things I have tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried:</p>
<p>bootrec /scanos command - told me that a operating system does exist, where is should (C: drive).</p>
<p>
</p><p>bootrec /fixmbr command - all this did was tell me the operation completed successfully, not sure what that does though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>bootrec /fixboot command - same as above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>bootrec /rebuildbcd command - this came up with the Windows installation, and asked me to 'add installation to boot list? Yes(Y)/No(N)/All(A):', I entered Y for yes, and all that returned was "The requested system device cannot be found."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure if that is helpful or not, as I said before, I know a little of computers, but when it comes to the finer commands, I am not so knowledgeable.</p>

</p><p>This is a common issue on the web....wouldn't it be nice if Microsoft owned their mistakes &amp; fixed them? This, has been going on going back YEARS!!</p>

<p>It's 2018 and I cannot find a solution for this problem as of a few weeks ago I cannot save anything on my pc because the "hard drive is locked." Disappointing to say the list. Not sure what to do at this point...go back to windows 7??</p>

<p>Whenever I try to save anything (e.g., word docs, pictures, and downloads) I get an error&nbsp;message stating that&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;"Hard drive is locked."&nbsp; When I try saving work as an administrator&nbsp;I receive the same error message. My system is the

<p>I have tried every proposed solution to this but now I have given up trying to repair theproblem.</p>
<p>Data recovery is now the task:</p>
<p>use DISKPART&nbsp;in the dos window to shrink the damaged partition by the size of your data.</p>
<p>use diskpart to create a new primary partition </p>
<p>use diskpart to format the partition</p>
<p>use diskpart to allocate a drive letter to this new partition</p>
<p>exit diskpart</p>
<p>use xcopy /s /I /e to copy all the files in their correct directories to the new drive letter</p>
<p>then having xcopied all the files you want, allow system recovery to reinstall windows.</p>

<p>
<span>This can help with some (but not all) programs/drivers:
</span></p>
<p>
<span>1) Uninstall the program if it's already installed. Then when you install/reinstall it instead of double clicking on the install file right click it and select "Troubleshoot Compatibility"
</span></p>
<p>
<span>2) Then click "Try Recommended Settings" and in the next window click "Start the Program" to install it.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>3) After it installs see if it works correctly. Please note - some programs may not be able to run in Windows 7.

<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Were there any recent changes made on the computer prior to the issue?
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I will certainly help you out with this issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Let’s try these steps and update us with the results.</span></p>

<h3> bricked  say:</h3>
<h2>            I&#39;m stuck on the Windows 8 Lock Screen..</h2>
                    <ul>
<li>Last night my computer automatically updated, restarted, and then turned on again. After a couple of hours I decided it was time to shut it off. Today, I turn on my Samsung Series 7 Chronos and the keyboard and mouse become unresponsive on the lock screen.
 I'm able to use the keyboard as it starts up, because I'm able to enter Windows Boot Manager through F10. Nothing at Start Up Settings or UEFI Firmware Settings have helped. I've tried Safe Mode(same problem), Disabling Fast BIOS, Re-Enabling Fast Bios, I
 even plugged in an external mouse through usb. I don't know what to do. I can't re-install Windows 8 because I bought the laptop with Windows 8 pre-installed. What am I to do in the situation? I know almost EVERYONE has experienced these problems, why has
 this been a recurring issue for so many?&nbsp;</li></ul>
<b><u><br />
&nbsp;To sum things up...&nbsp;</u></b><br />
<ul>
<li>1. Safe Mode does nothing for me, because the keyboard and mouse are still both unresponsive.&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;2. I don't have Windows 8 Pro, so whatever convenience that is for some, is not to me.&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;3. I don't have an installation disk because Windows 8 was pre-installed.&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;4. I have no back up restore points because I hardly use the computer to get some sort of virus. Nor did I expect the problem to arise from an automatic update.&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;5. Samsung Series 7 Chronos Model 6235ANHMW</li></ul>

    <title>HP Stream 7 install of Windows 10 Problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> edward 12295  say:</h3>
<h2>            HP Stream 7 install of Windows 10 Problems</h2>
                    <p>I originally purchased a HP Stream 7 with Windows 8.1 at an Microsoft Store. When I received an icon to upgrade to Windows 10, I decided to take it back to the Microsoft Store to do the upgrade instead.&nbsp; I was told that I would&nbsp;NOT be able to go back to
 Windows 8.1 because of the limited memory on the device even though I have an option on Windows 10 to do so. My Windows 8.1 was not backed up according to the Microsoft Store technician.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(&nbsp;I am writing this post on my HP Stream 7 on Windows 10 now.&nbsp;)</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Here are two issues I have:</p>
<p>&nbsp;1)&nbsp; When I am in <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Desktop mode
</strong></span>the icons seems to&nbsp;be bigger.--- I have a desktop program that opens 5 windows in desktop mode. All the windows are bigger now. Big enough that many of the windows cannot fit on the screen. I checked&nbsp;my screen resolution and it is at max resolution
 of 1280 x 800 for the HP Stream. It seems like third party desktop software&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>EXCEPT</strong></span> for Microsoft Software runs at lower resolution&nbsp;resulting in bigger windows.&nbsp;Interestingly in
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Tablet mode </strong></span>the Windows look like they did in Windows 8.1 except that only ONE&nbsp;Window can be opened at one time an it&nbsp;is in Full Screen Only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I tried the Miracast function on 10. The cast images are slightly stretched horizontally at the resolution of 1280 x 800. In&nbsp;Windows 8.1 the proportions all good with the 1280 x 800 resolution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;These are possibly bugs in the new Windows 10 Program specific to the HP Stream 7 sold by Microsoft.</p>

            <p>
Before installing Windows 10 all data was cleared by the Microsoft store technician. I had already contacted HP technical support to update my graphic driver. There was no difference with an updated graphics driver. Are you suggesting I un-install the graphic
 driver and re-install the graphic driver??<br />
</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>
Yesterday I installed another Windows Desktop software and the screen looks normal like it did in Windows 8.1!!!&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
There is something different about Windows 10 destop I should also mention. The desktop program icons are bigger. It is as if Windows 10 is looking at the tablet screen size and guessing that it could be bigger for easier reading. &nbsp;Checking the graphic didplay
 shows I am at the highest resolution for the HP stream 7.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 upgrade crashes while computer is idle. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> crashoveride318  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade crashes while computer is idle.</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded my computer on 08/02/15 with the GWX app, and now when my computer is sitting idle, and only when it is idle, Windows crashes with the error message on the blue screen: "UNEXPECTED_STORE_EXCEPTION". I have been searching fruitlessly through forums
 and web sites for some kind of help. or a workaround for this. Most of the search results are related to the Windows Store app, but I am not sure if that is the culprit, as my computer only crashes when it is sitting idle. I have adjusted the power plan so
 that nothing hibernates or sleeps, and also, Windows is not writing any memory dumps, so I can't upload those for help. I have followed the instructions provided in the forum post here:
</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-power/windows-10-message-unexpectedstoreexception/fa302a16-4a69-4f82-9b26-6c4736783372?auth=1">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-power/windows-10-message-unexpectedstoreexception/fa302a16-4a69-4f82-9b26-6c4736783372?auth=1</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>But this did not work for me. I don't know what else to do. I don't want to reset Windows and have to spend the next week re-installing all of my programs if I can help it, but it may come down to that unfortunately. Any concrete help would be most appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE 08/24/2015:</p>
<p>After reading the post from [<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/ff41e132-98e3-4df5-af0f-4c6ed4601bf2" title="dragon0365">dragon0365</a>] I did the video test which kept my computer from crashing, abd I got to thinking about the things [<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/ff41e132-98e3-4df5-af0f-4c6ed4601bf2" title="dragon0365">dragon0365</a>]
 mentioned in the post and my own thoughts about Task Scheduler and decided to try something. What I did was this: Opened the Task Scheduler App (Search bar for Task Scheduler and open the app). In the left hand column of the window, I navigated to: Task Scheduler
 Library&gt;Microsoft&gt;Windows&gt;Defrag. When the Defrag folder is clicked, the scheduled tasks are listed in the center section. I right clicked on the "ScheduledDefrag" task and then clicked "Disable". I closed out the Task Scheduler, and then let my computer sit.
 After an hour and a half, my computer was still running, not crashing. So this may be a work around for this issue, but if anyone else wants to try it, your mileage may vary. I will let it go for a day or so to see if it works for the long term, then I'll
 try re-enabling the task again, just to make sure its not a fluke. I'll try to get back with another update by this Friday 08/28/2015.</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE 01/03/2016:</p>
<p>Just over 4 months now and I still get random crashes. Sometimes it will be fine for several days, and then all of a sudden the thing will start crashing every time I let it sit idle. I have found a sort of work-around which is to put it to sleep when I'm
 not going to use it for a while. When it starts crashing, I'll reboot it, then once it's loaded and I finish my work, I'll give it a clean shut down. Then after I boot it again and finish working, this time I'll put it to sleep. After a few sleep cycles, it
 seems to be fine again for a while. While this is not a fix, it does seem to straighten things out for a while. I need to figure out something as all of the continuous crashing has ruined my external hard drive that my backups were being stored on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, (kind of off topic here) it seems to me that this version of Windows is about as slow as Win2k was at getting you to a usable desktop. I have a SATA HDD, not a SSD, so my boot times are "real-world" not "enthusiast".</p>

            <p>I have a computer with the same problem and it had the problem with Windows 8.1 (see below) but not 7. I have a AMD 990FX chipset.
</p>
<p>The problem has to do with drivers for the SATA controller. In Windows 8.1 I would use the Microsoft Default drivers and they worked but if I used the drivers provided by AMD or the the make of the MOBO they would crash the system during idle. In Windows
 10 I have found that Microsoft is using a new driver so it is also crashing during idle time.
</p>
<p>Why does it crash during idle? Simple, Automatic Maintenance. During automatic maintenance the system does all sorts of stuff from defraging your hard drive to updating windows. Most of the time there really is not a problem and Windows can get past it but
 it blue screens just to be safe. In Windows 8.1 I could work around this by stopping the task but in Windows 10 they removed that and made it impossible to stop. Or I could change the setting for when the system could blue screen but in Windows 10 I cant change
 it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you would like to test, by default the system will start maintenance after being idle for 10min. Within the next 10-15min your system should crash.
</p>
<p>Now find a long video to play and make it full screen. For the duration of the video the system should not crash because Windows does not think it is idle. FYI, playing music will not work unless you have speakers that can shake the mouse.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To sum up this is a problem with most AMD chipsets drivers and Windows automatic maintenance and as of right now I have not found a work around for it. For me I found a place that looks like you can stop it (Control Panel &gt; Security and Maintenance) with
 a button "Stop Maintenance" but when I click on it nothing happens. </p>

            <p>Well, I did a test, and ran a video full screen for over an hour with no hiccup. So where do we go from here? Is this scheduled maintenance something that we can disable through the Task Scheduler? I know that the calls for the OS to perform something like
 that should reside there, I just don't know which task/tasks would be the ones to disable. There are so many listed, that just clicking off things could probably screw up the system even worse.<br />
</p>
<p>Some input from a Microsoft tech would really help here.</p>

            <p>In Windows 8.1 you could find it under Task Scheduler &gt; Task Scheduler Library &gt;&nbsp;Microsoft &gt; Windows &gt; TaskScheduler and the task was named Idle Maintenance.
</p>
<p>That seemed like a generic location so I am thinking in 10 they moved it to a new home. Just don't know where that home is. I think I may end up clicking each one to see if I can find the Idle Maintenance, if it is still named that.
</p>
<p>I also would like Microsoft to fix this. </p>

            <p>I never did find it in task scheduler but I thought what if I ran some of maintenance manually? So on August 23 I ran "Defragment and Optimize Drives" (from Control Panel &gt; Administrative Tools) manually on all of my hard drives. They all say OK, 0% fragment
 and the C drive has a 3 days since last run at the moment. I also ran Microsoft Updates but I was up to date but I wanted the time stamp.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that I let my system sit idle for 1 hour and no reboots. I have not had any crashes or reboots from that time. I suspect I will have to manually do it every 5 days to avoid it but I can handle that. I did not try it but you can if you want, there is
 a "Change settings" button and you can turn off running on a schedule which by default is weekly. That may be why I cant find it in task scheduler.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: CrashOveride318 did find the Defrag task in Task Scheduler (see first post). I think Microsoft did away with the "Idle Maintenance" they had in Windows 8.1.</p>

<h2>            Start menu resets to default by itself</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just got a brand new computer. Installed a couple of apps and stuff, everything is working fine. Except... Windows start menu will reset to it's default layout after each reset -- no matter what I do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea on how to fix it? Since I'm already traveling a "reinstall everything from scratch" wouldn't be so nice... Need to fix this for this particular user (mine).</p>
<p>

<p>&nbsp;You mean after each restart, right?&nbsp; Because if you're Resetting then everything is cleared.&nbsp;

<p>Is anybody else having issues getting their Lego Rock Band songs to export into Xbox One and be playable in Rock Band 4?&nbsp; I have been having nothing but trouble getting old purchased songs to&nbsp;export into RB4.&nbsp;&nbsp;The songs are on my Xbox 360, still work on
 the 360, but when I search for the songs&nbsp;on the Xbox One&nbsp;I can see them in the Xbox Store but am not given the option to download.&nbsp; I had the same issue with AC/DC as well as other RB Music store DLC.&nbsp; Many of the DLC songs I was able to just re-purchase.&nbsp;
 The AC/DC I was after months of trying finally able to get a code to export and have them working.&nbsp; I've even tried to re-purchase the songs but when I put the code in I just get an error message.&nbsp; Help!!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi, have you checked the ready to install list for the game ? you may be pleasantly surprised just what is sitting in there waiting for you to install.</p>
<p>On the Xbox go to My Games and Apps</p>
<p>Highlight Rockband 4 in the Games section and press the menu button on the controller</p>
<p>Select Manage game from the menu and check in the ready to install list.</p>
<p>Harmonix are still in the process of obtaining licenses for many of the original Rockband songs and release those tracks once they have the license so keep checking at intervals for other tracks you may have previously purchased or exported on the 360.</p>

<h2>            Copy only changed files &#40;new &#38; modified&#41; in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>How to Copy Only New Files and Changed Files to my backup USB to do a backup.&nbsp;</p>
<p>---- You could do this on Old DOS and Window before they fixed it in Windows 10 &nbsp;--- &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Her is the Situation:/Problem&nbsp;</p>
<p>I drag a bunch of folders to the destination (my (USB backup drive) and copying begins&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Then I get a window that says destination has files with the same name and asks if : &nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>1. I want to replace the files<br />
2. Skip these files<br />
3 let me decide what to do with each individual file&nbsp;<br />
<br />
BUT NOT&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>copy """"changed"""" &nbsp;files only - &nbsp;Remember that?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Window 10, &nbsp;in it's wisdom, &nbsp;no longer seems to have this option - &nbsp;even though the files still have dates and sizes.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>I used to be able to say copy ( or move) changed files only. &nbsp;bing, bang, bata boom &nbsp;and it's done. &nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Not any more.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Because of this I&nbsp;Must either: &nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>1 not save the updated files- even though they have been updated based on the new file date<br />
2 replace all of the files which is waste of time and resources (<strong>there are 3307 files that I copy)&nbsp;</strong><br />
or decide on each file what I want to do on 3307 files also a major waste of my time. That would take me days.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
On previous Windows and DOS &nbsp;you could copy changed files only. <br />
<br />
-----Where is that option &nbsp;in windows 10 operating system? --------</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can buy a simply program like copywiz to do that for $29 dollars or use the dos Xcopy at the command prompt but really? This is the best the new wonderful window 10 can do? &nbsp;Search hardly works and now the Copy command is pathetic too?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any idea what to do besides DOS or paid copy programs? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Also, &nbsp;how much longer will windows 7 be supported by Microsoft. &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>I ask because MS support is so willing to help that their people say go back to 7. I assume they have no interest in fixing this well know issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>That was a good program and I am considering going back. until windows 10 beta testing
 is done using all of us as </strong><strong>guinea pigs.</strong></p>

            <p>Thank you for this response. It's an interesting workaround and I will naturally take it under consideration even though it's a workaround that doesn't exactly fit my needs as a user and all of my circumstances. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know we can't have everything of course and if Microsoft wants to eliminate this method of copying, that has worked well all this time, &nbsp;they can do so. However, what I am still looking for is an answer to this question --&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How to make windows 10 work like older versions of windows and even as old as DOS 3 plus. by copying only changed files rather then &nbsp;wasting &nbsp;either my time making individual choices on 3000 plus files or wasting my resources copying all of the 3000 plus
 files. &nbsp;if having to use yet another work around to do what is so simple to in other older versions of window.s. I can use the proper DOS Xcopy commands at the command promt of course, but this is supposed to be the newest and the best so why would I use DOS
 to get the job done or have to use a workaround?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I only drive my 1929 ford for show not because I expect it to go 120 MPH in 5 seconds flat. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wold like the system to copy only changed files as an option when I copy or move a file to another drive or to my backup USB drive&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you by chance know how to make "that" work?</p>

            <p>Hi RoberttWin and thank you for your quick response to this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, this does no solve the problem because my version of window 10 appear to be different from yours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You say&nbsp;</p>
<p>Select&nbsp;<em>Let me decide for each file</em>&nbsp;and then in the File Conflict dialog choose the option to&nbsp;<em>Skip N files with the same date and size</em>:</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I chose &nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me decide I don't get that option: &nbsp;Hers is what I show.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/32721b30-f7c0-46be-91b4-2225b08c3614" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/32721b30-f7c0-46be-91b4-2225b08c3614" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Notice that my choice is to skip 0 files with same date and size out of ( in this case) 720 files although it shows 720 files with the same date and size. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know why that is. Do you know how to make it read the correct number?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also this give me a choice of which to keep if I copy the files. </p>
<p>Is it not true that If I am making a ---COPY --- elsewhere that I want to keep the original files? If however I din't want the originals to stay in place that I would --MOVE -- the files. &nbsp;Have he definitions of these words changed or is Microsoft now using
 offshore programmers who don't really understand the US language that well. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to keep both with the &nbsp;--- Same -- Name. &nbsp;If I want to copy why would they even ask?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I had the skip option on my windows 10 version your solution might work though - unless it renames the files which I don't want.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks - I hopefully await your reply&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Well I found other posts which I missed before. &nbsp; Here seems to be the problem as of Aug 31 2015 but not the answer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>No it doesn't work according to MS - and it has not been fixed in over one year. &nbsp;see below.&nbsp;</p>

Windows 10 - Copy and paste functionality in file explorer

</span></div>
<div>
<p>Each day, I copy a number of files from my office computer to my home computer as a back up. As I update these files in my office computer, I copy and replace the older versions on my computer at home.</p>
<p>When I did copy and replace in Windows 7, for each file name that was already existing in my home computer, Windows 7 would give me a message for copy and replace giving the date of file modified and label it as&nbsp;<strong><span>Newer.</span></strong>&nbsp;For
 all "newer" files, I would them accept the copy and replace function.</p>
<p>I found this functionality in Windows 7 extremely useful since it would protect me from&nbsp;<strong><span>accidental replacement of a newer version with an older version.</span></strong>&nbsp;Just by checking the "Newer" word in the prompt,
 I would click yes.</p>
<p>This functionality is missing in Windows 10. It only provides an option where I have to manually compare and determine the newer version, and I find this loss of functionality very irritating (it was so much easier when Windows 7 did the compare
 and labelled newer files). I can't understand why Microsoft removed this functionality.</p>
<p>I called Microsoft support but the only solution they gave me is to go back to Windows 7 (a suggestion that I found to be extreme).</p>
<p>Am I the only one missing this functionality? Is there a work-around for this?</p>
<p>Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated as I am missing this functionality - I use it everyday.</p>
<p>Is there any hope that Microsoft will add this functionality to Windows 10 in the future?</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>

</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>Notice that my choice is to skip 0 files with same date and size out of ( in this case) 720 files although it shows 720 files with the same date and size.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
1. I see 760 conflicting files. Where are you getting the 720 number from?<br />
<br />
2. You're wrong, the two sets of files <em>don't</em> have the same date and size. The files in K: are all newer than those in F:, as shown clearly by the fact that their dates are in
<strong>bold</strong> text. So even if the sizes match (since neither size text is in bold), the dates don't and so the files are not necessarily the same.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><br />
<em>Is it not true that If I am making a ---COPY --- elsewhere that I want to keep the original files? If however I din't want the originals to stay in place that I would --MOVE -- the files.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Who says the files in the original location i.e. F: won't be kept? The dialog is clearly asking whether in the target folder i.e. K:, you want to keep copies of the original set of files from F:, or you want to retain the new files already in K:.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>Have he definitions of these words changed or is Microsoft now using offshore programmers who don't really understand the US language that well.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>No offence, but just because you didn't understand the dialog doesn't mean others don't. I've been around the world enough to have met lots of foreigners who could speak English better and write both English and code better than their counterparts here.
 Personally, when I'm faced with genuine OS issues I couldn't care less about the background of the developers. They're MS employees, that's all I know, and so I want them to fix their damn mistakes wherever they are, be it America, China, Russia or Addis Ababa.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>I want to keep both with the&nbsp; --- Same -- Name.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can't keep both sets of files with the <em>same name</em> in the <em>same folder</em>. This has never been possible. All you can decide to do with the dialog above is, as I've already said, choose to keep the newer files in K: or overwrite them with
 the older ones from F: (or keep both versions in K: with the ones from F: being <em>
automatically </em><em>renamed</em>). The original files in F: will of course be left untouched since you're copying and not moving, exactly as you want.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>If I want to copy why would they even ask?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>They're asking because the file names are conflicting. Couldn't be simpler. Now you decide which version of the files you want ending up in K:.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With a multi-file copy/move Win10 doesn't prompt you for each file whether it is newer or older than the one with the same name in the target folder. Instead it shows you a dialog where it highlights which file in each pair is newer, and which file in each
 pair is bigger. If you select both of a pair then it will rename the file being copied so both versions can co-exist in the target folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now is the current implementation perfect? Of course not. For example see the following case:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d70259e5-15bb-4141-940f-2572de0059a8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d70259e5-15bb-4141-940f-2572de0059a8" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see the Source versions of Files 1 &amp; 3 are newer, but the Target versions of Files 2 &amp; 4 are newer. Now what if one wants to end up with only the newer files in the Target folder (i.e. copy Files 1 &amp; 3 from Source but leave Files 2 &amp; 4 untouched
 in the Target)? Currently there's only a Select All checkbox for each column, so one would have to manually select Files 1 &amp; 3 from the first column and Files 2 &amp; 4 from the second. This is obviously impossible when one has hundreds of files in each column
 to select.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead if they had options like i) Select only the newer files, ii) Select only the older files, iii) Select only the smaller files and iv) Select only the bigger files, then IMO the dialog would be far more useful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: Here are the XP and Win7 file conflict dialogs:</p>

<p>As can be seen from an earlier post above the dialogue box shows the same files with the same name, the same date but a time 1 or 2 secs more than the original file. This causes the "Skip files with the same date and size" to be greyed out and unavailable.
 I can reproduce this every time using various USB memory sticks BUT this does not happen using a USB hard drive. Has anyone else found this and is there a solution?</p>

<p>I have reverted to DOS batch file commands to copy only files that have changed, or new file date, to USB memory stick/ external hard drives.</p>
<p>DOS command; Xcopy /s/d/y copies all files and subfolders with a filter for only&nbsp;new files, &nbsp;changed files, and updated files.What used to take 45 minutes &nbsp;to simply copy everything (26,000files 40Gig) &nbsp;now only takes 40 seconds as it only updates the files
 that have changed.</p>
<p>I assume sometime in the future Win10 will get a full blown overhaul of "file copy", until then use this "Batch file" e.g I&nbsp;call it Filebak.bat</p>
<p>Using Notebook write out the text below,&nbsp;save, and rename file&nbsp;extension to Filebak.bat as opposed Filebak&nbsp;.txt.</p>
<p>Then everytime you want to copy any changes or new files just click the Filebak.bat file and all done in seconds to a Memory stick on D: drive, or any other drive-hardisk.</p>
<p>It also creates a Log file with date and time,&nbsp;so that there is a permanent log of what was copied, when.</p>
<p>My user folder is called "john-" so that need changing to your own user name.</p>
<p>contents of Filebak.bat;</p>
<p>dir D:\<br />
Dir D:\ &gt;&gt;&nbsp; C:\Users\john-\Documents\XDocsLog.txt<br />
rem This copies the DOCS folder. Ctrl C to exit. (40secs for 40Gig 3.6Hz I7 Win10)&nbsp;<br />
PAUSE<br />

<br />
more &lt; C:\Users\john-\Documents\XDocsLog.txt&nbsp; <br />
PAUSE<br />
Exit</p>
<p>
</p><p>To customise;Right click the .bat file to edit, and customise the folder names of source Xcopy copies from, and destination to where copied to.</p>
<p>"&gt;&gt;" redirects output to a Logfile. and "more" outputs that Logfile to the screen with information as to&nbsp;how many new, and changed files copied.</p>
<p>I have tried Powershell method&nbsp;but too complicated for a simple backup system.</p>
<p>I will have a look at SyncToy as suggested</p>
<p>Indeed all Microsoft-WIN10 programmers&nbsp;have to do is use the DOS commands as above in a user friendly application using file explorer (copy-cut and paste),&nbsp;as a one button solution to backing up new, and changed files.</p>

<p>Yes Win10 file copy system has a bug that lists exactly the same files but with 1 second difference in date-time so forcing files to be copied that are&nbsp;exactly the same. I gave up and use XCOPY see my other post below. Eventually Microsoft will have to address
 a significant issue as&nbsp;this goes to the heart of Win10 - File Explorer and file manipulation. Until then use DOS commands-simple-effective and the way it copies I assume&nbsp;is a more an exact copy than using "Copy", aswell as &nbsp;"Robocopy"&nbsp; which enters into detailed
 filter parameters that&nbsp;defeats the simplicity of Xcopy in an editable-cutomisable batch file.</p>
<p>I await a Microsoft update that addresses programming bugs in file time stamp, and a File Explorer&nbsp;cut -paste-copy program that is simple and effective in backing up new, and changed files.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>What
 exactly happens when you try to set the screen saver? Do you get an error message?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Were
 you able to set a screen saver before on the system?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Who
 is the manufacturer of your graphics card and what is the model?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Which
 edition of Windows 7 do you use?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Have
 you downloaded the latest drivers for the graphics card from the manufacturer’s website?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>What
 type of screen saver are you trying to set?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>It might be that the screen saver is not supported by your video card, check with the manufacturer of the graphic card.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Check video&nbsp;performance ratings, follow the steps mentioned below.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click
 on Start menu and click on Control panel.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click
 on system and check in Performance information tools what is the rating for your graphics card.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For further reference check the article mentioned below.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>I would suggest you to uninstall the graphics card driver that is installed on the system along with the software and then download the drivers from the
 manufacturer’s website and install it on the system. Check the article mentioned below.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly</span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 3:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Apply the hot fix that is present in the article given below and check.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Error message when you set the screen saver to a 3D screen saver in Windows 7 or in Windows Server 2008 R2: "The screen saver can't run because it
 requires a newer video card or one that's compatible with Direct3D" </span></span></strong></p>
