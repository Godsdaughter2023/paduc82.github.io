<h2>            getting a &#34;this location may be unsafe&#34; warning in onenote with created or edited files</h2>
                    Hi all,<br />
<br />
I'm running into a problem with onenote.<br />
<br />
When I create a file (doc, docx, pdf,..., filetype doesn't matter) linking to it in Onenote consistently gives a "Microsoft Office has detected a potential concern. This location may be unsafe" warning<br />
When I download a file and link to it in Microsoft Onenote, everything works fine.<br />
However, when I subsequently edit the downloaded file, the warning pops up. The original file got no such warning.<br />
<br />
I tried the "DisableHyperlinkWarning"= 1 registry setting, to no avail.<br />
<br />
I'm probably missing something, suggestions would be appreciated!<br />
<br />
thanks, Rolf<br />

            Problem solved.<br />
<br />
possible causes:<br />
This computer had office 2007 installed before.<br />
I recently installed Office 2013, but deleted it (due to general ugliness, I'll try again with Office 2015),
<br />
resulting in several office-trees in the registry. <br />
<br />
solution:<br />
I deleted the office/12.0 and office/15.0 trees<br />
I searched for and deleted all DisableHyperlinkWarning = 1 entries EXCEPT for:<br />
<br />
/HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Common\Security<br />

<h2>            Duplicating  emails when moved to another folder</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I recently starting using Office 365 on a mac. I have outlook and set up my email through this (IMAP). Everything was working fine until earlier today when I noticed that emails I was moving into other folders (subfolders under my main account) were duplicating.
 It's very frustrating! I've tried some of the tips online, such as removing rules (which I had none) etc., and completely stumped - please help!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Id rather not delete and re-add my account, in case of any email loss...? Unless this is being silly and doing that will be fine!</p>
<p>If I need to provide more info please let me know.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>Lauren&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Lauren,</p>
<p>Since you’ve encountered a duplicating emails issue, I’d suggest you try the following suggestions for troubleshooting:</p>
<p>a) Try empty the cache of the inbox folder.Right click your inbox in the folder list and choose Properties &gt; Empty Cache.</p>
<p>b) Another option is to select the inbox and select “Synchronize Now”</p>
<p>If the 2 suggestions don’t work, to troubleshoot the issue further, I’d like to confirm some information:</p>
<p>1. Regarding “I recently starting using Office 365 on Mac”, do you mean you are using Outlook for Mac client to send and receive emails? If so, which version of Outlook for Mac you’re using, Outlook for Mac 2011 or 2016?</p>
<p>2. About “I have Outlook and set up my email through this (IMAP)”, did you set up an Office 365 account or an IMAP account (non-Office 365 account) into the Outlook for Mac client?</p>
<p>3. To determine whether the issue is client side issue or not, would you mind trying to set up the mail account in to another Mac machine’s Outlook for Mac client to see if any progress can be made?</p>
<p>Thanks for your time and efforts.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Mouran</p>

<p>- I downloaded office 365 and use outlook. I have a mac therefore it downloaded the 'mac' version. I downloaded it from Microsoft's website so the latest version i assume.</p>
<p>2. About “I have Outlook and set up my email through this (IMAP)”, did you set up an Office 365 account or an IMAP account (non-Office 365 account) into the Outlook for Mac client?</p>
<p>- It's a non-office 365 account. I used IMAP to set it up.</p>
<p>3. To determine whether the issue is client side issue or not, would you mind trying to set up the mail account in to another Mac machine’s Outlook for Mac client to see if any progress can be made?</p>

<p>Hi Lauren,</p>
<p>Since you’ve set up a non-Office 365 account into the Outlook for Mac client, to narrow down the issue further, I’d like to confirm some more information:<br />
1.&nbsp;Regarding “Everything was working fine until earlier today when I noticed that emails I was moving into other folders (subfolders under my main account) were duplicating”, how did you move the emails to other folders?<br />
2.&nbsp;If you moved the emails to other folders by creating a client side rule, did you check if the “<strong>Do not apply other rules to the messages that meet the same conditions</strong>” option is checked or not?<br />
3.&nbsp;Could you please try setting up another IMAP account into your Outlook for Mac client to see if the same issue occurs?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

<p>Hi Lauren,</p>
<p>Could you please provide the information mentioned above? And Did you try to set up another IMAP account into your Outlook for mac?</p>
<p>Since it worked after you emptied the cache and synchronized the inbox, it may be caused by the damaged profiles/identities.<br />

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>Apologies for my delayed reply:</p>
<p>1. Regarding “Everything was working fine until earlier today when I noticed that emails I was moving into other folders (subfolders under my main account) were duplicating”, how did you move the emails to other folders?</p>
<p>- I simply dragged them from inbox and dropped them into the folder.</p>
<p>2. If you moved the emails to other folders by creating a client side rule, did you check if the “Do not apply other rules to the messages that meet the same conditions” option is checked or not?</p>
<p>- No I did not use rules. When I checked there are no rules.</p>
<p>3. Could you please try setting up another IMAP account into your Outlook for Mac client to see if the same issue occurs?</p>
<p>- I have another account (info@ account) using IMAP that I have on Outlook for &nbsp;Mac and sent emails to that, dragged in folder etc. to see if the same thing occurred. And yes, it occurs for this too! So it duplicates and marks as 'unread'. Why is it doing
 this to this mail account also..? </p>

<p>Hi Lauren,</p>
<p>1.I'd rather not delete the email accounts and re-add them if possible... will that delete any of my emails?
<br />
&nbsp; -If you have backed up your email data on premise, the answer is no.</p>
<p>Since your another account using IMAP encountered the same issue, the root cause may be the damaged profiles/identities.</p>
<p>May I know whether you have tired the steps about re-creating the Outlook profile? If yes, please let me know the results.
<br />
If it doesn’t work, I’d like to confirm the information as follows:</p>
<p>1. The version of Outlook for mac you’re using.<br />
2. What kind of the emails you were moving, the emails which already in your inbox or you searched? Can you provide more detailed information?</p>
<p>Any updates will be appreciated.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Lance</p>

<p>Sorry, how do I go about re-creating the Outlook profile ? It was set up externally by someone at the company I work for, so would I have to ask them? I don't want to cause any issues, especially as others within the organisation have had no problems!
</p>
<p>The version of Outlook Mac: 15.18</p>
<p>I'd receive an email, I'd read it (also happens when I dont read it) and drag into a folder. I may also categorise it as well (with flag/colours). So I do not search for anything, I just drag it into a specific folder to help me categorise my emails. Essentially
 all I wanted to do was keep my emails in an organised manner in different folders, but they keep duplicating! Then when I delete the duplicate, this too duplicates in the trash can, which is very frustrating as I receive many emails every day.</p>
<p>Many Thanks</p>

<h2>            Installed Microsoft Office 2016 without Access now need Access</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I had purchased Access 2013 for my computer about 4 months ago. I had no problem installing it onto my pc with Office 2010, Windows 7 (love that OS) That pc is about 6 years old so I decided to buy another pc.</p>
<p>Now I have a new pc with Windows 10. I bought Office Home &amp; Student which does not have Access.</p>
<p>I tried to install my Access disk into Windows 10 &nbsp;and received a message saying that I had already installed Office and that I should remove it before installing. The Access program is a program by itself, but apparently I am unable to add it to &nbsp;my Office
 Home &amp; Student 2016. (for 1 Windows PC)</p>
<p>Is there some way possible that I can have it installed together?</p>
<p>Or do I need to buy another program that includes everything?</p>
<p>Thank you&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Nokia C1-01 Audio issue</h2>
                    <p>Hello!<br />
</p>
<p>A few days ago, my Nokia C1-01 accidentally fell to the ground and since then the speakers nor the vibrating alert has been working at all. (The phone works fine otherwise and it doesn't seem to be any exterior damage to it.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can listen to music and answer phone calls when I have headphones connected to it though, but I'm wondering if there's any way to fix this issue? I've had issues with the vibrating alert before (sometimes it works, other times it doesn't) but never with
 the speakers, which is troublesome since I can't hear incoming calls or text messages at all now.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had this phone for about 6 years and it has worked really well up till now, so I would like to know if there is any possibility to fix this. I am aware that it is an old model and that it might be difficult to do anything, but I just thought I would
 ask here just in case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>//Benny</p>

<h2>            Excel 2010 crashes when changing number format on a graph</h2>
                    We have a problem with Excel 2010 crashing when you are trying to change the number formatting on a graph axis. Some computers in our company have the problem and some dont, which makes the problem even more annoying. When you change date formatting, excel
 crashes, goes unresponsive or refuses to save due "lack of resources" even there are plenty available. This happens especially when the original axis data has both date and time in it, which in this case is logger information.
<br />

            Finally found a solution to this problem! These computers had "Office 2007 Compatibility pack" installed, because they had had 2003 Office earlier. Uninstalling it solved the problem! None of the suggestions mentioned in the Deepa Raj's answer did nothing.

            Hi jklsdfjlkjslk
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />Use below method to uninstall and install Skype to solve this problem.
<br />
<br />CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to invoke Task Manager &gt; Kill any instance of Skype.exe
<br />
<br />A. If this is UWP (Microsoft Store) Skype app of Windows - Windows Key+i &gt; Apps &gt; Click Skype and Uninstall
<br />Install Skype again from Microsoft Store. You can install from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDNCRFJ364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDN...</a>
<br />
<br />If above doesn't work -
<br />
<br />Choose to install desktop client of Skype from and use Skype for Desktop <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />B. If this is Skype for Desktop client 
<br />Copy the below line and Windows Key+R and paste into Run window by CTRL+V and Enter
<br />%appdata%\microsoft\Skype for Desktop
<br />Rename this folder also to something say Skype for Desktop_Old
<br />Reinstall Skype again from <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

                    <p>[Excel 2003 SP3 ver]</p>
<p>It used to work fine (double-cliking creates a new book) until a couple weeks ago&nbsp;but now it opens the template if you double-click a template file.</p>
<p>I checked [Tools - Folder Options - File Types] and "New" is highlighted for "Excel 97-2003 Template." So the problem comes from something else.</p>

<p>The following procedure fixed mine:&nbsp; Take out battery - use a very clean cotton cloth slightly damp with alcohol or contact cleaner&nbsp;- clean the back of the phone under the battery. There are several copper circuits in this area and&nbsp; a dirty thumb print can
 short out the circuit. No joke - worked for me.</p>

This is an error I get creating a notebook:</p>

            Hi Damien86uk,<br />
<br />
I would suggest you follow the steps below and check the issue again:<br />
<br />
1. From the screenshot, there is a folder named <strong>^.Documents</strong>, if so, please go to your OneDrive library and rename the folder to avoid using any non-standard characters.<br />
<br />
2. In your OneNote app, sign out of your account.<br />
<br />
3. Go to <em>Control Panel\User Accounts\Credential Manager</em>, click <em>Windows Credentials</em>, remove all Microsoft related credentials.<br />
<br />
4. Go to your OneNote app, sign in with your account and check the issue again.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
James

<h2>            Outlook crashes on replying&#47;composing messages</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10</p>
<p>Outlook 2016 (Part of Office365)</p>
<p>Everything was working fine until today. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Now everytime I click on COMPOSE email, or REPLY, Outlook freezes, then crashes.</p>
<p>Anyone have any idea or have similar issue?</p>

            <p>1.&nbsp; Did try the safe mode but same problem occurs</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Did try uninstalling everything except Office 365 but still same problem. Laptop is an HP 15" Laptop from Costco, purchased 3 weeks ago, so not much was on it to begin with.&nbsp;&nbsp; Only thing I have installed were ADOBE READER, 7ZIP, PRINTER SOFTWARE from
 HP, and Google Apps Sync.</p>
<p>3. Created a new Outlook profile, did not add Google Apps account, but a regular POP3 account.&nbsp; Still did not allow me to compose email</p>
<p>
</p><p>SOLUTION:</p>
<p>No matter what I did, Outlook was not allowing me to compose email or reply (it freezes with NOT RESPONDING message at the tile, then it crashes).</p>
<p>So, I simply decided to start over as only thing that I can suspect was the user profile corruption (or that I have no other idea of).&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Once factory wiped, went through the wizard, then created a new user instead of using the user created via wizard.&nbsp; Then installed Office 365, tested it, worked perfectly.&nbsp; Do not know how long it will work as the previously the system worked for a month.&nbsp;
 But for now, only solution was to create a new user account on the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>The only way I can think of is to use a special FONT, if you could find it, &nbsp;and then I suppose it would be TEXT just for appearance, rather than a real number.</p>

<p>Chuck,</p>
<p>Thanks for your response to my question.&nbsp; Do you know what font would be best to try?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am a teacher who often types fractions on worksheets, quizzes, and tests.&nbsp; Students seem to understand problems and correctly solve them more often when the fractions are written vertically rather than horizontally.&nbsp; Also, I was hoping that it would be
 easier and quicker to type fractions in one cell vertically rather than in two cells (which is what I am doing now), if typing them vertically in one cell was possible.</p>
<p>I appreciate your help.</p>

<p>I know of no appropriate font offhand.........I would just Google it.&nbsp; As for the students "solving the problems easier"......I assume that you are talking about word problems or printed test papers rather than doing math on the cells with the "fraction
 font" in them, cause that won't work........unless it's really a special type font that I never heard about, the fraction font is just TEXT, not a number.</p>
<p>One way in Excel is you could type 1--2 in a cell and format the cell with Wordwrap and narrow the column width and you will get the fraction 1/2 vertically looking sorta......but remember, it is NOT a number.&nbsp; Then you can change the font size of the adjacent
 cell for the whole number part.............about as much trouble as using two cells for your vertical fraction........</p>
<p>sorry, not much help here......this is kinda out of Excel's bailywick.......you might could insert "Images of fractions" is you are only wanting a printout.</p>

            Or, if you use a tablet PC, just write the equation on the screen!&nbsp; I do that, not while teaching fractions but with management principles for healthcare executives, and it's a very powerful and effective interactive tool.

<br />
Thanks for your quick response.<br />

Ok, I now understand the part you addressed but what I don't understand is what I ask in my question above.<br />
<br />
<br />
After doing the outlining and collapse to hide the details, then later when I then do a

How can we do a sort of the main titles in the 1st column without scrambling all of the hidden details<span style="font-weight: bold">??<br />

    <title>N96 - A bitter disappointment all round. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> iannicholson---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            N96 - A bitter disappointment all round.</h2>
                    I just upgraded from my trusty N80 to an N96. I cannot begin to tell you how bitterly disappointed I am with this phone.<br />
<br />
Two years on, Nokia have once again been able to take 10 steps forward and 25 steps back. Here are my findings so far...<br />
<br />
1) The speed. This phone is slow. Believe it or not, but it actually seems slower than the N80. I did not think this would be possible.<br />
<br />
2) Voice dialling. ABYSMAL! The N80 would work in almost any situation. The N96 demands complete background silence to even BEGIN to come close. Nokia - go back to the drawing board. This feature, which to me, a busy rep on the road (in the car) is VITAL AND
 IT DOES NOT WORK! When you hold down the right function button, it SOMETIMES registers it MOSTLY does not. When it does, it plays the little bleep, but then 3-4 seconds AFTER does the prompt come up on the screen telling you to speak. What kind of **bleep**
 is this? By the time the prompt comes up, you've already said the name, but the phone missed it! WHY NOT PLAY THE BEEPS WHEN THE PHONE IS READY TO LISTEN?!?!!? This is proof that this phone was tested by idiots or school-leavers without a clue. Or both.<br />
<br />
3) My TomTom software will not install. Well, it says it installs, but does not put an icon anywhere for me to find it. If I'm paying $1000+ for a phone that supposedly has GPS, I do NOT expect to have to pay MORE to be able to use it. Once again, Nokia, you
 are **bleep** customers off.<br />
<br />
4) The headset. I want a NORMAL headset. One earpiece. Microphone close to my mouth so PEOPLE CAN HEAR ME. Not some trendy stereo thing with a microphone that is at my WAIST when I'm driving. USELESS NOKIA, USELESS!!<br />
<br />
5) DVB-H. Nokia make a big point in the marketing of this phone, but guess what? NOBODY USES IT! No-one transmits DVB-H and so a flip out cup holder would be more useful on this phone.<br />
<br />
6) Phone Switch. This is allegedly a function that allows you to transfer all you settings from your old phone to the new phone. Guess what? It doesn't work. Not at all. Nope. USELESS!<br />
<br />
7) The slide. My old N80 used to hang up the call when you closed the slide. Not so the N96. In fact, it just keeps the call going. Is this a feature you can set/adjust? I don't know. The manual doesn't say.<br />
<br />
8) Auto-rotate. This feature is as bad as it is annoying. Nokia have obviously gone with a cheap mercury gravity switch rather than use acceleration detectors, which this feature, when turned on, annoying rotates the screen if you accidently hold the phone
 the wrong way. Because the processor is so abysmally SLOW in this phone, it takes ages to rotate and re-orient the screen again after. Sometimes, it takes a VERY long time for it to realise you're actually holding the phone upright again. Back to the drawing
 board, Nokia.<br />
<br />
9) Navi-Wheel. It's in the MENU but not on the PHONE! Obviously a feature they DID test and realised it was so bad, they took it out. Well, almost.<br />
<br />
10) Speakers. Horrible and tinny. Even the N80 sounds louder and bolder with a lot more bass.<br />
<br />
I think it is utterly disgraceful that Nokia pushes this phone on to unsuspecting customers and expect them to do their testing for them. Right now, for two pins I'd send this piece of **bleep** right back and go with an Apple iPhone (which was offered to me
 in the first place by Optus), but foolishly, I kept my brand loyalty and stuck with Nokia.<br />
<br />
Time, and Nokia's reaction to this, will tell how big a fool I possibly am.

<br />
This is a user-to-user forum so you won´t get any replies from Nokia here :(<br />
Im sure someone here can be of assistance, they are all very helpful and skilled.<br />
<br />
I have a N-95 and i love it, it took me some time to get used to it but now i will completely wear it out before getting another phone!<br />

I just want to point out that maybe you´re using the headset not properly. The loop within the cable of the headset is supposed to go around your head. That way the microphone won´t be at your waist...<br />
<br />
Give it a try! :)

            I have also recently upgraded from having my n80 headset for over 2 years to the n96, and the differences are small, but big enough if you notice them.<br />
<br />
Yes the phone is not really a upgrade but a side grade from the n80, i was desperate to upgrade as i have my peers upgrade phones all the time, but i was yet stuck with a old, but yet reliable, n80.<br />
<br />
Okay, to answer your questions,<br />
Yes the phone has problems and yes you will get used to the triviality once you experience the other features the n96 becomes miles away from the n80.<br />
<br />
Speed<br />
1) speed, it is slow in comparison to the other nokias that are currently out, but it is still quicker than the n80 in in some respects (such as file management and menu speed)<br />
<br />
Voice dialling<br />
2) yes the voice dial is not as cleaver as the n80 in my opinion, but you need to remember that you once trained your voice, im sure it will get better with time (you can configure it responds to you, so you dont have to confirm your commands)<br />
<br />
Tomtom<br />
3) i have had tomtom mobile/navigator v6 on my old n80 and i just copied the files across to the mass storage, and wam bam it was installed (Although the current v11 firmware has a terrible lag while on the menus) but the v12 firmware for the n96 fixes it and
 its back in full swing, no it wont work with the built in GPS, but that is currently tomtom's fault for not updating their application for over two years.<br />
<br />
Headset<br />
4) The headset i took out of the box and it was instantly forgotten, but dont forget you dont have to buy a nokia headset now you have the 3.5mm jack.<br />
<br />
Digital live TV<br />
5) im as annoyed as you, i think its classed as false advertisement somewhere, but did you ever have the ability of bbc i player on your old handset and the ability to output it to a TV (PAL or NTSC) or watch high quality converted videos on a large 2.8" screen.<br />
<br />
6) use pc suite and backup your n80 then restore it to your n96. your being a bit nieve trying to get all the settings across, if i remember correctly i had to transfer the settings between handsets one by one, until it completed, as one made the application
 hang or something.<br />
<br />
Slider<br />
7) did you not ever get annoyed with using the numeric keypad within a call (and you slide it open) and accidentally sliding it just below the 1,2,3 buttons ending the call, as i got frustrated many of times.<br />
<br />
There is an application for the n95 that does the same as this, i believe it is compatible with the n96, but i dont know why there is no option with it in the menu.<br />
<br />
Auto rotate<br />
8) that lasted about five seconds before it would me up<br />
but the fancy thing is that your photographs that you take are not only GPS tagged, but are autoroated as the phone knew what orientation the photos where taken in.<br />
<br />
9) Navi wheel: lets not get started on that one, im really disappointed with nokia too (and with the overall plastic feel of the handset)<br />
<br />
10) if you think the n80 speakers are clearer and louder than the n96 then you have got some settings wrong (turn off 3d tones)<br />
<br />
I am justifying why the n96 is more superior as a whole, but the n96 does have a handful of problems that might wind any upgrader from a near perfect handset. the feature set of the n96 is far superior than the n80 (play with your n96 and only your n96 for
 a week, then go back to the n80 and see how much the screen size alone makes a difference)<br />
<br />
Yes nokia have made a handset that could do it all, but nokia have actually made a handset that could do it, when it wants to work (or in it's own time).<br />
<br />
Im sticking with my n96 after being more than satisfied with my n80ie and yes i was a 'application geek' where everything that was compatible with my n80 was on my n80 as i wanted all features and whatnot. the n96 provides the same opportunities, but a whole
 new league.<br />
<br />
I did not intend for this post to feel like a review, but i felt like what 'iannicholson' is saying only a few weeks ago.<br />
<br />
Once you get the v12 firmware, you start to see why you chose this handset over the alternates handset.<br />

            Hi Tony,<br />
<br />
Thanks for a very good and detailed reply. Where can I get the v.12 upgrade? It doesn't seem to be available via the Australian website. Also, where can I find out which version firmware I have? It doesn't appear in the 'About' app (where one would expect it
 to).<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
<br />
<br />

            My local nokia store had it,<br />
they stated that it would become mainstream (for generic product codes only) in the near future.<br />
<br />
yet to find a bug, but im not using all the phone's features like i used to. ive managed to just skip to the stage in a mobile's life where i accept its problems and wait for th contract to expire, or imagine how the next nokia will be for the new children
 of the century.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hold on with the v12, nokia have blatantly found problems with it and are preparing a minor update or something to ensure it is released with best intentions and whatnot.<br />
<br />
Just hold out, you will see the n96't true potential (compared to the n80)<br />
<br />
and relating to the transfer between phones, you do need to do it one by one, or it will fail (i remember now)<br />
<br />

            Thanks for the replies everyone.<br />
<br />
To add insult to injury, I'm stuck on firmware version 10.065 because, according to Nokia, Optus (my service provider) has not 'approved' any software releases beyond that. I called Optus and spoke to a really helpful tech guy who offered to unlock my phone
 if that helped me get the latest version. But, according to Nokia, that won't solve the problem because the serial number is checked during the update process. Locked or not, I cannot simply upgrade my firmware without Optus/Nokia's say-so.<br />
<br />
What kind of totalitarian **bleep** is this?!<br />
<br />
Once more, Nokia shows how they can move 10 steps forward and 25 steps back. The Software Updater feature is USELESS to me. The only way I can get a firmware upgrade is to take the phone to Nokia, who will take 48 hours to do the upgrade.<br />
<br />
What a useless bunch of tarts this organisation is!

            Hi Everyone.<br />
<br />
Thanks to all those who gave such positive replies, but after another two weeks of struggling to get this phone upgraded by Nokia, I'm giving up.<br />
<br />
Nokia's customer service has been thoroughly non-existent and have show nothing but totally apathy and disregard to my issues with this phone.<br />
<br />
All they want me to do is take the phone in and leave it with them for two days. Why? So they can upgrade the firmware. A feature I SHOULD be able to do over the internet, but cannot (because, apparently, Optus must 'approve' the new firmware, but no-one at
 Nokia it seems to have told Optus that!).<br />
<br />
So, I called Optus today - the phone is going back. And good riddance!<br />
<br />
Goodbye **bleep** voice-dialling.<br />
Goodbye non-existent DVB-H TV...<br />
Goodbye **bleep**, SLOW user interface...<br />
Goodbye (optionally extra and expensive) GPS...<br />
Goodbye lousy, constantly rebooting OS...<br />
<br />
My thoughts and well-wishes are for all you poor sods who decided to keep struggling with this piece of **bleep**.<br />
<br />
GOODBYE NOKIA! After nearly 20 years, I think I've shown more loyalty than you ever showed me. I doubt I'll be back.

            Ian like you I have been a client of both Nokia and Optus since April 1994. The service (or lack thereof ) by both companies is appalling. I am also jumping ship but not until the new year when the handset I want is released. Unfortunately the only telco
 handling this phone that I want is Telstra. And we all know what Telstra is like.<br />
As I have already said Nokia have lost the plot as well as loosing customers. Unfortunately a customer lost is one that you rarely get back. Perhaps one day when the Nokia heads pull their collective heads out of the sand they might understand. By then it will
 be too late.

            I understand where both of you are coming from when in (in my opinion/)reality its Optus's fault, hear me out.<br />
<br />
If Optus is incapable of developing firmware to its customers within a acceptable time-scale, then they should consider sending out unbranded handsets (i dont mean unlocked, just handsets that are generic and can be updated). Or just not making changes and
 forwarding the firmware send to them back at nokia to publish on their site.<br />
<br />
It is by no means solely Optus that has to take the burden for this, as you have decided to go for a handset made by nokia that costs over £500, nokia should do everything under the sun to make customers feel as though they are getting a* service.<br />
<br />
Nokia are also at fault in some way for false advertisement (yes that is a big hit there), digital mobile TV is not current within england, and wont be for a few years to come, the only get out clause they managed to pluck is the inclusion of BBCI player (a
 uk tv catch up service over the air or wifi)<br />
<br />
Furthermore, what was nokia's game in giving this handset a premature birth that restarts more times than a skipping scratched CD. and this is no ordernary cd, this is ment to be a forever lasting scratch proof version that you paid all this money to get 5
 minutes use out of before it decides to miss a track and restart by itself.<br />
<br />
There are alternatives out there, but wherever you look you will see the same thing as here and reality will come crashing down when you realise you cant get out of that contract... contracts that include handsets will be most likely have firmware locked to
 that network, at least with nokias there is the possibility of getting that changed for the cost of the warranty, but yes, i should not be backing up nokia's decisions to allow mobile phone developers to tinker with their firmware and sit on it for a long
 time, i am stating that it is your handset, and nokia should at least allow you to choose if you want to have the networks features installed and tweaks applied, as im sure you can make a call regardless if they have the Optus style themes on board or not.
 and while they are at making the abilities to chose what software you want installed they can develop a battery that charges when you talk, and an attachment that tucks you in bed at night or even a handset that does [[NOT]] use the paying public as a beta
 tester!<br />
<br />
But until then, if you want a phone better than the n96 and you cant get an inno8, i would stick by my n96 as my contract with three video mobile costs peanuts (i managed to get one of those 'im leaving you guys unless....' deals)<br />
<br />
ps you two (braxyeo and iain) being a long term nokia customers you must of ran into these problems before, but im guessing the updates where not as important as they are now.<br />
Also do not go with three video mobile, as they are nothing but trouble (i have numerous examples and will go into them in detail on request but i have talked too much in this thread already)<br />
<br />
Man I really should end my posts a few paragraphs early, now it looks cluttered towards the end.<br />
Tony - happy with his n96 and you should be to

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>A deleted PST file should still be found or retrieved from the recycle bin. If it was permanently deleted or you have emptied the Recycle Bin, you will need to recover it from a backup if you have one. If you aren't able to retrieve any of it, we suggest
 that you try to login from Outlook.com and export the PST file from it. You can follow the steps provided on this
