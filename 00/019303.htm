<h2>            How to sort my conversations by most recent email - sent or received&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am working on Office365, Outlook 2016. I currently have my email view as conversations and sorted by date. But there are a couple of items I can't figure out how to configure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Within a conversation how to I make it so the email that appears in the condensed view is the most recent email, regardless of if that email was received or sent. For example, I might respond to an email but it is the email I am responding to that appears
 in the condensed view. I would like to see my email that I sent there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I also have my emails sorted by date, but they are sorted by the date of the last received email, not the most recent sent email in a conversation. For example, the most recent email I received in a conversation was one week ago, but the most recent email
 in the chain is one I sent just two days ago. The email appears in the section of my inbox 'Last Week' I would like it to be in the group for two days ago (Wednesday, Tuesday, whatever it happens to be).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>

            Hi Abi,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your post. As you set to view email messages by Conversation in Outlook 2016 client, a conversation includes all messages in the same thread with the same subject line. Conversation that include multiple messages are identified in the message list
 by <a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f00d5f58-4a81-4f3c-94eb-ce7dc71a7222?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f00d5f58-4a81-4f3c-94eb-ce7dc71a7222?upload=true" /></a>&nbsp;. You can click &nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/929f1d50-7844-45e4-8287-982be47b3804?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/929f1d50-7844-45e4-8287-982be47b3804?upload=true" /></a>
 to expand the Conversation and view the message you sent. Besides, as the message list show by Conversation sorted by date is related to the primary email with the same subject, it’s infeasible for user to set it. Meanwhile, you can change the several conversation
 options by clicking <strong>View</strong> &gt; <strong>Conversation Settings</strong>.<br />
<br />
If it’s inconvenient for you and you really want such related settings of Conversation view in Outlook 2016 client, it’s recommended to vote the related feedback

            <p>Howdy Katrina...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure exactly, but if i had to guess, I would say after making one of two email addresses i had into a forward only (to the other) address. I can no longer log into OWA with the now forward only address, but all of those messages were migrated to
 the current main address (or so I was told by our IT dept.).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure what the PC version of the app is...or how it differs from what I'm already using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our IT dept. tried looking it over and basically told me they have no idea why those messages aren't showing up in the OWA search as they are clearly on the server and not stored locally on my computer.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a similar problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Say I want to search for mails by John Doe.</p>
<p>Typically, I would search for "John" and then see where I get.</p>
<p>If I do this, I get back about 20 mails from different Johns, but only one from John Doe, while I know there are lots more of him. The others are simply not found.</p>
<p>If I search explicitly for "John Doe", I get back all his mails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked that I am searching in all folders and without a date limit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is quite frustrating as it makes search completely unreliable.</p>
<p>Using the desktop version is not an option to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best,</p>
<p>Broes</p>

<p>
</p><p>We started experiencing this issue too- where Frequent Sites is saying that the user viewed a document that they did not view. Is there something going on with the way it displays certain results? Maybe it's saying they viewed it but it might be retrieved
 b/c it's a frequently used file by others?</p>

<p>Hi Vicki,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd like to explain that the Frequent sites shows the SharePoint sites you visit frequently or, if enabled by your administrator, a list of recommended SharePoint sites generated by the Microsoft
 Graph (Office Graph). Recent activity information about this site will be displayed in addition to the site name and link.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Office Graph is an underlying service running on Office 365. It is designed to securely capture key interactions between actors (users) and objects (documents and other contents).
 For example, if I view a document, that interaction gets stored by the Office Graph making that information available for applications (like Delve) to create powerful experiences. We can enable it by

<p>Sure. I understand that. However,&nbsp;Frequent Sites is also saying "user" viewed "file name"&nbsp;for files that the user did not view.&nbsp;We had an internal customer submit a support ticket through our help desk indicating they&nbsp;were seeing under recent activity that
 it was indicating that they had&nbsp;viewed a file that they didn't&nbsp;view/had never seen before. We asked if they maybe remained logged in on a shared computer (they did not), and when I looked at my own&nbsp;Frequent Sites (and Recent Activity)&nbsp;I also saw activity indicating
 that I&nbsp;viewed files I did not view. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the intended function of Frequent Sites and Delve-like surfacing of content such as&nbsp;highlighting popular documents, or documents recently updated by others, or documents I did in fact view- but the problem is when it says that I've looked at
 files that I didn't look at, there are users who are concerned about liability and auditing-&nbsp;if the system is reporting them as viewing files they are required to have a business case to view, such as PHI. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Vicki,</p>

<p>Thanks for the information.</p>

<p>If your concern is regarding liability and auditing, I'd like to explain that the user will only view and modify the files that they are granted permissions to. They will not be able to access files
 if they don't have permissions.</p>

    <title>How to manage PowerPoint wmv file template background - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dmr123  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to manage PowerPoint wmv file template background</h2>
                    <p>I am using a template for a PowerPoint presentation, and the master slide has a linked wmv file which causes the background to slowly change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The change is very subtle, and not even necessary, but I like the template in all other respects.&nbsp; Normally the wmv file just plays in the background and is essentially 'invisible' and doesn't interfere with anything else.&nbsp; But if I move the mouse, it triggers
 the wmv file to play in a different sort of 'manual' mode, and displays a progress bar on the bottom of the slide.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This creates two problems :</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; While the wmv file is playing as a result of the mouse movement, I can't advance slides.&nbsp; Everything else freezes for a few seconds.&nbsp; This is of course a terrible problem when trying to smoothly pace a slide presentation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; When the wmv file is playing as a result of the mouse movement, it displays a semi-transparent progress bar on the bottom of the slides, which distracts and confuses my audience (and me!).&nbsp; I don't want to see this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I stop this behavior?&nbsp; Indeed, I'd be happy to 'freeze' the wmv file entirely and just have a static background.&nbsp; I've tried to delete the wmv file, but that of course means I then lose all the background!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for any suggestions/assistance.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>For us to identify if this is an issue with the PowerPoint application, .wmv file or compatibility, we need to check some settings and perform troubleshooting steps to isolate the issue. Though just to confirm, have you tried using other wmv file to check
 if this is an issue with a specific file? Please follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Install Office updates:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Open any Office 2013 application, such as Word and create a new document.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Click <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Account</strong> (or Office Account if you opened Outlook 2013).<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Under <strong>Product Information</strong>, choose <strong>Update Options</strong>.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Click <strong>Enable Updates</strong> if the option is available.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e. Choose <strong>Update Now</strong> to manually check for and install Office updates.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f. Close the <strong>"You're up to date!"</strong> window after Office is done checking for and installing updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Repair your Office application. Detailed steps are provided on this <strong>
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link.</a></strong></p>

<p>Hi</p>

</p><p>Thank you for your reply.&nbsp; But it doesn't address my question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll restate it more clearly.</p>

<p>Thank you for clarifying on that one. If you have .wmv background on your presentation, you can specify how you want your video to play during a presentation, and set many other playback options. The options include playing a video automatically or when
 clicked, playing a video full screen, and looping a video. You may need to set this option before adding any animations or triggers to your video. By changing this option, you will remove any animations that are associated with your video. Please follow the
 steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. In Normal view, click the video frame on the slide.<br />
</p>
<p>2. Under <strong>Video Tools</strong>, go to <strong>Playback</strong>. Then, in the
<strong>Start</strong> list, choose one of the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. To play your video when the slide containing the video appears in <strong>
Slide Show</strong> view, select <strong>Automatically. </strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. To play your video by clicking the mouse, choose <strong>On Click</strong>. Then, when you are presenting in
<strong>Slide Show</strong> view, simply click the video frame when you are ready to play the video.</p>

<p>Here is an article about several ways to <a href="https://www.raymond.cc/blog/extract-video-frames-to-images-using-vlc-media-player/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
convert a WMV to still images</a>. The simplest solution would be to pick one of those still images to set as the master background.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still wanted to keep some motion, you could take every 30th image from the video and put them into an animated GIF that would play back at 1 frame per second. It would run much more smoothly than a video because GIF take less computer horsepower.
 But I'm guessing that would be more bother than it's worth.</p>

<p><span>Hi, </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To remove a third-party ads on Skype, you need to have a little Skype Credit or a calling subscription. For more information, refer to this

<p><span>If that’s a Microsoft ad, you can try these steps first to remove the ads:
</span></p>
<p><span>Go to <strong>Tools</strong> &gt; <strong>Privacy</strong> &gt; <strong>Privacy settings</strong> &gt; uncheck the message that
<strong>says Allow Microsoft targeted ads….</strong></span></p>

</p><p>I am sorry to hear about your concern, but this usually happens if you sign in to a wrong Skype account. Were you able to remember on how you sign in back then? Do you use email address or the Skype username?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our workaround for this, just sign out and then sign back in manually using your correct Skype account. And for more information about your Skype inquiry, please go through this link:

Hi Jason! <br />
As an Office 365 user I have some questions regarding the "Average completion" percentage displayed as an analytic feature. What does this percentage means? How is it calculated (does it refers to the average time spent inside the Sway plataform? Is it an average
 computed upon the people who "glanced", "quick read" or "deep read")?<br />
This information would be valuable to help me understand the reach of my Sway.<br />
<br />
Thank you
<p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure if this is all that's wrong but when you nest if functions you're going to need a closing parentheses for each function:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=IF(C5&lt;64,"F")<br />
=IF(C5&lt;64,"F",IF(C5&lt;73,"D"))<br />
=IF(C5&lt;64,"F",IF(C5&lt;73,"D",IF(C5&lt;85,"C")))</p>
<p>
</p><p>So there are three IFs in the last line so there are three closing parentheses at the end of the function. You have 20 nested IFs so there should be twenty parentheses at the end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>MN</p>

    <title>Unable to attach documents present in OneDrive folder. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to attach documents present in OneDrive folder.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Bug in OneDrive/Mail combo attaching files</p>
<p>Take the following scenario:</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have a folder that is synced with OneDrive. For ease let us use C:\OneDriveFolder</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have a file in this folder "asdf.docx" in this folder: C:\OneDriveFolder\asdf.docx</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us assume that your employer blocks access to OneDrive but allows E-Mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you now want to sent the file asdf.docx via the Mail app, you cannot do so, because if you try to attach the file it will tell you that you have no access to it even if the file is available offline.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The real problem is that it fails in both cases:</p>
<p>1. if you try to attach the file via the OneDrive option</p>
<p>2. if you try to attach the file via this&nbsp;PC -&gt; local drive C: -&gt; OneDriveFolder</p>
<p>
</p><p>Expected behavior:</p>
<p>Failure if you try to attach via OneDrive-option</p>
<p>Success if you try to attach via PC -&gt; local drive C:&nbsp;-&gt; OneDriveFolder</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for taking the time!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I wish to add a file from the folder "C:\OneDriveFolder " I have to navigate there in the Item Picker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regardless of which way I take</p>
<p>
</p><p>via OneDrive-option</p>
<p>via This &nbsp;PC -&gt; local drive C: -&gt; OneDriveFolder</p>
<p>
</p><p>I always get this in the Item Picker:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/43daaa9b-3bae-4dfb-bc89-3e5b7174118d" height="401" width="548" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>So with your 2nd question: Yes I get this with all files, because I cannot even navigate to the folder and choose a file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For your 3rd question:</p>
<p>The simplest workaround was to copy the file to a different location (C:\Documents) and send it from there.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To clarify: The bug is that you cannot navigate to the folder although it is "available offline". It may make sense to let this scenario fail when you choose the "OneDrive" option, but if you go the way This PC -&gt; local drive C: -&gt; OneDriveFolder the operation
 should succed if the OneDriveFolder or any of its sub-folders is "available offline".</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Branko,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you have mentioned that your employer has blocked the usage of OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is your&nbsp;system connected to a domain?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the computer is on a domain,&nbsp;the restrictions implied to the applications such as OneDrive solely depend on the domain administrator. In this case,&nbsp;you can go ahead and contact the employer for further assistance on this case. You can also post the issue
 on&nbsp;TechNet forum. The TechNet link is given below. </p>

</p>
<p>

            <p>My command of the English language is obviously not good enough to communicate the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is NOT that access to OneDrive is blocked by the employer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is NOT that the system is not connected to a domain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem ist totally unrelated to domain-issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is, that you cannot attach a file to an email if said file resides in the OneDrive-folder and at the same time there is no internet connection to OneDrive (regardless if OneDrive is blocked by the service provider or OneDrive is down or there
 is no internet connection at all). <strong>This problem also occurs also if the file is available locally</strong>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately links to part suppliers aren't allowed to be posted on this forum so we can't give you prices. Try google to find parts but keep in mind that if you fit it yourself your warranty will be voided.&nbsp;If you want a new panel and a valid warranty
 you will need to pay Nokia Care to do it.<br />
<br />
Note that the screen will stay relatively scratch free under normal use, if you place it in a pocket with sharp metal objects like coins or keys it will still be susceptible to scratching.</p>

<h2>            Mismatch between outlook 2016 account photo &#38; settings photo in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>When you change your account picture in outlook from the account properties (by selecting the change link under your current photo)&nbsp;you are taken to windows 10's account settings where you can change the picture but it doesn't update in the outlook settings
 screen which still show the old photo. Repeating has no effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At some time it does seem to "catch up" but it's not clear to me when or which picture is being used in the interval.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running update global address list does not affect it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems bugged.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you go to Outlook Web App page directly in a web browser(<a href="http://portal.office365.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://portal.office365.com</a>) under private mode. Then change your profile photo and see if it works.</span></p>

<p><span>After changing the profile photo, please check that whether the new photo shows up when you send and receive mail.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If it doesn’t work, please let me know the below information:<br />
1. The detailed version number of Outlook (File&gt;Office Account&gt;Office Updates) such as Outlook 2016 Version 1701 (Build 7766.2064)and your Operation System.<br />
2. Screenshot of the symptom you described.</p>

            <p>Hi Alison</p>
<p>
</p><p>They don't change in outlook on the settings screen on return form which ever method you use. It does eventually catch up but I am not sure when/why. So I changed my picture from change photo&nbsp;in outlook office account, came back to outlook and it showed
 the wrong one. Left settings, went back in and it was still wrong. But later in the day it seemed to be right,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't tried the experiment properly with the pictures (I suspect I need another user to view meaningful results). A quick play (with the colleague who said&nbsp;that she couldn't set her photo) shows that the effect (i.e. that after using change photo the
 new picture doesn't show or appear at all if you didn't have one) is repeatable. Have you tired it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will report back when I try it.</p>
<p>Version 1701 build 7766.2060 - but the problem is not new. (I had assumed that the link to windows 10 settings was just faulty/mistaken - I hadn't noticed that it does change eventually)</p>

            Hi LanCHC,<br />
<br />
Based on your description, what I understand is that the photo do change finally, but you cannot see the changed one in Outlook&gt;File&gt;Info page, either you cannot know when it is changed to the right one. If I misunderstand it, please correct me with screenshots
 about the steps in your description.<br />
<br />
What’s more, can you see the updated photo in the mails or other websites in your organization? The “Outlook setting” page is the only one place where you can’t see the latest photo? Could you please show more details about “i.e. that after using change photo
 the new picture doesn't show or appear at all if you didn't have one”?<br />
<br />
Please feel free to post back when you finish your tests.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Alison<br />

<h2>            Have I been blocked&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am trying to find out if I have been blocked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two versions of Skype, old and new.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the old version, the contact is showing as 'away', the orange light.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the new version, the contact is showing as 'last seen days ago'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I type to the contact, they do not come along and read my message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if I try and make a video call, the contact's status changes to 'online now' on the new version of Skype, but still 'away' on the old version of Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time I make a video call, the contact's status changes to 'online now', almost immediately after I make the call, on the new Skype, but does not answer or reply --- this is strange, right?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have I been blocked or deleted?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or is the contact simply not reading my messages?&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>I have Skype 12.1809.217.0 which is the Windows 10 version. I received a notice from a friend of mine, "I would like to add you as a contact," but the items only shows up as a message, there is no option for me to accept this request. I can call my friend,
 but he can't call me, because I am not in his friend list, since I haven't accepted his request. I watched a video which shows an option on the left pane for recent, but I don't have that option, so I can't right click and accept the invite.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to go into Control Panel to uninstall so I could re-install, but it doesn't show.</p>

</p><p>In Skype for Windows 10, sending an instant message will act as an invitation to your contact. They'll be able to receive the contact request on their Recent tab and will have the option to Accept or Decline the contact request. With that being said, it
 is best if you will just send an instant message to your contact so you'll be added to her/his contact list.</p>

    <title>Why does Word auto-insert an en-dash when it should insert an - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikeliebeman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does Word auto-insert an en-dash when it should insert an em-dash&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I guess I never paid a lot of attention to this until recently, when a proofreader I was using started having if fit over some copy I sent in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hyphens should be used when breaking up words due to justification, but not for connecting words. Consider:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span>This is a hyphen -</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><span>This is an en dash&nbsp;</span><span>–&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><span>This is an em dash&nbsp;</span><span>—&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>BUT </strong>in word when I would want an en dash I am automatically given a hyphen. As in:</p>
<p><span><strong>This is Word when I should have an en dash but am given a stinking-hyphen.&nbsp;</strong></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And here I should get an em dash but I am automatically given an en dash.</p>
<p><strong>This is Word with an en dash where I sure as heck – given the automatic nature should have an em dash!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Clearly in both cases, MS Word automatically inserts the wrong character. How can I change the automatic function?</p>

<p>First of all, be aware that the AutoFormat As You Type option for dashes does not fire until you complete the word following the hyphen(s). At that time, the following will occur:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>A single hyphen preceded and followed by spaces will become an en dash.</li><li>A single hyphen preceded by a space will become an en dash.</li><li>A single hyphen followed by a space will remain a hyphen.</li><li>A single hyphen with no spaces on either side will remain a hyphen.</li><li>Two hyphens preceded and followed by spaces will become an en dash.</li><li>Two hyphens preceded by a space will become an en dash.</li><li>Two hyphens followed by a space will become an em dash.</li><li>Two hyphens with no spaces on either side will become an em dash.</li></ul>
<p>As you can see, there are a lot more ways to get an en dash than an em dash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But your initial premise is incorrect. Hyphens are used for breaking words at the right margin, but they are also used for compound words except in special circumstances. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>When the dash represents "to," as in "the Portland<span>–Seattle flight."</span></li><li><span>When part of a compound contains more than one word, as in "New York</span><span>–area restaurants."</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>In general, when sending in copy to be typeset, it's better not to hyphenate words except when the hyphen is part of a compound word. Proofreaders get nervous about hyphens even if your electronic file has used an optional hyphen (<strong>Ctrl+Hyphen</strong>),
 which will appear only if the word is broken at the right margin. This is not unreasonable: such hyphens in PDF copy get translated into hard hyphens when converted to Word.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 30px">The problem is that here I really want an en dash.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Also note that while grammar rules suggest that em dashes do not take spaces. ...</p>

</p><p>And I do/must use spaces before and after them. :-) and so the MS Word system produces 100% inconsistency for me.</p>

<p>If you want a specific dash, the best way is to insert it explicitly. You can do this in any of several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>In Word, you can type the Unicode number of the desired character (2013 for en dash, 2014 for em dash) and press
<strong>Alt+X</strong>.</li><li>In any Windows program, you can insert the dash from the keyboard using the ASCII number: with NumLock enabled and using the numbers on the numeric keypad only (the top row of the alphanumeric keyboard won't work), press
<strong>Alt+150</strong> for an en dash or <strong>Alt+151</strong> for an em dash.</li><li>In Word, assign keyboard shortcuts for the dashes. This is certainly the simplest method, and something I've used for decades. I would suggest
<strong>Ctrl+Shift+N</strong> and <strong>Ctrl+Shift+M</strong> (I also use <strong>
Alt+Ctrl+N</strong> and <strong>Alt+Ctrl+M</strong> for en and em spaces). If you don't know how to assign keyboard shortcuts, see
<span><a href="http://wordfaqs.ssbarnhill.com/CustomizeKeyboard.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://wordfaqs.ssbarnhill.com/CustomizeKeyboard.htm</a>.
</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>I'm interested in the style guide you quote. I know that it is UK practice to use a spaced en dash where US style would use an em dash, but the only instance in which I've seen spaced em dashes is in ebooks, where the em dash is liable to become nonbreaking
 (in Word it is not), causing bad line breaks, and in fact many authors use a spaced en dash
</span><span>instead</span><span>.</span></p>

<p>The Associated Press Stylebook (commonly referred to as the AP style guide) is the most common guide for punctuation for the press, and others, in the USA. I don't know about elsewhere.&nbsp;https://www.apstylebook.com/&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am aware of how to create dashes manually, but in all truth, it takes away from the flow as I write. I don't really want to be pulled into the mechanics of the technology as I write. I want it to be passive and amiable to my needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The double dash would work for me if the results regarding spacing were reversed! By that I mean, if this, as follows, was the case instead of how it works now.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>IF it were:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Two hyphens with no spaces on either side will become an en dash.</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Two hyphens preceded and followed by spaces will become an em dash.</li></ul>
<p>That would be perfect. What is now is perfectly horrible.&nbsp;<br />

<p>Thanks for understanding that I'm just the messenger! It's all a matter of&nbsp;habit, though, and I have to say that I don't think any more about inserting an en or em dash than I do about typing any other letter. It's actually way more trouble to insert a degree
 sign (<strong>Ctrl+@, Spacebar</strong>), which requires a bit of a stretch for my stubby fingers. The drawback, of course, is that the shortcuts work only in Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My shortcut for an em dash is actually <strong>Ctrl+M</strong> rather than <strong>
Ctrl+Shift+M</strong> because in the Dark Ages when I started using Word, I had a screen saver (remember those?) that hijacked
<strong>Ctrl+Shift+M</strong> for some command or other, and at the time I wasn't savvy enough to find out whether there was some way to disable that. Over many years of using the shortcut (and almost as many years of not having After Dark installed), it's
 never seemed worth the trouble of getting used to a changed shortcut, so I haven't changed it.</p>

<h2>            Getting rid of Bing and all Bing.x from the Registry and my computer</h2>
                    <p>Greetings!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been trying for weeks to get Bing.X and bing.com removed from my computer, running Windows 10 Pro. For one thing, the presence of bing.com interferes with one of my mission critical applications. Whata I have to do, load Linus on my machine?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Look, I've tried to delete EVERYTHING bing or Bing from the Registry. Many data values are just reloaded after they are deleted. I'm wondering if we can take legal action against MS for not allowing us to control our own machines, after all we paid for the
 OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've gone through the entire Registry multiple times, deleting bing.com before I observed that there's an entirely different set of values, like Bing.News, Bing.Sports, etc., number in tens of entries, if not over a hundred.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I know why it's impossible to delete bing.com from the computer. It keeps popping up, even after I've deleted everything from the file system and registry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's my message to Microsoft: I would like the presence of every and all references to Bing and bing.com removed from my computer, and done in a way that won't sabotage the operation of other apps. If this cannot be done, I consider it to be a violation
 of my personal freedom to control my own device -- which from the beginning has been a fundamental principle of the PC as it was conceived of in the beginning. As far as I know the law has not changed. However, I'll be bringing this up to the attention of
 several Senators and Congressmen in Washington, D.C. Having worked on several political campaigns, I'm sure, in the present political climate, at least one of those I know personally will respond with the legislation that will put a stop to allowing Microsoft
 to commandeer my computer without my authorization and against my will ..... which is actually a manifestation of Corporate Feudalism, which is the new political system SCOTUS has laid the legal foundation for with over 100 years of judicial decisions, ultimately
 having the unintended consequence of killing the American Republic as our Founding Fathers envisioned it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The authoritarian engineers at Microsoft in their overflowing HUBRIS have sat around a meeting room and made decisions which have had the effect of ruining the individual experience in working with computers. We need to put a stop to this. Now I personally
 may have to sacrifice thousands of dollars in personal economic losses to move to a different OS, but if this is what it takes to get rid of bing and Bing.X from my computer I'll do it, and seek legal regress with those who may agree with me on this issue.

SO: HOW DO I GET RID OF BING AND bing.com FROM MY COMPUTER RUNNING WIN 10 PRO?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please confirm whether&nbsp;you want to remove Bing.com as home page from Internet Explorer/Edge or from some other browser?<br />
Do you&nbsp;want to remove Bing app from his computer ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would&nbsp;like to tell you&nbsp;that making changes in registry is not a correct way of removing bing.com from browser. Serious problem may appear if incorrect changes made in registry.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are talking about home page in Internet explorer I suggest you to refer to the article:</p>

            <p>Howdy, Anusha!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there something you don't understand from this statement:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Q: HOW DO I GET RID OF BING AND bing.com FROM MY COMPUTER RUNNING WIN 10 PRO?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I don't mean to be impolite. But the main thrust of my message is that I don't want to see the word "bing" or Bing" anywhere in my computer: not the registry, not in a file or folder, and not in a browser.
 Duh .... uh .... I think this also means the Bing app, if that's what you call it these days.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">You see, I'm really mad, because Microsoft stole several hours of my time, making me think that Bing was just an ordinary app, when it's actually hard coded into the registry -- the only explanation for
 the fact that when you delete an item from the registry, get to the bottom, go back to the top, with the thought that Bing is GONE, you find out that .... abracadabra! Everything you've just delete is back, exactly where it was in the first place.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">So now I want all vestiges of Bing removed from my machine.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">By the way, I've had one conversation with my Congressman's office about this, and I'm preparing a detailed report on the matter, which I'll be sending to a couple senators, including Elizabeth Warren,
 who's very interested in corporate hubris with respect to screwing up the lives of consumers, as Microsoft is wont to do as part of its corporate policy, since Gates surpassed IBM's dirty tricks back in the day.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Here's the worse thing: stealing time, not stealing money ... with its new medieval, agrarian model of software sales, over and above hard-coding and HIDING your bing&nbsp; (and whatever else is there) &nbsp;in
 its new OS.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">So....please explain how to accomplish what I've requested.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Thank you kindly.</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can understand how annoying it would be seeing Bing everywhere when you don't want to .</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to tell you Bing is a default search engine, and default App from Microsoft. But Microsoft cannot force you to use Bing. As you don't want to use Bing you can remove it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I earlier suggest you to remove homepage from internet explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are talking about application then you can go to programs and features and remove all the applications related to Bing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to the following article to remove application:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/repair-or-remove-programs#v1h=tab01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/repair-or-remove-programs#v1h=tab01</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer tot he following article to change homepage from Microsoft Edge:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/change-your-home-page#v1h=tab01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/change-your-home-page#v1h=tab01</a></p>

            <p>Hi, Anusha!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, here's just another example of Microsoft stealing time, by directing a customer to perform a phony solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my installation of Windows 10 Pro, if you follow these instructions that the link you provide recommends:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1)">You can uninstall programs on the Settings page. To repair a program, use Control Panel.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>On the Start menu select&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">Settings.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p>In Settings, select&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">System</span>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">Apps &amp; features.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p>Select the program, and then select&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">Uninstall.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p>Follow the directions on the screen.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>as it happens, <strong>Bing is not listed among the Apps and Features.</strong> If you do a search for Bing or bing you get a response:
<strong><em>Registry REMAINS spiced with hundreds of BING references</em></strong>, WHICH CANNOT BE DELETED.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>NOR is it listed in the Control Panel under Programs and Features</em></span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So. <em>What's going on at Microsoft? The right hand of marketing and Customer Service does KNOW what the left hand of Hubris-saturated, Narcissistic Engineering has done, forcing&nbsp;down out throats?</em></p>
<p>One more time: Find out what we need to do to ELIMINATE BING?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question remains:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Q: HOW DO I GET RID OF BING AND bing.com FROM MY COMPUTER RUNNING WIN 10 PRO?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let's see if you can find out how to do it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>O, yeah! I do know how to change the Home Page from a Browser. I worked with browsers before they became browsers, Anusha. Just fyi.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Nice try, though.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>I don't think you get it. I don't want Bing on my computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me understand what you're saying: if Microsoft scams all its customers and hides an app in its OS without explaining it beforehand, and without providing the means of getting rid of it, you're OK with that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's like saying, if you lived in a Roman village in 477 A.D., and the Huns took it over, you'd be OK by bowing down to their gods, even rejecting the freedom to remain a Christian, which by then what the official religion of the Roman Empire,
<em>just because the Hun leaders sat around a tent and decided village policy and had to power and the means to force you to bow down to their gods</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What kind of American are you? And what kind of feudal-becoming company is Microsoft?</p>

            <p>Ah, I get it: the heavy hand of a legalistic mind ... which ordinary people and philosophers have cursed for two thousand years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like, you can't get medical care unless you sign a contract absolving your doctors of all responsibility for their errors, like prescribing the wrong medicine for an illness.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's one thing to hardcode in an OS a printer driver to ease customers facility in printing; it's another thing to hardcode a browser that aims at sabotaging every other browser on the market (of course, trying to imitate Apple like apes trying to imitate
 human sign language), and in the process -- because to the spaghetti code with one module not knowing all its impact on other modules -- interferes with other applications that ought to run on a computer with a Microsoft OS ... or supposed to run, according
 to the advertizing. (Historically, the strength of Microsoft has been its propensity to allow OS users to exercise maximum control over their computers; with the new regime trying to become more like Apple, they're upsetting a lot of their historically loyal
 customers -- in addition to eliminating producers and businesses in the marketplace, eliminating competition, changing the very face of entrepreneurial capitalism itself.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, OK, no I didn't read every line of the Microsoft legalistic. &nbsp;But ... perhaps we can prevent companies from scamming customers in the future. Sooner or later this struggle among a few oligarchic corporations to monopolize the marketplace while killing
 our Republic and inducing a system of Corporate Feudalism on us must end, and hamstringing folks with legalistic contracts that violate their personal interests must also end. If you don't see this, then you're contributing to the destruction of the American
 Republic. </p>
<p>
</p><p><em>[Of course you know that agreeing to a contract that is inimical to your personal interests is irrational. When the point of violation of personal interests is hidden by a product provider, that make the product provider
 truth about Windows 10. It's that simple.]</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>It's one thing to say, hey, it's legal, tough luck. It's another thing to do what's morally and ethically right. Some companies actually do have an ethics manual that aims at doing what's right. It's the third generation of hubris-besotted geniuses that
 have trouble conceiving in their spaghetti-coded minds what's right. There's no ethics manual in computer programming courses at universities today, but if there were, these minds could not grasp it.</p>
<p>

<p>Hello,</p>

<p>Where in the Admin console is the setting to allow or prohibit add-ins for Office 365 for Business? Even a click map would be great (login-&gt;Policy--&gt;user--&gt;individual_user--&gt;).</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Jamison,</p>
<p>It’s possible to manager add-ins for the whole organization in <a href="https://outlook.office365.com/ecp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Exchange admin center</a> &gt; organization &gt; add-ins.</p>
<p>For add-ins applied to the whole organization, there are three options:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Optional, enabled by default </li><li>Optional, disabled by default </li><li>Mandatory, always enabled. Users can’t disable this add-in. </li></ol>
<p>For the #1 &amp; #2, end users can enable add-ins by turning on them in <a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
OWA</a> (Outlook Web App) &gt;&nbsp; Options &gt; General &gt; Manage add-ins.</p>
<p>If there is anything unclear, please let us know. We will be glad to be helpful.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brook</p>

<p>thank you for the reply - my it group insists that there is nothing on their end that is prohibiting add-ins. when i try to add any add-in, i get this 403 error. i am on office 365 for business on an exchange online server. i also included my "manage add-ins"
 page from the outlook web app. &nbsp;any further ideas?</p>

<p>hi jamison,</p>
<p>please share with us your detailed steps about trying to add the add-in.</p>
<p>i notice that in your owa add-in manager ui (the 2<sup>nd</sup> screenshot), there is only on add-in. however, there are five add-ins installed by default. and these five default add-ins cannot be uninstalled. please confirm whether all other users only
 have one default add-in the same as you.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=4b9eefc2-8c91-44f2-b7de-b3461d2be132" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d4b9eefc2-8c91-44f2-b7de-b3461d2be132" /></a></p>
<p>i would like to collect the following information for further investigation:</p>
<ol>
<li>the issue occur to other users in your organization? </li><li>have you tried to add add-ins in another network environment? </li><li>which browser are you using? have you tried other browser? and please make sure they are up to date.

<p>The issue occur to other users in your organization? &nbsp;Yes. They thought they had trhe Office Store 'turned off' but i was able to install a web app, just not an add-in, so i don;t think that was the case.</p>
<p>Have you tried to add add-ins in another network environment? Yes, both connected to our network, through a VPN and at home.</p>
<p>Which browser are you using? Have you tried other browser? And please make sure they are up to date. I started with Chrome and then also tried IE 10. They are current.</p>

<p>Hi Jamison,</p>
<p>OK, please share with us your example when getting it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>About “Yes. They thought they had trhe Office Store 'turned off'”, do you mean that they cannot use their Office Store? If so, then the issue is related to their Office Store rather than Office 365.</p>

<p>Sounds like you and our team were on the same page. I received a note this morning to try it and it worked. This is the message that they sent along with the request to try - "There is a “My Marketplace Apps” that Is not enabled by default for the Default
 Organization Policy and it appears to give that capability to install add-ons." &nbsp;- So, problem solved. Thanks!</p>

    <title>USB-C quick charge glitch&#47;bug - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pippyo04  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB-C quick charge glitch&#47;bug</h2>
                    <p>I have had my Lumia 950 for about two months now. For the past three weeks or so I have had a problem charging with my phone through the USB-C quick charge. If the phones at 30% I will plug the phone in and it will charge to around 60% in about 5 minutes.
 Then&nbsp;the percentage will jump to 100% and just stop charging all together. I&nbsp;unplug the phone and it jumps back down to 64%. plug it back in and it either jumps back to&nbsp;100% a couple minutes later or just stays at 60%. I do a soft reset and then the phone
 will read something like 40%. Then it will either charge ungodly fast and jump to 100% or stay at 40%...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its a vicious cycle. The phone never seems to actually know what the battery's charge&nbsp;percentage truthfully is and then glitches by jumping to 100% whenever&nbsp;it realizes it had no clue what the battery percentage it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some information what cords and other info that one might need. I'm using the wall charger that came with the device and I have tried multiple outlets. I've also tried a different cord, (the one provided with the continuum dock). Now when I plug the phone
 into a computer with the usb-usb-c cord (provided by Microsoft) the phone charges normally but at about the fourth of the pace. Also when I plug the phone into my battery pack, the DC-34 made by Microsoft, It charges normally. I only have problems with the
 wall charger. </p>
<p>
</p><p>IMPORATANT! I first started to have this problem when I tried out my wired continuum dock. I believe this is where the problem originated but I have no idea why it happened. I haven't used my continuum dock for the past two weeks hoping that it would resolve
 the issue but the issue continues, and from what I can tell its worsened. (Although that could just be from mounting frustration)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else experienced this problem and knows a fix? Or Any advice on what I could try to solve the problem. Thank you!</p>

            Hi, <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/81b91624-a00b-4687-987e-f4ec9533eb76" title="pippyo04">
pippyo04</a>. Have you tried checking if there is any update available for the phone? Also, check if there are any updates available for the system apps by going to Store &gt; Menu &gt; Downloads and updates &gt; Check for updates. If this does not help, try resetting
 the phone by going to Settings &gt; System &gt; About &gt; Reset your phone. Make sure to back up your files before performing this. We'll appreciate letting us know the outcome.

            Not sure if the 5200 has the same menu structure as my 6233, but this is how to do it on a 6233 (perhaps it works for you...<br />
<br />
Press in fast sequnce :<br />
middle button (for Menu)<br />
2 (for Contacts)<br />
9 (for Copy Contacts)<br />
middle button (for select)<br />
middle button again (for yes)<br />
<br />
Hope this works for you.

Is there a setting that allows me to chose "Reply" or "Reply to All" on texting so that my response only goes back to the sender verses to everyone that the original message went to on my Lumia 520?

            It is not a setting. All you have to do is reply to the sender from your contact list or reply to the original text to reply to the group.

    <title>Outlook Double spacing problem &#33;&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> piyush soni  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook Double spacing problem &#33;&#33; </h2>
                    
<p>I really need some help from someone knowledgeable (or Microsoft) for this problem of Outlook adding two newlines on pressing enter once. I have seen people are getting frustrated all over the internet with this problem, but don't know why MS is not fixing
 this. I think it's a bug, but people have found a work around some way or the other. I still haven't.</p>
<p>My problem is, when I start a new e-mail from Outlook, it has my defined signature which works well, but when I click on 'mailto:' hyperlink on a webpage (having something in the body), it overrides these defined signature styles etc., and again on pressing
 Enter once it gives two line feeds ! Why MS ? Why do you do that? :(</p>
<p>P.S. I know one way out is to press Shift + Enter and not enter, and the other is to select the text, click 'Paragraph' in Format Text-&gt;Line Spacing and setting the spacing to zero for before and after. But I need a permanent work around. Does anyone know
 that?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<span>Hi Everyone,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Nick just posed something in an attempt to answer this original question about why he was getting a blank line between paragraphs when he only hit &lt;Enter&gt;
 once. I submitted&nbsp;the same&nbsp;question a couple of months ago. All proffered solutions before and after my post did not work for me. But I hit upon something new this morning.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I&nbsp;think I just solved the problem of double-spacing in Outlook emails, but you may not like the solution.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><i><span>Turn off your stationery</span></i><span>. Follow this path: [new email] \ Message tab
 \ Signature button \ Signatures option \ Personal stationery tab\ Theme \ [choose none].</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Your double-spacing problem should be gone. This works for new emails and replies to emails.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I’m sorry to see my beautiful, blue stationery go, but I’d rather hit the space bar twice to get paragraphs with a blank line between them instead of
 having one inserted automatically. And now I will be able to create a list of things in single-space without having to press &lt;Control&gt;&lt;Enter&gt;, which has its own problems, too.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I hope&nbsp;this works for you, too!</span></p>

            If you right click a toolbar and then select CUSTOMISE..., then under the FORMAT option, drag STYLE to your menu bar, you can then select NORMAL which will give you a single space.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I had this issue and found that STYLE was set to PARAGRAPH, hence, my double spacing when i hit enter.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps!<br />
