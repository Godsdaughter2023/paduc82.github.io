    <title>Audio&#47;Video sync issue - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Audio&#47;Video sync issue</h2>
                    <p>In my skype calls on Windows 10, the video lags significantly behind the audio. &nbsp;My network connection is 100Mbps down, 10Mbps up. &nbsp;My laptop is an older HP model which I do plan on replacing soon. &nbsp;In the meantime, my question is this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there some way of delaying the audio so that it could sync more closely with the video? &nbsp;I don't see anything under Settings in Skype, but I thought that there may be some registry tweak, or something similar to that, which would allow me to do this workaround
 for now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>David</p>

<p><span>Hello duvidL11,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to the Skype Community Forum! I do understand the inconvenience you have faced.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please be advised that for Video calling (high-quality) minimum download / upload speed is 400kbps. While recommended download / upload speed is 500kbps.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For Video calling (HD), minimum download / upload speed is 1.2Mbps. While recommended download / upload speed is 1.5Mbps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For the complete bandwidth requirement for Skype, please refer to this link:
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA1417" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How much bandwidth does Skype need?</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, kindly try the following steps in
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34703" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">solving video issues for Skype for Windows 10</a>:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>1. Use the latest version of Skype.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>We’re always improving call quality, so for best performance, make sure that you and the person you’re calling are using the latest version of Skype. Download
 the latest version.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>2. Check your connection.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the video freezes, looks block-like or has motion blur, it might be your internet connection (or your friend’s) causing the problem. If Skype detects a
 weak connection, it will reduce the quality to try and stop the call from dropping altogether. Check out our guide to solving connection issues.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>3. Check your webcam.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Make sure your camera is installed, plugged into your computer, and turned on. If you’re using an external camera and you’re having problems with video, try
 plugging it into a different USB port. If you’re using a USB hub, try plugging it directly into your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I hope this helps. Should you have further queries, please do not hesitate to reply to this post.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you.

<h3> kirkmanton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Access 2016 Shuttle Bar object spacing and behavior</h2>
                    <p>I have two laptops running Access 2016 and Windows 10 and the Shuttle Bars (pane to the left) on the two machines look different and behave different. On one machine the objects are double spaced and do not scroll smoothly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Is there a control to adjust the spacing between the objects? </p>
<p>
</p><p>2. What can we try to stabilize the scrolling?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The machine that looks and behaves normally is a 2011 Lenovo T420 running windows 10 and Access 2016.</p>
<p>The other machine which is not behaving, what I call normal, is a brand new Lenovo X1 Yoga also running Windows 10 and Access 2016. The Access file I have open is stored on a local server at work and I was accessing it through WiFi. Both machines were tested
 in the same room over the same WiFi connection. </p>
<p>

            <p>First I think you are referring to the Nav Pane. The Nav Pane can be customized for each installation of Access. A right click on the title bar of the Nav pane gives you option on how to view the Nav Pane.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second the Nav Pane is sensitive to the Graphics setup in Windows. If you have the sizing set to anything but 100%, this can cause the problems in scrolling that you describe.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Sync contacts with car kit - Not all downloading</h2>
                    1st post here so be careful with me, first may I say how useful this forum has been over the years.<br />
<br />
I have paired my Nokia 6300 with my Audi OEM car kit with no problems and it downloads the majority of my contacts but some are not downloaded.<br />
<br />
The contacts which have been on my phone for years have downloaded ok but the new ones which have been added dont download. The contacts were originally created on a Nokia E51, It seems to be due to the fact that new contacts have an extra field to them (Synchronisation)
 the options are either private, public or none.<br />
Is there any way to remove this or should it be as simple as choosing public or none.

            I have an Audi S3 with the OEM kit, and a little experimentation may help.<br />
<br />
Normally I have all my contacts saved in the phone memory, also if you have old contacts, they may need to have a Type Set to them for example "Home", "Business" or "Mobile". They come up in the MMI with Joe Bloggs/H or Joe Bloggs/B or Joe Bloggs/M Depending
 on what they type they are.<br />
<br />
I know the OEM kit will miss some numbers that have oddball contact types if you have renamed one of the types from the standard ones, or not assigned one.<br />
<br />
Sometimes its good to spend an hour with the computer and the phone connected with Nokia PC Suite, and set all the contacts up correctly.<br />
<br />
Theres some info on contact types in the Nokia 6300 User guide, <a href="http://nds1.nokia.com/phones/files/guides/Nokia_6300_UG_en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://nds1.nokia.com/phones/files/guides/Nokia_6300_UG_en.pdf</a> (Page 24 in the PDF) That should give an insight with contact types.<br />
<br />
<br />
Let us know how you get on.<br />

            Thanks for your help, sounds like we have a similar set up, I have an A3 with rns-e and OEM bluetooth.<br />
<br />
I know about the issues with mobile, business and home and have worked out I need to change the types and have done this.<br />
<br />
But the problem I am having is to do with the fact that new contacts have an extra field to them (Synchronisation) the options are either private, public or none.<br />
<br />
I am going to try and sync the phone with windows address book, delete all contacts from the phone and then re sync with phone see if that helps.<br />
<br />
Did you have to intall the contacts push software on your N95 or do they download OK, when I use my E51 I have to use the nokia contacts download application (I still have issues with this as it will only push half my contacts as i have around 500 contacts)<br />
<br />
My 6300 sync's all the contacts apart from the ones which have the syncronisation field<br />
<br />

            Yes I have had to use the Push Software to get it to work.<br />
<br />
As for some of you missing contacts, I think that can be due to the MMI memory not having enough space, I think it is limited to the amount of contacts it can hold. I have the same setup in my S3, with the RNS-E.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what the public and private syncronisation does. I'd have to look into that.<br />
<br />
It sounds like your almost there, and looks like there is a simple adjustment thats holding one or two of them out.<br />

    <title>Timesheet Actual Hours not showing in Capacity Planning - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Timesheet Actual Hours not showing in Capacity Planning</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have a multi-project, multiple resources&nbsp;environment and have&nbsp;requested that the&nbsp;personnel enter the actual hours that they spent on a project task in the Timesheet. The personnel do this by entering the&nbsp;actual hours spent on a given project task in their
 Timesheets&nbsp;on a weekly basis (i.e. they enter the hours that they have spent on a Project task over the entire week). The&nbsp;personnel then save the timesheets.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once this is done, the expectation was that the actual hours spent will show up in Capacity Planning when viewing the date range in question. However, the hours shown there are still the planned hours and not the hours that the resources have entered in
 their respective Timesheets.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We tried using the "Send Progress for All Tasks" (shown below) for the timesheets&nbsp;assuming that the Timesheet hours would then be reflected in Capacity Planning but no joy. We do not have Approvers for all the resources that use the Timesheets.</p>

</p><p>there is no way to do this as an administrator. But each project manager can set up rules in Apploval Center - Manage Rules - New. Enable "Automatically run this rule" and "Automatically publish the updates". This will approve all Status Updates and publish

            <p>Hello Omad!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the web installer, I had the same issue. I then tried the ISO for VS 2013 Pro and it works, perfectly. No installation issues, not problems, and it opens up and connects to my MS account without issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded this via Dreamspark as I have access to it as a student. If you know someone with the ISO, and assuming you're trying to use the Pro version, it should work with your key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can get the ISOs for Express here:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-express-vs.aspx</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully this helps, and hopefully MS figures out why&nbsp;we can't install via the web installer.</p>

            <p>Thankyou slerch666, the thought of using an ISO crossed my mind but I&nbsp;formatted and went down a different path&nbsp;- albeit using VS2014 CTP3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To run through the timeline, on the back of my installs constantly providing dud VS instances, I ran SFC and it picked up on some unrepairable corrupted files.&nbsp; I tried a 'DISM update' but understandably that didn't do anything (didn't even start), so :</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Format and clean installed WTP</p>
<p>- Install AMD Catalyst (control panel only, not display driver or other stuff)</p>
<p>- SFC /SCANNOW *Reported corruption again!</p>
<p>- SFC via WTP boot image *Still reported corruption!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Knowing SFC still does things even though it reports unrepairable corruption,&nbsp;I figured I have gone this far I may as well try&nbsp;installing something&nbsp;before giving up on WTP&nbsp;:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Ran web install VS2014 CTP3</p>
<p>- Restart</p>
<p>- Launched VS2014 and got the standard 'sign-in' prompt</p>
<p>- Created a 'Hello World' test program via phone emulator &lt;- Worked!</p>
<p>- Restart</p>
<p>- Repeated a 'Hello World' program again, worked again</p>
<p>
</p><p>Conclusion : I am able to start working on WTP, however I can only conclude that the 'VS2013 U3 Web Installer' caused issues (backed up by other threads/comments).&nbsp; The 'use ISO' may have resolved the install issues, but I formatted the drive before I could
 attempt this (aka before reading slerch's post).</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for why SFC continues to report corruption, I will park it as a 'Preview'&nbsp;issue and "move onward and forward".</p>

<h2>            Word for Mac 2016 crashes continuously at arbitrary moments</h2>
                    <p>I have an Office 365 University subscription and I am using Word for writing articles (max 15000 words).</p>
<p>Since Office 2016 Words keeps on crashing arbitrarily loosing the last minutes of my work and interrupting my flow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have re-installed Office several times but the issue is coming back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is someone having the same problem and, hopefully, came up with a solution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>Font problems are usually the cause of crashes with MS Word. You should use the Font Book application that is located in your Application folder and check if Fonts might be the problem on your system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the File menu of Font book is a Validate Fonts option. When you use it it will look at all fonts on your system and tell you if there are problems. You must resolve all problems it finds, even warnings. Usually the problems are duplicate fonts and even
 though a duplicate might be disabled, you've got to get rid of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After completing the process make sure you do a full shutdown and then wait a couple minutes before restarting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully this will help... and of course let us know.</p>

<p>I done figured it out. My taskbar is on the left of the desktop, as the vertical portion of the screen on the top and bottom is to me valuable real estate. The side of the desktop seems a more natural placement to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, by placing the taskbar on the left side (as in linux), the search bar disappears. I guess this had not been taken into account by the administrators of the insider program. They failed to mention that in cases like mine, the search bar is replaced with
 a circle that launches cortana.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep in mind, I just upgraded from Windows 8 this morning, so Windows 10 is very new to me.</p>
<p>

    <title>Using Excel to Keep Inventory - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mrhappygolucky1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using Excel to Keep Inventory</h2>
                    <p>I want to have a <strong>simple</strong> inventory to keep track of products.&nbsp; Column A will be the product name, and Column B will be the number in stock.&nbsp; That's it.&nbsp; Now, there can be an optional Column C that has the UPC number, but that's not a necessity.&nbsp;
 Is there a way to set up a spreadsheet in Excel so that I can just scan the UPC with a barcode scanner and have it go out on the Internet and retrieve the produce name and increase the quantity by one each time I scan another UPC with the same number?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>**Bonus question:</strong> If I sell a product, can I scan the UPC and have the quantity decrease by 1?</p>

            In theory, yes. <br />
<br />
In practice, I would not use Excel. This is more of a database, Access, application.<br />
<br />
The UPC scanner is just a specialized camera. The important part is the application that the scanner provides it capture to.&nbsp; You could even use smartphones with the right app behind them.&nbsp; Here is the results of a quick google for such apps:<br />
https://www.google.ca/search?q=iphone+upc+interpret+app&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official
<br />
<br />
The scanner must tie in to an application that has access to a database with the UPC codes. Rather than relying on internet data sources, I would suggest you populate a local database with known used products.<br />
<br />
I don't know if you could tie an application in to a spreadsheet to update a single row.
<br />
<br />
What I do know would work is having the scanner application create a CSV "record", row or File for each item scanned. Record the UPC and quantity added or subtracted (answer to your bonus question).
<br />
<br />
Then you would import those files to your spreadsheet, sort by UPC and you would use totals and subtotals to report the current inventory for each upc.<br />

    <title>Can&#39;t Delete Shared Calendar Item in Outlook, but can in OWA - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jayreg123  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t Delete Shared Calendar Item in Outlook, but can in OWA</h2>
                    <p>Office 2016 Pro Plus (Outlook 2016 x64)<br />
Exchange Server 2013<br />
Windows 10 x64 LTSB (v.1607 14393.2368)</p>
<p>
</p><p>User 1 changes calendar permissions to make User 2 an Owner of their calendar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>User 2 opens the shared calendar. They can add items successfully and they can manage sharing successfully. So, Ownership permissions are working in Outlook. However, when User 2 tries to delete an event they they created, an error appears: "Some items cannot
 be deleted. The were either moved or already deleted, or access was denied."</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When User 2 logs into OWA, they are able to delete the calendar item. So, all permissions are correct. However, something is clearly not working with Outlook. I'm only deleting one calendar event.</p>
<p>
</p><p>User 1 &amp; User 2 have the same version of Outlook.</p>
<p>I've disabled all but the Exchange Add-in.</p>
<p>I tried two switches:&nbsp; /cleansharing&nbsp; &amp; /resetsharedfolders</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've confirmed that User 2 has permissions to delete entries:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried repairing Office installation for User 2 and even a new Outlook profile, but still get the same outcome--can't delete.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I fix Outlook so that User 2 can delete entries from User 1's calendar without going to OWA?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;Jayreg123,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greetings. This is Alan Wu from Office 365 forum support and it is my honor to assist you for your case here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For your scenario, I'd like to confirm how long you got this problem. I mean, there is a knowm issue that the user who has been granted with the appropriate permission is unable to edit the shared calendar within 4 hours while he accepts the shared calendar
 invitation. About this kind of issue, our engineers are working on it. For more information, you can refer to<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/known-issues-with-shared-calendars-in-outlook-d6fd4f68-489c-4196-a9c2-588c5ead00b8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">&nbsp;https://support.office.com/en-us/article/known-issues-with-shared-calendars-in-outlook-d6fd4f68-489c-4196-a9c2-588c5ead00b8</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's move forward if the above mentioned information is not your scenario. I understand that you have said that the permission is OK since it works fine in OWA. However, my understanding is that there might be some cache affection on the Outlook client.
 To isolate it, I suggest you remove the user 1's calendar from user 2's account and then re-add it back to see if it makes a difference (as for considering the above mentioned known issue, please wait for more than 4 hours if you re-add it). And, I know there
 are several methods about assigning user 1 calendar's owner permisson to user 2. So, please try one of the following method to re-assign the permission.</p>
<p>1. Use Windows PowerShell to do it.&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/exchange/mailboxes/Add-MailboxFolderPermission?view=exchange-ps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/exchange/mailboxes/Add-MailboxFolderPermission?view=exchange-ps</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Use Outlook client to add the permission.&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/share-an-outlook-calendar-with-other-people-353ed2c1-3ec5-449d-8c73-6931a0adab88" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/share-an-outlook-calendar-with-other-people-353ed2c1-3ec5-449d-8c73-6931a0adab88</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If necessary, we are glad to help you further.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>What do you mean by disappeared?</p>
<p>Do you mean they don't show up in your start menu anymore? That doesn't necessarely mean they are gone. You could check for the Office 2007 directory and see if they are still there. The default is "c:\program files\microsoft office\office12". Powerpoint
 should be listed as "powerpnt.exe" for example.</p>
<p>Or do you mean that they don't start when you double-click a&nbsp;workbook, presentation, ...?&nbsp;It could be that just your file associations are gone. In such a case, you could right click an Excel or Powerpoint file and choose "Open With..." to browse to the
 application. Make sure to mark the program as the default to open this type of files (check near the bottom).</p>
<p>Or do you mean that the programs are really gone from your&nbsp;harddisc? If that's the case, see if you can still locate the setup program (Control Panel =&gt; Programs) and do a repair. If even that is not possible, you will have to use your disc (or download)
 and do a fresh install.</p>
<p>Note that Paint comes with Windows not with Word. If you 'lost' that one, you will need your Windows disc to reinstall it. But really, if you managed to somehow remove paint, who knows what else is removed. I would at least try a repair of Windows (not Office)
 or even a full reinstall.</p>

<p>Hi - This is down to method! When you rip a CD (unless a different path has been chosen) -&nbsp;the tracks will be copied to your Music folder which is the default location for ripped music.
</p>
<p>To re-rip the same tracks to your USB you would need to change that rip location to your usb device, but this is unnecessarily complicated. What I would do is insert&nbsp;the usb - go to the music folder - select the desired album(s) or tracks - right-click and&nbsp;select
 'Send to...' - you'll see your usb device listed as one of the options.</p>
<p>Note - music copied to USB and then played on an external player sometimes does not perform as expected (wrong track order etc.) so you may need to experiment a bit to see how things work best. I'd try with just&nbsp;one album first, then try adding more. Cheers,
 Ric.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t make the technical preview bootable, cants install with setup.exe</h2>
                    <p>HI EVERYONE!</p>
<p>
</p><p>first of all, please forgive my english, i'm a spanish native speaker studying translation and this is my first year so, please be comprehensive :3</p>
<p>
</p><p>i got this problem, as the title says i cant install the preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have done this: i downloaded a copy of the preview in x64. then used the "windows 7 USB/DVD download tool" to make an uas bootable with the iso image. until here everything seems to be fine but when i reboot my pc and try to boot from the usb i just cant,
 the machine doesn't recognize that there's an SO in the flash drive, and then it starts loading windows 8 from my hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so i said "well if i cant boot it, lets try installing it from inside windows" so i put the flash drive on, execute setup.exe, it goes on just like a normal installation, but i get stucked in the "Making sure you're ready to install" screen, the task managers
 shows that it is using cpu resources but i left it work for about an hour and nothing happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i thought that maybe WINDOWS 8 (installed at this moment in my machine) could make some trouble for the preview to get installed, but then i remember that it shouldn't be any trouble if i boot it and install it on another hard drive, but as i said before,
 i can't boot it from my usb flash drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>any idea what could be wrong with this?</p>
<p>anything i'm doing bad? =P</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks a lot for reading this and i hope you can give me a hand :)</p>

            <p>I could not install it as a fresh install onto blank partition or drive. It seems to only work for me as an upgrade to a current (win 7 bootable partition) . what worked for me: &nbsp;I first &nbsp;installed win 7 home on the external drive I intended to use for Win
 10 test purposes, (didn't even validate/activate the win 7 ), booted the DVD with the ISO, and the win 10 beta installation proceeded to completion on that drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Highly satisfied with the Beta OS so far!</p>

            <p>If I recall correctly then if you want to make a bootable usb device with the 64 bit version of any version of Windows (not just the 10) one&nbsp; you need to add the bootloader that comes with the 32 bit version of Windows of the same version ( in this case
 the bootloader form 32 bit version of Windows 10), its name is bootsect.exe. The file is not present on 64 bit version of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run into this problem when trying to prepare a bootable usb with Windows 7 64 bit.</p>

            <p>thanks for the answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>first: no, i don't get any error message from the process</p>
<p>
</p><p>note: i didnt know that sometimes to make the x64 bit version of windows bootable by USB, i had to run the bootsect un the download tool, i'm trying this now<br />
<br />
and second: I build this PC by myself it has a Gigabyte motherboard, an Intel i5 2500K processor, 8GB of ram (kingston) and a WD 500GB hard drive. all this running windows 8 x64.</p>
<p>
</p><p>about the methods, i've already tried that 2 options, I've configurated my bios for the installation and tried to boot my old windows 7 installation USB flash dive, and it worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>as I said, I'm trying the solution that someone gives me above. I'll come back to tell if it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PD: can you please make a comment about my writing? is it clear? any mistakes?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I assume you have 'mounted' the ISO to be able to run the 'Setup' for Windows 10 Tech Preview.</p>
<p><strong>NB:</strong></p>
<p>If you do that - the setup will '<strong>upgrade</strong>' the operating system that you booted up from&nbsp;on the pc.</p>
<p>That&nbsp;should&nbsp;work and carry your user account an settings and all applications across that are compatible.</p>
<p>(I have already tested the upgrade procedure.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The <strong>BAD</strong> news if you do that - is that when the Preview expires (definitely by Spring in the US) - you will have to re-install a clean version of your Windows 8 again (and all the apps) - or the next version of the preview.</p>
<p>You will also probably lose all the data stored on the hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The same applies if you install Windows 10 as a Dual Boot on that PC.</strong></p>
<p>So rather use any other spare hard drive in the pc - or a spare pc - to do a clean install to evaluate any of the Previews that are made available.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not real sure as to why you can't boot from the USB created with the Win 7 USB Tool....</p>
<p>It should be a non issue... Is the flash drive formatted FAT32... this is required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as trying to install from within windows with the setup, you may have a 3rd party security program interfering... Disable or uninstall.. preferably with a specific removal tool.</p>

<h2>            Word disabled when offline</h2>
                    <p>I was recently away without internet access, and trying to use Microsoft Word on my laptop--which I've had activated and licenced for over a year--disabled itself saying it could not verify. I was unable to use Office all week (no wifi or data in the woods)
 and it was infuriating as a paying customer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back in civilization I see I can upgrade the verison--maybe that was it, but how can I be sure I'll be able to use Word should I find myself without connection? This was seriously disruptive and annoying.</p>

            <p>Hi David,<br />
<br />
Users don’t need to be connected to the Internet all the time to use Office 365 ProPlus, but users must connect to the Internet at least once every 30 days.
<br />
<br />
As part of the installation process, Office 365 ProPlus communicates with the Office Licensing Service and the Activation and Validation Service to obtain and activate a product key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each time we log on to our computer, the computer connects to the Activation and Validation Service to verify the license status and extend the product key (This process requires Internet connection). As long as the computer can connect to the Internet at
 least once every 30 days, Office remains fully functional. If the computer goes offline for more than 30 days, Office enters reduced functionality mode until the next time a connection can be made.
<br />
<br />
For your reference: <br />

                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had to upgrade from Office 2010 to Office 2016 in order to order new version of publisher. &nbsp;I have had issues since install. &nbsp;I have uninstalled old office version but now cannot open Office 2016 at all. &nbsp;Cannot get into safe mode, keeps saying to "repair"
 which I do but not resolved. &nbsp;I'm in a bit of a panic as I'm working on a funeral pamphlet and cannot access my emails. &nbsp;Any suggestions? &nbsp;Seems hung up on main screen.</p>

            <p><span><span>Hello Jenetta,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>To resolve this issue we need some information. Let us know the following.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Since when exactly are you facing this issue with Outlook 2016 not opening, not even in Safe Mode?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>How did you try repairing Office 2016? Did you click on the Repair Now option on the error message?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If yes, have you tried then you may do an Online Repair of Office 2016 from the Control Panel and check if it helps to resolve the issue.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Follow these steps to perform an online repair of Office 2016:</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>&gt; Control Panel</strong></span><span>. </span></li><li>
<span>From Control Panel navigate to <strong>Programs</strong> and /or
<strong>Programs and Features</strong> and right-click on your Office 2016 installation.</span></li><li>
<span>Click on <strong>Change</strong> and then select the
<strong>Online Repair</strong> option.</span></li><li>
</span></li><li>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Check if the above step works and you are able to search normally in Outlook 2016.
<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><span>You may refer to the following discussion thread which talks about the same issue:<br />
</span></span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2016-officeapps/investigating-issue-that-causes-office-2016-apps/6062c1c0-85ed-4daf-a074-c5ea523a9744"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2016-officeapps/investigating-issue-that-causes-office-2016-apps/6062c1c0-85ed-4daf-a074-c5ea523a9744</span></a></p>

            Hi,
<div><br />
1.Did you make any changes on the computer prior to the issue?<br />
2. Which version of operating system are you using on the computer?<br />
3. Is the issue confined only with facebook?<br />
<br />
The 400 Bad Request error is an HTTP status code that means that the request you sent to the website server (i.e. a request to load a web page) was somehow malformed therefore the server was unable to understand or process the request.<br />
<br />
<br />
You may check which version of Internet Explorer you have installed on the computer.<br />
Find out which version of Internet Explorer you're using<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Find-out-which-version-of-Internet-Explorer-youre-using" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Find-out-which-version-of-Internet-Explorer-youre-using</a><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1</strong>: <br />
Check your URL (Uniform Resource Locator). If you typed the URL wrong, you will get Error Code 404. Even a single letter or number in the URL can make a difference.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2:<br />
</strong>You may also try to turn off friendly HTTP error messages in Internet Explorer
<br />
a) To do these go to Tools -&gt; Internet Options -&gt; Advanced. </div>
<div>b) Uncheck show friendly HTTP error messages. </div>
<div>Once you have done this, you should get a more detailed message that will point you to the real problem.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 3:</strong><br />
If the issue still persists then you may also try the steps in the link and check.<br />
Cannot access some websites in Internet Explorer<br />

<h2>            Error using AZcopy to import pst files</h2>
                    <p>I am following these directions to upload a PST using AZCopy:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Use-network-upload-to-import-PST-files-to-Office-365-103f940c-0468-4e1a-b527-cc8ad13a5ea6</p>

</p><p>I get the following error:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Looking at the instructions as shown in the link above, a value of se appears in the example shown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using the value of the SAS URL obtained from the Office 365 New Ingestion Network Upload Job, copied and pasted. I do have my destination url enclosed in quotes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried enclosing the URL in single quotes (') rather than double quotes("). Interestingly, this resulted in a different error message:</p>

            <p>I was able to successfully run the command.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was saving the command to a single line batch file and then running the batch file. I prefer this when running a complex command, as it is easier to edit or modify the command, and provides a reference for running the command again in the future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Copying the command from the batch file and pasting it directly into the Microsoft Azure Storage Tools session allowed the command to run without error. So it appears the problem is a Windows batch file processing problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additional solution for those also experiencing this problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even though the URL is quoted, the batch file treats anything followed by a % as a variable. To counter this, replace each "%" with "%%". The string circled in red above would become: "se=2016-10-12T05%%3A08%%3A12Z&amp;".</p>

    <title>troubles after installing Bing weather app - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> resoluta  say:</h3>
<h2>            troubles after installing Bing weather app</h2>
                    Hi, Today I installed the Bing Weather app, worked fine. Extra unwanted effects: app list now shows a to z list in a different way but worse: my touchscreen doesn't respond as it should. swiping is totally corrupted. Getting to the app list barely works
 (swipe right to left), instead the app first touched opens. Putting a letter in place in Wordfeud ie is very irritating, can only be done in three times.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I removed the Bing app, but the problems stayed. Rebooted, no change.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My phone is HTC 8x with latest updates, Netherlands.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How do I return my phone in a state before the Bing app install? And what is wrong with this app anyway?!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>greetings</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thank you for your message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that your Windows Phone 8 is not working as expected. Have you tried to reset your phone?</p>

<p>Since the problem be fixed by deleting all the rules in Outlook, may I know if you can reproduce the same behavior if you re-creating those rules one by one?

<p>1. After creating which rule then you can reproduce the same behavior. Please let me know the details.
</p>
<p>2. The detailed version number of Outlook client. Click <strong>
File-&gt;Office account</strong> and you will see the details. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you cannot reproduce it, it means that the problem is resolved now. Under this circumstance, I think the best solution is to delete the rules one by one so that we can figure out which rule caused this problem.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rick</p>

<p>The version was in my original post: Office 365 Business to Version 1901 Build 11231.20174&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both users updated from Version 1901 Build 11231.20130. I have also updated to the build above.&nbsp; However I am still on Windows 7 and have been unaffected by this issue they are on Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am unable to recreate the issue at this time for both users as they deleted all rules.&nbsp; That was an older solution I had found in another forum.&nbsp; Just seemed odd that this issue did not come about until updating to the newest build.&nbsp; Neither user had recently
 added any new rules to Outlook either.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The only reason they had updated to the latest build was due to issue of&nbsp;not being able to send meeting invites and getting the following error when sending invites from their own calendar:</p>
<p><span>&nbsp; This message could not be sent. You do not have the permission to send the message on behalf of the specified user.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The problem above was resolved for one user but not the other.&nbsp; Still trying to resolve that issue.</span></p>

<p>Hello Robert,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your prompt reply. Regarding to the second problem, you can try to re-add the account in Outlook client to see if it helps. Besides, generally we will focus on one problem in each thread. If the issue persists and you need
 more help on it, please feel free to create a new thread in the forum. We are pleased to help you.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rick</p>

<h2>            Figures in Word 2013 skewed</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I am trying to make a graph on word 2013. I have inserted an arrow and I am trying to make it horizontal, but for some reason I cannot. The arrow gets close to being horizontal but just as I am about to make it horizontal it skips several degrees and becomes
 skewed. This happens in either direction (as I try to get the arrow to horizontal position in the other direction).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason I cannot make it perfectly vertical either. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Its possible that I am not aware of some new features in word 2013, so could you please help me out.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you! </p>

            Select the arrow and on the Drawing Tools&gt;Format tab of the ribbon that should then appear, set the vertical height of the arrow in the Size section of the ribbon to 0.
