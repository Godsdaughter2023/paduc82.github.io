<p><span>Hi cjayet,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·</span></span><span>What is the make and model number of the
 computer?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·</span></span><span>Do you get any error message when you try
 to play any sound?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There seems to be issue with sound settings on the user account.</span></p>
<span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Method 1:</span></p>
</span>
<p><span>Make sure you have set sound device as default.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps:</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 Start, click Control Panel, and then click Sounds, Speech, and Audio Devices.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 Sounds and Audio Devices, and then click the Audio tab.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In
 the Sound playback section, under Default device, verify that the audio device is the correct default audio device.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>If
 this isn't the correct default audio device, click the drop-down list next to the device name, click the audio device you want, and then click OK.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Changing
 the audio device might require you to restart your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 2:</span></p>

<h2>            Elton lp2443 not printing on windows 7</h2>
                    I had windows xp with an Eltron lp2443 printer attached. I have now got a new computer with windows 7. Have connected the Eltron with the computer via a USB. Waring comes up as 'does not recognise this font' Have installed driver for the Eltron and fonfs.
 Any suggestions as to why it does not print or recognise (have set the printer as default)

If you are running 32-bit Windows 7 the XP driver may install in compatibility mode, otherwise you will need a new printer.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>USB 3.0 devices are backward compatible with USB 2.0.&nbsp;Therefore your USB 3.0 flash drive should work connected</p>
<p>to your USB 2.0 PC. (It will only work at USB 2.0 specs, but it should work.)</p>
<p>The only way to get USB 3.0 ports on a notebook, laptop, tablet PC is to buy a system that already has USB 3.0 ports.</p>
<p>Desktop PC motherboards that&nbsp;only come with USB 2.0 ports can usually be upgraded to USB 3.0 by simply installing&nbsp;</p>
<p>a USB 3.0 PCI add in card to one of the motherboards available PCI slots (or buying a new Desktop motherboard</p>
<p>with USB 3.0 ports.)</p>
<p>However, if you don't mind the much slower USB 2.0 performance your USB 3.0 Flash drive will have it should still</p>
<p>be detected &amp; work connected to your USB 2.0 PC. This is a hardware issue, no update or software alone&nbsp;can</p>
<p>change a USB 2.0 port into a USB 3.0 port.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've encountered a similar situation when using Windows 8.1 OS where I was unable to figure out how to initialize a brand new, raw, unformatted, 1TB HGST 7K1000 HDD placed in an external SATA3 2.5" HDD&nbsp;to USB 3.0&nbsp;enclosure. Like in your situation, I could
 easily find the drive in the Windows Device Manager but couldn't figure out how to use the Windows 8.1 OS Computer Manager to first initialize the drive &amp; then format it for use.</p>
<p>I wound up purchasing a third party software application called Partition Magic (the free version didn't allow initializing of brand new, raw drives for formatting). That was the solution that worked for me. In hind site,&nbsp;I&nbsp;was new to using Windows 8.1 OS&nbsp;and
 most likely didn't need to purchase a third party Disk Management software application simply to initialize and then format a brand new, raw&nbsp;drive.&nbsp;However, I&nbsp;couldn't figure out how to initialize the new, raw drive to then format it using the Windows&nbsp;OS Computer
 Management Tool,&nbsp;under Storage, Disk Management feature.</p>
<p>I was able to open the Windows&nbsp;OS Computer Management Tool, Disk Management feature but the drive did not show up in there to initialize it for formatting. I was never able to get&nbsp;help from Microsoft&nbsp;Windows Support on this common problem where brand&nbsp;new,
 raw,&nbsp;external USB 3.0 drives only show up in Windows Device Manager, but not in the Disk Manager to enable initializing then formatting the drive for use.</p>
Partition Magic (paid version) worked for me given this scenario.

<blockquote>is it possible to turn a picture into&nbsp; pdf file?</blockquote>
<p>==================================<br />
Try the following...<br />
<br />
Download and install the freeware PrimoPDF</p>
<p>(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System <br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)</p>
<p>PrimoPDF<br />
<a href="http://www.primopdf.com/index.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.primopdf.com/index.aspx</a><br />
(if you only have a few files to convert...you can even<br />
do it online)</p>
<p>With your new program installed...select your photos<br />
in any image viewer/editor and go to...File / Print.<br />
<br />
On your Print screen...open the drop window and<br />
select PrimoPDF as your printer.<br />
<br />
Click...OK...now you will see the PrimoPDF screen<br />
and you can browse to a save folder.<br />
<br />
When you click...OK..your .pdf file will be created<br />
in your save folder.</p>

<p>Hello, Vanessa!</p>
<p>If you want to join your friend's realm, check if he is listed as a friend on your Xbox Live account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also there are some restrictions on Xbox Minecraft. You may want to check if your friend has bought again the subscription for that realm. If this doesn't work, then ask your friend to invite you to the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this was helpful!</p>

<p>Everything else is running and showing up as expected.</p>
<p>Both are running on Windows server 2016 core (the admin center as a single VM).</p>
<p>Is there a prerequisite on server core for the admin center to show the Hyper-V functions?</p>

    <title>Automatic sign-in WITHOUT Kinect&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pete8475  say:</h3>
<h2>            Automatic sign-in WITHOUT Kinect&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>How do I setup my Xbox account to automatically sign-in when I power on the Xbox One WITHOUT the Kinect plugged in?<br />
<br />
My wife does not like the idea of a camera in our living room so I don't get to use the Kinect, it sits in the Xbox One box in my basement.&nbsp; More than once I've mentioned to her that it would be nice to have this component of the Xbox One hooked up but she
 is not willing to have a camera in the living room regardless of whether or not it actually does anything.<br />
<br />
There's an old saying that goes "Happy wife = happy life" so I'm not going to argue the point with her any further.</p>
<p>So after having the machine for a while I've reached the point where I'm a bit sick of having to navigate through various menus to sign in EVERY time I turn the machine on.&nbsp; So is there a way to have my account sign-in automatically without Kinect?&nbsp; It is
 the ONLY account on the machine.</p>

<p>I don't even have my kinect hooked up because I don't want more clutter and I completely agree with you. &nbsp;This thing needs auto sign in. &nbsp;I tried the kinect and the auto sign in is not that great, it doesn't work all the time. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Another way to make people use the kinect. &nbsp;*** Microsoft, just let the damn thing sign me in. &nbsp;With or without kinect, this should be automatic because the kinect sign in has many flaws.</p>
<p>I have a feeling they will add this in the future, when people start complaining.</p>

<p>Even worst case scenario, if you don't want to use the Kinect, all you have to do is have it save your password and then go to sign in an select your account. &nbsp;It's literally a 5 second process. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And not to sound inflammatory, but by choosing to not use the Kinect, you are really missing out on some great features that the system as a whole has to offer. &nbsp;I honestly don't know where I'd be without my voice commands. &nbsp;If I had a complaint at all,
 or suggestion, I'd want the ability to rename my system so I could call it what I want and then tell it what I want to do. &nbsp;:)</p>

<p>Nope, just a realist. &nbsp;Is it really worth all the "boo hoo" to take the 5 extra seconds to choose your profile to sign in if you don't want to use the Kinect feature? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Simple fact of the matter is you guys are in the vast minority here. &nbsp;As is evidenced by the length of this thread over the last couple months.</p>

<p>I agree with bigben....the Xbox was designed for it to use the Kinect...that's why it was all bundled together. &nbsp;Anyone else understand the logic of the fear of cameras? &nbsp;I mean, most (if not all) cell phones nowadays has cameras on them. &nbsp;Watch out! &nbsp;Samsung
 is out to spy on you!!! haha</p>

                    I followed the following steps to move my Program Files and Program Files (x86) from my C: drive to my D: drive:
<div><br />
</div>
<div><span>"You would need to boot into safe mode, then take admin rights over those folders(google how), then copy
 the folders to the new drive then delete the original folders. Now, go to the folders on the new drive, right click, and click "create shortcut". Put the shortcuts for both folders where they were originally. Now you can reboot to get out of safe mode. windows
 will see the shortcuts and continue to operate normally, because they let it "pretend" that the files are still right where they should be."</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;All worked well until it came time to delete the Program Files and Program Files (x86) folders from my C: drive so that I could create more free space on my C: drive. &nbsp;The shortcuts to the new position of the copied folders on the D: drive are resident
 on the C: drive, however, when I go to delete the Program Files and Program Files (x86) on the C: drive I am given an error message that says:</div>

</div>
<div>"The action can't be completed because the folder or a file in it is open in another program. &nbsp;Close the folder or file and try again". &nbsp;I need to create free space on my C: drive as soon as possible - pls help!!!</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moving the Program Files folder to another drive is not supported in Windows.Usually, there is no method to do this without issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I would recommend posting your query in the TechNet Forums.The issue you posted would be better suited in the TechNet Forums.</p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope the information is helpful.</p>

    <title>Include Music, Video and Photo from External Hard Drive Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jonathanparnaby  say:</h3>
<h2>            Include Music, Video and Photo from External Hard Drive Issue</h2>
                    <p>I've recently bought a Surface RT and 500GB Western Digital External Hard Drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The external hard drive is primarily used to store all of my videos, music and photos to sea space on my surface.&nbsp; I've learnt that you can right click on the folders in the Ext hdd D: drive and click "Include in Library" so you can view the content within
 the applicable modern&nbsp;UI app within Windows RT.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At first glance this seemed to have worked but upon closer inspection&nbsp;I experienced some strange things listed below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Music App - (4388 files) Quite a few albums are picked up and I can manage music however some albums I have stored in folders which are .mp3 format as well&nbsp;aren't picked up.&nbsp; Its currently showing around 572 songs.</p>
<p>Video App - (805 videos) None of the videos are stored within the "My Videos" and I can only&nbsp;open the video if I click "Open or Play Something".</p>
<p>Photo App - (6762 photos) Most of the photos are displayed but sometimes it shows the folder but then says there is nothing inside the folder when there is and its clearly there going through the desktop Windows explorer. Could be the amount I have takes
 a long time to fully recognise that's its there.</p>

    <title>Trouble printing Monochrome &#40;Black and White&#41; - New printer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tburd23  say:</h3>
<h2>            Trouble printing Monochrome &#40;Black and White&#41; - New printer New drivers Fresh instal</h2>
                    <p>I purchased an Epson XP-420 for at home printing. When I originally brought it home a couple weeks ago and installed it everything worked fine. I could print from Firefox and PDF documents in B&amp;W with no problems. Colors as well. Now, I can no longer print
 correctly from the computer. It either prints out totally blank pages or the pages have some black marks where it was going to print but never really did.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I use the copy feature&nbsp;it recreates Monochrome perfectly. Additionally, the test page comes out perfect as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All ink cartridges are full.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done all windows updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've installed the latest Epson drivers for the XP-420.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've installed the latest firmware for the XP-420.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've went into the printer settings and reset to default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've powered everything down. Unplugged. Re-plugged. Repowered. Nothing....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've went into the printer settings and selected print directly to printer instead of spooling.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've went into Printers &amp; Other Devices and did the right click and troubleshoot. It tells me everything is fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have any clue what is going on? I really need to print some documents and I've spent roughly 6 hours trying to figure this out. Generally, I'm a very patient person. However, this has begun to chip away at that patience as one could imagine.</p>

            It's not only that game. Also other games have the same exact error. I've recently reinstalled Windows 7 so it's brand new installation. Also I have checked that page and I have the .dll in the correct C:\Windows folder.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: Maybe I need the newest version of the .dll? Can I download a new version anywhere?<br />

<h2>            Computer crashes and now all apps and data missing</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Apps and features on Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer crashed last night after working very well.</p>
<p>This morning, I woke up to a "fresh" computer that had seemingly erased all of my data. Found out later that it was likely an update that happened and I just had to locate my folders again and reassign them.</p>
<p>This was NOT my problem. The problem seems to be that most of the apps (that I actually really liked) seem to be GONE! The film and video player, photo viewer, netflix, and even the store app are completely gone! Many many more are gone, but those pop out
 at me. What the heck happened??? When I go to Settings, under Apps and Features, most of the apps show as Unavailable and I'm unable to do anything with them on there... What do I do??? This is extremely upsetting, after being very pleased with Windows10.</p>

</p><p>To answer your original questions:</p>
<p>1. My computer was in sleep mode, and when I went to use the internet for school work it froze.</p>
<p>2. I was able to locate all the data, for some reason all of them had been reassigned to a different "User" tab</p>
<p>3. As far as I can tell yes, only to Windows Store apps, especially seeing as I can't even locate the actual Windows Store.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for keeping us posted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mentioned that you are unable to perform the system restore due to the error message. VSS stands for Volume Shadow copy Service. This is a service necessary to perform a system restore. In order to check if the service is disabled or stopped, I would
 suggest you to try the steps below and check:</p>
<p>1. Press Windows key + R</p>
<p>2. Type services.msc and press enter to open the services window.</p>
<p>3. Locate Volume Shadow Copy, right click and select "properties".</p>
<p>4. Change the startup type to automatic and save the changes. </p>
<p>5. Try performing the system restore again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, the appwiz.cpl command is a shortcut to open programs and features. You can try these steps to open the programs and features window.
</p>
<p>1. Press Windows key + R</p>
<p>2. Type control and press enter to open control panel.</p>
<p>3. Type programs and features in the control panel search box and open it.</p>

<h2>            Sharing folders in local network to &#34;specific people&#34; when MS account the same</h2>
                    <p>I have PC and notebook attached to same Microsoft account (log in options set to not asking me for password every time I starting PC or notebook). When sharing folders in "Specific people" there 3 options in dropdown list: my Microsoft account, Everyone
 and "Create new user". With permission set to Read/Write to my Microsoft account I can see folders from other device, I can see folder but cannot get access ("Windows cannot access XXX"). With permission set to Read/Write for "Everyone" I can share and get
 access folders from another device (after fixing issue with "<strong>Function Discovery Resource Publication</strong>" service startup to Automatic from default Manual).</p>
<p>How to share folders between my devices in local network when both set to same account? Sharing to "Everyone" doesn't feel right.</p>

<p>Hi s73,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are several ways to share your files and folders over a network. I agree that sharing it with "Everyone" doesn't feel right as everyone connected to the same network will be able to access. You've mentioned that you've set a Read/Write access to your
 Microsoft account and you can view the folder from other device but unable to access it. Have you also shared the folder from your other device and set the same permission to your Microsoft account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyhow, aside from the two options you've tried, you can also share your files/folders through the
<strong>Sharing Properties</strong>, the <strong>Advanced Sharing</strong>, or through the
<strong>Share tab in File Explorer</strong>. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Sharing Properties</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>In your File Explorer, right-click the folder you want to share and click <strong>
Properties</strong>.</li><li>Go to the <strong>Sharing</strong> tab, and click <strong>Share...</strong> under
<em>Network File and Folder Sharing</em>.</li><li>Select your user account account and click <strong>Share</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Done</strong>, then <strong>Close</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Advanced Sharing</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>In your File Explorer, right-click the folder you want to share and click <strong>
Properties</strong>.</li><li>Go to the <strong>Sharing</strong> tab and click <strong>Advanced Sharing...</strong> button.</li><li>Tick the box<strong> Share this folder</strong>. You can also adjust the number of users and edit the Share name of the folder.</li><li>Click <strong>Permissions</strong>. If you can't see your account name there, then click
<strong>Add</strong>, and set the permission.</li><li>Click<strong> Apply</strong>, then <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>For other options in sharing your files, please check out&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4027674/windows-10-share-files-in-file-explorer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Share files in File Explorer</strong></a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have additional questions, or if the issue persists after the troubleshooting steps above, please let me know by replying to this thread. This way, I'll get notified and respond back to you as soon as I can.<br />
</p>
<p>Regards.</p>

            After removing permission for Everyone in Sharing I tried to add permission to my Microsoft account in Advanced Sharing. When I typing account name as my email it recognizes, adds my name and I can set permission to Full Control. Unfortunately when I trying
 to open this folder from notebook I have error "Windows cannot access ...". I've tried to add permission by Computer Name, but in locations there is only my PC and error about not in domain. So it seems new sharing system requires or access for Everyone, different
 Microsoft account per every device I have or domain system for my local network.<br />
All I need is sharing folders between my computers. Homegroup was terrible (biggest problem was to share when it cached removed PC with settings somewhere, after chain of restarts in proper order I finally made it working), but it worked.

<p>Thanks for the feedback. Basically, there are changes to the file sharing over a network in Windows 10 including the removal of HomeGroup as described on this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4092694/windows-10-changes-to-file-sharing-over-a-network" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon searching about the issue you have, I've bump into a thread where in the customer has logged in on two computers using the same Microsoft account. By enabling network discovery on his desktop, the user was able to access the files on his laptop. The
 same goes when he enabled network discovery on the laptop, he was able to access the files on his desktop. Please try this on your end and let's see if it works. Follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Navigate to<strong> Control Panel &gt; Network and Sharing Center</strong>.</li><li>In the left pane, click <strong>Change advanced sharing settings</strong>.</li><li>Under <em>Change sharing options for different network profiles</em>, expand the
<strong>Private</strong> category.</li><li>Under <em>Private</em>, tick the <strong>Turn on network discovery</strong> option.</li><li>Under <em>File and printer sharing</em>, tick <strong>Turn on file and printer sharing</strong> option.</li><li>Expand the <strong>All networks</strong> category.</li><li>Under <em>Public folder sharing</em>, tick the <strong>Turn on sharing so anyone with network access can read and write files in the Public folders</strong> option.</li><li>Click <strong>Save changes</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know how it goes so we can further check on the issue.</p>
<p>

<p>Everything was set except "<strong>Turn on sharing so anyone with network access can read and write files in the Public folders".
</strong>I tried, but my custom shared folder without "Everyone" access still not accessible. And public folder probably those public folders in Users. And "access for anyone" exactly for anyone, it has nothing to do to access as Microsoft account user.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t update my password</h2>
                    I am trying to update my password out of fear that someone may have access to my account. My email is very important and I need it for many things; When I try to update my password the page for a code to be sent to my phone will not allow for the code
 to be sent to my phone, it says, "That doesn't match the phone number associated with your account. The correct number ends in 50." But when I click the option for "Not have access to any of these," and it takes me to the page to place a phone number when
 I put mine in it says, "That phone number is already associated with your account." If my phone number is already associated with the account why won't it send me the code to my phone to update my password?&nbsp;

<p>Yes its an xbox hard drive fat xbox 360 as well i was hoping with the new xbox update today it will work. I used my usb hard drive to test it out but got a status code 416B - 4174 - 1680 - 0500 - C000 -0032. So the update would not even take on the xbox
 360 and i did not want to use my xbox hard drive on this xbox. Its been working fine on my friends xbox and took the new update without a problem im just lost. Why does the same hard drives i had on my xbox will work perfectly fine on other xbox 360 but gives
 me tons of problems on mine?</p>

            Sure. &nbsp;In the left hand side pane of your Explorer, right-click in a blank space and choose "Show all folders" for the Windows 2000/XP style file list.

            <p>The best that I've found is setting up a shortcut to focus on your file folders.&nbsp; Copy a Windows&nbsp;explorer shortcut.&nbsp; Alter the Target property to</p>
<p>C:\Windows\explorer.exe /n,/e,/root,C:\Users\YourUserName</p>
<p>or, for example, </p>
<p>C:\Windows\explorer.exe /n,/e,/root,C:\Users\YourUserName\Documents</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You'll find a few odd effects from this including the search function automatically opening up a new window.</p>

<p>If you decide that you don't want to get Preview updates anymore you can opt out in the Xbox Preview Dashboard app. You won't be removed from the program right away; it won't happen until the current update is released to the general public. If you change
 your mind, you can always re-register your console later using the Xbox Preview Dashboard app.</p>
<p>Here's how to remove your console from the Xbox Preview program:</p>
<p>1.Open the Xbox Preview Dashboard app.</p>
<p>2.Select Registration.</p>
<p>3.Under Manage flights, select Change. </p>
<p>Note If you have more than one console in the program, you can change their statuses by using Manage other consoles.</p>
<p>4.Under Manage programs, select Remove, and then select Submit. You'll be prompted to select a reason for leaving.</p>
<p>If you run into any issues, post in the private Xbox Early Access forums for help.</p>
<p>Note Your console won't be removed from the program until the current Preview update is released to the general public, so it won't happen right away. Until then, your console's status will show as Pending.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Repair looping on Automatic Repair couldn&#39;t repair your PC</h2>
                    <p>Hello Microsoft Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having a issue with my Windows 10 partition which would no longer boot. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It all started while I was using Windows 10 and suddenly got a system notification that disk errors were found and that a reboot was required to correct them. I have the feeling (but no evidence) that some heavy Windows 10 update was going on and being applied
 as it occurred on the 3 other Windows 10 PCs I have over the last couple of days -- which would be confirmed by below Srt message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I let the PC reboot and could see chkdsk finding issues/errors and as a result
<strong>truncating </strong>some 3 files which were only identified by a number (an index?). Once completed I rebooted which went through "Preparing Auto-Repair..." then "Diagnosing your PC..." followed by the
<strong>Automatic Repair </strong>process saying it <strong>couldn't repair my PC
</strong>and keeping looping into that mode whatever boot option (F8) I would try. The Automatic Repair error message pointed at a file SrtTrail.txt which contains as last paragraph:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Test Performed:&nbsp;<br />
---------------------------<br />
Name: Check for pending package install<br />
Result: Completed successfully. Error code = &nbsp;0x4<br />
Time taken = 562 ms</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason why I can report the above file extract is because my PC has dual boot, Windows 10 (default) and Windows 7 (luckily still working -- running right now).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The <strong>boot menu</strong> is working correctly : at power-up I can still select either Windows 10 or Windows 7 and for each of them press F8 and select boot options. However when selecting any of the Windows 10 "degraded" modes (safe mode, no network,
 etc), it enters the auto-repair loop. Also, once in the Windows 10 boot options, pressing F10 (other options) then F1 (Recovery) I have the option to perform the
<strong>Startup-Repair</strong>, which I also tried (and let it reboor 3 times), but ended with another eventual message in SrtTrail.txt file saying:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Startup Repair has tried several times but still cannot determine the cause of the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Beyond the initial <strong>chckdsk </strong>here above, all subsequent chkdsk on whatever partition completed error-free. Besides, CrystalDiskInfo reports a 100% healthy disk from the SMART info of the disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran <strong>sfc/scannow</strong> from a Windows 7 admin cmd prompt after going to the Windows 10 partition in its Windows\System32 folder to make it presumably run the right sfc.exe but I have no means to determine if the correct Windows installation was
 validated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have made an attempt to recover a former set of <strong>configuration </strong>
files from Windows 10 by copying the \Windows\System32\config\RegBack\*.* which all had a time stamp of 10 days ago, to&nbsp;\Windows\System32\config after first saving the files to be overwritten, but that didn't help much either, so I copied the saved files back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last but not least and probably most puzzling (at least disappointing) is that when selection in the Windows 10 boot options (F8) the Recovery environment (F10 &gt; F1) and there selecting "<strong>System Restore</strong>" from the Advanced Options, Windows
 could not find any former Restore Point (!?) while I'm sure there must be at least half a dozen of them !</p>
<p>
</p><p>Among the remaining Advanced Options, I didn't try yet the last one titled <strong>
Go back to previous version</strong>, as I wasn't sure where this would lead me (and that would presumably not be based on a System Restore safe point). Any hint here ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've found a quite same former post in this forum <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/windows-cannot-start-during-automatic-repair/f6ea1644-1b17-43a1-9b8b-b9a8c7eae878" title="Windows cannot start during automatic repair">
<strong>here</strong></a>, without actual resolution for the issue : the user ended up reformatting and reinstalling Windows from scratch, wich I would very much like to
<strong>avoid</strong> !</p>
<p>Finally, I also did try the Microsoft <strong>Answer Desk </strong>(Virtual Agent) but the identified suggestions were concerning issues/symptoms pretty far away from my situation.<br />
</p>
<p>I'm seeking for some expert advice to hopefully walk me though a recovery process (as I do have an operational Windows 7 running on the same PC) without having to reinstall Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot !</p>

<p>Restore Points won't really help you anyway, they are just backups of a handful of key system and registry files. Great for a quick undo if you make a bad change, but about useless if the system can't boot up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The go back to previous version actually rolls back to the previous Windows 10 version (like 1511, 1607, or 1703 "Creator Update"). &nbsp;It's not a bad choice to try if it failed while installing a major update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know you don't like it, but a fresh clean install is going to be the fastest path to guaranteed victory. &nbsp;Roughly 15 minutes to install, then another 30 minutes or so installing your favorite browser and software and such. &nbsp;An hour, maybe two tops for
 a perfect install, versus spending hours/days/weeks otherwise (not to mention how much time you've already spent doing all the work you mentioned above without success).</p>

<p>Hi Shawn, thanks for going through my case description and providing this advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will give a try to the Go Back option just before anything more drastic -- I think indeed it was trying to apply the Creator's update -- hopefully the "former" version is still there somewhere. As this is a laptop (Dell XPS 17), Windows 10 has always had
 much more troubles applying major upgrades (btw I still have a pretty decent 4y old Lenovo laptop which could not be upgraded to Windows 10 at all), I wouldn't be surprised that this major upgrade is hitting some laptop specific issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually I do have two system images from this disk : a Win 7 Backup &amp; Restore system image dated 1 month ago, and a Win 10 Backup &amp; Restore system image from 2 weeks ago. So I first went to re-apply only the last saved Win 10 partition from its Win 10 B&amp;R
 backup but I was stunned to discover that Win 7 B&amp;R wouldn't be able to read/recognize the .vhdx made by the Win 10 B&amp;R (even though the Win 10 B&amp;R is actually named with "Window 7" between brackets) ! How disappointing is that... for such a crucial feature.</p>
<p>However, when I booted on a Win 10 install disk (from a virtual DVD attached to USB port) to use Win 10 own B&amp;R, the 'Repair my PC' option would allow me to 'Restore from a previous image', but this would only go through a re-format of the disk and apply
 the whole system image with all (4) embedded partitions! I saw no means to select only the Win 10 partition :-(( ... How disappointing is that !?</p>
<p>PS: I certainly prefer to avoid going back also on my Win 7 partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read what you said wrt to a clean reinstall but I beg to immensely disagree with you about the impact. Sure, getting the OS back, the browsers and some off-the-shelf software is a matter or one day or two. But when you have tons of customisations, shortucts,
 tools &amp; utilities, automation and productivity improvements implemented over past years (6 years for Win 7 working like a breeze, 18 mo for Win 10 progressing nicely), not even mentioning the tweaks implemented to have this specific Dell XPS laptop stable
 under both OS, I can tell you such a re-install is no small feat, as far as my computer environment is concerned at least.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the above reasons, on top of any actual evidence of why it actually failed, make me prefer to restoring from a functional backup first of all, before considering a clean install -- by the way, in this latter case, what is the OS reactivation process
 and will it be "automatic" or do I have to take some specific steps ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll keep exploring my options and update this thread as I progress !</p>

<p>As looking deeper into the \windows\system32\drivers folder shows a whole bunch of files with zero length, I'm resuming to a more drastic instervention than somply recovering the missing/corrupted files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will first of all safeguard all relevant content from my Win 10 partition before engaging in any further action. For info, here is the structure of my disk where both Win 7 and Win 10 partitions reside. Yes I kept some unused 20 GB for a future Ubuntu
 partition and could use it in interim step if you advise me so.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I'll then try the <strong>Go Back to previous version</strong> from the Recovery environment at boot time and if Win 10 can boot again (even in safe mode) run a
<strong>sfc/scannow</strong> and a <strong>DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth</strong> &nbsp;if required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keeping you updated !</p>

<p>Alllllright. The attempt to use the <strong>Going Back to previous version</strong>&nbsp;from the Recovery environment nicely
<em><strong>failed</strong></em>, as Stephen (here above) rightfully anticipated.
</p>

<p><span>PS</span>: isn't there something wrong here ? Like keeping "previous version" files safe before applying an update that could fail seem a must to me ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>More suprisingly, even the <strong>Reset this PC</strong> option from the Recovery environment, whether
<em>with our without </em>keeping my personal files and apps, <em><strong>also failed</strong></em> !</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/70ba0ea4-f140-429f-8f38-ae572968bcd6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/70ba0ea4-f140-429f-8f38-ae572968bcd6" /></a></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">PS</span>: Now this got me completely off guard. What is the point of reserving gigabytes of disk space and whatnot if a PC Reset feature can not survive when system folders of the OS get messed-up in such a way that
 it can't boot anymore !?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going now to try restoring images from a former system image (i.e. overwriting all partitions on that SSD volume with their 4 back'ed-up partitions), using a Windows 10 installation media.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sigh....</p>

<p>Time for likely last update to close this topic/adventure.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader1"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Summary</span>:
</p>
<p>Recovery from Microsoft backup <em><strong>miserably failed </strong></em>as, in the end, I discovered that the backup itself was also corrupt. Additionally, the Restore process from Microsoft Backup &amp; Restore is
<strong><em>so rigid </em></strong>that I lost much more data than should have been, even impacting
<em>another </em>disk. Only option left was then to reinstall from scratch. As anticipated, this took much more time than expected in elapsed, and there is still customisation ahead before reaching close to where I initially was.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader1"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Details</span>:</p>
<p>For the sake of clarity, my Win 10 image/system backup embodies 4 vhdx files (along with several other XML files), which were presented by Microsoft Recovery as {insert-huge-GUID-here}, C:, X:, D:.</p>
<p>After several attempts in using Microsoft Backup &amp; Restore to use this Windows 10 system image which I had saved two months go, I have to draw several
<strong>pretty severe conclusions</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Windows 7 B&amp;R is not capable to use/show a Windows 10 backup. Win 7 creates a
<strong>.vhd</strong> file per volume, while Win 10 creates <strong>.vhdx</strong> files. Despite Windows 10 is officially out since more than 2 years, Microsoft did not manage to make Windows 7 capable to restore backups taken by Windows 10. This is sad and
 inconvenient but was not a blocking factor: indeed even if I couldn't use my alive Win 7 partition to attempt to restore the corrupted Win 10 partition, I could boot to the Windows 10 Recovery Partition or Windows 10 installation media, but that left much
 less flexibility in examining my options or what I was doing;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Beware, instead of using the handy <strong>volume label</strong>, MS B&amp;R would present you the partitions to restore as
<strong>drive letters </strong>which is imho pretty stupid as these drive letters depend on the partition/OS you are booting on, while the volume name remains unchanged. And yes, this volume name information
<strong>is</strong> available in the backup XML files next to the backup .vdhx files ! So it's just plain laziness or stupidity, as you prefer, especially volumes never mounted as a drives with a letter and are therefore identified with a rather useless GUID.
 Reading the .vhdx files with a 3rd party tool (7zip) allowed me to identify that ùy GUID volume was actually the Windows Recovery partition (which has a meaningful volume name nevertheless). And that the C: was the Win 10 partition, X: was the Win 7 partition,
 and D: was my Data disk (another physical disk in the computer).</p>
<p>Of course, examining the .vhd files and comparing with Win 7 B&amp;R would show the same drive letters but their content is not the same (OS partitions are swapped). This confusion would not exist if the volume label were used, and was cleared thanks to the
 fact that I had another live OS available from where I could examine the actual backup files (vhd, vhdx and associated xml's);</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) When restoring with MS Recovery, it is a kind of <strong>all-or-nothing restore</strong>. You can not choose to restore only a specific partition. It either has to be: the "minimum number of partitions for Windows to boot" or "all data". The "minimum"
 option would besides not let you adapt to your reality -- so&nbsp; no way to restore only the Win 10 partition backup and overwrite the corrupted Win 10, despite these are all separate vhdx files ! And in my case things got even worse: as I had changed the partition
 size and despite there was room enough available for the restore, *all* partitions were restored from backup, including my Windows 7 one which I absolutely did not want to overwrite !</p>
<p>How did that happen ? Well, as I discovered <em><strong>afterwards</strong></em>, the recovery would show you the drives it is going to recover in a (non-editable) edit field, but if you don't click in it and move the cursor to the right end of its content,
 you'll not see the various drive letters that are appended behind the big GUID that was displayed and that unwanted partitions will be taken along So that's how I lost my Windows 7 C: partition also. And, yes, worst of all, also the Data partition on my D:
 drive, overwritten by the 2 months old backup !!</p>
<p>
</p><p>In summary, a pretty crappy piece of software, with <strong>no flexibility</strong>, extremely
<strong>poor visibility </strong>and huge <strong>unreliability </strong>in what MS Recovery (you in the end) is
<em>actually </em>doing while attempting to restore partitions from its own backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) After the Recover restored in the end everything, I started to rebuild customisations and reinstall software on my Windows 10 partition and let the wave of Windows updates be applied. But after a couple of days I ran into the same disk corruption issues
 again ! Restored again from backup and proceeded step by step with many verifications before reinstalling anything -- though you just can't stop Windows from piling up and deploying the updates in your back (beyond a very limited time), but corruption got
 soon&nbsp; back again ! So as a final step I did a restore <em>for the third time </em>
of the Windows 10 partition, and when it rebooted I forced it to start in Safe Mode with Command prompt only. Then I ran a chkdsk, only to discover that more than 400 system files were found to be corrupt !! Wtf !?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, in the end, not only am I not able to recover what I want and forced to recover (overwrite) everything at a greater cost/loss, but the backup data I'm relying on is
<strong>not even reliable </strong>as consistency is neither checked at backup nor at restore time !? What is the point of taking a full system image every two months if it carries so many risks !?</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2"><em>b) Reinstalling Windows 10 from scratch</em></p>
<p>So I had no other option than a full reinstall of Windows 10 from the installation media which I created from Microsoft web site when the build 1607 was released. Despite this isn't precisely an old release, it still spanned 3 days for all subsequent update
 releases to be made available, downloaded and applied, till latest build 1703 which I'm running now.</p>
<p>In the meantime I've had again the various issues&nbsp;from the past, like the reset of keyboard and other regional settings between updates, which is a usual nightmare when you're not using the plain US default language and keyboard,&nbsp; telemetry tuning resets,
 Windows Search not working at all or then only partially (happens when you don't want Cortana to invade you, fixed now) or Edge being unstable (even now, this version of Edge is not at same version than Edge on my other PC where Windows 10 still runs fine)
 and doesn't behave the same way like dark theme not available everywhere. Apart from last minor glitches, I consider this new Windows 10 partition is stable -- I'm running a chkdsk and an sfc scannow
<em>every day </em>as additional check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm now in the closing process of reinstalling custom software and WSL environment I had, and I'm about near the end of it. I'm waiting to have reached a stable and reliable platform again for a couple of days before taking another full backup. But before
 that I first will have to:</p>
<p>a) try to identify what data I lost over the last two months that was savagely overwritten by the recover from backup and that I hopefully can recover otherwise</p>
<p>b) select another backup software offering actual flexibility, reliability -- oddly enough, I tried EaseUS Todo Backup and made a partition backup of Windows 10 onto my Data volume (D: drive) but it got overwritten when MS Recovery reapplied the full image
 ! (I actually used ETB in the past but found the interface confusing and could not resolve to implement it as main backup tool).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, as far as I'm concerned, unless you have any additional question which I'd be happy to answer, this closes the topic for me and puts an end on my updates of this thread.</p>

<p>Hello!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Excuse me for coming on this post so late but I've been trying to fix this error for a month now and nothing worked. I made a clean reinstall of Windows 10 like 3 times already, trying different partitions and when i finally make it start, it lets me do
 what i want on desktop for 5 minutes before giving black screen and entering infinite restart loop or automatic repair one with the same error as yours.</p>
<p>If you have any idea on what to do to repair my PC please help me when you can.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in anticipation!</p>

<p>Hi Cristian, I will do my best to assist. </p>
<p>Your situation seems rather radical to me! is my understanding correct that when you start your PC now you can only use it for 5 minutes ?</p>
<p>If yes, what have you done on this last reinstall to fix it ? Where is your installation file/iso coming from ?</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
