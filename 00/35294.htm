<h3> steve speedking  say:</h3>
<h2>            Video quality</h2>
                    <p>Hello. I hope somebody can help please with the following two questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1...... The video quality is very poor, is there a way to improve the quality, I find Skype is the only platform which provides such poor video feed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2...... How can I get high quality full screen video and allow for&nbsp;the smallest possible space&nbsp;for message text on screen at the same time?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope somebody can help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Much appreciated.</p>

<p>Hello again,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is about the raising the quality of the video, this will always depend on the Internet connection on how strong it is. My other question is, have you tried to ask this contact that has a HD cam if his/her video quality is smooth and clear?
</p>
<p>

<p>This is a very unsatisfactory reply - I asked a question - you asked me a question back! It reminds me of the first years of commercial computing when the magic computer people sat behind machine room doors and wouldn't tell anyone about what they did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spent forty years of my working life with computer firms taking the mystique out of computing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a little sympathy with your job. In the old days Microsoft operating systems manuals were very good. Now someone in Microsoft decided not to produce a manual. Finding things out when you are retired is a nightmare. You can follow things round and
 round on your various websites for ages - they need a fundamental rethink with a good editor in charge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have answered my question yesterday and accessed sxstrace.exe</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>

    <title>Both Alt keys do not work on keyboard - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Both Alt keys do not work on keyboard</h2>
                    This just happened 1 to 2 days ago. I was switched through tabs using the alt+Tab shortcut just fine and when suddenly, the alt key just stopped working. My Acer laptop overheats very easily and often power surges and shuts down. Now this isn't the problem
 as it happens from time to time. If it were, my Alt would have stopped working a long time ago.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have searched and searched to find solution to this problem and all of them just doesn't seem to work. I have tried the sticky keys option, sticky keys were already turned off. I have tried the regional language keyboard method, but the alt refused to function.
 I have the on-screen keyboard and all other keys seemed to work just fine except the Alt key.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have tried using Safe Mode to restore the system back to a point before the Alt key stopped working, and it did not help me solve my problem. I do not know what I did to lock the Alt function because I all did was to use the alt key and the mouse to give
 commands during a game like usual, and it was fine before this happened.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The only choice I have left to to reboot the laptop back to factory default, but I haven't tried it yet as I have no way of backing up my files in any means. Will please someone be able to help me solve this problem?<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Check Sony Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their forums about any known issues.<br />
<br />

<br />
===========================================================<br />
<br />
Check with System maker's support, on-line documentation,&nbsp;and/or forums as there probably<br />
are&nbsp;Hotkeys that enable and disable&nbsp;the touchpad functions. <br />
<br />
Settings for TouchPad are in Control Panel - Mouse (there might be several tabs with TouchPad<br />
entries)&nbsp;and some have a utility that loads in Notification Area near clock on lower right.<br />
<br />
==========================================================<br />
<br />
If needed : (make sure you have rebooted at least once if the above did not work)<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Mice and Pointing Devices - Double Click on Touch Pad -
<br />
Driver's Tab -&nbsp;Click Update Driver (this is may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying
<br />
drivers), now RIGHT CLICK&nbsp;on TouchPad and UNINSTALL.<br />
<br />
Then go to USB Controllers and UNINSTALL EVERYTHING except the category itself (all in it). REBOOT<br />
<br />
This will refresh the TouchPad Driver and the USB Stack. This does not stop the touchpad from<br />
working.<br />
<br />
Here is the similar procedure in XP, Windows 7 and Vista's is the same except we need to clear the specific device if present.<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310575" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310575</span></a><br />
<br />
Then go to System maker's site&nbsp;and get the latest touchpad drivers.<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click on - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
=================================<br />
<br />
This utility also helps to control the TouchPad :<br />
<br />
TouchFreeze<br />
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/touchfreeze/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://code.google.com/p/touchfreeze/</a><br />
<br />
Hope this helps.

            <p>Greg - thanks for your response. &nbsp;I started the steps in the Integrity Checklist - the first one being check for updates. &nbsp;Nothing will update. &nbsp;Java window pops up with "update" button but then it says I already have the latest version. &nbsp;Windows Defender
 window pops up but as with the Store apps, when I try to update it remains in "searching" status for a very long time and the update never installs. &nbsp;These are the first steps in the checklist you said to follow but I can't even get through them. &nbsp;Please advise.
 &nbsp;It is 2am and I'm going to continue working on this tomorrow. &nbsp; &nbsp;Please let me know what I need to do to be able to get through these first steps. &nbsp;Also, are any of the steps once implemented, able &nbsp;to create more issues with my Asus laptop ... I am a little
 leery about some of the steps so your reassurance would make me feel better! &nbsp;The error message I get when trying to update Windows Defender is that it could not update and check my internet connection (which is fine.) &nbsp;It says "connection failed" and"virus
 and spyware updates failed." &nbsp;I clicked the help buttion in the window but it is of no help. &nbsp;Is there a way I can hire you to connect to my computer to fix these issues?</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 and Lenovo ThinkPad T420 INTEL HD GRAPHICS 3000 GONE&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello I run a Lenovo ThinkPad T420 i7 vPro with 4 gb Ram with Nvidia NVS 4200M upgraded to windows 10</p>
<p>but it used to have Intel HD Graphics 3000 aswell when running windows 7.</p>
<p>Some of my programs worked better on the 3000 graphics but it has gone from device manager.</p>
<p>I have tried finding drivers for the Hd 3000 and they will not install in any modes of compatibility.</p>
<p>How do I get this back.</p>
<p>Otherwise Windows ten has been a very easy install and looks great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice or clarification would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Many thanks </p>

<p><span>Windows 10 is designed to be compatible with the vast majority of devices. However, if you are unable to install the drivers in compatibility mode then I would suggest you to check with the device
 manufacturer for compatible drivers.</span></p>

            Hi Deborah,
<br />
<br />If you have Microsoft Office installed, you can use Microsoft Word. A built-in application in Windows that you can use to create documents is WordPad. Just go to Start, look for Windows Accessories, and click WordPad, or you can just enter the phrase "WordPad" and click on it.
<br />
<br />If you have any additional questions or concerns, please feel free to let me know.       
        </p>

            Hi Deborah
<br />
<br />Windows comes with 2 applications that can be used to create typed documents
<br />
<br />1. NotePad - used for creating plain text files, with no great control over Font or document formatting - you can change the document font and set word wrapping - that is it!
<br />
<br />2. WordPad - it is like a cut down version of Microsoft Word, you have more control over document formatting and Font Style and size, it includes the option to insert images into the document - see the WordPad toolbar below:
<br />
<br />WordPad can save documents in a number of formats including, but not restricted to .rtf (Rich Text Format) and .docx (MS Word Document)
<br />
<br />If you cannot find these applications, type their name into Cortana search, then right click the result and select 'Pin to Start' for easy access to them. Alternatively you can find them in the 'All Apps' section of the start Menu under 'Windows Accessories'
<br />
<br />If you need the full functionality of MS Word, you need to purchase it, it does not come packaged with Windows 10 and has never come packaged with any previous version of Windows . . .
<br />
<br />If you need to edit PDF's on Windows 10 go to the App Store and Download the Free Xodo PDF Reader &amp; Editor
<br />
<br />Finally, if you need the full functionality of MS Word and cannot afford to buy it, download Open Office or Libre Office - they are not perfect, free software never is, but it will suffice for most

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might be experiencing this issue because Recycle Bin is corrupted.&nbsp;If your Recycle Bin is corrupted, you can face various problems when using it such as this behavior. Let's repair Recycle Bin by
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/ha-latn-ng/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
using the System File Checker tool</a>. This tool scans for corruptions in Windows system files and restores corrupted files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, we suggest that you manually delete the Recycle Bin folder on your computer. Each drive on Windows has a hidden and protected system folder named
<em>$Recycle.bin</em>. When you delete files or folders, they are moved to the Recycle Bin folder for holding. If you delete the Recycle Bin folder, Windows will automatically create a new
<em>$Recycle.bin</em> folder. However, all previous contents of Recycle Bin will be lost. Make sure to only do this step if you don't have any valuable data in Recycle Bin. Here are the steps:</p>

<h2>            need tv suggestions &#40;fast, no input lag&#41;</h2>
                    
<pre>hello,<br />I need to buy a tv for console gaming, and I was hoping for a recommendation. My budget is around 500 dollars (hopefully). I would like a flat screen, but it needs to have absolutely zero input lag, and fast picture (frame rate, or whatever. I don't know much about this stuff). Basically I need a tv that reacts instantly to my controller, and does not leave a smear when I move the screen fast. <br />Can anyone help me? <br />I would be ok with a 30 inch, but I might spend a bit more for a 35 inch, if it's a good deal.<br />Thanks!!<br />Mighty</pre>

<p>You may not believe me, but let me introduce you to the CRT. Yes that humble picture tube that has adorned the viewing masses for decades prior to digital displays. I am currently using a 30" Phillips, which is OK but a Sony would have been better.These
 direct view sets from &nbsp;a few years back have deep rich colors, inky blacks and no lag. none. zip. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The only cons are is space, weight and you will most likely max out at 1080i. Which should not be a deal breaker for you.</p>
<p>30" HDTV CRT sets can be found in classifieds and thrift stores for well under $150. but be an intelligent shopper and use your common sense if buying pre owned electronics.
</p>
<p>If you have more questions please ask.</p>

<p>Thank you for your input, but I've already figured this out. I've been using a CRT my whole life, and I was skeptical about whether I could find a good flat panel with unnoticeable lag. I bought the BenQ XL2420T, and I'm very happy with it. I don't notice
 any lag. After making the switch, I don't think it's necessary to stick to the CRT. Supposedly, my new monitor has 5.7 ms latency, and 2 ms refresh rate. I notice no difference at all, compared to my CRT, and the picture is way, way better. And, it's nice
 and light, easy to move around. </p>

<p>Any LG, Samsung, or Sony TV. The reason is these are the only TV's i know that can force themselves to act like a computer monitor and not only disable all enhancements (Game mode essentially) but also enable 4:4:4 chroma subsampling which is the best form
 of RGB that you can get.</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>The Xbox 360 supports full RGB and having this "PC mode" &nbsp;feature will cut lag down to at least 16ms or less. Its usually (at least on LG and Samsung TV's) is enabled by RENAMING the input label from something like HDMI 1 to a pre-defined name like "PC".</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>Plus, these are quality brand names. Along with Sharp, Panasonic, and the latter.</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>Insignia, Dynex, Emerson, Vizio (YES Vizio is NOT a quality brand), Element, etc. are all budget &nbsp;or in-house brands (for example, Insignia and Dynex are BEST BUY brands. BEST BUY isn't known for HDTV's lol) that do not contain good features for low input
 lag gaming.</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>In essence, you DO get what you pay for.</p>

<p>I have a sharp aquos LC-60E69U tv and there is no game mode, there is like 100 + ms of lag on tv, but I don't know how to reduce. If you have any recommendations of how to reduce either by switching cables, setting quality down, or changing tv settings please

<p>for me that tv would be unusable. 100 ms is way too much. I'm not sure, but I'd say there is no way to bring that down to usable lag. I would get a different tv for gaming.
</p>
<p>I got the BenQ 2420 (something like that). You can get the 2410 (i think) for under 200 dollars. Or, go with the Asus Evo, which is around 170 dollars. they are 24 inch tv's, but they have the same amount of pixels as your big screen tv, so they won't be
 any less clear. they are monitors. the Asus is used by the pros. the BenQ has 5.7 ms total lag. the Asus is even less, i think. They are great monitors, and they are easy to transport.. You might have to look into a sound system to go with them (the BenQ doesn't
 even have speakers). But, I use turtle beach headphones for my sound, anyway.</p>

<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>Basic things to reduce input lag would be running the Xbox 360 (or any capable device connected to your TV) at your TV's native resolution (could be 1080p or 1360x768 for a "720P TV"). This allows the Xbox 360 (which is most of the time FASTER at scaling
 an image than your TV is) to scale the game's rendering output to match your TV's native resolution so your TV can shut off its internal scaler.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Also, turning off "enhancements" that are named features such as "Dynamic Contrast/DC", "DNR/Digital Noise Reduction/Noise Reduction", "Dynamic Color/Live Color", etc. (Usually they are located in your Picture settings under "Advanced settings" or "Expert
 Control"). These settings are good for enhancing Standard def broadcast signals, but for all HD content that can be produced digitally, it does more harm than good. In this case, causing input delay.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Make sure to keep Display Discovery ON unless you see things not working with different apps on the Xbox 360 and in that case, you can experiment with it OFF. If your TV has a BLACK LEVEL setting, for PC-related (Yes the Xbox 360 is a type of PC) content,
 set to HIGH or NORMAL black level. You then set your Xbox 360's REFERENCE LEVEL to Expanded (Expanded also means 0-255 contrast range, Intermediate is about 8-248 which you should never use, Standard is 16-235). If your TV does NOT have a black level setting,
 Set it to Standard as it is the SAFE setting for contrast range since your TV might be expecting 16-235 already.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>The benefit of having a black level setting on an HDTV is that if you have a device capable of outputting the 0-255 full range rather than your HDTV processing the extra 0-16 and 236-255 levels, it can reduce input lag IMMENSELY. Alternatively, sending your
 TV a "PC" signal (1280x720p) instead of an HDTV signal (720p) will most likely make your TV set for that 0-255 full range, which for that case, you can use Expanded on the 360. You cannot force 720p to be a "PC" signal on the Xbox 360 or any other computer,
 but you can force it on your TV (look below for input label trick) if your TV supports it.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Sharpness and backlight settings are minimal for helping a bit towards input lag if set a bit lower than midpoint, but those "enhancement", black level, and native resolution tips are the most major solution to reducing input delay. Renaming your HDMI input
 "label" from HDMI 1 to "PC" could also act as a "Game mode" if your TV has such a feature.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I know this is a lot to comprehend, but doing these exact things over and over again for different HDTV's helped me figure out the general steps toward reducing input delay.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot for the help. I do have a few more questions, first off, it is a 120 hz tv and I know an Xbox runs 60 hz would it work best if my 120 hz level was on high, medium, low or off. Secondly is there another way manufacturers label black label. Finally
 would it work best if I were to set my Xbox to my tvs native resolution (1080p)?</p>
<p>The model of the tv is the sharp aquos LC-60E69U if you want to look further into the specs of the tv.</p>
<p>I will also post my current Xbox and tv settings soon.</p>

<p>120 hz level: off</p>
<p>My Xbox is currently running 1080i but the tv is native 1080p. I don't think I will be able to rename the input but it does have a pc input. The funny thing is that this model listed on other websites has 4 ms of response time under the specs, so I'm not
 sure if that is a new updated version of the model or that is incorrect specs.</p>

<p>A fews things, turning down your backlight will reduce power consumption and the overall life of your TV. You never really need it more than medium or even 1/3 of the max setting (on a 0-100 scale) unless you have straight sunlight shining on the TV. It
 also might help with strobing and low scanning rate that can cause an iilusion of input delay even though there really isn't.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Yeah, you want to keep that 120hz feature off as that is artificially creating frames to insert in between the true 60hz frames which creates a smoother experience but a large amount of input delay.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Are you using an HDMI cable or the Component HD AV cable for Xbox 360? You want to get the Xbox 360 to switch to 1080p if possible. If you're using a Component cable and your TV does not do 1080p over component like some don't, then you need to invest in
 an HDMI cable if not already using one.</p>

<p>LOL i ment to say INCREASE the overall life of your TV. woops.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Response time does not indicate input delay, although it does give a general idea of how quality the panel in your TV is. Anything 8ms and under is considered fine.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>If you have an Xbox 360 that doesn't have an HDMI port, then the next best thing would be that VGA AV adapter for Xbox 360. THAT will setup your TV for a PC connection almost without any configuration since VGA inputs are known as a PC-type of connection.</p>

            Emule.exe is a&nbsp;file sharing client. <br />
I suggest you uninstall the emule.exe then download and reinstall emule.exe to see if it helps.
<br />
You can download from many 3rd party sites or from where you originally downloaded it.
<br />

Thanks, <br />

<p>Sorry, it is not possible to convert .pdf files back to .docx format without special software that you would have to purchase and install. Your best bet is to restore the original versions from your external backup medium.</p>

<p>The critical question is: Are they MS Word files that you can modify in the usual fashion or are they Acrobat Reader files that you cannot modify? Your reports do not make this clear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can find out by launching MS Word, then using the File / Open function.</p>

            when I open my files, the pdf logo is in front of the document, the document has the name and .docx extension and when I open them they appear as pdfs. I have tried a program which will open the document as a docx ( that program is called "docx" but it
 opens only one file at a time as the original .docx. I want all my docx documents to open as their original docx format. for some reason that pdf "event" now opens all of them as pdf.

<p>We seem to be running around in circles. Why don't you upload one of these files to WeTransfer.com so that I can have a look at it myself and check its format?</p>

<h2>            Multiple Blue Screens of Death while playing games after upgrading to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Original title: msi gt 60 issues with windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>really having multiple problems with windows 10 on my msi gt60-20c laptop.&nbsp; getting multiple blue screens of death, gameplay stuttering and totally locking up my computer.&nbsp; all of the admins keep telling me to delete and reinstall graphic drivers (which
 has been done multiple times using various driver removal tools) but nothing has helped.&nbsp; I've updated every possible driver and am pretty well convinced that windows 10 just will not work with this&nbsp;laptop. &nbsp;I gave windows 10 my best shot, but i'm ready to
 say screw it and go back to windows 8.1, which worked fantastic with my machine.&nbsp; is there any way at all to retrieve my windows 8.1 product key and reinstall windows 8.1 back on my machine, or will I be forced (after trying my darndest to get win 10 tor work)
 to purchase windows 8.1 just for a product key?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks</p>

<p>^^ This. &nbsp;Go to your magic menu and check "Active Effects" and see if you have any red text. &nbsp;It's possible you contracted vampirism without realizing it. &nbsp;If not, you just have bad luck with the quest.</p>

<p>If you accidentally hurt any of them (like with an area effect spell that was meant for a different target) they will ALL go berserk and relentlessly try to kill you (even if you yield) while calling you a "monster." I know that's probably not what you did,
 but just a head's up...when I came back from that vampire castle, a group of vampires attacked them and I BARELY clipped one of them with a fireball while trying to help fight the vampires off. They all went insane on me and ended up killing me because I wouldn't
 fight back and they wouldn't accept my apology...</p>

            Hi christophercavosora 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />A. You should look for your old files in following folders 
<br />
<br />1. Go to C\Users and see if you are some other User who matches your user name. Get into this folder and see whether your files are there. 
<br />2. Go to C:\Windows.Old folder and look for your files here. 
<br />
<br />These folders will be hidden, so you need to make it visible by opening File Explorer &gt; View tab &gt; Check Hidden Items &gt; Restart your File Explorer.
<br />Now, you should traverse the folders appropriately to find your files.
<br />
<br />B. Login to your Onedrive and see if your files are there.
<br /><a href="https://onedrive.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/</a>
<br />
<br />C. If a file is deleted in Windows 10, it goes into Recycle bin.
<br />
<br />Can you look into Recycle bin and see whether the files are there or not? If yes, restore from there.
<br />
<br />If this is not in Recycle bin, you can try free version of Recuva to recover the files (note - it is not always successful, hence you require some luck also)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.ccleaner.com/recuva" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.ccleaner.com/recuva</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            Hi Christopher, this is happening much too often at the moment, you are logged into a temporary account . . . 
<br />
<br />Before you do anything or move any files around
<br />Restart (not shut down) your PC 3 or 4 times, this will fix this issue a lot of the time . .. 
<br />
<br />Otherwise: 
<br />
<br />Please open Windows File Explorer 
<br />Navigate to C:\Users 
<br />Do you see two user folders that look like yours?
<br />Open those folders and check inside Pictures, Documents . . . etc. and see if your files are there 
<br />
<br />If your files are there: 
<br />
<br />Create a new user profile with Admin privileges 
<br />Log into the new user profile 
<br />Copy all your data from the old profile to the new profile (Documents Library, Pictures Library . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />If you still have not found your files, look for a Windows.old folder on your C Drive, expand that to open the users folder contained inside - check there for your files, icons . . .etc. 
<br />
<br />If you do find your files . . . etc. there, copy them out as soon as possible as Windows will remove the Windows.old folder in time
<br />
<br />NOTE VERY IMPORTANT: Do Not copy your files into the Temporary profile you are currently in, when the situation is corrected, your files will be deleted with the Temporary Profile and will not be recoverable !!

            Hi Patrick.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Since it uses a motherboard similar to a laptop motherboard, an All-in-One uses a graphics chip instead of card and cannot be upgraded by consumer.  See HP's explanation here:  <a href="https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Desktop-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Graphics-Card-Upgrade-HP-Envy-27-All-in-One-Model-27-k350xt/td-p/6300254" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Desktop-Hardware-...</a>
<br />
<br />What I'd do is focus on Updating the Display driver from the PC or Display adapter maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model number or HP Serial Number from the sticker on the PC.  
<br />
<br />While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS, network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />For Display issues one fix that is working is to Roll back or Uninstall the Driver on the Display Device &gt; Driver tab, restart PC to reinstall driver.
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Registry Cleaner that claim to fix issues are all Snake Oil, stay away from them as they will cause<br />
severe issues while fixing nothing.<br />
<br />
Have you&nbsp;tried your mouse on another system? Have you tried another mouse on your system?<br />
<br />
===============================================================<br />
<br />
If you use a 3rd party mouse (such as Microsoft or Logitech) be sure to check for updated drivers<br />
manually at their site.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Mice and other Pointing Devices - double click on mouse -<br />
Driver tab - click Update Driver (this may do nothing and regardless you need to check at<br />
3rd party maker's sites) - then Right Click on UNINSTALL - REBOOT - this refreshes the driver<br />
stack.<br />
<br />
===============================================================<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.<br />
<br />
</strong>What antivirus/antispyware/security products do you have on machine? Include any you have EVER<br />
had on this machine including those you uninstalled (they leave remnants behind which can&nbsp;cause<br />
strange issues).<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<strong>Do these :</strong></p>
<p>Try these to clear corruption and repair/replace damaged/missing system files.<br />
<br />
Start - type this in Search Box -&gt;&nbsp; COMMAND&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top and RIGHT CLICK&nbsp; -&nbsp; RUN AS ADMIN<br />

To see all that is loading bootup - wait a few minutes without doing anything - then Right Click<br />
TaskBar - Task Manager - take a look at Appplications - Processes - Services - this is a quick<br />

<br />
===========================================<br />
<br />
<strong>Consider this an absolute must - manually updating your drivers.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<p>Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above<br />
is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

<h2>            Skype barely audible on Kindle Fire 10</h2>
                    <p>I have a brand new Kindle Fire 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sound works perfectly in all apps, except skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When people talk, I can barely hear them, and the same goes on the other side - they can barely hear me.</p>
<p>This is true only for video conversations. Voice only conversations seem to work fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other apps, including other communication apps, work well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice?</p>

<h3> sophics  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disk Drive&#47;Tray Problems on Xbox 360 Elite</h2>
                    
<p>Lately I have been having lots of problems with my disk drive on the Xbox 360 Elite my 1st problem is that the drive will rarely read games and a lot of the time it says Open Tray. Now my games are fine there are no scratches on
 them and no disk burns half of them are quite new e.g. Crysis 2 and still it will not read them. My second problem is that the disk tray closes by itself after 10 seconds of me opening it which is extremely annoying. The Xbox is currently lying on it's side.
 Please help.</p>

<h2>            Ruined</h2>
                    Skype has completely been ruined. No wonder no one is using it anymore. There is currently no way to edit the contact directory, which is silly. My personal phone number has changed so no longer is valid, but there it is still in the directory. I do not
 know how something so easy and fun to use could be changed into this degree of difficulty.

</p><p>You write,</p>
<p><em>My personal phone number has changed so no longer is valid, but there it is still in the directory.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you please kindly post back to clarify if you changed or updated (removed, replaced) this number in your profile, and approximately when you performed the update?&nbsp; I am not exactly sure what number you refer to, when you say, "my personal phone number."
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally speaking, I have recently encountered the same scenario. A number I used for years is no longer in service, yet there it is in my profile settings and still searchable in the directory, because in my case, I have not added and verified a new number.</p>
