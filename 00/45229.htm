                    when a contact calls me, my skype only rings once, then stops.&nbsp; My contact gets a message that I'm 'busy'.&nbsp; This has been happening for months. I have uninstalled skype &amp; re-installed . Updated, but I can't fix it

<p>I have skype version 12.13.257.0</p>
<p>It is happening on all calls. I have also heard yesterday a friend in London , England , is having the same problem.</p>
<p>I found a phone number on the net yesterday that offers help with skype.&nbsp; I rang them...an Indian sounding man answered and wanted $100 to fix my problem.&nbsp; I presumed a scammer, so I declined.</p>
<p>I hope someone has a solution.</p>

<p>I did as you suggested.&nbsp; Installed version 7.40.0.151 , I was 'online', but it did the very same thing.&nbsp; Rings once on my device and stops.&nbsp; My caller gets the message that I am busy and to leave a message. This happens on 2 computers, my iPhone and a kindle
 fire.&nbsp; So it's not my devices but skype or something wrong in my settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions??</p>

            I did everything you suggested, but could not fix it.&nbsp; A visitor had a look for me and found the problem.&nbsp; Somehow the option for
<strong>'call forwarding'</strong> had been <strong>'activated'.</strong>&nbsp; I didn't even know that was there, so it was not my decision to activate it.&nbsp; It solved the problem after switching that off.&nbsp; So if anyone else has this problem, check that setting.&nbsp;
 Thank you for your attempts to help me.

<p>
</p><p>I close all the apps, and then after a while, from anywhere from 10 minutes to several hours, I alt+tab to something and they're there again..</p>
<p>

<h3> the only name not taken  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1&#58; Hangs on startup or shut down</h2>
                    <p>I have a Dell Inspiron 15 running Windows 8.1. As&nbsp;best I can tell, all Windows updates have been installed, and all drivers are up&nbsp;to date&nbsp;(thus spake the update utility). When starting up, the system will hang within seconds of powering on. Or, should it
 actually boot without incident, it then will hang when powering off. The only resolution thus far has been to remove and then reinstall the battery pack. This can't be good for the computer over the long term.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two online sessions with Dell support have resulted in a big, fat FAIL. I also have tried the "Automatic Repair" function in Windows, to no&nbsp;avail.&nbsp;Other than that one minor (ahem) problem, I really like this machine, so I don't want to replace it. I will
 be grateful for any and all suggestions.<br />

            <p>You can go to file history using the search and select the desktop version which is the one that doesn't have a gear icon. From there you can create a System Image and back it up to an external drive. The issue with that is it will create a image of the
 current drive. If you can run dism /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth and sfc/scannow with no errors you should be okay using that to restore the new drive with your current state.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is it will copy corrupted files in thier current state. If you issue lies with the motherboard and most likely its the graphics card you shouldn't have an issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It takes about 30 min to create an image and goes up with larger drivers so you can always make the image and talk with the tech about using that to restore from. Just make sure you have all your keys for programs and files backup up. You can use file history
 for that too. Good luck glad they agreed to fix it. When you have an issue like that after a fresh install and drivers from windows update hardware is usually the issue</p>

            <p>Okay let me know how that goes and what was done to troubleshoot. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You can run this command the same way you ran the dism restore health command</p>
<p>
</p><p>sfc/scannow if that comes back with errors that can't be fixed run the dism command again then you can run the sfc/scannow to confirm the same issues were repaired.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you you continue to get errors with sfc/scannow after they are fixed chances are the hard drive is having issue. You can follow these steps to scan the drive and mark the sectors as bad so they aren't used. Since there is a possibility that you have a
 failing disk it is best to back up your data as soon as possible. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows key + X &gt; Command Prompt (admin)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have an <strong>SSD drive</strong>, run:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>CHKDSK /f</strong> </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you have a <strong>standard rotary hard drive</strong>, run this command instead:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>CHKDSK /f /r</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You'll get a message that the tool cannot be run because the disk can't be locked and whether you want to schedule a check on the next reboot. When you have saved your work and are ready to restart type Y&nbsp;and&nbsp;hit enter&nbsp;reboot immediately, or finish what
 you're doing and then restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If bad sectors are found&nbsp;it will mark them so that they can't be used. But if the tool appears to hang for more than a couple of hours at a certain percentage, then that would indicate that your hard drive is defective and will need to be replaced.

After you changed the password in RR did you also change it in windows live mail?&nbsp; The servers look correct (Im a RR user) but you still have the original password so of course it cant work<br />

    <title>Update Microsoft Basic Display Adapter for Nvidia Geforce - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> carl bengtstahl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Update Microsoft Basic Display Adapter for Nvidia Geforce</h2>
                    <p>I have installed Nvidia Geforce GTX 870M on my Alienware (Dell) computer but the Microsoft Basic Display adapter can't find the PCI\VEN_10DE&amp;DEV_1199&amp;SUBSYS_05511028.</p>
<p>That should be the address to Nvidia cards, but still, only Microsoft Basic Display is in the list of devices.</p>
<p>I've tried to install any and many of Nvidia drivers, but none of them have the right address in their INF-files. Still messages saying Nvidia installer cannot continue, or, Driver not compatible (because the Microsoft BD can't find the card).</p>
<p>Can I uninstall the Microsoft Basic Display Adapter or at least Update so it can find the right address to Geforce GTX 870M driver?</p>
<p>I simply need a driver for Nvidia Geforce GTX870M that have the "10DE" and "1199" and "05511028" in their Driver INF-files so the Microsoft driver for Basic Display can fint it!</p>

<p>The problem is apparently in the configuration of this Alienware M17x R4. According to DELL the chipset is not compatible with other Nvidia cards than 675M or 680M. I have reinstalled the 675M which was delivered with the computer but it crashes. That's
 the reason why I wanted to upgrade and switch to a newer card.</p>
<p>When testing the 675M card I got messages such as "The computer have run into a problem...." and DRIVER POWER STATE FAILURE and/or VIDEO TDR FAILURE. Is there any solution of this, or do I have to throw the 675M card in the garbage bin?</p>

    <title>Samsung ATIV Book 9 laptop cannot connect to MS Wireless Display - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Samsung ATIV Book 9 laptop cannot connect to MS Wireless Display Adapter in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Since installing Windows 10, I've lost the capability to attach my ATIV Book 9 to my Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter. It worked fine under Windows 8/8.1.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I took it to the MS Store and they did the same thing I did: reinstall drivers. Nothing worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The tech there said it is simply incompatible and that there is likely a bug in Windows 10 stopping it from working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone else confirm this?? or tell me what I need to do to make it work?</p>

</p><p>In one of your previous reply you have state that the issue occurs only when you install the latest drivers and it works great with the basic drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you please contact the manufacturer once to check if there is a conflict with the driver that is resulting the issue.

 charged November 18th for it. I am sick of calling and getting no answers and now I am out $600 dollars and have no console. Where is my damn Xbox One at!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>well first thing first</p>
<p>first when you order anything from MS store you need an ms account that being said sign in with the ms account that has your order in it</p>
<p>when you order from ms store you get an email with your order number</p>
<p>and it will be under your Order history connected with your ms store account</p>
<p>if you are only seeing it under paypal are you sure you didn't goto another etailer and order it there? in which caSE YOU do need to take it up with the etailer</p>
<p>you can go paypal in your region and look up the transaction history</p>
<p>a lot of etailers accept paypal not just ms store</p>
<p>with ms store you need to order with your ms account</p>

<p>EDGE,</p>
<p>Sorry to hear you are having such a rough time. Are you able to see your order in the Microsoft Store at all? If so, is there a "Track Status" link you can click to see the shipping information? Do you have the original e-mail receipt from the purchase?
 I'm just trying to think of any additional information we can get to hopefully get this squared away for you. Please let me know if you have any of the above so we can figure out where to go from there. Worst-case scenario I imagine you can file a dispute
 with the bank/paypal to get a refund for failure to deliver a product. Please keep us posted on your progress. Thank you,</p>

<p>I bought this from XBOX Live on XBOX Dashboard using my XBOX Gamercard and Paypal.</p>
<p>I have no order history on xboxmarketplace or xbox live, I've called customer support, and the market place support and get no support at all.
</p>
<p>Its basically a ghost at this point.</p>

<p>Well it wouldn't be thru the Xbox live &nbsp;marketplace as they don't sell hardware they the marketplace</p>
<p>Your best option. Is to goto ms store in your region online and sign in with your ms account that will have your order number and history &nbsp;as it sounds like it went thru ms store or possibliliy&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was through XBox Live. They had a Reserve Now Tile on the front page. I clicked on it, it used my already saved Pay Pal information. I have the charges, I have the proof, the problem is nobody at Microsoft cares. I am not a 12 year old child, I am a 31
 year old computer engineer. At this point I have no clue what to do. I have a Paypal case open by MS is not responding and my credit card companies hands are tied by Paypal. Am I just going to eat a 600 dollar mistake by MS??? Is someone EVER going to help
 me? I have called every single number but always end up with people over seas who can't do anything. This is frustrating. I bought the Xbox through Microsoft to cut out the middleman I should have just used Gamestop or bought a damn PS4.</p>

<p>Well my Day One Edition Xbox One arrived... Six days later. I called Microsoft today to let them know I received it. They still have no record of me buying it. Oh well. Its here finally. I find is appalling that this was down rated. It shows the BS customer
 support. I've owned Xbox's since the original and work for a company who has Microsoft SA and I find this whole situation to be just downright amateur.

<h2>            Unwanted gamertag&#58; how to get rid of it&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, everyone. I have had a Microsoft account for 9 years. However, having never owned an Xbox console, I never created a Live account or gamertag. Recently, I upgraded to Windows 8. When I logged in using my hotmail address, it showed that it was associated
 with the gamertag SleekParchment5, with the region set to Brazil, much to my surprise. I never created this gamertag, and I most certainly do not live, and have never lived, in Brazil. I would like to know how I would be able to delete this gamertag altogether,
 or at least have it moved to a dummy account so that I can create another one with the proper name and region, whithout having to change my hotmail address. I am sorry for the inconvenience, but this is very problematic, especially due to the regional issues.</p>

<h2>            SCSI to USB Iomega device</h2>
                    I have old Jazz and Zip Iomega drives-both are SCSI. I also have an old Iomega SCSI to USB cable. I am particularly concerned about how to get Vista to actually recognize and read these devices since of course my&nbsp; notebook has no SCSI ports.

    <title>Blocked Wireless Printing &#38; Some Programs From Updating - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kompton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blocked Wireless Printing &#38; Some Programs From Updating</h2>
                    <br />
<p>Ok... so I've been beating my head against the wall trying to figure out what the issue is, after a month of searching forums and getting nowhere I have to ask for help.&nbsp;
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Issue: Computer will not print over wireless networks &amp; will not allow some programs to update.<br />
</p>
<p>Computer: Sony Vaio Model: PCG-71912L<br />
</p>
<p>OS: Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The computer has no issues connecting to the internet or WiFi networks, I can surf the web as normal.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Through my searching I believe that a port that these programs use is blocked.&nbsp; The last message screenshot:<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a5c70e94-0f8d-429e-9e63-30dfb7a46309" height="295" width="371" /><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So I thought I'd try Microsoft Fix in and I got this message:<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fe0318ef-8dd1-4acd-aad3-d564c63ba8c2" height="231" width="433" /><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I restored all factory defaults on my Malwarebytes, Windows Firewall, and Windows Defender, uninstalled Norton Antivirus completely, and tried to connect, no go.<br />
</p>
<p>So I turned off all of my firewalls completely, and still no fix.&nbsp; Additionally adding these items to exception lists didn't help either.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm not sure how to proceed, has anyone else run into this issue?<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>How do I examine my ports to see if one has been closed or tampered with?<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>

<h2>            Skype for Business on Android Oreo 8.1 on Moto X4 on Sprint, mute starts one-way audio</h2>
                    <p>Odd trouble.&nbsp; Using Skype for Business v 6.22.0.30 on a Moto X4 on Oreo 8.1.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>I join a meeting on Skype for Business app then,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meeting Join Audio Option, choose top radio button Use Skype for Business (full audio and video experience)</p>
<p>
</p><p>join meeting with mic muted and hear the meeting participants</p>
<p>
</p><p>Press unmute and speak, then press mute to listen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can no longer hear the meeting audio from others but hear later that they could hear me, so one way audio&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally drop and rejoin, to hear again and it happens again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Drop and rejoin by having Skype call me at my phone number, which works normally with mute and unmute multiple times.</p>

<p><span>Hi Phil,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>According to your description, my understanding is that when you join the skype meeting with your skype for business account in Android Phone then you press mute to listen others and you can not hear others. Please clarify
 if I misunderstand your text.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In this case, first please make sure that you have installed the latest version of skype for business app on your phone, you can try to upgrade it and then see if the issue disappears. Moreover, when you said “ Can no longer
 hear the meeting audio from others but hear later that they could hear me, so one way audio”. To isolate if the issue is related to your network environment, please change to other network environments at your convenience and check if it can make any difference.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>On another hand, if suggestions can’t meet your current scenario, to help check if the issue is related to your specific skype for business app on your phone. If convenient, please configure your skype for business account
 to another mobile phone ( like your friend’s or colleague’s), and then see if you still have the same issue as before.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you got any updates about this issue, welcome to share with me, thanks.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regards,</span></p>
<p><span>Oliver</span></p>

<p>The Skype for business app on my phone is 6.22.0.30 and the phone is Moto X4 Oreo 8.1.0 security patch October 2018.&nbsp; There were no further updates when I checked today.&nbsp; I'll join a call and try for the trouble again today, then post a result.&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp;

<p>Hi Phil,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for the late response, I was out of office during the weekend. Given the situation, please try to uninstall then reinstall Skype for Business on your phone and check how it goes.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue still persists, may I ask if you have tried Oliver's suggestion to test the feature on another Android phone with your account? This is to narrow down whether the issue is specifically
 related to your device. </p>

            Reloaded the app and had same trouble.&nbsp; Now I just choose the 'call me back on the phone' choice for audio.&nbsp; this is not as good but does get me working.&nbsp; maybe if i get a new phone or the app is updated in the future, it'll work.&nbsp; I'll try once in awhile.&nbsp;
 Thanks.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried contacting the support team of Intel regarding the issue that you are experiencing with your wireless adapter driver? If not, kindly try to reach out to them first so that we can further isolate your issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly get back to us once you've contacted them.</p>

            The problem isn't with Intel the probably is the driver is not compatible with Windows 10 and there isn't a way to remove it. So that falls on Microsoft. I have the same issue and I&nbsp;have uninstalled all network devices and removed all Intel Drivers, Software,
 and Firmware and it's still embedded in System32. The only option I see is to reinstall windows from scratch but if I have to do that then what is the point.

I figured it out. You need to go into your Devices and manually Update all Network devices. (For me the issue was my Intel Bluetooth) then restart and start the process of updated or refreshing your PC.&nbsp;

</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>So, to be specific, I:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>open my "Device Manager" (Control Panel&gt;System&gt;Device Manager)</li><li>navigate to "Network Adapters", open this to expose my various network adapter devices</li><li>right click on each line item thus exposed to raise a contextual menu</li><li>for each item, select "Update Driver Software..." from the contextual menu</li><li>for each item, in the resulting popup window, select "Search automatically for updated driver software"</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In each case Windows spins for a protracted period of time (many minutes, on each item), and then reports "The best driver software for your device is already installed. Windows has determined the driver software for your device is up to date".<br />
<br />
And in the end, after all of this, the problem is NOT resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this procedure is not what you had in mind, please clarify.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, Intel indicates their drivers are "generic", and suggested I check with my motherboard manufacturer, to make certain I have the latest/greatest motherboard-specific driver for my network adapters installed (I do). So, I have a request into
 my motherboard manufacturer's technical support, asking them how to resolve this incompatibility. I am more than half-expecting them to blame Microsoft... which will bring me full circle back to Microsoft (in the form of these forums), without even a whiff
 at a resolution to the problem. But perhaps I am just borrowing trouble...<br />
<br />
My integrator (the people who built my system) says I probably don't want to install "Creators Update 1703" anyway, a lot of their customers have had serious problems with it. Their advice is to wait for the next update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will reserve judgement until/if/when the motherboard manufacturer responds, but my suspicion is this is indeed actually a Microsoft defect (which is probably not affecting very many people, or there would be more about it on it on the web), and that I
 will have to wait/hope for them to address it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I am frustrated... thanks for trying, at least.</p>

<p>I'm running into the same problem. &nbsp;What's weird is I can update to the latest Intel wireless drivers, get through the initial part of the Windows update, make it 100% through the "shutdown/restart" phase but the Windows update ends up failing after the
 second restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really feel like this is an Intel problem since the drivers are unable to be 100% fully uninstalled and they do not provide a cleanup script to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't really blame MS for this because as a software and firmware engineer, I know how impossible it is to support every single permutation of devices.</p>

<p>So, this forum suggested contacting Intel. Intel suggested contacting my motherboard manufacturer. My motherboard manufacturer (Taiwanese company named "Gigabyte") is unresponsive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My current situation: intractable driver incompatibility, can't update Windows 10 (and additional Windows 10 updates are now backing up behind Creators Update 1703), and none of Microsoft, Intel, or Gigabyte is prepared to address this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very unfortunate.</p>

<p>I am the original poster. Microsoft has apparently forgotten the "NameIsTaken2" account, has it registered to some hotmail user. So, created a new account to update this thread. (Update: funky, the forum is still seeing me as "NameIsTaken2" &lt;shrug&gt;.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The company that build my system (Puget Systems; Auburn, WA USA) appears to have identified a workaround to this problem. They have documented the workaround in a "help" article posted on their website:</p>

<p>Recap: Windows 10 Creators Update 1703 would not install on my Intel X99-based system, which uses a Gigabyte GA-X99-Designare EX (rev. 1.0) motherboard, with the following error message generated during installation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Intel Ethernet driver NETwtw04.sys plus 16 cores present on device</p>
<p>Uninstall this app now because it isn't compatible with Windows 10."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A potential source of confusion: my processor only has 10 cores to begin with, so the notion that 16 cores is some sort of magic maximum is mistaken. Out of an abundance of caution, I reduced my system to 6 cores (out of 10).</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) followed the instructions in the online help article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>installed Intel Wireless driver v19.70.0 ("vanilla" version from Intel)</p>
<p>did nothing to the bluetooth driver</p>
<p>disabled 4 cores (to run on the remaining 6 cores)</p>
<p>Windows 10 Creators Update 1703 installed without controversy</p>
<p>
</p><p>this constitutes "success", with the original problem</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2) "restored" the system:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>re-installed the Gigabye wireless and bluetooth drivers</p>
<p>re-enabled my 4 cores (back to the phystical total of 10)</p>
<p>re-started Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 immediately blue-screened, on startup, with the following error:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stop code: SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT-HANDLED</p>
<p>What failed: Netwtw04.sys</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
3) restarted again, system was stable for perhaps 60 seconds, then blue-screened again, with an identical error
<p>
</p><p>4) "troubleshot" system, making incremental changes until stability was achieved</p>
<blockquote>
<p>disabled 1 core (to run on the remaining 9 cores)</p>
<p>installed Intel Wireless driver v19.70.0 ("vanilla" version from Intel)</p>
<p>re-enabled my 1 core (back to the phystical total of 10)</p>
<p>system appears stable (has not crashed since, will update with more troubleshooting if it does crash)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of note: there is that pesky file again, Netwtw04.sys... tthis is perhaps why Windows 10 Creators Update 1703 was refusing to install, Microsoft knew something we did not, but they were clumsy/not-very-informative about it. I am going to give Microsoft the
 benefit of the doubt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This would seem to isolate the version of the wireless networking driver provided for use with this motherboard by the motherboard manufacturer, Gigabyte.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Conclusion: Something about Gigabyte's (Intel) wireless networking driver is not compatible with Windows 10 Creators Update 1703. The driver supplied by Gigabyte is an older version of the driver. Somewhat mysterious is the fact that installing v19.70.0
 direct from Intel did not rectify this problem, can't explain this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Endless and profuse thanks to Puget Systems for tackling this. They really went the extra mile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>What an insanely massive amount of work to do on your part, (the user), instead of Microsoft providing a hot-fix for whatever bit of code of the update 1703 is incompatible with Intel's driver.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It's been quite frustrating, as I also have had the "Activate Windows Now" message in the bottom right corner of my display since I upgraded my machine. This is in spite of my version was upgraded from windows 8 for free during the period Microsoft was still
 offering it well over a year ago, and it has been an ACTIVE perfectly valid windows installation for all that time until now.<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li><span>ASRock X370 Professional Gaming</span></li><li>Intel(R) Dual Band Wireless-AC 3168 - (<strong>Network Card that is built into the Motherboard</strong>)</li></ul>
&nbsp;
<p>I am using the same SSD, just booting it up on a new motherboard with because I wanted to upgrade to one using DDR4 RAM, PCIe 3.0, and the new Ryzen 7 processor.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
However, I have been having install issues with 1703 for a long time; about 6-7 months; that's longer than my "activate windows now" problem.&nbsp;The driver that my network card uses is&nbsp;<em>indeed</em>&nbsp;the&nbsp;<span>Intel Ethernet driver
 NETwtw04.sys.</span><br />
</p>
<p>Given that I am using the same drive with the same OS on a different motherboard, I thought I would have a little work to do getting drivers installed and working. Ironically, everything installed and worked like a charm first try, each time. Only, I still
 could not update to 1703 from Microsoft, and THIS TIME it gave me an ACTUAL REASON:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>These programs need to be uninstalled because they aren't compatible with the upgrade.&nbsp;<br />
<span>Intel Ethernet driver NETwtw04.sys plus 16 cores present on device</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Strangely, today, 9/19/17, when booting up my computer, the "Activate Windows Now" message is gone, and so with that, I thought maybe I'd be able to update Windows. Nope. Same exact error; Uninstall "<span>Intel Ethernet
 driver NETwtw04.sys plus 16 cores present on device"</span><br />

<p>"These programs need to be uninstalled because they aren't compatible with the upgrade.
<br />
Intel Ethernet driver NETwtw04.sys plus 16 cores present on device"<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Exactly the error message I received.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Paradoxically, my processor only HAS 10 cores, which makes the error message somewhat misleading.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem seems to be that NETwtw04.sys won't function under Windows 1703 with all processor cores active; at least one (though as far as I can tell just one is sufficient) must be disabled. If NETwtw04.sys is present under Windows 1703, the OS blue-screens
 at startup with a multi-core threading-related error. So, the basic notion that NETwtw04.sys is "incompatible" with Windows 1703 is indeed correct.</p>
<p><br />
So, as detailed in my "problem solution" post to this thread, I installed the latest/greatest driver from Intel (which among other things installs NETwtw06.sys, which is the correct driver needed for my particular wireless networking, but does NOT uninstall
 the NETwtw04.sys file that causes this problem... apparently NETwtw04.sys CAN'T be uninstalled under normal circumstances), disabled a single core via BIOS (which rendered my system, with NETwtw06.sys, "compatible" with Windows 1703), and the Windows 1703
 update proceeded properly, removing NETwtw04.sys during the update process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once NETwtw04.sys was gone, I could re-enable all cores, and the system has been stable ever since.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The builder of my system, Puget Systems of Auburn, WA (halfway between Seattle and Tacoma) originated the fix. Gigabyte (motherboard manufacturer), Intel, Microsoft, and these forums were all, unfortunately, of no great assistance in resolving this issue.</p>

<h2>            HDMI or USB3 &#40;for HDMI&#41; not working &#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p><br />
Hello,<br />
</p>
<br />
My Toshiba QOSMIO DX730-10Q has just been upgraded to Windows 10. I recently bought an LG LED monitor and tried to connect it to the HDMI (this is the first time I’m using the HDMI port since I bought the computer awhile back) and it’s not working.<br />
<br />
Whenever the LED is connected on HDMI, it says ‘Checking signal’ then ‘HDMI No Signal’. When I tried disconnecting it from QOSMIO, the LED says ‘Please check your connection’ – so this means it’s able to detect that it is connected earlier, only that it’s unable
 to receive any from the computer.<br />
<br />
I bought a USB 3.0 to HDMI adapter, hoping to isolate the problem. I noticed that it has a USB 3.0 driver (from the system), but since I’ve not used this too before, I don’t know whether it’s working at all. The computer has 6 USB ports.<br />
<br />
I tried all the ports, still not working.<br />
<br />
I tried connecting this LED to a Windows Vista laptop on HDMI, it worked right away. This means it could be the Windows 10 or my computer thas has a problem.<br />
<br />
Would appreciate your immediate advice (or from anyone who encountered the same issue!), thank you.
<p />

<h2>            Microsoft Treasure Hunt freezes and then resets to 1</h2>
                    <p>I am having&nbsp;problems with game crashing and resetting. I was at level 32 with 15 pick axes, maps and dynamite and 4 hearts. Froze up and had to start over. Now it seem that I get to the point where I have the 15 axes and dynamite and then it crashes. There have been times when it asked if I wanted to use the game on the cloud or the one that is on my computer, they are always the same two. I don't know if there is a way to retrieve the game or do I just quit playing because this is very aggravating.</p><p><br /></p>

<h3> richardryanpei  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using USMT to manually backup to USBHD and Keeping File Dates</h2>
                    <p>I am currently using USMT as a method of backing up user data in a corporate environment before a migration to windows 7.&nbsp; in out process we are just using the tool to perform the backup portion and calling USMT from a batch file manually.&nbsp; We are not using
 the loadstate function as we like to keep the new user profiles clean and avoid loading setting that are not required, and in our batch file i have set the "/nocompress" option so scanstate.exe creates a folder structure inthe backup store folder that gets
 created on our External usbhd's.&nbsp; This process is working well for us as we can quickly see what data was backed up and only copy back the data needed.&nbsp; The only issue is the files dates on all data is set to the time and date that scanstate.exe is run and
 we would like to have the dates saved with the files as using have requested this. (even a manual copy and paste will keep the date).&nbsp; I have looked into the "includeAttributes" function but when i attempt to use this any data that would have been backed up
 before making the change is now skipped completely.&nbsp; The documentation on the use of this function i find minimal and i also have not found much help searching message boards.&nbsp; I am using MigDocs.xml, MigApp.xml, and a custom.xml that has some custom includes
 and excludes.&nbsp; If someone can give me some help or point me to somewhere i can get better info with saving file dates using USMT that would be appreciated.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Administrator account deleted. No more possible to go re-installed to a previous date</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>My account was Admin and I have deleted another account from the PC (with PC name). And I guess it was the real admin, because now I can no more install any software.</p>
<p>Adding a new account is not possible because the administrator field for typing passwort is not active.</p>
<p>I've alos tried to reinstall to a previous date, but I am supposed to enter the Admin password: and the one I know doesn't work!</p>
<p>So I'm stuck</p>
<p>Do you have an idea how to recover my admin privilege on my computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advanced</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As there is no administrator account present on the computer, you will not be able to perform any actions. I would suggest you to refresh the computer using the Windows 8 DVD/installation media. If you don’t have a Windows 8 DVD, refer to the following link
 to do so:</p>
<p><strong>How to create installation media for a PC refresh or reset</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>a) Boot from the Windows 8 DVD.</p>
<p>b) Click on <strong>Repair your computer</strong>.</p>
<p>c) Click on <strong>Troubleshoot</strong>.</p>
<p>d) Click on <strong>Refresh</strong> the computer.</p>
<p>e) Follow the on-screen instructions.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Refreshing the computer will not delete not delete any of your personal files or change your settings. The apps that came with the computer or you installed from Windows Store will be reinstalled, but any apps you installed from other
 websites and DVDs will be removed. You'll find a list of the removed apps on your desktop after refreshing the computer.</p>

            I have a similar problem and would like to try this solution, but I don't have a windows 8 DVD. &nbsp;It came pre-loaded on my computer (ASUS) and I didn't get one with it. &nbsp;I have been unable to upgrade to upgrade to 8.1 because I don't have administrator
 privileges on my computer.

<h2>            want to save pdf file to last subfolder saved in, not default folder</h2>
                    
<p>I am a relatively new Win 7 user who is accustomed to Win XP.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to save monthly statements from web as pdf files--I often download several months worth consecutively.&nbsp; IE retrieves the file as a pdf, and I click on the save icon.&nbsp; BUT then Win 7 takes me to default window to save, which then&nbsp;necessitates that
 I click through&nbsp;"documents" and several subfolders until I get to the desired subfolder.&nbsp; Rather than remember that I just saved the same type of file in subfolder X, it makes me go through the same series of clicks to get to the desired subfolder EVERY time.&nbsp;
 Win XP used to auto default to the&nbsp;last folder that I saved that&nbsp;type of file in.&nbsp; &nbsp;I want that back!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can it be done in Win 7???&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suppose that I could save every file into whatever default folder and then manually move the new files into the subfolder that I want, but I'm hoping that I can avoid so many extra steps.&nbsp; This is one "improvement" in Win 7 that I&nbsp;HATE.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope someone can give me an answer and some direction how to make this work?&nbsp; Thanks in advance</p>

<h2>            Microsoft error messages</h2>
                    <p>Why are Microsoft error messages USELESS, at best? So far, NONE of the error messages I got from Microsoft have been useful in solving any of my PC problems. All I get, for example, is an error message like "There was a problem in resetting your compter"
 when I try to reset my Windows 10. WHAT kind of a help is THAT? I KNOW there is a problem, and THAT is WHY I am trying to repair the installation!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is so frustrating to see a bunch of USELESS error messages from Microsoft.</p>

            True the error messages are often of little help. However over time those are getting better. One day computers will be self-healing however that day is not even in sight yet. Though it could be just around the corner in a field that moves as fast as this
 one.<br />
<br />
Please start a new thread detailing the problem you are having and we will certainly try to help.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. <br />

<p><strong>What Country/State/Province: Ohio, USA&nbsp;<br />
Modem brand &amp; model number: Scientific Atlanta by Cisco - 2203C<br />
Router brand &amp; model number: Linksys - WRT54GS<br />

<p><strong>If Wireless, what type of encryption are you using? This I do not know..</strong></p>
<p><strong>Wireless is running, the connection problem is always in the last portion from internet to LIVE.</strong></p>

<p><br />
Things you have tried: <br />
Is UPnP Enabled? Yes, via Router configuration.</p>
<p>Is NAT Type Open? I believe so, NAT filtering is disabled on the Router. (?)<br />
Any Error Codes you encounter: <br />
What type of internet do you have? Cable <br />
Who is your ISP(Internet Service Provider)? Time Warner (Roadrunner)<br />
When you run "Test Xbox LIVE connection" what is the exact message shown on screen? Sometimes I can't connect to XBOX live and sometimes the message is that NAT may not run as expected and I may have trouble connecting to some games.</p>

            It appears that you are correct, I also cannot see weird characters. In this case, I can only suggest you to contact the Software manufacturer for an updated program, this might be a case of 1903 bug.

    <title>Windows 10, serial key needed for fresh install&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10, serial key needed for fresh install&#63;</h2>
                    So, I can download Win 10 from the site, and it verifies my Win 7. &nbsp;But I would rather do a full format rather than do an upgrade, just because. &nbsp;If I format with the Win 10 USB from the media creation tool, where/what serial do I put in, do I put my Windows
 7 key? &nbsp;I'm not sure how the key works as I've not actually installed Windows 10, and my friend's install verified his Win 7 and upgraded.

</p><p>You have to perform the "upgrade" first in order to later perform a "clean" install of Windows 10. No other way around it. The upgrade aligns (for lack of a better word) your existing Windows 7/8 license key for use with Windows 10 (for the free offer).
 If you later perform your clean install the activation step should be simple because you have already done it during the upgrade. As long as you don't perform some major hardware change to your device. Think about it this way. MS will be maintaining a database
 of the key associated with the hardware components of your PC. I guess this will kill the key pirates.</p>

            <div>I'm guessing that on a clean install there is no need to provide the serial. Just skip&nbsp;providing the serial&nbsp;given that you already did a Win 10 upgrade and already have it activated. Can someone confirm this? Thanks.</div>

            <p>thats true. I did the upgrade and the re-install. During the re-install my Win8.1 key didn't work and windows wasn't activated until i connected to the internet, after which it got activated. Am guessing its not with my win8.1 serial, infact i think its
 activated with the device serial number rather then hardware, wouldn't you say so? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways, Here is an issue i might have to face. My laptop came with Vista. I got Win8.1 through the dreamspark program (Thanks Microsoft :D). Now iam planning to build a custom gaming desktop and will probably sell my laptop after reverting it back to vista.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In that case, the problem is that i cannot install windows 10 right way on my new desktop which iam sure wont work. So will installing win8.1 first and then upgrading to win10 work? even if it does, will a clean install work after then?</p>

</p><p>Your Windows 10 entitlement applies only to the laptop because that's the device you were using when you performed the upgrade. As you mentioned, no activation key&nbsp;was used when you re-installed Windows 10. Microsoft is apparently collecting the hardware
 device IDs in combination with the activation key associated with the&nbsp;licensed copy of the version of Windows you are running at the time of the in-place upgrade.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, you own the copy of Windows 8.1. You install it to the new desktop and perform the upgrade to Windows 10. Activation will probably fail. I will say you could be able to convince Microsoft that all you want to do is transfer your entitlement to another
 machine. This might take a call to their activation department.</p>

            <p>here is how it works for me<br />
I installed windows 10 from windows 7 <br />
and windows 10 automatically activated itself<br />
then I kill my hard disk:-)<br />
and from a USB flash card<br />
where I previously save windows 10 ISO file<br />
I did a clean installation of windows 10</p>
<p>and when I complete the installation of windows 10 </p>
<p>it activated itself</p>
<p>note: when windows 10 ask you to put the code just skip it</p>
<p>note 2 : if you do it make sure your USB Flash card is on</p>
<p>because it take me 1 hour to figure it out that my boot USB was off in my BIOS:-)</p>

            <p>hmmm, makes sense. Transferring the entitlement is exactly what i want and I guess i will have to call the activation department when the time comes. Thanks mate.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is available in dreamspark now, but not the pro version, but like 10 to 15 different versions. Only onces that made sense or the N edition and the debug checked editions. Any idea what "multiple editions" version is and where it stands with the
 N and pro versions? Sorry if this is the wrong place to ask this question.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>No&nbsp;you do not have to do an upgrade from any windows to win10 you can do a fresh install</p>
<p>on a new hard drive that you install and use the full download version of the iso and burn it to a dvd and install it without any upgrade</p>
