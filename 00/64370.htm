            <p>Thank you for responding so fast to my question.......It is everything I need to install, right now windows updates don't work. I ran MS security essentials ,<strong>came up with nothing wrong</strong>, yet....I can't download, or update... After I ran the
 MS Security Essentials, I uninstalled it, went into a safe mode, then try to install my Norton, which I had to download from Norton, which was the wrong thing to do because I couldn't install it..... and they said because I must have some sort of a virus....
 I shouldn't install any virus protection right now... They said oh, we could help you fix it....BUT it would cost $ 199.95&nbsp; I said I didn't have that kind of money right now...so, they said OK we could do something else for $ 150.95... I told them NO WAY&nbsp;
 then they said they had one other thing they could do for $ 99.95&nbsp; again I said NO WAY! I just said help me install the virus protection that I already have with you..... and they said that they couldn't do it.....because that would not work, if I already
 have a virus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what I need is to install my printer, install MS virus protection, and get my windows updating like it should be doing........</p>
<p>Thanks </p>

<p><strong>Troubleshoot Windows Update:</strong></p>
<font>
<p>You can reset Windows Update components by running the Fixit on this page. But, if there's malware present, it will continue to reset the connection to the update servers:</p>
<p>How do I reset Windows Update components</p>

<p>Suggest you download and save the Fixit. Then configure the system to Clean boot prior to running it:</p>
<p>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista/Windows 7</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff"><font color="#0000ff">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</font></font></u></a></p>
<p>Once the Fixit has been downloaded and the system booted to the Clean state, check to see that the native Windows firewall is now On if a 3rd party firewall was being used previously. Now run the Fixit and choose the Default mode. Restart once it's done
 and see if the system can connect to the update servers. If it can not, then run the Fixit again and choose the Aggressive mode. Restart when it's finished running and check for updates.</p>
<p>I suggest before shutting down and installing any updates, disconnect from the Internet first.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Printer installation</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<font>
<p>I would suggest you to uninstall and reinstall the latest drivers compatible for Windows 7.</p>

<p>Open the Printer troubleshooter</p>
<p>Open the Printer troubleshooter by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type troubleshooter, and then click Troubleshooting. Under Hardware and Sound, click Use a printer.</p>

                    After installing Windows 7 on a HP Notebook I have a network adapter called "Microsoft Virtual WiFi Miniport Adapter", I have been searching for information on this and I know what it's for, but I can't find any information about how to set it up or get

            Hello Ray Witt, <br />
<br />
Try the suggestions below before you begin your Windows 8 installation. <br />
If you are upgrading from a computer that was pre-installed with your previous operating system, such as Dell, HP, Sony etc then go to the manufacturer's website and download the latest drivers for Windows 8 for your network and video adapters for your model
 computer. Store the drivers on a USB flash drive or disc. If your computer manufacturer doesn't have Windows 8 drivers, check for the most current Windows 7 drivers as they may work with Windows 8 also.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other things that may help with the install.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Disable all non-essential hardware such as printers, external hard drives etc.
<br />
- Verify all Windows updates are current on your current Windows operating systems.
<br />
- <span>
As a general rule, you can check to see if your antivirus is compatible on the Windows 8 Compatibility Center at the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/win8/CompatCenter/Home?Language=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link here</a>.
<br />
- Antivirus can be uninstalled during the install of Windows 8. Your system will be fully protected as Windows Defender is installed by default in the operating system. If you uninstall your antivirus, go to the antivirus manufacturer's website and use the
 removal tool to be sure it is removed correctly. <br />
</span>- Run the following troubleshooter and then try the download again: The troubleshooter is for Windows Update. The Web Installer of Windows 8 uses the Background
 Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS).&nbsp; This is the same component that is used when you download updates via Windows Update.&nbsp; A common cause to this problem is a “broken” BITS.&nbsp; The Windows Update troubleshooter rebuilds BITS.<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2714434" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2714434</a><br />
Once the troubleshooter has completed, try again to see if you can install Windows 8.
<br />
<br />
Next, run a clean boot if using the Windows Update troubleshooter doesn’t help with the download.
<br />
Using clean boot, we can try to determine which app/program might be causing this issue.
<br />
Note: If you are using AVG antivirus, they have an updated version that you can download for Windows 8 as&nbsp;the older version could be causing a problem. When updating, choose the “Program” option. After AVG has updated, reboot your computer. Then try the download
 again. If it still fails, there may be a conflict. </p>
<p>Step 1: Follow the steps to perform clean boot:<br />
a) Press the <b>‘Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.</p>
<p>b) In the
<b>‘Run’</b> window type <b>’MSCONFIG’</b> and click <b>‘OK’</b>.</p>
<p>c) Click the
<b>‘Boot’</b> tab and uncheck the <b>‘Safe Boot’</b> option.</p>
<p>d) On the
<b>‘General’</b> tab, click to select the option <b>‘Selective startup’</b>, and then click to clear the option
<b>Load startup items</b> check box.</p>
<p>e) On the
<b>‘Services’</b> tab, click to select the <b>‘Hide all Microsoft services’</b> check box, and then click
<b>‘Disable all’</b>.</p>
<p>f) On the
<b>‘StartUp’</b> tab, click ‘<b>Open Task Manager’. &nbsp;</b>In the<b> Task Manager window
</b>under<b> startup tab, </b>right click on each startup item which are enabled and select ‘<b>Disable’.</b></p>
<p>g) Click
<b>‘OK’</b>, and then click Restart.</p>
<p><b>Step 2: Enable half of the services<br />
a. </b>Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.<br />
b. Click the <b>Services</b> tab, and then click to select the <b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box.<br />
c. Click to select half of the check boxes in the <b>Service</b> list.<br />
d. Click <b>OK</b>, and then click <b>Restart</b>.</p>
<p><b>Step 3: Determine whether the problem returns.<br />
</b>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the
<b>Service</b> list.<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the
<b>Service</b> list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
If only one service is selected in the <b>Service</b> list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.</p>
<p><b>Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items
<br />
</b>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the
<b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box in either step.</p>
<p><b>Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns<br />
</b>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the
<b>Startup Item</b> list.<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the
<b>Startup Item</b> list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
If only one startup item is selected in the <b>Startup Item</b> list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem. Go to step 6.<br />
If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the
<b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box in either step.</p>
<p><b>Step 6: Resolve the problem.<br />
</b>After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box for the problem
 item.</p>
<p><b>Step 7:<br />
Note:</b> After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.</p>
<p>a) Press the
<b>‘Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.<br />
b) In the <b>‘Run’</b> window type <b>’MSCONFIG’</b> and click <b>‘Ok’</b>.<br />
c) On the <b>‘General’</b> tab, click the <b>‘Normal Startup’</b> option, and then click
<b>‘OK’</b>.<br />
d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click <b>‘Restart’</b>.<br />
<br />
If the clean boot didn't point to a conflict with software, then run Checksur. Click on the KB number to bring up the article and download the tool.

            Hi Trung... you could create a script\batch that enables wifi hotspot then have it run when you login using task scheduler.
<br />Below are 2 links.
<br />One provides the commands for creating the hotspot and the other how to create the task.

<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using the recovery disk reinstalls Windows. It does nothing for your apps or for your data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Microsoft Works was preinstalled, you need to contact your computer's manufacturer to find out what to do (or whether it's even possible to get Works back).</p>

<h2>            Win10 Unlicensed itself... Broken arch_amd64 files&#63;</h2>
                    <p>For the last few days, my PC has been unable to boot normally, only going into a limited boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Symptoms:</p>
<p>&nbsp; - &nbsp;"activate windows" watermark in the corner.</p>
<p>&nbsp; - clicking Start menu and search bar doesn't do anything</p>
<p>&nbsp; - Can run programs from the task manager file...run command, but only in administrator mode</p>
<p>&nbsp; - clicking on the "activate windows" text in the system control panel leads to the message "class not recognized"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things i've tried:</p>
<p>&nbsp; - an SFC /Scannow craps out after 48%</p>
<p>&nbsp; - Chkdsk /f ran and fixed some stuff but still not working</p>
<p>&nbsp; - the DISM /online /restorehealth thing also craps out.</p>
<p>&nbsp; - Running a repair install from the latest ISO get to about 50% installing windows and then craps out with the message "windows 10 install failed".</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;- Grabbing the latest update package from the microsoft catalog site doesn't install</p>

            Hi Machleder, in order to encrypt your PC with BitLocker, generally your PC must have a Pro edition of Windows and have Trusted Platform Module (TPM) hardware. Do you know if you have Windows 8.1 Pro? You can verify by going to Control Panel &gt; System. For example, Windows 8.1 and Windows 8.1 Single Language are not Pro editions and do not support BitLocker.

            Hi  Machleder, what Edition of Windows 8.1 do you have loaded on your PC. BitLocker does not come as part of the Home Edition, it is only Included in the Pro and Enterprise editions . . .
<br />
<br />Go to Control Panel - System - what Edition of Windows 8.1 is listed there?

<p>To Greg as well:</p>
<p>Thank you, the links were most helpful. It definitely appears that my version of Windows 8.1 does not have BitLocker.</p>
<p>An organization that I work with now requires BitLocker for access to work information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Further question:</p>
<p>Can I upgrade my current system ?</p>
<p>Or; what would you recommend (see description of system on prior response)?</p>
<p>

<h2>            I cannot open font folder in control panel.</h2>
                    When I double click on the font folder icon within the control panel window, it will not open. It hangs and becomes non-responsive. Then I click the cancel X on top right of window and it says an error has occurred and that it needs to close. The whole
 desktop disappears and then re-appears. What is going on? And how can I install my Fonts?

            Hello Sparkybell1734, welcome.
<div><br />
<div>1. How long has this issue been occuring?</div>
<div>2. What Service Pack level of Windows XP are you using? SP1, SP2, SP3?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also, try this to see if it resolves the issue:</div>
<div><br />
<div>1. Click START</div>
<div>2. Click 'Run'</div>
<div>3. Type <strong>C:\Windows\System32\dllcache</strong> and press enter</div>
<div>4. Check to see if<strong> fontext.dll </strong>exists. <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">IF</span></strong> it does, go up a folder to C:\Windows\System32</div>
<div>5. Locate the <strong>fontext.dll</strong> in that folder and delete it</div>
<div>6. Reboot your PC and attempt to open the fonts applet in the Control Panel</div>
<div><br />
<div>---</div>
<div><br />
<div>If that does not work, as an alternate method of installing fonts, you can always copy and paste the font file into C:\Windows\System32\Fonts</div>
<div><br />
<div>Let us know what happens,</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks!</div>

    <title>Scheduled tasks start after standby mode and hibernation although the - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bege10  say:</h3>
<h2>            Scheduled tasks start after standby mode and hibernation although the option to run as soon as possible after a missed start is unchecked</h2>
                    I have created several tasks that work as they are supposed to. With one very annoying exception: If they have triggers while the computer is in standby mode or hibernation, all of them will start directly after I wake up the computer from standby mode
 or hibernation. But none of the tasks has the option checked to run as soon as possible after a missed start!<br />
How can I stop this behavior?<br />
This does not happened when the computer was switched off completely.<br />

<h3> vissevin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Destiny 2&#58; Annual Pass without DLC&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So i bought Destiny 2: Annual Pass fully expecting the DLC to be included (Forsaken) but it isn't, and i cannot install it or buy it. And i do not want to buy it in pound or NOK (whatever that is) but just Euros. I feel like i got scammed since i still cannot
 play. It wasn't stated anywhere that it didn't come with the DLC. So i feel like if they're offering this you should atleast be able to buy the content. (yes i checked the xbox multiple times and the site aswell)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi Vissevin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Forsaken annual pass is an add on to the forsaken.&nbsp; &nbsp;This will give you access to gambit, black armory, etc.&nbsp; It is basically an add-on to Forsaken Expansion.&nbsp; Also, in states you need Forsaken before buying this Annual Pass. Sadly, DLC are nonrefundable
 but you should and can speak to a customer service rep by requesting a call back or speaking to an agent via chat&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, are you trying to access something within Forsaken?&nbsp; You still need to be the recommended light/level and complete certain missions in the game.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Your best bet would have been to purchase The Destiny 2 Forsaken complete collection, yeah it comes with Destiny 2 full game, but comes with all dlc too, and the price has been knocked down by 60%. Here is the link

            Again, that isn't available in my country. The only purchasble options were Annual pass and Silver Coins. Nothing, it didn't even state: "Needs Forsaken Dlc)" and now my game constantly tells me to download Forsaken wich isn't avalaible.

            All DLC for Forsaken has already been released. The next DLC for the game is Shadowkeep, which is seperate to Forsaken, you do not need it to play Shadowkeep.

            If i have to purchase the thing that was advertised seperatly on a 3th pary site i feel like i got scammed. I can't even play because the error message keeps popping up. AND REMEMBER THIS WAS THE ONLY THING FOR SALE AND IT WAS ADVERTISED AS THE DLC IT
 SELF. SO I COULDN'T EVEN BUY THE FORSAKEN DELUXE EDITION. I feel like i should gwt my money back or the DLC to be honest.

            Hi  dlockesf
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Sorry for the inconvenience this is causing. 
<br />
<br />Give this a try:
<br />Delete NGC folder and add a new PIN code
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\ServiceProfiles\LocalService\AppData\Local\Microsoft\NGC.
<br />In NGC folder delete all the files. To do so you must be logged as Administrator.
<br />delete the temp folder within the NGC folder
<br />Now go to Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Sign-in Options.
<br />Click Add a PIN and add a new PIN code for your account.
<br />
<br />Now the PIN login should be working again.
<br />
<br />Switch to local account and add a PIN code
<br />
<br />Option 2:
<br />
<br />try to switch to local account, and the add a PIN code. Here's how to do that:
<br />
<br />Go to Settings &gt; Accounts and locate your account.
<br />Click Sign in with a Local Account instead.
<br />Follow the instructions to set up a local account.
<br />Sign out and sign in with your local account.
<br />Now add a PIN code.
<br />After you've added your PIN code you need to locate your account under the Accounts section in Settings.
<br />Choose Sign in with a Microsoft Account instead.
<br />
<br />That's it, PIN login should be working now for your account 
<br />
<br />or
<br />
<br />

<h2>             Operation failed with 0x8007005 and 0x80073712. Component store corrupted</h2>
                    
<p>I&nbsp;was sent over here by "PA Bear MS MVP" because he believes I may have a hijack infection.</p>
<p>I have been unable to uninstall the IE9 beta, and am at my wits' end. At one point, I was advised to try manually uninstalling it by running the following code from an administrative-level command prompt:</p>
<p><strong>FORFILES /P %WINDIR%\servicing\Packages /M Microsoft-Windows-InternetExplorer-*9.*.mum /c "cmd /c echo Uninstalling package @fname &amp;&amp; start /w pkgmgr /up:@fname /norestart"</strong></p>
<p>So I did, but I repeatedly got the message "Operation failed with 0x8007005. Access is denied." I kept running the command and even tually was told: "Operation failed with 0x80073712 The component store has been corrupted." This was when PA Bear Sent me
 over here.</p>
<p>I CAN see IE9 in my installed updates list, but when I try to uninstall it, I get a Windows Update Error message that "Some of the updates failed to uninstall".</p>
<p>You can find a more detailed account of my struggles at:</p>
<p><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/InternetExplorer/thread/c14dc30f-84bc-4955-80a7-d7e957968c0b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/InternetExplorer/thread/c14dc30f-84bc-4955-80a7-d7e957968c0b</a></p>
<p>I have been running Nod32 since installation of my system, doing scans with MalwareBytes and MSRT about once a month jsut to be safe. Nothing has ever turned up anything.</p>
<p>HOWEVER: My home page was once changed without my approval after installing a third-party utilty. The page was changed to a strange address called Seek.mt (as I recall) -- a Google imposter. I switched my homepage back to its normal place without incident.
 I then an full scans with all of the programs above and they found nothing.</p>
<p>There are NO other signs of infection other than&nbsp;this IE9 removal problem, and the corrupted file reports I have received. &nbsp;My computer has bluescreened a couple times in the past two months, but the codes indicated that the responsible file came from my
 Motorloa Bluetooth installation. I reinstalled the Bluetooth and they did not recar.</p>
<p>Have been&nbsp;doing PCs since 1983 and never had an infection, so this is a concern. If it's an evil code-critter, I'd like to know what it is and stomp it out. Thanks for your help!</p>

    <title>Skype sending messages to the wrong person - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> frustrateduser1966  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype sending messages to the wrong person</h2>
                    I am running Windows Phone 10 and Windows 10 Pro on my main PC; at some point, my phone asked to integrate Skype and Messaging, which I okayed.<br />
<br />
All was "fine", then I realised one I could link the phone with my computer; awesome. &nbsp;This link is fantastic; I never take my phone out of my pocket when I'm on my PC, and it has been great when it works.<br />
<br />
However, this "sending messages to the wrong person" started with the girlfriend; for no reason, Skype started "texting" her work number. &nbsp;I have no idea why, and my GF only has one copy of her contact (Outlook), with two numbers (mobile, and work). &nbsp;At first
 it was once in a while, then more often, and now, almost 100% of the time it picks the wrong contact #.<br />
<br />
Next issue was my brother-in-law and sister; individual contacts, but both of them have the same home number (and both contacts are from Outlook). &nbsp;One day, went to contacts, picked my sister, told her "Happy birthday", and got a text back -from her- saying
 "this is your brother, her number is xxx-xxx-xxxx". &nbsp;This text, according to Skype, came from her #. &nbsp;Since then, those two people's contacts are ambiguously connected; they're not linked anywhere in my phone contacts, but if I pick one, it's a crap-shoot
 who gets the message.<br />
<br />
This is slowly propagating to other people. &nbsp;Another brother-in-law, if I try to text him, once I click "Send message" and it loads Skype, the contact I get there with comes up with a random contact's name (same every time), and a number that is not in my phone.
 &nbsp;I tried calling it, and it's not even a valid number. &nbsp;His contact is in GMAIL only, and has his e-mail, mobile, and home.<br />
<br />
Now, it seems pretty obvious to me that there is some damage to my data, and I have a feeling it's coming from the fact some contacts are Outlook, some are GMail, some are internal to Skype (which existed pre-Microsoft integration).<br />
<br />
Is this a known issue? &nbsp;I can't find anything anywhere. &nbsp;Can I force my phone to move all of my contacts to Outlook or Skype or something, eliminate the gmail/outlook integration, and just use "Skype" contacts (I'll fix them all in the app)?<br />
<br />
I'd really like to keep the Skype integration, but if I am eventually just going to have a mess where messages don't go to their intended recipients, then it's pretty useless.

<p>If I unlink them, I the issue goes away (SMS messages always showed up properly in "Messaging"), but so does the entire purpose of linking them in the first place, which is to get messages to come to my PC / link them together in one consolidated very-slow
 interface.<br />
<br />
I ended up figuring it out anyways; Windows Phone (in my case) can't deal properly with contacts that have similar information.&nbsp; Also, if you have a contact with a "Microsoft Account", and "Hotmail" ... they both come up as "Outlook".&nbsp; In my case, my Microsoft
 Account and Hotmail accounts were the same account, but it seems some of them were just stored on the phone internally (when I deleted all links to contacts, I still had a few people on my phone). If you have two contacts with the same information (so, two
 John Doe's with 555-555-5555 as their phone number), Skype will link them and pick a random contact as the "master" (I assume the Outlook one), and pick a random number as the "main" number.&nbsp; As well, if you have two contacts with similar information (Mom
 Doe, Dad, Doe, Daughter Doe ... all with their own cell numbers, but the same home number ... all from different sources (GMAIL, Skype, Outlook), Skype will aggregate their data in unpredictable ways.&nbsp; It seems odd that, if Skype was going to pick an arbitrary
 number, that it wouldn't pick a "Mobile" number by default for texting, since they're generally the only ones that can actually receive SMS messages.<br />
<br />
I "fixed" it by the following (in case anyone else has this issue and wants to have a possible idea of how to "fix" it):.&nbsp; My mentality was "stop everything from connecting, reset everything, put all contacts in one place, and them set it all back up again):<br />
- I disabled the Skype Phone to Skype PC link.<br />
- In "People", I deleted everything that links contacts (in my case, outlook and Gmail ... Skype isn't an option for some curious reason).</p>
<p>- I went to the Google Contacts web interface and exported all of my contacts to CSV.</p>
<p>- Went to Outlook on my PC and imported all of the contacts from the CSV to my Hotmail account that the phone uses</p>
<p>- While I was here, I moved all of my contacts from other Hotmail accounts into the phone one (I have a few accounts, none were on my phone though).&nbsp; There were very few, so I figured why not.<br />
- In Outlook, I managed all my contacts to eliminate duplicates, and clean everything up (removed old contacts).<br />
- On my phone, I re-added my Outlook account; this re-added all of my contacts "perfectly".&nbsp; As well, now when I update my contacts' info, I get a quick message about synchronizing, which I never got before.<br />
- On my PC, I reset Skype through Apps and Settings; I expected this to reset Skype, but it didn't actually do much ... everything came back basically exactly as before (including knowledge of contacts that it should have no knowledge of, such as my SMS contacts
 that are not stored in Skype).<br />
- On my phone, I reset Skype through Apps and Settings; this seems to have reset Skype properly.<br />
- On my phone, and I can't remember how I did this, I ensured the phone was using Skype as the messaging software I'm supposed to be using.<br />
- On my phone, in "People", I manually re-linked all Skype accounts (most worked automatically).<br />
- Re-established the Skype Phone to Skype PC link.&nbsp; Sent myself a text, and it showed up on both the phone and the computer.<br />
<br />
For a few days, it has been working.&nbsp; No idea how long that will last, but we will see.&nbsp; I was hoping to migrate my Skype contacts to Outlook contacts (or vice-versa), but that is apparently not doable for some reason.<br />
<br />
As well, when I add contacts now, I add them as "Hotmail" contacts (my phone asks me when I'm making a new contact where to store it; this ensures they're all in the same place).<br />

            So, Microsoft has abolished it's plan to have Skype as the default messaging app on it's phones?&nbsp; When did this happen?&nbsp; I don't see it anywhere in the news.<br />
<br />
That sucks, because the Phone &lt;-&gt; Windows integration was nice when it worked. <br />
<br />
Also, a bit of an addition to my previous message: I still had weird things going on, so I deleted all of my contacts from Skype and re-added them.&nbsp; Since the Windows 10 version of "reset app" doesn't actually seem to work, deleting the contacts and re-adding
 them was as close as I could get.

                    <p>I've been having some - very - annoying problems with Windows. I'll contextualize - it may be important to a possible solution: I had windows 7 and windows 8.1 on a dual boot setup. I mainly used windows 8.1. Two days ago, out of nowhere - I didn't install
 any new software, aside Microsoft updates, for weeks - I couldn't resume from hibernation. Everything was fine - for over an year - until then. It just got stuck at the presmss phase.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After some struggle I was able to boot on windows 7 (which was almost as in a clean boot state since I only kept it to recover from problems such as this). Since I didn't used it for quite some time, windows update forced me to do some updates. After that,
 I lost the ability to connect to the internet, it just kept saying "unidentified network". Well, after a full day of trying to solve the problem, I decided to just recover windows 7 to the initial - factory - state. Well that didn't help. The presmss phase
 still hangs for 10 minutes and the whole boot takes around 15. After that, &nbsp;I updated most of the drivers but nothing changed - actually it got worse and sometimes windows wasn't able to boot so I had to recover to a previous state. I ended up deleting windows
 8.1 through disk management - though I still kept the partition - I don't want to possible available size for a second partition to be smaller.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, after this very lengthy, although with no results, quest, I'm out of ideas. Could someone please help me? I don't mind making a clean boot to windows 7 but I'm afraid that the problem might persist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Note: I've tried to make a boot trace but it ended up with a BSOD before the logon UI.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the description is appears to be hardware related. My bet is the hard drive is somehow defective. You should also test the memory using Windows memory test utility or Memtest86.</p>

            <p>Well, I believe that that will raise a bit of a problem. Although most of the information is independent of my system language there are some things that are in Portuguese. I'll post the report either way since it seems to me that there are just a few things
 that will raise that problem and those who do seem to be solvable by a quick check on the internet for translation.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Well, I would prefer to be that and buy a new hdd and everything's fine again than be something much more expensive. If it's hardware it's somehow weird since once logged on everything's fine (except the fact that I can't use two finger gestures on my touchpad
 but that must be driver related and has nothing to do with the main problem). </p>

    <title>Recent Win7 problems following failed Comcast software install - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pdxcomposer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recent Win7 problems following failed Comcast software install</h2>
                    <br />
Dunno where to begin.&nbsp; I can only suspect that all problems are related to a single event and the most likely event, due to timing, was a download, but failed install of Comcast desktop software (automated in the Comcast cable internet installation.)&nbsp; I also
 suspect this because one posted answer to "freeze" problems here mentions conflicts with AV software and AV drivers may have been part of the Comcast package.&nbsp; Dunno.<br />
<br />
PROBLEMS:&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I cannot uninstall software.&nbsp; Windows Installer "hangs" on "Preparing to Install" and nothing happens.&nbsp; I must force close this with Task Manager.&nbsp; That usually corrupts my desktop images, removes all desktop icons and start button, forcing me to reboot.&nbsp; (Near
 as I can tell, Install Manager affects Explorer.exe some how.)<br />
<br />
I cannot install software. Same problem. The program hangs indefinitely on "Preparing to unistall."<br />
<br />
After attempting to cancel install or uninstall events (and failing) and after forcing closure with Task Manager, and after the desktop recovers sans icons, start button and application bar (as if Explorer had shut down, but froze on the desktop graphic), when
 retreating to Task Manager to correct this, I have chosen the "log off" option.&nbsp; This allows me to log off and then log back on.&nbsp; However, once logged on, I hit a black screen and Task Manager shows many applications are opened twice in the open application
 list - including many resident drivers.&nbsp; It appears that the original "log off" did not shut down these apps, but the "log back on" repeated them.&nbsp; This ends in a black screen everytime and requires the machine to be shut down (where it then hangs on the "shutting
 down" screen.)&nbsp; See below.<br />
<br />
Whether in restart or shut down mode, the shut down hangs indefinitely. On occasion there is some hard drive activity, but in most cases, once it freezes, the hard drive is inactive - but the computer does not budge off the blue "Shutting down" window.<br />
<br />
Microsoft's Fix It will start, but freezes indefinitely on "detecting problems."&nbsp; Reviewing activity in Task Manager, the program once hanging in "detection" uses no CPU and registers no activity. The hard drive light rarely flashes and does not show any search
 use. Cancel will close the program without needing to force close with Task Manager.<br />
<br />
4AM - Windows Media Center attempts to "optimize" and hangs in the process.&nbsp; The next morning, when found, WMC is frozen, will not respond to mouse or remote commands and must be forced closed in Task Manager.&nbsp; Once done, Win7 and WMC act normally except specific
 to the other problems above.<br />
<br />
I also note that Microsoft Updates have been found and downloaded but have not auto installed.&nbsp; At least three recent updates are sitting awaiting my permission to install.&nbsp; One Java update continues to fail when found, as well.&nbsp; Normally all these auto-install
 without requiring my permissions.&nbsp; After an indefinite period of time, the shut down button does show that updates are awaiting a re-boot. I allowed this to occur once - sitting with a "please do not unplug or force close - updates installing" window for 9
 hours - while at work.&nbsp; The machine was frozen.&nbsp; No evidence of updating occurred and all listed pending updates remain pending.<br />
<br />
I run Microsoft Security Essentials and PC Tools Firewall Plus and feel confident that no virus is causing this problem. Were I to provide a learned guess, the machine appears to be blocking many temporary programs that want to read or write to the hard drive.&nbsp;
 But not all, as I stream video, record broadcast TV in WMC, use Firefox and Thunderbird - all with no problem.
<br />
<br />
As I definitely want to remove the Comcast installs and one ESPN WMC remote program, getting Windows Installer to work correctly is pretty critical.&nbsp; Wanting to use the Fix It program to review and correct registry problems is also strongly desired.&nbsp; Your recommendations
 here will be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks.<br />
<br />

            Whew!&nbsp; What a ride.&nbsp; But, it looks like it's over.&nbsp; Here are the details.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
The recovery disk maker software always hung at open - so I could not make the disks.&nbsp; All of HPs diagnostic software also hung at open.&nbsp; So both the HP site and their installed software were of no help.<br />
<br />
I ran chkdsk /f and chkdsk /r with no problems found.&nbsp; I ran Win7 memory diagnostic with no problems found.
<br />
<br />
Owing that my last encouraging change (getting MSE to install a virus definition update) happened when I was able to shut off the WU installer with "net stop wuauserv" I decided to try that again.&nbsp; It appeared to fail the first two attempts (each after a reboot),
 but by the fourth attempt and reboot, I managed to get it shut off.&nbsp; The immediate change was astonishing.<br />
<br />
However, one other caveat.&nbsp; Around the time of the failed Comcast software install on 10/26, and as the failure of system, Flash, and MSE updates began mounting, I had also connected an 80 gig USB flash drive to the system. In reading about similar problems
 with Windows 2000, I tried disconnecting my LAN to see if this were the cause of the conflict.&nbsp; (The LAN connection was started 10/26 - connecting the machine to the Comcast router.)&nbsp; There was no change.&nbsp; As I rebooted, I decided to disconnect the 80 gig
 USB drive in case it was causing a conflict.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
OMG.&nbsp; Either due to the successful shut down of the WU installer and/or the unplugging of the USB drive or both - I had a clean shutdown - no hang.&nbsp; Windows opened in record time and as I began checking the integrity of previously failing apps, MSE prompted
 me for a quick scan and ripped through to completion in record time (I ran a full scan later with no virus results.)<br />
<br />
I contemplated a "net start" but decided against it, as the machine was finally working normally.&nbsp; The only app failure was and continues to be: PC Tools Firewall.&nbsp; Apps I wanted to uninstall and others awaiting installation, all worked perfectly. Looking to
 reboot, the shutdown button listed a pending update (dunno if it was a system one) and that too worked flawlessly. A single update took 20-30 seconds and then shut down without hanging up - as it had for more than a week.<br />
<br />
Over the remaining 4 hours last night, the machine appeared to be back to functioning correctly in all matters except&nbsp; PC Tools Firewall.&nbsp; Whatever had caused this tremendous series of problems disappeared - either due to the "net stop" or the removal of the
 80 gig USB drive - or both. <br />
<br />
I have not restarted WU install using "net start" and have no immediate plans to do so. (For all I know, it restarts itself after a few reboots.)&nbsp; I will check the system update status soon and restart it, if need be.&nbsp; But, in getting my machine back to perfect
 health, I will be slow to let WU installer get reactivated by me.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
As for the USB drive, I will need to check it on another machine.&nbsp; I had used it to port some files off my machine (for portability) and do not need it permanently attached to this PC.&nbsp; It did work without error when transferring the files and I am unaware
 that it had any failure which might have affected the PC.&nbsp; Never the less, as unplugging it seemed to coincide with getting the health of my machine back, I will not be in any hurry to reconnect it.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.&nbsp; Like I said, it was quite a ride. &nbsp; But, I think I am out of the cold, dark woods and operating with a healthy machine once again.<br />

<h2>            CUDA support on Surface Book 2</h2>
                    <p>Installing the NVIDIA CUDA v9 on my Surface Book 2 [i7/16Gb/52HDD/GeForce GTX 1050]; got a warning from the installer that it wasn't able to find the GPU. While It did say that it expected this on newer versions of the hardware, I'm a little antsy about
 overwriting my stock drivers. Anyone did this already?</p>

            <p><span>Hello Angela,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I can imagine the inconvenience you are experiencing and I appreciate your efforts taken to resolve the issue.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This problem may occur if one or more of the following conditions are true:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>i. You have a removable drive, configured as drive letter C.</span></p>
<p><span>ii. You do not have a removable disk in the removable disk drive.</span></p>
<p><span>iii. Third-party application conflict or virus infection. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Let’s try to identify the actual cause and troubleshoot accordingly.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">However, before we proceed I would require some more information to assist you better.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>1. Did this problem recently begin? If so, do you remember making any changes to the system prior to this issue?</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. Is there any external devices connect with your computer?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to try the following methods:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As a work around you may insert a removable disk in the removable drive before you start the computer and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If the issue still persists, then try to <strong>change the drive letter assignment for the removable drive to a letter other than C.</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To change the drive letter assignments in Windows 7, follow these steps:
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Log on to the computer as Administrator.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. Insert a disk in the removable drive.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3. Click on <strong>Start</strong>, right-click on <strong>Computer</strong> and then click on
<strong>Manage</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>4. Click <strong>Disk Management</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>5. Right-click the removable drive that you want to change, and then click
<strong>Change Drive Letter and Paths</strong>. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>6. Click on <strong>Change</strong>, click the <strong>drive letter that you want to use</strong>, and then click
<strong>OK</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue still persists, then try method 2.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Step 1:</span> </span>
</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Boot the computer in safe mode with networking</span></a><span>
</span></strong><span><span>and check if the issue persists.<strong> </strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Safe mode is a diagnostic mode that starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started. The words&nbsp;<strong>Safe Mode</strong>&nbsp;appear in the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows
 mode you’re using.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Step 2</span></strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">:</span>
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If issue does not appear in safe mode, there could be possibility of some background programs conflicting with the smooth running of the computer. To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start computer by using a minimal set of
 drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot". A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>

            <p><span>Thank you for your response. Let me answer your questions:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1. Did this problem recently begin? If so, do you remember making any changes to the system prior to this issue?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Answer: Yes. I now have
 two people sharing this PC and set up this PC to have multiple users the day before this issue began happening. It would only happen when they would "Switch Users".</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. Is there any external devices connect with your computer? At the time this was occurring, I had a jump drive I use for backing up files inserted into a USB port. I had forgotten it was in there and booted up the computer without
 removing the jump drive. Since I had a feeling that might have something to do with the error message I made sure to remove it last night b</span><span>efore I left my office.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So far today I haven't seen the error message I've been making sure that one user is'Logged Off" before switching to the other user.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>So I'm not sure if the problem has been resolved completely. I'll save these instructions so I'll know what to do if it starts happening again.</p>

            Hi MegaLaserGamerX ,
<br />
<br />If device model was provided correctly that unfortunately we do not have any drivers for this camera for Windows 10.
<br />
<br />You can look here: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-gb/d/lifecam-vx-1000" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-gb/d/l...</a>
<br />
<br />Drivers are available only for XP, Vista, Windiws 7.
<br />
<br />Or do you have other model?
<br />
<br />Follow all steps from this guide: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/13753/windows-10-can-not-find-or-start-the-camera" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/13753/...</a>
<br />
<br />If this doesn't help, probably it cannot work with Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Let me know if you have more questions

<p>Thank you for your reply. Unfortunately I do not have the monitor during the boot period, only the keyboard and mouse are active.</p>
<p>Once Windows10 loads, it is just the opposite - I have the monitor, but no keyboard or mouse function in order to log in and proceed.</p>
<p>Under the topic of Devices and Drivers, DRN24 was conversing with Argel Obm - Forum Moderator, who last suggested re-installing Windows10 by creating an Installation Media for Windows10. I believe that is what I will need to do. Hopefully I can find my Windows10
 license information.</p>
<p>Also, during DRN24's conversation, 'Mike Smith' believes it was Microsoft Update&nbsp;KB04074588 on or around 2/14/2018. I believe the update occurred on my computer on 2/15/2018.</p>

            Hi Neil.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />This is believed to be caused by the recent Cumulative Update for Version 1709:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4074588/windows-10-update-kb4074588" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/407458...</a>
<br />
<br />I would try uninstalling it at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History.
<br />
<br />You might also be able to get back before it via System Restore:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Then if it reinstalls and causes the same problems, uninstall it again and block it using Method Two here:  <a href="https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automatic-updates-install-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automat...</a>
<br />
<br />If necessary you can perform these operations in Safe Mode:  <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>
<br />
<br />But if you can't get into Safe Mode try Advanced Startup Options by whichever method works here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a> 
<br />
<br />If no other method works it may be necessary to create and Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Boot mode uses different drivers so mouse and keyboard should work.
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />After it loads, on second screen, choose Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Troubleshoot Options, then System Restore.  
<br />
<br />If System Restore fails access the Command Prompt to try Option Five here to unlock F8 Advanced Boot Options in Windows 10 to reach Safe Modes:    <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>
<br />
<br />If necessary you Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />There is a step to rescue files using the bootable media here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

<p>Thanks Greg for your reply and all of the valuable suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, <em>outside</em> of Windows, the monitor is no longer active when booting or accessing the BIOS by any key-press combinations whatsoever, even after removing and re-inserting the CMOS battery, removing the CMOS jumpers - you name it, another
 tech source tried solving that one with every trick in the book. However, the mouse and keyboard are active - I just can't see to click on choices for anything 'bootable'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I let the system load to Windows, then the monitor is active but no mouse or keyboard thus rendering Windows inaccessible because I cannot get to the time/date screen to the password prompt in order to solve things from
<em>within</em> Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I purchased a new computer today. I don't know yet what version of Window10 Home it is yet, but I will check so as not to fall prey to the troublesome update. I also have a hard drive adapter so I can access the old hard drive via USB to retrieve photos,
 files, etc..</p>
<p>I will then re-install the old hard drive and see what I can do with it following the advice I have so kindly received in these responses to my post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully, others will benefit from this information.</p>
<p>

            Hi again Neil -
<br />
<br />Do you have links to other cases where the monitor is affected because I've seen my first two today out of the dozens with the USB issues in the Cumulative Update and am still trying to process it so I can elevate it via MVP channels.
<br />
<br />Have you tried another monitor yet?

<p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>Sorry for the delayed reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just reconnected the HP computer affected by the Cumulative Update to a different monitor and it DOES work at startup and I am able to access the basic setup menus,</p>
<p>Apparently Windows does not like Envision Monitors as I have run across other search results which briefly mention past issues with Windows and Envision Monitors. For the sake of compiling data, my problem Monitor is an Envision H22W which under 'Device
 Manager' on my new DELL computer is recognized by Windows only as: 'Generic Non PnP Monitor'. Also, I am having a problem with the H22W not displaying properly which, hopefully, will not be the case when I connect a new DELL Monitor arriving today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back to the HP computer, I hit the ESC key for the Startup Menu, selected F2 for System Diagnostics. It ran through correcting Disc Errors, made appropriate corrections to the surrogate monitor display and loaded to Windows with , of course, no KB or Mouse
 :-(</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will continue to try other options which you suggested.</p>
<p>Neil</p>

            I installed the latest updates to Windows 10 yesterday and today found my Kensington Expert Mouse Trackball no longer worked, even after several reboots, unplugging and replugging.&nbsp; So I downloaded the latest Kensington TrackballWorks and after removing
 the existing Trackball Works software, reinstalled it and then restarted the computer.&nbsp; This caused the computer to fail to boot.&nbsp; On the 3rd try, I got the Advanced Recovery page, from which I chose to revert to an earlier version of Windows 10.&nbsp; Now, following
 the reversion, the machine is working again with the mouse, but it seems from now onwards I will no longer be able to do any more updates to Windows 10 unless this gets fixed.<br />

    <title>Windows Updates kills wireless card - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> choggner  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Updates kills wireless card</h2>
                    I have an Compaq Presario F730US. The situation is a little bit complicated, but I will try to explain it.<br />
<br />
I was running Vista on the computer. One day I ran Windows update, and the computer stopped recognizing the wireless card. I uninstalled the updates and disabled new updates, and it seemed to work again. I did not like this setup, since I didn't want to have
 to avoid getting Windows Updates, but I accepted the situation because I was about to update the computer to Windows 7.<br />
<br />
After I did a clean install of Windows 7. The wireless card was working fine immediately after the install. The device manager recognized it (I checked because that was the problem I had been having with Vista). I used the computer for about an hour. I hoped
 that the problem would not come back with Windows 7, so I allowed it to run Windows Update. But immediately after I updated and restarted, the wireless card stopped working again. Once again it does not seem to be recognized by the computer.<br />
<br />
This time, however, once I uninstalled the updates the problem remained. I have re-installed the wireless card drivers. I am out of ideas. I have been on the phone with Microsoft Support for several hours now, and they are shifting the blame to a faulty wireless
 card. But I know that the card worked perfectly up until the Windows Update ran. There's a very very low chance that my wireless card broke right as I installed the updates - especially since I had this problem with Windows Updates in Vista. Does anyone here
 have any ideas?

            Hello Choggner,
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for your posts. &nbsp;I have read your previous threads, so we can skip the BIOS/Driver download steps as you have already been down that road. &nbsp;After taking a look at Compaq(HP)'s site, it appears that there was an update required for Vista users.
 &nbsp;Click&nbsp;<a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareDownloadIndex?softwareitem=ob-55210-1&amp;lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;cc=us&amp;product=3548244&amp;os=2093&amp;lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HERE</a>&nbsp;and download/install the update. &nbsp;After the update is installed, reboot your computer and see if the
 wireless is recognized. &nbsp;Also, do you see your Wireless device in the BIOS?</div>
<div><br />
<div>We look forward to hearing back from you.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Cheers</div>

Unfortunately, installing that update did not restore the wireless function.

<p>I had exactly the same thing happen to me today (12-13-2010) when I reluctantly decided to run Windows Updates.&nbsp; I say reluctantly because I have never run Windows Updates with out something bad happening to my computer as a result.&nbsp; So today I ran the updates
 and things seemed to be working fine until Windows gave me the message to restart my computer in order to complete installation of the updates.&nbsp; So I restarted, and when my desktop was back I discovered that my internet connection had vanished.&nbsp; My network
 could not be recognized.&nbsp; I ran the troubleshooter and it said my network adapter could not be found, and asked me to connect an ethernet cable from my router to my machine.&nbsp; I did that and completed the troubleshooting process and then was able to get an
 internet connection.&nbsp; But as soon as I disconnect the cable I am back to where I was - that is, my network adapter is not recognized.&nbsp; I gather from reading this forum that many others have had exactly the same problem upon running Windows updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not know what to do at this point.&nbsp; I am not a technical person, and my work, which requires Internet access, has come to a standstill as a result of running Windows Updates.&nbsp; My computer is an HP G62-143CL notebook, running Windows 7.&nbsp; I don't know
 where to go from here.&nbsp; Please advise.&nbsp; I would like answers to these questions:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; What specific Windows update caused my network adapter to not be recognized, and why?</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; How do I, a non-technical person, get this problem fixed?</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Why would I ever willingly run another Windows update?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Andrea</p>

<p>1.&nbsp; It's really hard to say which exact update caused this problem unless you know which you installed.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The first thing to do is connect the cable for the time being so you can connect to the internet.&nbsp; Next, hit start, and type in Device Manager.&nbsp; Do you see any items listed that have a yellow exclamation mark?&nbsp; If so, right click on it, and hit update
 drivers.&nbsp; Hopefully this solves the problem - if not, what things have that exclamation point next to them?</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Because windows update is what helps protect you from viruses, and fixes bugs that are found in windows.&nbsp; It's unfortunate (and rare) that this has caused an issue for you.</p>

<p>Zac, thank you for responding.&nbsp; As you can see from other posts on this forum, as well as the list of related posts, others have experienced the exact same thing that happened to me, so this is not an isolated problem.&nbsp; I have looked under Device Managers
 and found my network adapter, and everything looks fine -- there are no yellow exclamation marks, and when I open the detail window, it says my network card is working properly.&nbsp; Nothing looks amiss.&nbsp; And yet, since I ran the Windows updates, my network adapter
 is not seen; hence no wireless internet connection.&nbsp; Right now I am connected via an ethernet cable.&nbsp; I have made two attempts to reinstall the driver for my network adapter -- first from the existing drivers on my machine, and when that didn't solve the problem,
 I downloaded an updated driver from HP (my computer's manufacturer).&nbsp; I installed that driver, but that too did not solve the problem.&nbsp; My network adapter is still not seen by Windows.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell from looking at this forum, it doesn't appear that anyone else who has had this problem has reported a successful fix.&nbsp; I don't know what to try next.</p>

            You say Winupdate caused the issue, but fail to say whether winupdate is set for 'Important Updates'<strong>only</strong> or if 'Reccommended Updates' is also selected.

<p>Thanks for trying to help man. I still haven't been able to solve the problem, and it's like 2 years old now. Unfortunately, your ideas did not turn up anything. Doing what you suggested was one of the first things I tried, and it was no good. Needless to
 say, I'm very disappointed with both Microsoft and Campaq/HP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to see a more full discussion of the problem, look at this thread:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even though it is marked as a solved problem, I know that Stonkey hasn't been able to fix the problem yet either. It's just an error that a fair number of people got, but neither Microsoft or HP felt like they needed to provide a solution.</p>

<p>Hi Chogger,</p>
<p>What is the brand and model of the wireless card you're having the issue with?</p>
<p>Do you update the BIOS as suggested by HP?</p>
<p>You can turn off recommended updates and that will prevent the driver updates and still install the Important updates the protect the operating system from vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>You can also go into the Device Manager, click on the View tab, and select Show hidden devices to see if there are multiple instances of the wireless card.</p>
<p>If there are, you can remove those as well as any "other devices" instances which might also be the wireless card.</p>

<p>Truthfully, I don't remember the brand of the wireless card. I stopped using the laptop about 6 months ago. As you can see, it's been nearly a year since I posted the original question. Having a laptop without a working wireless card defeated a large part
 of the purpose of a laptop for me, so I got a friend to loan me an old one to use.</p>
<p>I did try updating the BIOS and other various suggestions from HP. None of that worked.</p>
<p>I did turn off the non-important updates, but that didn't restore my wireless functionality (which was the whole point of the question). I also tried removing the updates that were installed when the problem started, but that didn't help either.</p>
<p>I also checked for extra instances of the card, but there none. There wasn't even one instance of the card there.</p>
<p>Like I said before. I've very disappointed with both Microsoft and HP on this issue. It doesn't help anything that some Microsoft moderator keeps marking ideas that don't work solution to the problem.</p>

            I also had this issue. I have a Toshiba Satellite L755-S5175 with a Realtek RTL8188CE wireless LAN card. Everything worked great until the most recent MS updates. Since I didn't have anything critical on it yet I did a repair reinstall of the OS (Win 10
 Enterprise). It worked until I did updates again.<br />

    <title>Surface Pro 2 Wireless Driver failed after updates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> james b. 52  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 2 Wireless Driver failed after updates</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft techs,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There have been two updates in the past two months (one last night), where the following morning, my wireless driver has failed to load properly. &nbsp;This was a huge inconvenience the first time, and I knew how to deal with it this time, so it wasn't as bad.
 &nbsp;When I shut down my surface, I click the "update then shutdown" option each time, like I assume I'm supposed to do. &nbsp;When I started up my surface, there were no networks available, which just wasn't true...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the fix, for anyone who has this issue:</p>
<p>(Surface Pro 2)</p>
<p>Use the search function to pull up your device manager.</p>
<p>Uninstall the wireless driver under Network Adapters (do not delete it)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-Mine is the Marvell AVASTAR 350N</p>
<p>Click the on/off button to sleep your surface.</p>
<p>After a few seconds, when your surface is sleeping, click and hold the on/off button for &gt;7 seconds to perform a soft reset</p>
<p>Your surface should complete the soft reset, re-install the driver, and it should work properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best of luck to everyone, and I hope this issue stops!</p>
<p>
</p><p>-James</p>

            <p>This fix works but as the problem has occurred to my Surface Pro 2 at least six times now, I'm wondering when the problem will be resolved.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are the Microsoft Engineers aware of it?</p>
