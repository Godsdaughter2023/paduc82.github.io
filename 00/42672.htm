                    I am wanting to do what the subject says... I can't do it using photo viewer, nor can I find any info on it... &nbsp;Is there another microsoft photo viewer with this capability? Non Microsoft if they don't have any. &nbsp;Thanks! &nbsp;JG

            <p>I can't think of any that would allow this. &nbsp;Now Microsoft makes an enhanced Photo Viewer called Windows Photo Gallery (<a href="http://get.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">download here</a>&nbsp;for Windows 7+) that lets you drag-drop picture thumbnails around into folders, but it
 looks and works pretty much identically to just opening the folder directly in the first place, so I don't know if that really gets you what you want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also right-click a displayed picture in the photo viewer to get to options like cutting it and pasting it into a target folder.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 keeps &#34;freezing&#34; randomly after fresh install on new SSD</h2>
                    <p>I had already upgraded to Windows 10 Pro from my Windows 7 pro install. It worked great but was a little slow so i purchesed a Sandisk 240gb SSD and fresh installed onto that. After the USB boot part had finished and it restarted, during the set up phase
 (WiFi settings, cortana etc) it randomly started to freeze. The mouse and screen would both become unresponsive and only way to get out of this was a hard reset. I finally managed to log into Windows 10 and the problem carried on. I tried to update my graphics
 card drivers (GTX 970) but the freezes carried on still, completely randomly. Sometimes while i'm browsing, sometimes when i'm sat idle at the desktop. I'm completely stuck with what to try. I did try to reinstall again but it didnt fix it. Help me please</p>
<p>If you want anymore information about my setup, just ask and thanks in advance</p>

<p>Hi Selvam,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The AppData folder is where your files specific to your user account are saved. This folder is normally hidden. The folder gets updated whenever you perform actions or tasks in your user account. However, to better assist you with your inquiry, we would
 like to know what specific task are you trying to perform with the AppData folder?</p>

<h2>            Installing MS KB978897 on Server 2008</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I'm trying to install the hotfix from MS KB978897 on a server running Windows Server 2008 SP2. I requested a download of the hotfix, but there were two files.: 417533_intl_x64_zip.exe &amp; 430589_intl_x64_zip.exe. Both were listed on the hotfix download page for
 Server 2008 x64. I know how to install them. I'm wondering if I need both or just one of them? Has anyone installed this hotfix?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<p><span>Hey mjb0919,</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know the exact error message.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>DEP: (Data Execution Prevention)</span></p>
<p><span>If you are receiving the DRM activator error message do the following to correct the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Left click on Start</span></p>
<p><span>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right click on Computer</span></p>
<p><span>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Left click on Properties 4 - Left click on Advanced System Settings</span></p>
<p><span>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under Performance click on Settings</span></p>
<p><span>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Left click on Data Performance Settings</span></p>
<p><span>f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on TURN ON DEP FOR ESSENTIAL WINDOWS PROGRAMS AND SETTINGS ONLY.</span></p>
<p><span>g.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on Apply and then OK.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>UAC: (User Account Control)</span></p>
<p><span>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open up Control Panel, and type in user account into the search box.</span></p>
<p><span>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You'll see the link for "Turn User Account Control (UAC) on or off".</span></p>
<p><span>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click it.</span></p>
<p><span>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uncheck the box, and reboot your computer.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>:
 Do enable it back once done with the test. </span><span><span>We don't recommend turning User Account Control off. If you do turn it off, you should turn it back on as soon as
 possible.</span></span></p>

<p>Hello Savan,</p>
<p>The error message comes up as :&nbsp; "Access violation at 0x00BE1E1C (tried to read from 0x8050244A) program terminated". It is whenever I try to activate games I purchased/or trial ones&nbsp;recently from BigFish</p>
<p>I have tried the "turn on DEP for essential windows programs and settings only". On my computer, when I go to control panel, under user accounts, I don't have a link or button that says "Turn user account control (Uac) on or off.</p>
<p>I did make a discovery today, but don't know if it is related, but it seems to be...&gt; While in "my computer" I clicked on a few of the BigFish games I have and compared the folders in them between the games that do run and ones that won't activate. I found
 that the ones that open and run ok are older games and they <em><strong>do not</strong></em> have a folder that says "DRM Activator" application in them. (these seem to be there only from games within the last 6mos,&nbsp;of which I have 3,&nbsp;none of them work)&nbsp;When
 I click on these folders from the newer games that don't work, that same access violation pops up immediately &gt; the 1st number seems to vary in which game I try, but the 2nd "tried to read from" number is the same.</p>
<p>I only started to get the "drmactivator is having a problem and needs to shut down" message since I tried downloading a trial&nbsp;game the other day.&nbsp;</p>

            I am having the same issue that you are describing.&nbsp; My DEP is already set for windows programs and settings only, my user account control is already off.&nbsp; I updated my video driver, as was suggested in the Big Fish online help and&nbsp;still have the problem.&nbsp;
 I cannot play ANY of the Bigfish games without getting access violations and DRMactivator shutdown messages every time I try to activate one of the games.&nbsp; Any more insight into this would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; I am running Windows Vista 32 bit.

            Hi Minikin, After reading and reading as much info here and seemingly having lost anymore contact from anyone here as well, I decided to do the drastic thing. I saved all my text files and fam. Pics etc and did a full system recovery. ( I am running windows
 xp, and having tried several of the read fixes to no avail, I figured that my system had over the last year been corrupted somehow) After running windows updates etc to get the system back to date again, I reloaded big fish and it's games and everything is
 running smoothly again. I never was able to find out what it was exactly that went wrong with bigfish programs. I had a running correspondence with them on the problem and although they did try, their "fixes" didn't work for me either. If you trace back in
 microsft answers, this problem with bf games, as well as others, has been happening for quite some time and although some of the advice fixes some peoples problems, they don't fix everyones apparently. Good luck Mike

            <p>Microsoft Updates CAN stuff up hardware and software programs you use. Fact. It stuffs up Hauppauge Capture (popular software used for recording video gaming videos to share on YouTube). I use the Xbox App too, and have a laptop and custom desktop gaming PC both use Windows 10. They also have Xbox Smartglass on Android and Apple phones. Or do you have a Nokia Windows 10 phone? Make sure the device you're Xbox app is on, and your console, are connected to the same home network you use. Make sure all devices have the latest software update. If it fails, for official support, contact Xbox Support. </p>

    <title>Windows 8.1 at 100&#37; disk usage after reserving Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fwd_nemstar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 at 100&#37; disk usage after reserving Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Foreword: This is the second time this has happened. The first time, it took me two weeks to figure how to possibly fix it (thankfully I have an old XP system I can use to search out fixes online). However, I can't remember everything I did to fix the issue
 the first time around. This was about a week and a half ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At any rate, the first time this problem developed, I had just updated my computer (an HP Pavilion g6 factory loaded to windows 8, then on purchase upgraded to windows 8.1... it worked fine for a year and a half), part of which failed - the skype update
 that was supposed to replace the 8.1 inbuilt version. However, I had also reserved windows 10, before I realized there was an issue with the disk usage. I originally thought it was the skype update, but I don't know now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The usual symptoms arose as described by numerous frustrated individuals on forums galore. Initially, the disk usage took several minutes to reach 100%, then, gradually - each time I rebooted - the time shortened considerably.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I expanded the virtual file to the recommended parameters and this gave me some breathing room by lengthening the time it took to get to 100%. I attempted sfc /scannow, and for whatever reason... sometimes it could complete and other times the disk usage
 prevented it - so, the problem sometimes did not start until after I left the command prompt. Disk corruption was found, not all of which could be fixed (I read the logs numerous times, and the problems were not always the same in comparison). I ran "DISM
 /online /cleanup-image /restore health" several times and it was basically the same story. Finally, I did a system refresh to windows 8, undertook several clean boots, more sfc /scannow and dism stuff (that finally worked), antivirus checks and rootkit checks
 (neither of which came up with anything), until finally the disk usage problem disappeared. &nbsp;I re-upgraded to windows 8.1, and had to update everything all over again, which was a very time-consuming process (days). It's worked fine for about a week or so.<br />
<br />
I updated again yesterday, and again reserved Windows 10 before shutting down. &nbsp;Today, on start-up, the same 100% disk usage problem has re-manifested (yeah... it's a ghost in the machine). sfc and dism both show errors again, where when I fixed it before,
 they had soldiered through everything (after the refresh). I REALLY don't want have to go through all this **** again.<br />
<br />
So...<br />
<br />
1. Is there an easier, less time-consuming way to do this (besides chucking it out the window), so that I don't have to re-update the same **** over and over again after the refresh and then after re-re-upgrading to 8.1 again? And if so... what is it? if not,
 then:</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Is this a sign of an impending drive failure? if not, then:</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Will Windows 10 address this issue? if not, then:<br />
<br />
4. Just as a wild guess, is this being caused by Windows 10 downloading components onto my system prior to the actual installation? The disk usage shows as 100%, but I get very little to nothing on the ethernet usage and the wireless is shut off, so I'd have
 my doubts. if not, &nbsp;then:<br />

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for posting your query.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I apologize for the inconvenience.</span></p>
<p><span>From description I understand that you are unable to work with your computer as expected. We will help you to resolve the issue.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>These issues might occur due to applications or services running at the startup on the computer. Bad sectors on the hard drive or outdated and incompatible
 drivers might also cause such issues. </span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>1. Which software are you using to monitor the hard disk activity?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Do you get any error message on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>First of all, take a note of the processes or applications that is running when the computer runs with high disk usage. Also, we need to find the
 applications that are running at startup. </span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps to check for the processes under Task Manager:</span></p>
<p><span>•Press
<strong>Ctrl+Shift+Esc</strong> to open <strong>Task Manager</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span>•Click on
<strong>Processes </strong>tab. Check if any of the processes consumes high memory usage.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Bad sectors on the hard drive can be a cause for high disk usage.</span></p>
<p><span>Check which process is utilizing the Hard Disk on Windows 8.1, you may try the following steps.
</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Open <strong>
Task Manager</strong> and click on <strong>Details</strong> tab.</span></li><li><span>Right click the columns headers and click "<strong>Select Columns</strong>".</span></li><li><span>From the "<strong>Select Columns</strong>" window, check: I/O Reads, I/O Writes, I/O read bytes, I/O write bytes and then click
<strong>OK</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Now the columns will be added to the view and will display how much each process is utilizing from the hard disk.</span></li><li><span>Sort by I/O read bytes or I/O write bytes by clicking on the column header to see which process is utilizing the Hard Drive most.</span></li></ol>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>If you not run the 'check disk' scan or tried optimizing the drive, follow the steps from this article.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Improve performance by optimizing your drive:</strong></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/improve-performance-optimizing-hard-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/improve-performance-optimizing-hard-drive</span></span></a></span></p>
<p><span>(<strong>Note</strong>: This applies to Windows 10 TP also.)</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Important:</span></strong><span> While performing check disk on the hard drive,
 if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive, it tries to repair that sector and any data available on that might be lost.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, I suggest you to refer to the suggestion by Arpan Kashyap from the following link.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-performance/windows-8-keeps-slows-down-to-100-disk-usage-and/cd787f8d-e7b4-4872-aecb-6f0cd15ad942?page=1&amp;tm=1380334962208"><span><span>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-performance/windows-8-keeps-slows-down-to-100-disk-us<span>age-and/cd787f8d-e7b4-4872-aecb-6f0cd15ad942?page=1&amp;tm=1380334962208</span></span></span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information helps. Feel free to get back to us for any further queries or issues related to Windows Operating System.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

            <p>I tried just letting it sit and process for a few days, based on what one guy had suggested on another forum (he talked about windows moving files away from damaged sectors, and this process creating a disk usage problem), however, on plugging it back into
 the 'net, the 100% disk usage started right back up again.<br />
<br />
Yes, I already followed Arpan Kashyap's suggestion, several weeks ago. That gave me a bit of breathing room, since the disk usage took several more minutes before it reached 100% and froze the system - thereby allowing me the chance to run chkdsk, sfc /scannow
 and dism... which sometimes were able to complete before the disk usage obliterated any chance of them actually starting. I was only able to run the optimization process after downgrading to windows 8. I was also only able to run chkdsk after downgrading.
 Both of these ran, initially, after I re-upgraded to 8.1 (just to make sure).<br />
<br />
Now, I can run chkdsk if I get into safemode on startup (shift+restart, for those that may not know - better instructions than I can give are on the net or in this forum). However, the results are not spectacular, to say the least. I've run it several times,
 and still the computer goes into 100% disk usage once it goes into normal mode. Task manager, which I have used since the beginning of this issue, tells me that "system", the Windows Modules Installer, and a number of other windows-related processes are the
 big culprits of the disk usage, although at times it is at 100% and nothing at all is showing as using the disk - this may be because the system is freezing and therefore task manager isn't registering the usage in real time, but that's merely conjecture.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Other high-rate processes, which were expected, include Norton and Total Defense Security Suite (no, I didn't have them loaded at the same time). TDSS actually actively attempted to prevent me from running the dism services, or do clean boots, so I chucked
 it. Norton apparently was a part of the original windows 8 loadout, and so appeared when I "refreshed" - I do wonder if the latent dormant&nbsp;files may have interfered with TDSS' processes, perhaps even precipitating some of this, since many anti-viruses don't
 like each other. <br />
<br />
In short, I know - and have tried - a number of different fixes for this apparently not uncommon issue. Unfortunately, the documents I was working on when this started may be a total loss, since I was unable to back-up all of them before it became apparent
 that this was going to be no trifling matter. I say this simply because at the moment, I have several plans:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Allow it to run ad infinitum while connected to the 'net - at least long enough to see if Windows 10 shows up (if that's what's causing this), and maybe - MAYBE - fixes the thing. It may well be that whatever snit it's trying to work through, even if
 it's not Windows 10 related, will be obviated if I just sit around and wait on it. If this doesn't work:<br />
</p>
<p>2. Rather than refreshing, I will do a full downgrade and start over with a hopefully completely clear system. Hopefully it (as in whoever programmed Windows 8) is smart enough not to write onto bad sectors (if that's what's causing this) - I've heard that's
 the way it's supposed to work, but who really knows. I'd prefer to format, but I'm guessing that might destroy the update process as well, since I don't have an external back-up of that and don't trust the one present on the system to make one that isn't corrupted.<br />
<br />
Unless you guys have anything better to suggest...?</p>

            I decided to reset the OS before windows 10 gets here, since DISM is showing an error that requires a new source, so, I had to download the ISO anyway. Might as well just get it over with... except of course, now it says "There was a problem resetting
 your PC", so now I've got to fix that. I guess them's the breaks. Thank you Windows 8.1 and whatever it is that caused this - if it's simply the complexity we've all come to know and expect in modern computing.

            I had the same problem. &nbsp;Geek squad worked on it remotely for two days and I finally had to take my computer in to Best Buy. &nbsp;Geek Squad reported back that Windows 8.1 was corrupted by unknown source but likely an update. &nbsp;They wanted an additional $85
 to backup my stuff and then return to the computer to factory settings. &nbsp;Capable of doing both, I declined and will pick it up tomorrow. &nbsp;Is this the only fix? &nbsp;I'm not a techie but I know this was microsoft's fault.

            I was able to use the system - on a limited basis - in Safe Mode (with and without networking), but if I tried to download anything from the net, as in updates, the system would **** out (same with attempted back-ups, towards the end). However, I was able
 to download the Windows 8.1 media to a USB drive while in Safe Mode, then circumvent the issue with getting the system to restore to factory settings (because it wouldn't) by running a format, after a restart, and then installing 8.1 anew from the USB. In
 consequence I lost everything tied down, including HP's "Assistant" (no great loss there) - but it works now.
<br />
<br />
I was able to "shuttle" valued files to my secondary system prior to doing any of this by copying them to the USB drive while in Safe Mode and then transferring them physically (I know lots of people already know all of this simple stuff, but in case you don't...
 here it is). Of course, once the Windows 8.1 media goes on the USB drive, it erases everything else, so mind you get your transferring done ahead of time if you have limited resources (as I do).<br />
<br />
I probably should have written all of this several days ago, but I was still pretty pissed off. Therefore... a week and more later... it works like a champ. There was, however, one update that refused to install, so I "hid" it. I'm leery about updates nowadays;
 while I suppose I'll give 10 a try, I am not transferring major files back until I see how things go.
<br />
<br />
It's always good to have a few fallback options available: here's to having a stable secondary system... hopefully it stays that way. ;)<br />

<h2>            No permissions in administrator account</h2>
                    <p>When I first set my PC up for Windows 8.1, I set myself as the Administrator. (And did not add an Administrator as such)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now a good percentage of the time, I get error messages stating that I cant create a folder, or cant rename a folder, or various other things that I - the administrator of my accounts and system - don't have permissions to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When looking for answers in the community, I see where I evidently need to be a genius, and use something about Office 365 or some such.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, when following links given to thread holders, it is stated that support for such ended in 2014...&nbsp;&nbsp; Wow!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Look all I wish to do is access my PC, (I am the only user) add folders in the areas where I wish to, rename them as I wish to so that I can add files to them, without being told that I don't have permissions to run my PC as I wish!&nbsp;&nbsp; Darn it is mine I paid
 for it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Microsoft, Google, HP, and wont me to...&nbsp; awe **** now I am off on one of my tirades...&nbsp; We are offered no support from any of these companies and have no where to turn but to the community....&nbsp; This is fine and dandy but the only ones who care to help
 are those who really do know how to&nbsp; operate a PC very well, don't really seem to understand that we,&nbsp;as average user(s), cant understand all the stuff which includes a lot of initials of processes which I have never heard of. (such as ASAP you can add xxxxxx
 to the ALCIA of your IOS which shoves it into PCOS in time to crash your dadblamed new PC with its totally new OS)&nbsp; &nbsp;which I cant understand anyways!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please How do I get permission to operate my OWN personal property HP PC programmed by Microsoft, using Windows that are covered with light reducing (to Zero) film, while trying to use Google to search for anything (and can find anything including **** that
 no one should EVER be subjected to) except an answer as to how to enjoy your PC!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Now, unless I have irritated everyone out there who could help me, how do I “get permissions” from my PC to do the simple things I should be able to do as ADMINISTRATOR.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you so much!</span></p>

            It is not uncommon for the CPU to run hot when under a load.&nbsp; If the computer is running okay then it really is nothing to worry about.

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Depending on the processes and processing of applications, the temperature of the CPU and GPU can increase. Make sure the PC fans are clean and dust free, you can also buy a portable cooling system as a station for use under the laptop.</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is actually very normal behavior for a laptop (or any pc) running a graphic intensive game on high settings.&nbsp; Provided you have liquid cooling (and you should on a gaming laptop) you should be fine.&nbsp; Theyre designed for this sort of thing.</p>

<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>What do you mean with liquid cooling? I am aware of the fact i have a dual fan cooling system on the left and right with copper pipes running to the middle. But liquid cooling? Does every gaming laptop have this?</p>

            It is usual for laptops that they are overheating, also if your laptot did not shut-down during high temperatures - it means temperatures are not too high to shut it down. Also try to clean the computer and check if fans are working as they supposed to
 do. Main thing, do not play the game in bed if blanket is under your laptop, it is obvious that temperatures are high.

            No, it can be purchased separately, such as ROG GX700, by connecting it directly to the laptop. However, this is an extreme solution and suitable for gaming laptops. However, you can try using a dual fan system.

<p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is common for laptops to hit a thermal limit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a look at your laptop and its not got the best cooling since its quite thin.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A lot of the thin gaming laptop can it 80c 90c.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best way to reduced heat is to cap the FPS and lower the CPU intensive graphic settings&nbsp;</p>

<p>On gaming laptops some of the more modern cpu/gpu/apu's are able to go to around 120 degrees before shutting down due to overheating, Your laptop will have software that automatically reduces game performance when certain thresholds for temperature are hit
 to reduce the overall heat.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Laptops generally run far hotter than pc's when it comes to gaming, My gaming laptop will hit around 85 degrees on more modern games without issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are aftermarket coolers you can get that will help with overall system temperatures and a few people like myself will replace the stock thermal paste with some good quality expensive paste (nano aluminium or diamond pastes work the best for transferring
 heat)</p>

<p>Question for you - Is a 3rd party firewall being used in place of the native Windows firewall ?

<p><br />
No third party firewall only Windows Firewall which has been disabled several times in attempt to install the updates. Virus program: Microsoft Security Essentials - shows nightly full scan and definitions up to date as of right now.</p>
<p>Have not ran any third party utility or registry cleaner since we had it.</p>
<p>System Mechanic (Microsoft) has been installed and will not help.</p>
<p>I will try the .net 4 as you suggested since I have not tried that yet. Will reply back when I have done that and retried afterwards to do windows&nbsp;updates.</p>

<h2>            Why aren&#39;t all my files transferring from my USB drive to my HDD&#63;</h2>
                    Just purchased a new Lenovo all-in-one with Windows 8, and I've really enjoyed learning to use Win8, but I'm having a very frustrating problem with copying my music collection from my 500 GB WD external USB HDD to my new PC.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm simply trying to drag and drop all of my music from the external drive to my music library. &nbsp;"Properties" of the source folder shows it should be 914 files in 133 folders for a total size of 4.22 GB.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I "select all" then cntrl-C then cntrl-V in the destination and the copy moves along pretty quickly. &nbsp;One odd thing is I get a couple errors about file names being not valid or too long, probably because these files have semicolons or question marks, but
 this is only a couple files and i skip them.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Before long, the transfer "completes", and the properties of the destination show 461 files in 88 folders with a total size of 2.25 GB; roughly half of the data I wanted to copy!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any ideas on what could cause this? &nbsp;Could odd characters in the file names cause 'silent' problems in a file transfer like this? &nbsp;Could it be a problem with the drive? &nbsp;I never noticed any problems using it before.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance!</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It could be the characters in the file name, and it may be that the file name is too long....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not necessarily the actual file name possibly, but the combination of the file name, and how deep it is being buried in a Hard Drive folder...which when combined, can make the overall name quite long....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance...as an example...If your are getting the error trying to copy to</p>
<p>X:\ Documents\ Photos\ My Vacation, try instead X:\ Documents\ My Vacation....</p>
<p>or just X:\ My Vacation</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may or may not then be able to cut and paste to Photos</p>

    <title>Recommendations for Windows 10 Home system repair disk and system - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cvarga  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recommendations for Windows 10 Home system repair disk and system image creation frequency</h2>
                    <p>I thought I had a good understand of backup and restore for Windows. Following a recent problem where neither my saved backup (system image) nor system recovery disk resolved my problem, I am wondering now what are the recommendations for&nbsp; how often I need
 to create a new system repair disk or a system image. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that any new files or apps and settings changes made following a backup activity can't be restored using my backup or saved system image. What I am curious to know is whether I need to make a new system repair disk and create a new system image
 backup whenever Microsoft distributes a new build version. </p>
<p>
</p><p>When I had the problem I referred to, the system failed to boot up but put me into the Windows Recovery Environment, where it tried to diagnose and repair an undescribed problem. The automatic repair failed. I next tried to use my Win 10 system repair disk
 to no avail. I downloaded the Win 10 ISO and tried to reinstall from it unsuccessfully. The messages I received suggested that the recovery steps I was trying were inconsistent with the installed OS. This brings me back to my original question. When Microsoft
 installs a new build version (such as going from the 10568 to the 14363 builds, do I need to create a new system repair disk and/or a new system image backup? Thanks in advance for your help.</p>

            Yes, your thinking is correct. A new build is basically a whole new OS so a new system image and repair disk are in order. Also the restore point setting is off by default so turn that back on.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To reset your Surface from a USB recovery drive:</p>

<p>Step 4: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Surface logo appears, release the volume button.</p>
<p>Step 5:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When prompted, select the language and keyboard layout you want.</p>
<p>Step 6: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select Troubleshoot &gt; Reset your PC.</p>

<h3> michael jeffrey pantastico  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why can&#39;t I turn off Battery Saver&#63;</h2>
                    I just have a question on why I can no longer turn off battery saver and on why it is now perpetually on? Even when my battery is above 90% it still appears to be on, evident from the green icon on the bottom left of the battery icon. When I try to turn
 it off from the action center, clicking on the battery saver tile has no effect and there is also no option to turn it off in the battery settings.

            For continuity it is best to stick with one thread on a topic, especially as the response to your last question was only a couple of days ago. If you feel your thread is being lost on the back pages just bump it with another post.<br />
<br />
While the error report mentions AMD that does not directly apply to your cpu or it's driver. I think it relates more to 64 and 32 bit apps .<br />
If you look in the <span style="font-style: italic">Winsxs</span> folder and open various&nbsp;
These folders are part of Windows updates. Have you had a problem with any<br />
of the updates ? If not, running Windows updates may resolve the conflict that leads to<br />
the error.<br />
- Just a thought - 2AM ? Do you have Windows setup to check for updates at that time ?<br />
Is the machine turned off at that time ? If so and Windows can't do what it's told it will generate an error report.<br />
<br />
Or - from the following it looks like&nbsp; the 32bit option is not playing nice with the 64bit option, and that the file involved is&nbsp;
<br />
Don't worry that a file that ends in 32 is in a 64bit folder.<br />
<br />
Reading the information in the link below seems to indicate there is a conflict with<br />
something you have installed, and it's attempt to use the comctl32.dll .<br />

<br />
Your system is running properly, yes ?<br />
I don't know what is generating the errors but errors do happen, and many of them
<br />
are not a problem. With one's like this it is often because you have something setup that<br />
does not follow Windows rules, so Windows has to have something to say about it, but<br />
if everything is working properly you needn't worry about it. If you have a software that<br />
is a bit buggy that may be the source of the error.<br />
<br />
The MS link below gives some explanation of the purpose of the Winsxs folder.<br />

            Spybot has been reported to conflict now and again (as do all forms and brands of AV).
<br />
I reckon if you use Tea-timer it is more&nbsp; likely to cause problems. <br />
Also - While it's good to have more than one malicious code detector to run as a cross check,<br />
even though Spybot specialises in spyware&nbsp; you should not run it in resident with your AV, as<br />
running more than one AV (or combo of code detectors) in resident, can cause conflicts .<br />
I'm guessing the same may apply with firewalls, so disabling the Windows firewall may also do<br />
the trick, if you have it enabled.<br />
