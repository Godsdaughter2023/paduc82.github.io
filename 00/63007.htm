<h2>            NO ONLINE Play 4 UFC&#33;&#63;...Battlefield won&#38;&#35;39&#59;t update&#59; updeate error code 0x8b50033 0x00000000 0x00000402...</h2>
                    
<p>This may just turn into a rant. &nbsp;Starting with my latest issues with the XBOX ONE....Currently I can't play ANY online modes for the EA SPORTS UFC. &nbsp;It started with my game freezing, &amp; making what sounded like the disc being grinded or the disc getting stuck
 while loading. I had to unplug the Xbox1 just to get it to turn off. &nbsp;When it rebooted I tried to play the UFC online again but I couldn't. I thought it may have been the EA servers, so i watched TV and waited until the next day to try and play again. The
 message that kept coming up on the UFC was..."THIS SESSION FAILED TO LOAD. PLEASE TRY AGAIN". &nbsp;I uninstalled the game and all its contents, reinstalled it and tried again. &nbsp;Same message. I then tried to play one of my friends ONLINE, in a game of UFC. I sent
 him the game invite. &nbsp;He accepted, then his game froze and did the exact same thing mine did. I actually heard the grinding noise thru the headset. Now he can't play the UFC ONLINE. &nbsp;Ok, I figured the UFC was spreading some sort of virus. haven't tried playing
 any of my other friends that have it cause they didn't want "THE UFC VIRUS". &nbsp;This was, I think 3 days ago. &nbsp;Today is 6/27/14. &nbsp;This morning tired the UFC again...same thing. I decided to play the BATTLEFIELD 4, which I have no disc for (Hard Drive), the UFC
 I have on disc. &nbsp;When I tried to play BF4, it said, "THIS GAME NEEDS AN UPDATE". Which it tried, but then said, "THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE UPDATE", and gave me the link to trouble shoot the problem. &nbsp;I followed the steps with no success. I tried the Reboot
 according to the directions to clear the cache and such...still the same on both games. &nbsp;Held down the bumpers and the triggers and got this code...0x8b50033 0x00000000 0x00000402. &nbsp;It seems i can play the 2k14 online, I went to quick match, go into a game
 with some random person, played a few possessions and quit. &nbsp;Following the steps from when my BF4 said I needed an update, and there was a problem with the update, I got to the last step, which said my console needs repair. &nbsp;I also was checking the UFC forum
 and did see other people &nbsp;with then same issue I was having with not being able to play ONLINE. &nbsp;What gives MICROSOFT, XBOX ONE, BILL GATES, WHOEVER WILL LISTEN? &nbsp;These are JUST the latest issues I'm having with this BUGGY &amp; GLITCHY machine/computer/entertainment
 device/whateva you want to call it.... For $500 out the gate, IT should run flawlessly. &nbsp;Now with that being said, does ANYONE have ANY idea what is going on with this system of mine?</p>

<p>Oddly enough, Windows has a very similar error code of 0x00000402 which is to do with damaged system files. Not saying that it is the same cause for Xbox One but a bit of a coincidence.</p>
<p>Have you tried a system restore - <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/system/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../reset-console-to-factory-defaults</a> </p>
<p>As long as you have been connected to Xbox Live your save games will be on the servers but it would mean you need to reinstall/re-download games, updates and DLC you have purchased.</p>
<p>This is obviously the last thing to try but you mention you tried other trouble shooting steps.</p>

<p>To fix this when you see this happen is to do a hard reset on your console. &nbsp;To do a hard reset after turning on your xbox one you then hold the power off button down for about 10 seconds. &nbsp;You'll hear a slight noise as if it's processing something. &nbsp;If
 done correctly you'll see a xbox green screen come up when you turn the system back on. &nbsp;It will take about a minute to boot up at the most but you should be able to play with no problem. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>Something Xbox updated cause this to start happening recently so I can't blame EA as the game was running smooth when I got it. &nbsp;Any questions your can hit me on my gamer tag @SlickCoolie. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>On the BF4 I never seen that problem.</p>
<p>PEACE!</p>

<p>Im getting the same error code with a digital version of Dying Light. No offered solutions seem to work. YES ive tried the system hard reset and cleared the cache and NO they do not help.
</p>
<p>BTW @ Slick Coolie, The xbox one shows that " xbox green screen " on start up normally soooo that doesnt mean anything. And your solution doesnt help at all.</p>

    <title>Laptop working hard after Recent Windows 10 Update. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rod352  say:</h3>
<h2>            Laptop working hard after Recent Windows 10 Update.</h2>
                    Installed the most recent update for Windows 10, and now my laptop is working really hard. The fan, which is normally quiet, seems to be in overdrive since the upgrade, and my laptop is getting quite warm. Haven't been doing anything more than casual browsing,
 and for the most part it's been idle. Still no change in fan speed/volume, or heat. Tried two restarts, but nothing has changed. It's bad enough that my computer went from a 30 second start-up(Windows 7) to taking about 5 minutes for it to boot with Windows
 10, but now the new update is making my laptop work a lot harder than it should be. Any thoughts?

            Your suggestions really didn't help me, but thanks for replying. The troubleshooting showed no issues; the only programs running when it's getting warm and overworking the fan are two browsers; and I'm not short on memory so it's not that. On top of my
 laptop working harder than it was before the November update, it now shuts itself off during start-up 50% of the time. Windows 10 has left a pretty sour taste in my mouth. I'm going back to Windows 7.

<h2>            0x81000001 error code when I try to back up my files to an external drive</h2>
                    I am trying to back up my files to an external drive. One backup succeeded ages ago but whenever I try to update it I get this error message. I've managed to do a system image on my spare internal drive. What I really need is instructions on the best way
 to back up my files. Ideal would be a mirror of my one terrabyte internal hard drive onto my other one terrrabyte internal drive, so backups are automatic and regular, but I don't know how to do it.
<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help offered.<br />

    <title>Xbox One S Wi-Fi connection Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yourowner53  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One S Wi-Fi connection Issues</h2>
                    
<p>Just exchanged my new Xbox One S for another one due to problems connecting to Wi-Fi. The last two weeks, everytime I turned on the system it was automatically disconnected from the internet. When I went to settings to connect again, no wi-fi signal would
 show even when I pressed "Y" to refresh. It was like there was no Wi-Fi card(part) in the system I have to restart the system or hold down the power for 10 seconds. Once the system restarts, Wi-Fi is automatically connected. But if the xbox is off for a period
 of time like 4 hours, the same issue happens. This might be to bad firmware release. Because this is the second console that does that. Less than a month ago it wasn't having any issues. Last two weeks, that changed. Anyone else having this issue? Have a good
 weekend!!!!</p>

<p>It seems there are some users that are having issues with the Xbox one S wireless connection related to the instant on function.</p>
<p>Maybe one work around for now is that you turn off the instant on function and try using the power save turn on option. &nbsp;It will take longer to boot each time but your wifi hopefully should work each time.</p>
<p>Hope this helps. &nbsp;Sorry it's only a temporary solution.</p>

<p>Count me as another one having issues with the WiFi. &nbsp;I bought a brand new one s last Saturday and immediately started having issues with the console dropping the connection. &nbsp;After talking with tech support, &nbsp;they suggested I exchange the console. I did
 that and am having the exact same problems. Very frustrating </p>

<p>Have you reset your router? Also check to to see if the router detects your XBox IP when it is connected and disconnected to see if it is broadcasting.</p>
<p>Is everything else on the wifi working fine? I would also contact ISP to see if they have any suggestions.</p>
<p>Also try setting your xbox IP to static on the router to see if that helps.</p>

                    My laptop has begun to randomly shut down with out warning, no blue screen no error report, after which windows starts normally, if not always completely, before stopping again. Ill make this short before it craps out again, and hopefully I will be able
 to use it long enough to check back for answers.

            Hello,<br />
<br />
This is a service associated with HP printers. From what I can find, it really doesn't need to start at Windows startup.<br />
It is called "HP CUE DeviceDiscovery Service"<br />
<br />
To set it to Manual, or just Disable it. Follow these steps.<br />
<br />
Click Start and type&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Services&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; press Enter<br />
Seach for the "HP CUE DeviceDiscovery Service", right-click it and set it to disable or manual.
<br />
<br />
If you find that your HP printer is not functioning correctly, uninstall and reinstall the HP software.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.

<h3> mhostly  say:</h3>
<h2>            WIndows 10 spotlight stopped working</h2>
                    <p>UPDATE:&nbsp; I have somehow resolved this issue by doing the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. In Personalization I changed the lockscreen to "Picture"</p>
<p>2. I turned "OFF" the switch for&nbsp; "Get fun facts, tips, tricks, and more on your lock screen"</p>
<p>3. I retried the procedure outlined in the link in my original post (DISM... sfc /scannow....&nbsp; Get-AppXPackage... )</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Note that I still got the same error about Cortana app needing to be closed.</p>
<p>4. Rebooted</p>
<p>5. In Personalization I changed the lockscreen back to "Spotlight"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mysteriously it now works....for the moment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks to everyone that suggested solututions.</p>
<p>

</p><p>I am using Windows 10 Pro on a Dell 3470 laptop.</p>

<p>
</p><p>This worked that time.&nbsp; Now it has stopped working again and the solution above does not work.&nbsp; I get this error message when I attempt the</p>
<p>"Get-AppXPackage...." command......</p>
<p>Add-AppxPackage : Deployment failed with HRESULT: 0x80073D02, The package could not be installed because resources it modifies are currently in use.<br />

            Hello, I’m Virginia an independent advisor here.
<br />You could use this fix from the tenforum to reset &amp; re-register Spotlight: 
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/82156-reset-re-register-windows-spotlight-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/82156-reset...</a>
<br />There’s a bug with Spotlight since the Fall update, if you choose ‘not a fan’ it resets the background to the default photo so you have to run this fix again.

            Thanks for your suggestion. The solution mentioned closing down the App in Task manager.&nbsp; The error states that Cortana is the app that needs to be closed.&nbsp; You can't close Cortana in Task Manager.&nbsp; I tried closing it in the local group policy editor,&nbsp;
 but I still got the error.

    <title>How to import EFS key from an XP backup&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> oloriene  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to import EFS key from an XP backup&#63;</h2>
                    Hi there,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I know this question has been asked before but I cannot seem to fathom the answer from the other posts.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have an old backup from a Windows XP Pro machine, and I have managed to restore the EFS certificate to my new laptop using BKF extractor software.</div>
<div>The old backup contains files that are encrypted with an EFS key. (I know, should not have played with fire!)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I currently have a SONY Windows 8 Home laptop.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried to import this certificate using the Cert Manager and the Console Snap-in tools as&nbsp;described&nbsp;by Microsoft in various articles.</div>
<div>I see that many other posts suggest EXPORTING the key and giving it a password, but my old computer is toast and I only have the backup itself.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How do I simply tell my laptop that THAT is the key to use to view the files? Can I do the Export - Import function with a restored EFS key?</div>
<div>Are the old keys themselves encrypted and I am whistling past the graveyard?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you for your time, I hope I am not repeating any other posts here. I just cant seem to get my new laptop to&nbsp;recognize&nbsp;the old key.</div>
                </div>

            Hi Pinkati,
<div><br />
<div>I had looked at that particular article but I am afraid I had no joy.</div>
<div><br />
<div>My original laptop crashed during a shutdown and I think my user profile got completely scrambled.</div>
<div><br />
<div>What I have done though was a full system restore on the original laptop (fortunately it was unused at the time). I was at least smart enough to backup the full system state and all files on the laptop (inlcuding the encrypted ones) before the laptop crashed.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I then logged on via the Administrator account (would you believe that I lost the user account password...?) and installed an EFS recovery software program. The software was able to locate the security keys and decrypt the files. Sadly the demo version
 does not do a full restore so I am scraping together the $149 to buy the full program.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I hope that anyone else out there can&nbsp;benefit&nbsp;from this as I have looked at all avenues to try and recover the lost keys and all sorts of decryption software. The only way that I can seem to find to recover my EFS encrypted files is the following scenario:</div>
<div><br />
<div>1) A full system backup of your computer (including a System Sate backup).</div>
<div>2) An unused computer that you can do a full restore onto (with XP pre-installed onto it.)</div>
<div>3) Administrator access (the XP Sytem Administrator.)</div>
<div>4) Some sort of EFS Recovery software (I am not going to try and punt anyone here...)</div>
<div>5) A healthy credit card.</div>
<div><br />
<div>And then restore the backup, log in as Administrator, install the EFS software and let it run.</div>
<div>In my case the software found all the keys, decrypted them and the proceeded to decrypt my files.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps.</div>

    <title>I was wrongfully banned from Xbox Live. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            I was wrongfully banned from Xbox Live.</h2>
                    
<p>My Xbox Live account is named: l Watch Kids (The l is a lowercase L)</p>
<p>I occasionally let my son play Call of Duty on the account.<br />
I was not present at the time but yesterday my son told me he got into a "hacker lobby" in Call of Duty which apparently&nbsp;does something which is against the Xbox Live Terms of Service.</p>
<p>I assume this is why my account was banned as the e-mail I received said I tampered with my console.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
My account is now banned from Xbox Live. I spent ALOT of time and money on that account only to have it lost and I think it is unfair that I have to suffer for my son's actions so I asked a member of Xbox Support and they referred&nbsp;me to these forums and told
 me to express my issue here.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 255, 1)">I am sorry to hear about this, but Xbox is very firm on this. They will most likely not reverse the ban because, although you may be genuine, they probably get a lot of people that say, "It was my friend, child, etc." They are
 trying to make an enjoyable community for the fair players and have Xbox Live&nbsp;Terms and Service&nbsp;for a reason. If the rules are broken, by anyone using the GT/console, no matter who, it will be banned/ suspended&nbsp;accordingly. I'm sorry but I don't think they
 will reverse it as they don't know for sure it was your child who did it.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>"Document in ADF", usually means that there is a document in the Automatic Document Feeder. Or to put it differently, there is a paper jam in the document feeder (probably of the scanner part).</p>
<p>The fix is to check the feeder and clear the jam. Sometimes it indicates there is a piece of paper stuck or a faulty paper detector.</p>

<h2>            Asus Zenbook Function Keys Not Working</h2>
                    I recently bought a Asus Zenbook UX305FA and it came with Windows 8. I upgraded to Windows 10. After all the updating and installing, I finally got to using it. I noticed that none of the function keys worked. Or rather, did other things. For example:
 my sound (up) key launches Inspect Element in <em>Chrome.&nbsp;</em>Does anyone know how to fix this issue?

            <p>Hello&nbsp;Funky Chipster,</p><p><br /></p><p>Your deposit is being prevented due to a mismatch between your Irish Rewards Account region and your British Microsoft Account region. Since your Rewards Account is a separate entity from your Microsoft Account, migrating your Microsoft Account region will not also change your Rewards Account region. Therefore, when your Rewards Account attempts a deposit in one regional currency, it cannot complete when your Microsoft Account is of a differing currency. Also, since your Rewards Account is Irish, it is only tracking purchases in Euro. Purchases in a different regional currency will not be eligible for Rewards.</p><p><br /></p>
<p>However, this issue can be fixed by heading over to the Microsoft Commerce page at (<a href="https://billing.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://commerce.microsoft.com</a>) to update your Microsoft account to match your Xbox Live Rewards location. Another option if you wish to continue with Rewards in your current Xbox Live region is to opt out of the program at ( <a href="https://rewards.xbox.com/optout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://rewards.xbox.com/optout/</a> ) , wait 48 hours and then sign back up again, which can also take 48 hours.
  &nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>While you will lose your progress by starting a brand new account, you can start earning Rewards Credits that will successfully reward your newly registered regional currency. To confirm that you have re-registered correctly, you can check your join date from the MyRewards page at (<a href="https://rewards.xbox.com/myrewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://rewards.xbox.com/myrewards/</a>). If your join date shows a specific date and not a date of "???", then your account has successfully been re-registered. If you open a new post after being able to log in to your new Rewards account, you can request&nbsp; any pending deposits from your old account to your new one.

</p><p>To share screen using your Skype version, you may follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Start a voice or video call with a single person or a group.&nbsp;</li><li>During the call, tap or click the&nbsp;<strong>more button ( ... )</strong> ellipsis icon&nbsp;in the call bar, then choose
<strong>Share screen</strong>.&nbsp;</li><li>If you're using more than one screen, select the screen you want to share.&nbsp;</li><li>Use the <strong>Share your screen</strong> drop-down to choose what to share - either your full screen or a specific window, then choose
<strong>Start</strong>.&nbsp;</li><li>Select <strong>Stop sharing</strong> when you're finished.&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>The classic Skype version was removed from&nbsp;the website for download due to some issues with the installer. The problem is with the installer and not the Skype application itself. Users who have downloaded it before are not affected.</p>

<h3> nerdbrick  say:</h3>
<h2>            Media Center Guide &#34;No data Available&#34;</h2>
                    I've noticed that every now and then I will see "No Data Available" for some channels in the guide. Its random when it happens and what channels show it. The only way I can seem to bring the data back is to go into the guide editor and make one small change
 and save the guide. After the Save the guide is complete again. After a week or so, the same problem comes back. Might be timed with the automatic guide update.<br />
<br />
The channales that this is happening on are on my dishnetwork list. <br />
<br />
Thoughts?

<h3> browngjv  say:</h3>
<h2>            ksecdd.sys error</h2>
                    I woke up this morning and my computer was sitting at a black and white screen&nbsp; that said windows boot mananger:&nbsp; windows failed to start.&nbsp;&nbsp;a recent hardware or software change might be the cause.&nbsp; To fix the problem :&nbsp; 1 install your windows installation
 disc and restart your computer.<br />
<br />
down below it says<br />
<br />
File:&nbsp; \windows\system32\Drivers\ksecdd.sys<br />
<br />
Status:&nbsp; 0xc00000e9<br />
<br />
Info:&nbsp; Windows failed to load because a critical system driver is missing, or corrupt.<br />
<br />
I put in my Vista 64 cd and followed the instructions and the progress bar just goes and goes for hours and hours.<br />
<br />
I have not installed any new software lately, but yesterday afternoon my computer popped up an error message saying my software was no longer genuine.&nbsp; I bought my Vista Ultimate package from Staples over a year ago and registered it first thing and have installed
 other Microsoft software since then and it has checked to see if my operating system is genuine before.&nbsp; I don't know if this problem is related.&nbsp; I have restarted my computer over 50 times, put the instalation CD in over 50 times, and get nowhere.&nbsp; Any help
 at all, even if it's telling me there is no hope and to reformat would give me back some sanity.

            Have you tried using Last known Good Configuration when you Press F8 as if your going to boot into safe mode you will have the option there choose it and let me know the outcome?<br />
<br />
Lets see if you able to try Safe Mode with&nbsp;Command Prompt &nbsp;if the Last Known Good Configuration didn't work.&nbsp; If it lets you log in it should take you to the system32 directory&nbsp;within command prompt then from there type the following:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Type cd restore&nbsp;press enter<br />
rstrui.exe&nbsp;press enter <br />
This will bring up system restore <br />
<br />
When its scanning and looking for a way to scan your PC try and see if your able to press ESC to cancel out of the search to fix problems so it will take you into the System Recovery Option Tools..
<br />
<br />
Let me know of the outcome after performing these tasks. <br />
<br />
Thank You , <br />

<p><span>Hi WARDY4194,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>a. Did you make any changes prior to this issue?<br />
<br />
b. What type of backup are you creating, is it Automatic or Manual?<br />
<br />
You may have to put the computer in a Clean Boot and check for the issue. Below are the steps to put the computer in a Clean Boot State:<br />
<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p><strong><span>To perform a Clean Boot on a computer that is running Windows 7:</span></strong></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Also, see the section on how return your computer to a Normal startup mode by following the steps under “Reset the computer to start as usual”, after performing the clean boot
 troubleshooting.<br />
</span></p>
</span><span><br />
1. Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.<br />
<br />
2. On the General tab, click Selective Startup.<br />
<br />
3. Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.<br />
<br />
4. Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.<br />
<br />
5. Click OK.<br />
<br />
6. When you are prompted, click Restart.<br />
<br />
7. After the computer starts, check if the issue is fixed.<br />
<br />
If your issue is resolved after performing Clean Boot, then follow the steps mentioned in the following KB article to narrow down the exact source:<br />
<br />

</tbody>
</table>
<p><br />
<br />
<span>If you still come across the issue, you may format the External Drive and check if it shows up in the backup.</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Formatting the Hard disk would erase all the data.</span></span></p>

<p>So, either use that page's Find a Driver Auto-Detect while you are in W8 or fill in the form and specify the W8 X64 OS while you are in W7 and do the download there.</p>

In general you want W8 packages, not W7, however, if there is no W8 package you&nbsp;should try using the compatibility troubleshooter or the symptom that you reported may be understandable.</p>

    <title>High CPU usage for Windows Defender on Surface pro 4 after 1803 update - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            High CPU usage for Windows Defender on Surface pro 4 after 1803 update</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that since the update my Surface Pro 4 has been experiencing CPU usage problems. The fan seems to always be on after the recent update (1803, OS Build 17134.81). It doesn't seem to ever turn off anymore. When I took a look at what might be causing
 the high CPU usage, I noticed that the "Antimalware Service Executable" process has consistently been using up 30% of the CPU usage.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried to manually turn off real time protection temporarily to see if a change happened and it seems to stop the high CPU utilization but I'd prefer to keep windows defender active real time!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also tried to the command prompt(admin) method mentioned in another question but it hasn't come up with anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help?? I'm worried because the computer is now getting hotter and hotter with windows defender active, and between this and the Edge it consistently uses minimum 50%!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

            I have a surface pro 4 and I removed the 1803 update when i ran into this issue.
<br />I highly recommend you do the same until Microsoft comes out with new updates that support surface pro 4.
<br />To do this go to start - settings - update and security - recovery - go back to previous build.
<br />If you can't do that then below is a link for the surface images.
<br />Download for pro 4 and do a reimage.

<br />
<br />Then once you gone back pause the update... i have mine paused for 364 days.
<br />You can do this from Start - Settings - Update and Security - Advanced Options.
