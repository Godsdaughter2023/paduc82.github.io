<h2>            Controller shortcuts and how to turn them off&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Couldn't find any information on the Internet and need help.</p><p>I have a strange problem. When playong games pressing x or y buttons sometimes opens up dashboard menu or a turning off menu. Sometimes xbox oven starts to take videos. Mostly happens when you have to hold down these buttons (x and y). Happened a lot in Overwatch and in FFV. Maybe these are some kind of shortcuts and how to turn them off?</p>

<h2>            Windows Update KB3011780 Causes Blue Screen After Restart</h2>
                    Is anyone else having an issue with the latest Windows Security Update causing their PC to crash upon restart? I'm getting the blue screen of death whenever I restart to install the update. I'm currently using System Restore to go back to before the update
 is applied and there are no crashes after I do so.

            <p>Hello Deon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you get the stated error message when you take pictures from your Lenovo Thinkpad's built-in Camera but rest assured we'll help you troubleshoot the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the first place, you can click the Photos tile from the Start screen.&nbsp;This will take you to the camera roll. You can also click&nbsp;the Camera tile&nbsp;and then zoom out by pinching to see what's on the camera roll. The default storage location is Camera Roll
 folder. The pictures can be only saved to Pictures Library. However, you may create a new folder inside pictures library and change the default location to that folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow these steps to change the default location to a folder inside Picture Library.</p>
<p>a) <strong>Right click </strong>on Picture Library.</p>
<p>b) Click on <strong>Properties</strong>.</p>
<p>c) Click on <strong>Add button.</strong></p>
<p>d) <strong>Choose a folder </strong>that you want to <strong>add to</strong> <strong>
Picture Library</strong>.</p>
<p>e) <strong>Click </strong>on the newly added folder.</p>
<p>f) Click on <strong>Set save location</strong>.</p>
<p>g) Click on <strong>Ap</strong><strong>ply</strong> and <strong>Ok</strong>.</p>

    <title>Having issues accessing a shared folder with Windows XP and Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> amuzeini  say:</h3>
<h2>            Having issues accessing a shared folder with Windows XP and Windows 7 over a network.</h2>
                    This issue seems unsolvable, short of just sticking with XP which never had a problem with sharing files/folders. I have 2 Windows 7 x64 machines, one Ultimate, the other Home Premium on a home network. Both machines dual boot with XP. Both XP systems
 work like a charm in sharing files/folders. One of the machines is new with a fresh install of Win7 Home Premium. I have created a few empty folders on 2 drives (not C, but E &amp; G) so that I can transfer files, programs from the other machine and have enabled
 sharing on all of these folders.<br />
<br />
All these folders show up as shared on the network but I can only access one of them. They all have the same share settings and "everyone" has full control over them. File &amp; printer sharing turned on, passwords are disabled. By the way I do not like 'Homegroup"
 and have opted not to use it. <br />
<br />
So why can I access only one folder but not the others? I get a "You do not have permission to access \\xxxx" error when accessing the others.<br />
<br />
I have looked everywhere for a solution to this and found nothing. I hope someone can enlighten me as to how sharing can work and not work at the same time, even with same settings.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
AM<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
I'd suggest you follow these steps and check if the issue persists.<br />
<br />
<br />
You may use the Shared Folders troubleshooter to automatically find and fix some common problems.
<p><span>Open the Shared Folders troubleshooter by clicking the <span>Start</span> button, and then clicking
<span>Control Panel</span>. In the search box, type <span>troubleshooter</span>, and then click
<span>Troubleshooting</span>. Under <span>Network and Internet</span>, click <span>
Access shared files and folders on other computers</span>.</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span>Step 2:</span></p>
<p>Temporarily disable security software and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p><br />

<strong>Note:</strong> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats.&nbsp; In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable
 it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</div>

<h2>            Windows 10 update failed several times</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just bought a new laptop, <strong>Win 10 64bit</strong> </p>
<p>On loading it up I went through the motions of logging in, Wi-Fi etc. and then it went to automatically install the Fall update
<strong>1703</strong>. This failed and I'm pretty sure it said there might be a corrupt file. As I was eager to check other things on the PC, I decided to come back to it later and went to the desktop.</p>
<p>Later, it tried to install again and failed. Tried again and had a <strong>BSOD</strong>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was one of the error messages:</p>
<p>Windows 10 installation file is corrupted - error <strong>0x8007000d</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>From the update history I can see that it is both Quality updates and Feature updates that have failed to install</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a while I tried to<strong> reset</strong> the PC, but this froze at 34% and after reading other user's horror stories, I decided to
<strong>abort</strong> mission </p>
<p>Booting next morning asked whether to clear the <strong>TPM</strong>, so I did</p>
<p>Reached desktop</p>
<p>Since then I have tried the <strong>Troubleshoot</strong> which made no difference, and
<strong>Media Creator</strong> and that gave me error messages too:</p>
<p><strong>0xC1800103 - 0x90002</strong></p>
<p><strong>0x80042405 - 0xA001A</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>These were on two separate laptops, using a 16GB <strong>USB</strong> </p>
<p>
</p><p>It's now telling me the latest update is not 1703 but something beginning in 16, so I am updating to that right now, going ok so far but don't want to speak too soon, it's pretty slow</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other than this I don't quite know what else to do, please help</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t sign in...after changing my password&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    So, I had to change my password because one of my accounts on a different app got hacked, and now when I want to go on my Xbox 360 S I can't sign in. It says this "Sorry, Something's wrong with your Microsoft account. Go to https://account.live.com for
 help. Code: 8015D003". So following this instruction it wants me to change my password yet again!!! which as I said at the start I already had to do!! but since changing my password on everything my laptop still signs in using my old password but my Xbox 360
 s won't even recognise the old or new password and I have yet to try and sign in on my Xbox one. So any help would be really helpful...don't want to be changing the password again since it was done only a week or so ago and It's already proving to be a pain
 signing into things. Thanks

</p><p>I recently just built a new computer, however once I start up the PC I then ran into a restarting loop. So I suspected it is because I didn't install the drivers, however when i try to install it the same problem occurred again. Therefore I when on to try
 to reset the OS, but I couldn't mange to fully reset it as it reaches 66% the blue screen occurred again. Then when I try to turn on the computer again i see this message "an operating system wasn't found. try disconnecting any drives that don't contain operating
 system."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help. Thank you.</p>
<p />

            <p>Hi, thanks for replying</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running a ASROCK H170M-ITX/ac for the motherboard, the system is UEFI. For the OS I installed a Windows 10 OEM DVD. I have tried inserting the OS disk again to reset it however it doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am wondering will the problem be solved if I replace the HDD? But can I use back the same OS DVD? Or I have to get a new one?</p>
<p />

            <p>I have never installed an OEM version of software, so perhaps someone who has experience with that will advise if any special procedures are required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Depending on how your Bios is configured, you may or may not be able to boot to a Legacy DVD.&nbsp; But first, are you trying to install as UEFI and are you running the x64 bit version of the OS?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you did the install, the system may have asked how you wanted to boot, do you remember seeing that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried removing the DVD from the system when you boot?&nbsp; If it is removed, try inserting it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did the install ever complete initially?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you installed originally or during any follow on attempts to install, are you getting any messages other than what you mentioned, and when exactly do you get them?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What type of drives do you have in your system?</p>

<p>If your not getting artifact on every game your playing I doubt this is a hardware issue, as artifacts would be appearing all over the place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this happening mostly when the system is under load?&nbsp; Could be over heating, make sure its in a well ventilated area.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly it could be a bug with the game itself, checking the games forums to see if other people are getting these issues could confirm its the game and not your Xbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, have you tried to reinstall the game to make sure there are no bad data in the game files.</p>

<p>Thanks for your answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also first thought to a software problem but it is very strange.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is always happening. For instance in Forza, the artifact issue appears even when I just started the console and the game, even before playing any race (in the garage). The console is in a well ventilated area and isn't hot at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I already checked the games dedicated forums but couldn't find any help. It seems like I am the only one to face this problem...</p>
<p>
</p><p>And yes I tried de reset the console and reinstall all the games twice but it won't solve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any other idea?&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>Yes, it's legal. But be aware of the following disadvantages:</p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><div><br />
<div><span>1. The biggest disadvantage of an OEM version is that its license ties it permanently to the first computer it's installed on. It can never legally be moved to another computer, sold, or given away (except with the original computer). If
 the computer dies or is stolen, your license dies with it.</span></div>
<div><br />
<div><span>2. It can only do a clean installation, not an upgrade.</span></div>
<div><br />
<div><span>3. Microsoft provides no support for OEM versions. You can't call them with a problem, but instead have to get any needed support from your OEM; that support may range anywhere between good and non-existent. Or you can get support elsewhere,
 such as in these forums.</span></div>

<h3> ryansfw  say:</h3>
<h2>            My DVR game clips cannot be seen by my friends, but I can see theres</h2>
                    
<p>I do not have any privacy setting turned on or anything, anyone should be able to view my clips but they cannot. For instance, when you choose a friend on your friends list and view their profile, you can scroll to the right to view recent activity and if
 you scroll to the right once more it shows their game clips. However when I have my friends go to my profile and scroll to the right of my recent activites there is nothing, they dont see my game clips. I can watch my own but noone else can? Whats the point?
 Im just curious to know if this is happening to anyone else and why my clips are not able to be found by my friends. Is this an account issue or something else?</p>

            Let's see here...<br />
<br />
The Microsoft engaged Support Engineer "expert" <b>Method 1</b> <i>might </i>work if you happen to have a genuine bootable XP installation CD that is the same version and Service Pack as your unspecified version and Service Pack (most people don't) and if it
 does work, you will not know what the problem was.<br />
<br />
Here is some good reading about a "Repair Install" that the "expert" forgot to tell you:<br />
<i><br />
It is extremely important that you backup important data that is not available from other media sources. This backup should be located on a separate hard drive, CD, DVD, network storage, etc. that will not be affected by the repair install.</i><br />
<br />
<i>A Repair Install will replace the system files with the files on the XP CD used for the Repair Install. It will leave your applications and settings intact,
<b>but all Windows updates will need to be reapplied</b>.<br />
<br />
</i>
<p><i>A Repair Install will replace files altered by adware and malware, but will not fix an adware, malware problem.</i></p>
<br />
The Microsoft engaged Support Engineer "expert" <b>Method 2 </b>also <i>might </i>
work but I doubt your manufacturer is going to help you and there are sure alot of things to try in that link that might work and they might not work (probably not) and you still won't know what the problem is when you are done.<br />
<br />
One problem here in the MS Answers forums is these Microsoft engaged Support Engineer "experts" don't seem to know what to do to troubleshoot a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) and somebody else always has to do it for them.<br />
<br />
Do give those things a try if you are compelled to do so and let us know how it works out, or you might do this and somebody that knows how to troubleshoot a BSOD can probably help you out:<br />
<br />
Since even the latest Microsoft Answers forum implementation STILL does not prompt for any kind of system information when a new question is asked, we know absolutely nothing about your system.&nbsp; Not knowing fundamental information about a problem prolongs the
 frustration and agony of resolving these issues.<br />
<br />
Thank you MS Answers, for continuing to make the resolution of simple problems as frustrating and time consuming as possible.<br />
<br />
Please provide additional information about your system as best you can:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
What is your Internet browser and version?<br />
<br />
Does your system have IDE drives or SATA drives?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?&nbsp; (this includes plug pulling, power buttons, removing the battery, etc.)<br />
<br />
Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive (internal or external)?<br />
<br />
Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD that is the same Service Pack as your installed Service Pack (this is not the same as any Recovery CDs that came with your system)?<br />
<br />
What do you see (exactly) that you don't think you should be seeing and when do you see it?<br />
<br />
If the system used to work properly, what do you think might have changed since the last time it did work properly?<br />
<br />
If there is a problem booting, XP is configured to automatically try to boot again and you can get stuck in a loop of just being unable to get past the boot options screen or none of the boot options you choose will work.<br />
<br />
Sometimes when XP has a problem starting or crashes and tries to start again, it will give you a "short" menu of boot options and none of them will seem to be the right ones to get your system going again.&nbsp; Something like this:<br />
<br />
Safe Mode<br />
Safe Mode with Networking<br />
Safe Mode with Command Prompt<br />
Last Known Good Configuration (your most recent settings that worked)<br />
Start Windows Normally<br />
<br />
You've tried them all!<br />
<br />
The options resemble the XP Advanced Boot Options menu, but the one option you need (Disable automatic restart on system failure) is not offered because XP has gone too far along in the boot process and offers you a limited number of boot options.<br />
<br />
If that is the case, you must manually invoke the Advanced Boot Options menu yourself until you do see the option:<br />
<br />
<strong>Disable automatic restart on system failure</strong><br />
<br />
When you do get to the correct XP Advanced Options Boot menu you want to see, it has options on it like these:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Safe Mode<br />
Safe Mode with Networking<br />
Safe Mode with Command Prompt<br />
<br />
Enable Boot Logging<br />
Enable VGA mode<br />
Last Known Good Configuration (your most recent settings that worked)<br />
Directory Services Restore Mode (Windows domain controllers only)<br />
Debugging Mode<br />
<strong>Disable automatic restart on system failure</strong> <br />
<br />
Start Windows Normally<br />
Reboot<br />
Return to OS Choices Menu<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What you need to choose from that menu is the option:<br />
<br />
<strong>Disable automatic restart on system failure<br />
</strong><br />
Then if XP fails to boot normally, you will see an error screen with information and clues regarding the problem and then you can decide what to do next.<br />
<br />
If you do not see the Disable automatic restart on system failure option, you need to reset your system and start tapping the F8 key on the keyboard until you do see the Disable automatic restart on system failure option.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you miss the F8 window of opportunity, you need to try again and start tapping the F8 key with more urgency (sooner and more frequently) until you do see Disable automatic restart on system failure, then select it.<br />
<br />
You need to keep trying the F8 menu until you do see Disable automatic restart on system failure option, and select it.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your system is experiencing a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD), we need to know what the screen says:</p>
<p>Here is a BSOD example showing information you need to provide:</p>
<p><a href="http://techrepublic.com.com/i/tr/downloads/images/bsod_a.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://techrepublic.com.com/i/tr/downloads/images/bsod_a.jpg</a></p>
<p>Send the information pointed to with the red arrows (3-4 lines total). &nbsp;</p>
<p>Send the entire *** STOP message line since there are clues in the 4 parameters.</p>
<p>If it looks like there is some kind of file name listed under the STOP message, send that line too.</p>
<p>Skip the boring text unless it looks important to you. &nbsp;We know what a BSOD looks like, we need to know what your BSOD looks like.</p>
<p>Respond to the queries and report back the results from the Disable automatic restart on system failure screen and you can decide what to do next.</p>

<h2>            Initialize a wireless connection automatically before windows logon&#63;</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>I'm trying to deploy software updates across a network using active directory. &nbsp;The update is supposed to install before windows logon. &nbsp;This works correctly on a machine that is connected via the LAN, but the update doesn't install when the ethernet
 cable is unplugged. &nbsp;I'm assuming this is because it can't access the network share, and that if it connected to the network wirelessly before logon it would install.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Question:</p>
<p>Is there a way to automatically initialize a wireless connection before logon?</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated :)</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Unlike wire connection current Wireless hardware depends much more on the part of the OS already running.</p>
<p>AFAIK, there are enteties working on this issue as we speak and hopefuly it will be better in the future with New Chipsets andRradios.</p>
<p>In any case try to post here too.</p>

<p>update. it came up with the same error. I visited the first link you sent and it told me to try to do a "repair" on the iTunes programs which I did and rebooted again, checked for widows updates again. Re tried the install and it worked fine.&nbsp;</p>

            I don't know why the Microsoft engaged Support Engineer "expert" is asking you to upload things to your SkyDrive since I have never in my life seen a Microsoft Engaged Support Engineer "expert" diagnose a BSOD from a crash dump file.&nbsp; But maybe today is
 the day.<br />
<br />
If you upload your crash dump files,&nbsp; somebody else that is not engaged by Microsoft will end up helping you figure out what is going on.&nbsp; Go ahead and upload the crash dump files and then we will see what the "expert" does with them.<br />
<br />
Installing KB916595 will also not help you unless you are seeing a message like this:<br />
<br />
STOP 0x000000D1(, , , )<br />
DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL<br />
<br />
<b>HTTP.SYS </b><br />
<br />
But at least it is a link to a KB article that has something remotely resembling your STOP error.<br />
<br />
Besides, If you are running Service Pack 3, you already have that fix.<br />
<br />
Unless you plan on debugging crash dump files in the future, I would not bother installing the debugging tools from KB315263 either - that is a lot of trouble and there are already people here that have those tools installed (probably not Microsoft engaged
 Support Engineer "experts" though).<br />
<br />
These are just more Microsoft engaged Support Engineer "expert" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild-goose_chase" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
wild goose chases</a> to waste your time and keep you busy.&nbsp; You don't need to be kept busy - you need to fix your XP problem.<br />
<br />
Here is what you should do instead:<br />
<br />
Since the Microsoft Answers forum implementation does not prompt for any kind of system information when a new question is asked, we know absolutely nothing about your system.&nbsp; Not knowing fundamental information about a problem prolongs the frustration and
 agony of resolving these issues.<br />
<br />
Thank you MS Answers, for making the resolution of simple problems as frustrating and time consuming as possible.<br />
<br />
Please provide additional information about your system as best you can:<br />
<br />
<div>What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
What is your Internet browser and version?<br />
<br />
Do you have the problematic Windows Desktop Search installed?<br />
<br />
Does your system have IDE drives or SATA drives?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?&nbsp; (this includes plug pulling, power buttons, removing the battery, etc.)?<br />
<br />
Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive (internal or external)?<br />
<br />
Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD that is the same Service Pack as your installed Service Pack (this is not the same as any Recovery CDs that came with your system)?<br />
<br />
What do you see that you don't think you should be seeing and when do you see it?<br />
<br />
What do you not see that you think you should be seeing?<br />
<br />
If the system used to work properly, what do you think might have changed since the last time it did work properly?
<div><br />
<div>Does your system seem to boot okay and then crash or does it not boot at all?</div>
<br />
<div>Can you make the system crash any time you want? &nbsp;For example, would you say that there is any particular system activity that coincides with the crashes (like watching videos, playing games, etc.).</div>
<div><br />
Now provide more information about your system and information from the most recent crashes.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Click Start, Run and in the box enter:</div>
<div><br />
<div>msinfo32</div>
<div><br />
<div>Click OK, and when the System Summary info appears, click Edit, Select All, Copy and then paste the information back here.</div>
<div><br />
<div>For video driver information, expand the Components, click Display, click Edit, Select All,&nbsp;Copy and then paste the information back here.</div>
<div><br />
<div>There will be some personal information (like System Name and User Name), and whatever appears to&nbsp;be private information to you, just delete it from the pasted information.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This will minimize back and forth Q&amp;A and eliminate guesswork.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>Download BlueScreenView from here:</div>
<div><br />
<div><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/blue_screen_view.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/blue_screen_view.html</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>Unzip and run it (BSV installs nothing) and let it finish scanning all your crash dump files. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you double click on of the dumps, you will get some information about it (including the&nbsp;Caused By Driver field) and you may be able to spot the problem right away - especially if&nbsp;you see a pattern in the dumps where the Caused by Driver field is the
 same (start with that&nbsp;driver).</div>
<div><br />
<div>BlueScreenView tries to locate the right driver or module that caused the blue screen by looking inside the crash stack. However, be aware that the driver detection mechanism is not 100% accurate, and you should also look in the lower pane, that display
 all drivers/modules found in the stack.<br />
<br />
Sometimes BlueScreenView will implicate XP files as the cause of the crash (ntoskrnl.exe, win32k.sys, hal.dll etc.) but they are probably not the real cause of the crash (BSV does the best it can) and you need to look at some other crash dumps or use the Windows
 debugging tools to dig a little deeper into the crash dump to find the real cause.<br />
<br />
You would have to either gather up some more example crashes and look through them, or find some where XP files are not the "cause" or you could upload your crash dump files to your
<a href="http://explore.live.com/skydrive-get-started" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SkyDrive</a> and somebody with the Windows debugging tools can help take a look at them in more detail.<br />
<div><br />
<div>Select (highlight) one or more of the most recent dump files by clicking them and holding&nbsp;down the Ctrl key to select multiples files. &nbsp;Try to select just the most recent ones that&nbsp;relate to your issue (maybe five or so dump files to get started).</div>
<div><br />
<div>Click File, Save Selected Items and save the information from the dumps to a text file on&nbsp;your desktop called BSOD.txt.
<br />
<br />
Open BSOD.txt with a text editor Notepad, WordPad, etc.), select all the text (Ctrl-A), copy all the text to the Windows clipboard (Ctrl-C) and paste the text from the clipboard (Ctrl-V) back here in your next reply.
<div><br />
<br />
<div>Here is an example of the BSV report from a single BSOD that I initiated on purpose that&nbsp;shows the cause of the crash as the i8042prt.sys driver belonging to Microsoft Corporation:</div>

<div><br />
<div>Send the BlueScreenView information from the last 5 memory dumps (if you don't have 5 memory dumps yet, send the most recent ones you have).</div>
<div><br />
<div>While you are waiting, please do this:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Perform some scans for malicious software, then fix any remaining issues:</div>
<div><br />
Download, install, update and do a quick scan with these free malware detection programs (not at the same time):<br />
<br />
Malwarebytes (MBAM):&nbsp; http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free<br />
SUPERAntiSpyware: (SAS):&nbsp; http://www.superantispyware.com/<br />
<br />
SAS will probably report a bunch of tracking cookies and you can just let it delete them.<br />
<br />
They can be uninstalled later if desired.<br />
<br />
Reboot your computer and troubleshoot remaining issues.<br />
<br />
Sometimes it is easiest to just upload the memory dump files from your most recent crashes to your SkyDrive (everybody has a SkyDrive for sharing file).&nbsp;&nbsp; Then somebody that already has the Windows debugging tools can take a closer look at things and figure
 out what is going on.<br />
<br />
The memory dump files from the recent crashes and BSODs are usually in this folder:<br />
<br />
<br />
The files will be named something like this:<br />
<br />
<br />
You need to upload the most recent ones...&nbsp; maybe 5-10 of the most recent crash dump files ought to be enough if you have that many.&nbsp; If you do not have that many, send what you do have.<br />
<br />
Getting started with SkyDrive:<br />
<a href="http://explore.live.com/skydrive-get-started" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://explore.live.com/skydrive-get-started</a><br />
<br />
After you get your files uploaded and are looking at them on your SkyDrive, you need to "share" your folders/files so others can see them.<br />
<br />
Here is a link that tells you how to do that:<br />
<a href="http://explore.live.com/windows-live-skydrive-change-access-permissions-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://explore.live.com/windows-live-skydrive-change-access-permissions-faq</a><br />
<br />
Then choose the "Get a link" button.&nbsp; When you click that, a window will open that contains the link to your SkyDrive files.<br />
<br />
Copy the contents of the box "Copy this link to share:" by selecting the link contents (it will all become highlighted), press Ctrl-C (copy) and then come back to the forum and in your next message press Ctrl-V to paste the contents of the link back here.<br />
<br />
What you paste back will look something like this link to my SkyDrive:<br />

    <title>Volume starts really loud and then quiets down a few seconds later - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Volume starts really loud and then quiets down a few seconds later</h2>
                    <p>Say i have my volume set to 20, my laptop speakers start off really loud, say when I play music or watch videos, and then it eventually quiets down to the correct volume level. When I stop playing music/videos for a few seconds, and then start playing it
 again, the volume starts off really loud and then quiets down to the correct volume level.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not completely sure if this started after a windows update, or a Dell update, but I have tried the audio troubleshooter, and it tells me to turn off enhancements. I go to my sound settings but I cannot find an "enhancement" button anywhere. I also can't
 roll back the driver since that option is greyed out. My laptop speakers were fine before an update, but after that it went downhill. There is no problem when using headphones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also when I Skype my friends without using a headset, they say my voice gets loud and then quiet, and then back to normal again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone could please help me with this issue, that would be awesome.</p>
<p>

            Hi Catey.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Tutorial for disabling audio enhancements here:  <a href="https://www.thewindowsclub.com/disable-audio-enhancements-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.thewindowsclub.com/disable-audio-en...</a>.  It's likely a driver problem which I'll cover thoroughly later but I'd go through the checklist in order:
<br />
<br />1) For sound problems first try this checklist:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4026994/windows-fix-sound-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/402699...</a>
<br />
<br />2) Restore the Windows Audio Service which may have become disabled: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/57567-restore-default-services-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/57567-resto...</a> 
<br />
<br />3) Update the sound driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model, if it is newer than the one presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  While there compare to make sure you also have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display, Network and all other drivers.  
<br />
<br />4) Right click Volume icon in System Tray, choose Sound Settings, from the Output and Input devices dropdown menus, choose then one(s) affected to see if that helps.  If not use the Troubleshoot button nearby. 
<br />
<br />5) Run the Playing Sound troubleshooter at Start button &gt; Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />6) Try rolling back the sound drivers in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  Choose Sound controller and other audio devices, then Driver tab, then Roll back if available.  
<br />  
<br />7) If no newer sound drivers then uninstall the one presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button.  Restart PC to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />8) Try other and older drivers for your model Sound controller, too.  For example, try the next oldest driver in the model's online Support Downloads list.  To try all previous drivers installed on your system, in Device Manager choose Sound controller's Driver tab, then Update Driver, then Browse, then Let Me Pick.  
<br /> 
<br />9) If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />10) If this was caused by Version 1809 update (which you can confirm at Settings &gt; System &gt; About) then you can roll back Version 1809 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />11) You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />12) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />13) If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a> 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>This may or may not apply to your situation:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do your speakers have a separate volume or volume/bass control attached with a wire? And are your speakers several years old?</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's what I have, and in my case there was really no solution. The volume controller had to be replaced - the inevitable result of tugging at the wires over a prolonged period. The controller itself is only available on eBay and at a price where it makes
 more sense to replace the speakers altogether. No more wired controllers for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully your situation can be rectified with software.</p>

<h2>            WiFi networks not discoverable</h2>
                    <p>Hi all</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot detect ANY WiFi networks from my computer when I am logged in, it is as if I am in the middle of the ocean.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT I am able to discover WiFi networks from my lock/login screen, but it only sometimes seems to be able to connect to them, after telling me that it is 'taking longer than usual to connect to this network' and then that is was unable to connect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I have logged in, my WiFi cannot discover ANY networks. At all.&nbsp; I also do not have a WiFi option in my settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have images I can upload to show what it looks like if needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done every single software fix I am certain is available to me:</p>
<p>I have double and triple-checked my settings that WiFi is discoverable and nothing else is changed/wrong.</p>
<p>I have reset network from my settings.</p>
<p>I have checked my drivers and adapter options, they all say my WiFi is there and it is working fine (which I know because I have connected to it from the lock screen)</p>
<p>I have entered command lines in powershell and command prompt to reset network and other commands that have been told to me by computer people I know.</p>
<p>Gone through every single option on this page: https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues</p>
<p>Followed the instructions on this page: http://www.thewindowsclub.com/windows-10-vpn-cannot-detect-wireless-network</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am at the end of my tether, I called Microsoft and all that happened is the lady tried to get me to pay $150 before she said she could help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>

<p>What service are you with i.e. comcast or other?&nbsp;Have&nbsp; you tried unplugging your router and&nbsp; restarting it to reset it? If you have other devices can they connect? Have you gone to your manufacturers website to see if they have updated network drivers for
 your computer ? There have been some networking issues lately with windows. </p>

<p>Here is a post on this community where someone talked with Microsoft tech and they are aware of the problem and are working on it.</p>

</p><p>Do you have an ethernet cable? You might want to plug in for the time being.</p>

<p>I'm not in the U.S. </p>
<p>
</p><p>All my other devices connect, as I said, my system can see networks in the lock/login screen and sometimes connect to them, but it does not exist in my desktop. I have run 'netsh wlan show networks' and all the networks are listed in command prompt.&nbsp; As
 I said in my post, I have verified that everything else is working, it must be a bone-deep glitch in windows 10, I'm going to try and revert to a non-creators update version of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using ethernet atm, but I am a Uni student. I need wifi when I am in class.</p>

            Many people are having network problems. Might be best if you roll back until Microsoft fixes this. To have a mobile device that cannot connect is a very big problem. I am on a wired connection and even wired my internet has dropped a few times since patching
 my system for the Meltdown and Spectre&nbsp; .It is not a problem with my router nor my connection service. It is a problem with all these quick patches I think. Good luck with the roll back.
