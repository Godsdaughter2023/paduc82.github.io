    <title>Can&#39;t Install IE8, now can&#39;t open or run any version of IE. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> billpiersall  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t Install IE8, now can&#39;t open or run any version of IE.</h2>
                    Running Windows XP as OS<br />
I was prompted by a website that my browser was out of date and decided to install new version of IE. When I followed link, it said I was running the latest version of IE, IE8,&nbsp; already. I thought maybe there were errors on install, or bug/upgrades to IE8,
 so decided to reinstall browser.<br />
<br />
I downloaded and ran install, app said it was uninstalling old version and installing new, but during Finalizing stage of install, said there was an error and IE8 could not be installed.
<br />
<br />
Prompted me to restart Windows so it could Undo any changes made, then to follow Troubleshoot link it put on desktop to fix issues. I restarted and had Troubleshoot link on desktop, but was unable to open it, got an error message that said recheck address?
 Checked properties of link to get address, said to go to go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=106440.
<br />
<br />
At this point, I found I couldn't open IE at all. In order to access the go.microsoft site, I had to use Mozilla as my browser. Followed all instructions on Troubleshoot page. Uninstalled Virus software, let the Fix Me app set security levels, Checked and was
 told that SP3 and security updates were current. Ran Microsoft Security Essentials full scan, took forever....but it did find and remove 3 adware files.
<br />
<br />
Tried last Fix Me app to check blocked files ? and that app would not run, got error messages. I downloaded and ran the IE8 install again, and had same error messages.
<br />
<br />
At this point I can't open IE at all, only Mozilla will run at this point. Would like to get IE8 or whatever the most current browser is, up and running. Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Any Ideas?&nbsp;
<br />

<p>One possibility is that you had IE8 installed correctly but just went to a site that doesn't like it.&nbsp; Now you probably still have it installed but perhaps not so correctly or at least you have some kind of connectivity issue with it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Fortunately, in your OS you have a tool which can help determine the state of IE and its modules.&nbsp; E.g. Run... (press Win-R and enter:)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>msinfo32.exe&nbsp; /category&nbsp; IESummary</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>etc.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Also, tell us what happens if you try to open an IE window this way:&nbsp;&nbsp; Run...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>iexplore.exe&nbsp; -nohome&nbsp; -extoff</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You may have to click Stop (or press Alt-V p)&nbsp; to get beyond having just an open window.&nbsp; If you get that far you would have to admit that you were past a point at which you "couldn't open IE at all".&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;eg&gt;</p>

<p>Not sure I understand what to do. I went to Start, then Run and entered msinfo.32exe/categoryIESummary with no spaces, then with spaces....msinfo.32exe/category IESummary.</p>
<p>Both of these failed. Just a window saying make sure I typed name correctly.</p>
<p>Also tried to enter iexplore.exe-nohome-extoff and got same message. I then entered it with the spaces, iexplore.exe -nohome -extoff. Didn't get error message, but nothing opened or happened.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>On a different note that may or may not help, when I look in the Control Panel at installed programs, IE is not listed. If I go to Program files on my C Drive, IE is there, and I can open and see the IE .exe application file. When I click on it there, same
 thing.....nothing happens.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Let me know for the Run menu, if I need spaces etc. Not very familiar with entering things there.....sorry.</p>
<p><br />

<p>Really appreciate your help, hopefully we can get it figured out.</p>

<p>Good.&nbsp; That's why I gave you <u>two</u> spaces where only one was required.&nbsp;&nbsp;So now when you fix your last

<p><br />
</p>
<p>Also, have you tried looking at any more of the diagnostics that the System Information tool shows you about your IE?&nbsp;&nbsp; So far, everything you are showing looks fine.</p>

<p>Hi Mark, </p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a possibility that the emails are gray-listed. Meaning, it's either your mail server configuration or your domain records contain errors which result in a temporary refusal of delivery. For us to isolate the main issue, we would like to know if
 you're using an Outlook web or Outlook app. If the latter, which Outlook version do you have? Have you also tried performing the steps provided on the link above?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, we suggest that you try to reset your Internet connection to make sure that this has nothing do to with your connection.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We will be waiting for your response. </p>

    <title>Trying to save a blob file in Outlook for macOS using javascript - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Trying to save a blob file in Outlook for macOS using javascript</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(12, 13, 14, 1)">
Ok so I have a&nbsp;<code>Blob</code>&nbsp;file
 that I'm trying to save on local disk (the&nbsp;<code>Blob</code>&nbsp;is
 created locally from an&nbsp;<code>ArrayBuffer</code>).
 The problem I'm facing is that Outlook for macOS does not want to open a&nbsp;<code>FileSaverDialog</code>&nbsp;or
 something similar to let the user save the file.</p>

My code is working perfectly in Outlook for Web (OWA) on all browsers (including Safari) and Outlook for Windows
<p>
</p><p>const blob = new Blob([body]); //body is an ArrayBuffer created locally</p>
<p>const link = document.createElement('a');</p>
<p>if (link.download !== undefined) {</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; const url = URL.createObjectURL(blob);</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; link.setAttribute('href', url);</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; link.setAttribute('download', fileName);</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; link.style.visibility = 'hidden';</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; document.body.appendChild(link);</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; link.click();</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; document.body.removeChild(link);</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: I have tried using window.open(blob);, but Outlook for macOS throws an error in that situation: "There is no application set to open URL blob:https://..."</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>PS 2: I have also tried using Office.context.ui.displayDialogAsync(url, { height: 100, width: 100, requireHTTPS: true });,but still getting the same error.</p>

<p>How am I supposed to prompt a SaveFileDialog for the user ? Thank you in advance</p>

<p>For Add-Ins specifically I don't know, but for AppleScript in general, you can always check the Outlook Apple Script dictionary in the Script Editor app.</p>
<p>(the easiest is to drag the Outlook icon on the Script Editor icon in the Dock).</p>

    <title>Pivot table, grouping by month&#47;year adds rows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> callbr549  say:</h3>
<h2>            Pivot table, grouping by month&#47;year adds rows</h2>
                    In a pivot table when I group a date field by year and month, it adds a blank line at each year, so&nbsp;the&nbsp;values field&nbsp;is not continuous, but has a gap at each year.. I would like to see year added as a new column, how do I do that? There would be a year
 column, then a month column, and then the values field is&nbsp;a continuous list by month with no blanks. &nbsp;I think its possible because Pivot Tables reference book I have shows an example of a finished table in that format, but does not give instructions how to
 do it. I need to do this fairly often because I need to transfer data from a pivot table into a statistical software package for further analysis, but the blank lines screw up the statistics.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I guess you want two different columns for years and months in the pivot table.&nbsp; Go to Pivot Table Tools &gt; Design &gt; Report Layout &gt; Show in Outline Form</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

    <title>Lumia 950 XL - B2X Support - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jaded sufferer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 950 XL - B2X Support</h2>
                    <p>How do I get support for 950XL? MSFT has outsourced support service from a third party called&nbsp;B2X, and since 18 October the phone has been dead. B2X ship the phone to a fourth party, and at that point all visibility or management of the process by B2X is
 lost.</p>
<p>My handset was returned within a week labelled 'no fault found', and it is as dead today as it was at the beginning.</p>
<p>The B2X website for booking warrant fix or replacement refuses to allow a warranty&nbsp;return to be initiated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>B2X agree the website is a problem and each week since October have asked me to wait and be patient! I have requested and been refused warranty replacement. I have suggested a new battery may solve the problem but I am ignored. I have spoken to supervisors,
 and their supervisors and the limp response is sorry, but we will send an email to the team who are working on your problem, after that we cant do anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought I should ask on the community forum how does microsoft plan to address this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I notice the topics section does not include phone does not work'!</p>

            <p>How Microsoft plans to address this? As a Windows Phone long timer, I'm starting to wonder if this move to B2X
<em>IS </em>the address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I sent my phone in because when I pressed the power button, it would not power on until 30 seconds later. It was happening often. Also, because the&nbsp;MS Band and the Phone teams are not in close enough collaboration, no one at MS could tell me why my Band
 2 and my phone where not talking to each other. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The support level of the B2X team is exceedingly low. I would post the lengthy chat session I just had with them (and it is not the first one that I've had with them), but to spare you the read, I'll sum it this way: pathetic. (If anyone wants to see it,
 let me know.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the highlights of my experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>The history of my month-old case, even after 3-5 contacts, is hollow. The last record is that I called a few days ago (for a status), and the one before that is from when I opened the case. I do not even think it contained the issues for which the phone
 was sent in.</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>I keep being asked if I've 'checked the status on the website?' I have. the status is CLOSED.&nbsp;FedEx tracking says my phone was delivered to B2X. No one at B2X is telling me anything about what my phone is going through. They have not sent me any notification
 EVER in any regard. And on my calls/chat to them, they provide NO information. I am not in possession of my phone, so the meaning of CLOSED is lost on me.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>They smother me with <em>pleases </em>and <em>thank yous, </em><em>sorries for you inconveniences,
</em>and <em>i'll try to help yous, </em>and <em>I understands,&nbsp;</em>but really the four or five&nbsp;agents I've spoken to have proven to be impotent vessels full of lip service an not much else (I don't think the blame is fully theirs.) In my last chat, the agent,
 Puneet S, asked me where I sent the phone,&nbsp;I replied with the FedEx tracking number and a link to the FedEx website. It was apparent that he was not making use of the resources, and I came learn that agents at B2X "have very restricted rights on internet"
 (Puneet S). So no FedEx.com for them.</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>I often heard, "Wait &lt;x&gt; days&nbsp;and &lt;something&gt; will happen."&nbsp;Where &lt;x&gt; was a number from 3 to 5, and &lt;something&gt; was some satisfactory conclusion. In reality this phrasing is smoke and mirrors, a pacifier, and a lie (as far as I'm concerned.) Today's &lt;something&gt;
 was: "I am putting this case on higher priority so please be assured that we will contact you." Uh-huh. Be assured, you say.</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>There is apparently a Tier 2 level of support... but no one has two-way access to them. I cannot speak to them. The agent can't either. Maybe a manager can, though I'm doubtful.&nbsp;I've been told that someone from that level would touch base with me. My base
 goes untouched. </li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Sigh. Today was the first time that I had a physical sickening&nbsp;reaction to the BS and lies, and was almost relieved when the "session disconnect" error popped up on the chat thread.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope mine is an extraordinary and rare case, and if it is not, I hope that the lives and livelihood of those who work at that company recover well when B2X goes under.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To MS: ... ... just... hhhhhhh</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>
</p><p>You MUST call them and try to get the number of the repair facility in... I forget what state the repair facility is in. Alabama... Texas... They know. Get the number and call there for a status.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked for the number and my available phone records won't go back that far.

            <p>B2X solved their website problem where previously&nbsp;it refused to close existing support tickets, and meaning a new one could not be created.</p>
<p>I was able to return the phone to the lab. When it left it was completely inoperative.</p>
<p>When it returned the documentation stated 'no fault found'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am amazed that simply shipping it to Hungary is all that was needed to make it work again!.

            <p>MSFT is somehow pleased it sold so few handsets that this tide of unrest is so small. Its difficult to imagine they will bounce back as a hardware vendor.</p>
<p>Looking at their strategy I would say they want their software to become ubiquitous and therefore hardware becomes a nuisance to them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interesting to hear Nokia is starting to make handsets again. Lets see how they innovate this market.</p>

<h2>            Error Message&#58;  Microsoft Outlook has stopped working</h2>
                    
<p>HELP!!!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I installed MS-Office Pro Plus 2010 several days ago.&nbsp; I've been running Outlook 2010 for several days, and finally got it setup the way I want it, last night, after importing Contacts and Calendar items from Outlook 2003 on a different computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>HOWEVER, when I tried to run Outlook 2010, this morning, I received the following error message:&nbsp; "<strong><em>Microsoft Outlook has stopped working</em></strong>".&nbsp; That's all it says, and Windows 7 gives up on trying to find a solution!!</p>
<p>HELP!!!!</p>

            <p>That didn't help my Outlook at all, but it did force me to look at my firewall more closely. There was a button to restore it to its default settings. At one time, Outlook worked so I took a shot that it might work with the default settings. And it did!
 Now, maybe someone will be successful with your method, and if not, they can try this one. Thanks for advising to work with the firewall.</p>

            FYI:&nbsp; I got mine to work again.&nbsp; Out of frustration at trying everything and getting no where, I tried shutting down my firewall and then rebooting outlook.....it worked immediately.&nbsp; Hope it works for you!<br />

    <title>Build 9879&#58; Windows Defender Turns Off After Definition Updates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> oreveredrist  say:</h3>
<h2>            Build 9879&#58;  Windows Defender Turns Off After Definition Updates &#40;new title&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Old Title: &nbsp;Build 9879: &nbsp;Two False Notifications that Windows Defender is Off</p>
<p>
</p><p>Build 9879: &nbsp;I just got two false notifications that Windows Defender is not on: &nbsp;"Turn on spyware protection" and "Turn on virus protection." &nbsp;According to the Security and Maintenance control panel, everything is on and OK. &nbsp;According to Windows Defender,
 itself, everything is on and up-to-date. &nbsp;Clicking on those notifications gives me a "Missing Shortcut" dialog and it looks for explorer.exe. &nbsp;It then pops up another dialog that: &nbsp;"The item 'explorer.exe' that this shortcut refers to has been changed or moved..."
 and asks if I want to replace it with what it found. &nbsp;I've been running Windows 10 Technical Preview since the very beginning without this coming up. &nbsp;Ditto for having been on build 9879 since the day it was released without this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no other antivirus or antimalware programs installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: &nbsp;I've changed the title of this thread to better reflect some of the findings in it. &nbsp;The above is still true, but my false notifications turns out to have been a timing issue. &nbsp;Shortly after installing new definition updates, Windows Defender throws
 an event 7031, shuts down, and then turns itself back on 60000 milliseconds (60 seconds) later. &nbsp;That event started with a failed attempt for Windows Update to install "Windows Technical Preview December Update for x64-based systems (KB3025096)." &nbsp;Windows
 Update does not re-prompt me to install that update, though. &nbsp;So, I'm stuck.</p>

            Happened again just now (8:24 AM and 8:25 AM). &nbsp;Like the last time, I was online with the Chrome browser at the time. &nbsp;This time, though, I was logged onto on a secure site. &nbsp;So, I don't think it's web/browser related. &nbsp;Might be time related, though. &nbsp;I
 think this happened about the same time before.

<p>
</p><p>I just got yet another notification about this, went to Windows Defender, and this time it actually WAS off. &nbsp;I checked the Updates tab for when the last definition update was applied and it was just before I got those notifications. &nbsp;I'll keep an eye on
 this, but now it's looking like when Defender gets its definitions updated, it turns itself off and doesn't turn itself back on. &nbsp;This is different from what I first reported (false reports of being off), but might be related.</p>

            <p>Mine turned off two or three times lately with manual installation of def files after manually doing&nbsp;windows check for updates.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I looked in event viewer and it says something like;</p>
<p>

<p>The Windows Defender Service service terminated unexpectedly. It has done this 1 time(s). The following corrective action will be taken in 60000 milliseconds: Restart the service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if ignored, it restarts in about&nbsp; sixty thousands milliseconds,&nbsp;&nbsp; which is pretty quick :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I look in Reliability Monitor and the exact same time defender downloaded the def&nbsp;update, there also were additional&nbsp;downloads for the new modern apps that were&nbsp;installed too.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            I created a custom view in my Event Log for event 7031. &nbsp;I've got 4 occurrences of it regarding Windows Defender. &nbsp;I compared the times of those to the Update History for Windows Updates. &nbsp;The first one happened at the exact time that it tried to install
 the "Windows Technical Preview December Update for x64-based systems (KB3025096)." &nbsp;I hadn't noticed it until now, but that update failed with Error Code 800F0923. &nbsp;Of course, now that I see that, I haven't the slightest idea how to proceed.

<h3> tom_g35  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot set up up an O365 email account in outlook</h2>
                    <p>I volunteer for a couple of organisations who use O365.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried to set up the accounts in Outlook on the desktop and in the mobile apps on both ios and android and each time a message appears that the credentials are incorrect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However if I use the same credentials via webmail I get in no problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both organisations allow users to users to setup mail in email clients and produce guides to support this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I initially thought that mobile devices might be blocked but as both organisations produce guides for their volunteers it cannot be this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone encountered this issue and if so how was it overcome?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks&nbsp;</p>

            Hi, i hope you're doing good today.
<br />
<br />If you already checked your DNS records and everything works just fine in the cloud maybe you're having issue with the autodiscover.
<br />
<br />The first thing you need to do is create another Outlook profile from control panel&gt;mail&gt;show profiles&gt;add.
<br />
<br />If you still have the issue type regedit on the Windows search bar and type regedit&gt;right click&gt;run as an administrator.
<br />
<br />Go to this route:
<br />
<br />HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Outlook\AutoDiscover
<br />
<br />Add a DWORD(32 bits) registry, the name would be ExcludeHttpsRootDomain and edit the decimal value to 1.
<br />
<br />Try to setup the account again.
<br />
<br />If it doesn't work add the other registries on this article.
<br />

<p>I appreciate the effort and response, but I'm very leery about messing wit the registry. I'm not that experienced.</p>
<p>The below is what I don' t have. I was hoping it was a simple process to enable/show the file block settings.</p>

<p>Those settings are optional (that is why they are in options). The idea is to either totally block, or add an extra step when opening older / "risky" file types so that the user does not accidentally open infected files.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, since the DOC file type allows macros, it is a favorite "macro virus carrier" for hackers. So, if you know you do not use DOC files and do not normally share DOC files with customers, you can block them. That way if you are sent an infected
 file you do not accidentally "automatically" open it, infecting your machine. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Over the years, MS has blocked more file types by default. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You can turn them on simply by clicking in the check boxes. First you have to decide what the check marks will do. That is set by the 3 radio buttons at the bottom of the dialog:</p>
<ul>
<li>do not allow the checked file types to open at all</li><li>Open in "protected view", do not execute macros, do not edit </li><li>Open in "Protected view" allow editing</li></ul>

<p>So the screen shot that you showed is from a later version of Office?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said, I now do not have Office 2007 installed so I cannot verify whether there was a File Block Settings item under Word Options&gt;Trust Center&gt;Trust Center Settings, but as you indicated that there isn't such an option, it may not have been available
 in Word 2007.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it ALL *.doc files that you are unable to open, or just some particular ones.&nbsp; If it is all of them, it is probable that the option was turned off in the Registry.&nbsp; You might try repairing the Office installation as it is quite possible that it would
 "reset" the File Block Settings in the Registry (which uninstalling and re-installing would NOT do). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Instructions for repairing the Office installation are detailed in the Knowledge Base article at:</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>However, if repairing the Office installation does not overcome the issue with opening *.doc files, then you will have no option but to:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Modify the Registry</li><li>Open the files on a computer on which you are able to modify the File Block Settings under the Trust Center Settings and then save the files in *.docx format.</li></ol>

<p>He Steve DOES have a Trust Center option.&nbsp; What he does NOT have is a File Block Settings item in the Trust Center Settings dialog.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is normal for Word 2007 as the File Block Settings facility was only added to the Trust Center Settings dialog beginning with Office 2010, and it is for that reason that the instructions for modifying File Block Settings in Word 2007 that are give in

<h2>            Dell Venue Pro 10 with Windows 10 crashes in multiple scenarios</h2>
                    <p>I have a Dell Venue Pro 10 (10" device) that fails in multiple scenarios after installing the Windows 10 January TP:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Device crashes when removed from power</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can actually run this device perfectly fine when it's plugged directly into power, but the second I remove the power source from the device, allowing it to run on battery, it crashes, complete with a blue screen.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>If device is started without being plugged in to power, touch screen is unresponsive</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I cold boot the device, I can get to the Windows login screen. However, I cannot unlock the screen. It does not accept any swipes or any press of the Windows hardware button to unlock the device. If I plug the device into power, the touch screen
 responds and I can unlock the device and continue using it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: I have installed all available WU provided updates on this device after installing the OS.</p>

<br />
I would require additional information for further assistance:<br />
<br />
1) Do you have multiple versions of Office/Excel installed on your computer?<br />
2) If yes, are you using both Office 2007 and Office 2010 applications?<br />
3) Does Excel files try opening in Excel 2007 or Excel 2010?<br />
<br />
Try the following and verify the result:<br />
<br />
1) Ensure that Excel is not running under compatibility mode.<br />
Go to the following location &gt; right click on <b>EXCEL</b>/<b>EXCEL.EXE</b> &gt; <b>
Properties</b> &gt; <b>Compatibility</b> &gt; uncheck all the options &gt; <b>Apply</b> &gt; <b>
OK </b>and verify the result <br />
<br />
Excel 2007: <b>C:\Program Files or Programs Files x86 \Microsoft Office\Office12</b><br />
Excel 2010: <b>C:\Program Files or Program Files or Program Files x86\Microsoft Office\Office14</b><br />
<br />
2) If you're not using Office 2007 application, if it is advisable to uninstall it as it might conflict with Office 2010. If you're using any of Office 2007 application, disable Excel from Office 2007 following instructions mentioned in the below article:<br />
<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-001/help/install-or-remove-individual-office-programs-and-components-HA001234067.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-001/help/install-or-remove-individual-office-programs-and-components-HA001234067.aspx</a><br />
<br />
3) Repair Office 2010 installation following instructions mentioned in the below article and then try opening *.xls files and verify the result:<br />
<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/project-help/repair-office-programs-HA010357402.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/project-help/repair-office-programs-HA010357402.aspx</a><br />
<br />
Hope the above information helps. Take your time to try the suggestion and let me know the results at your earliest convenience.<br />
<br />
Thank you.</span>

<h3> jon80  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why doesn&#39;t Windows Mobile 2003 connect to WiFi&#63;</h2>
                    I have an HP iPAQ RX3715 (runs Windows Mobile 2003 4.21.1088), which used to connect to WiFi, however, since I changed internet service provider, this device does not connect to my WiFi router. &nbsp;The wizard searches the SSID, and, prompts me &nbsp;for a password
 which is incorrectly rejected. &nbsp;I am sure because the same password worked smoothly with my sister's smartphone which runs on Android. &nbsp;Other laptops running Windows XP SP3, Windows 7 and Windows Vista have no issues automatically connecting to this WiFi connection.
<div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Within the Wireless Network Properties of one laptop, Windows 7 connects with the following settings:</div>
<div>Security type: WPA2-Personal</div>
<div>Encryption type: AES (this is controlled by the Internet Service Provider, Melita see www.melita.com.</div>
<div>These are automatically detected by the operating system.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have no way of updating the operating system on the HP iPAQ RX3715, if updates are available, except by temporarily downloading the files on another computer, and, trying to find a way to push the updates on the device, if updates are available. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When checking within the options available for wireless within the device the following (incompatible) options are available:</div>
<div>Authentication: Open, Shared, WPA, WPA-PSK</div>
<div>Data encryption: WEP, TKIP i.e. AES not yet available as yet.</div>
<div><br />

            <p>Hello. If you lower the security to&nbsp;WEP on the router and use a WEP key, I bet it would work. Your iPAQ&nbsp;hardware (2003 vintage) didn't even know that WPA or WPA2-AES would exist so it can't connect to that. WEP is fine and nobody will hack you. I run it
 for legacy equipment. Also, make sure the router is set for mixed b/g/n. If it is set to n only, your b device won't connect. But since you can connect it, that is probably OK. It is the encryption that it can't understand.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think you mean the router was pre-configured by your ISP. Call them and see how to change it.</p>

            <p>I might just add that sometimes connecting an old "B"&nbsp;device to a network can drag the network speed down a little.&nbsp; Not a big deal usually, unless you're into serious multi-player gaming.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In&nbsp;those cases, an alternative is to plug&nbsp;an old&nbsp;"B" router you might still have laying around from before into one of the Ethernet ports on your current router and set up a second WiFi network in the house just for your legacy devices.</p>

            The ISP supports WPA-PSK/WEP, however, the device remains showing 'connecting' ad infinitum, and, a hard reset does not seem to trick the device either. &nbsp;The ISP support cannot provide logs of connection attempts, either.

            Hello. Have you power cycled the router since you made any changes? Also, you can try to troubleshoot using no security and also going to a free hotspot to see if you can connect to any Wifi to rule out a hardware problem.

    <title>Query selection criteria syntax - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> max stewart  say:</h3>
<h2>            Query selection criteria syntax</h2>
                    <p>Is there a document listing the functions and syntax to be used for selection criteria in a query ‘form’ (i.e. not VBA and not SQL)? Access Help and Query Builder appear to assume everyone is writing VBA.</p>
<p>Some of the differences are bizarre, e.g. IsNull() is fine in VBA but apparently has to be IsNull()=TRUE in ‘query’.

            <p>OK</p>
<p>Two trivial and simplistic examples:</p>
<p>Of the four types of Access objects (tables, queries, forms and reports) I decide to set up a query.</p>
<p>My query includes a table column ‘Size’. ‘Size’ can be L or S.</p>
<p>I wish to select all those of Size L</p>
<p>I select Design view for that query, and in the criteria row of the Size column I type “L”</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, I decide to set up a validation rule on field ‘Age’ in a form. I decide to test that Age is numeric.</p>
<p>In the property sheet Validation Rule I type IsNumeric([Age])=True</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the above, the query selection criterion and the form validation rule are neither VBA or SQL.</p>
<p>In the validation rule for example, I would have expected (based on VBA-style syntax) that IsNumeric([Age]) would suffice, but no: it has to be IsNumeric([Age])=True<br />
</p>
<p>But where please are the relevant functions and syntax documented? &nbsp;<br />

            <p>All queries, without exception, are in SQL. SQL is the language of Queries. You can use VBA to construct the SQL of a query; the Query Grid is a tool to build SQL (which you can see if you want to, though that's not essential); you can use a Form to provide
 parameters for a query in SQL. But there is no such thing as a "query 'form'" per se -just a Form which can be used by a Query.</p>

            <p>Thank you both. </p>
<p>I was asked for an example. I tried to provide a deliberately simplistic one and I have obviously failed.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can only reiterate the questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- when setting up a query using Create / Query Design, I am presented with a split screen, the lower grid of which has rows “Field, Table, Sort, show, Criteria, or:”</p>
<p>If (pace my previous post) I put L in the Criteria row / ‘Size’ column, where is it documented that I can simply put a text string (‘L’) rather than e.g. [Size] = “L” or something more elaborate</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- when (again pace my previous post) &nbsp;in a Form I set up Validation, where is it documented that I must use IsNumeric ([&lt;fieldname&gt;]) = TRUE rather than VBA-style IsNumeric([&lt;fieldname&gt;]). The syntax is different but where do I find this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In passing, I am well aware that using Create Query generates an SQL string, and I have often used Create Query as a quick way to create a first draft select/sort that can then be modified.
</p>
<p>If I want to write neat SQL I can refer if necessary to one of the standard SQL reference books and MSFT’s “Comparison of Microsoft Access SQL and ANSI SQL”</p>
<p>But if I want to fill in the Criteria row / Size column of a Create Query query, where do I look for reference?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I apologise for either being obtuse or posing a too-trivial question (or both).</p>
<p>And no, it isn’t homework!</p>

<p>1- The 'Size' field could be numerical signifying size or letter to designate so you must know what the datatype if the fields are to be able to put the appropriate criteria.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2- If the field for 'Age' is datatype number then it would automatically reject any input that was not a number.&nbsp;

            If you'll excuse me briefly breaching your closure edict, not everything is documented, and it would be unduly optimistic to expect it to be so.&nbsp; There will always be syntactical eccentricities which fall through the holes in the bucket.&nbsp; There are other
 more important ones of which you won't find any mention.&nbsp; The Help topic for the ValidationRule property specifies that it must be an expression which returns a Boolean value.&nbsp; I would regard a function call which does this as an expression, though all the
 examples given in Help do involve two operands.&nbsp; These things usually come out in the wash in one way or another, and in most cases a reasonably intelligent developer will spot what needs doing, as you have done in this case, and by doing so have alerted others
 who might come across the same issue.<br />
<br />
What it does reinforce of course is the need to thoroughly test every small detail of the design.<br />
<br />
One should not compartmentalise the various technologies too much.&nbsp; When you call a VBA function in a context like this you are of course using VBA, merely not in the context of a procedure or function.&nbsp; The same is true if you call a VBA function in a query.&nbsp;
 Conversely if you build an SQL statement in VBA and establish a recordset, you are using SQL.&nbsp; You are also using DAO or ADO of course.&nbsp; There is a great deal of interconnection between the technologies, but you won't find every last detail documented.<br />

<p>
</p><p>However after tearing my hair out, I found 3 "<strong>Generic Utilities</strong>" in my Processes&nbsp;under Task Manager. When you disabled one, the RMS icon in the taskbar vanished. But, on restart it would be back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can disable the RMS here but cannot delete those <strong>"Generic Utilities"..</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Someone mentioned,&nbsp;<strong>SpyBot Search and Destroy</strong>... ran a scan and it picked it up right away and deleted them. On restart there is no further RMS..</p>
