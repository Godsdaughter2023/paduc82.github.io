<h2>            No VSTS in Microsoft Teams Connectors</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know why Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) Connector is not visible on our Microsoft Teams Connectors. I'm using the free version of Microsoft teams. The email address i've used in creating Microsoft teams is also the same email address
 i'm using in VSTS. I would like to know also the steps needed to activate it if there are conditions for it to appear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi Mark Edison Khu,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From your description, I understand that you want VSTS to be available in Teams Free version, however, as far as I know, This integration isn’t yet available for free version of Teams. It is recommend that
 use Teams from your organization. &nbsp;And to see activity about VSTS or Team Foundation Server (2017.2 and later) projects directly in your Microsoft Teams channel, here’s the article for your reference:
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/service-hooks/services/teams?view=vsts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Teams with Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) and Team Foundation Server (TFS)</a>. Your understanding are highly appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Anna</p>

<h2>            Cant access my contacts anymore while using skype top dial</h2>
                    <p>I am a paying customer using Skype to call my clients many times abroad.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype took away the ability to use my iPhone contacts to dial. Now I have to dial manually checking the number several times while dialing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is an outrages&nbsp;behavior to make software less user-friendly just to force us to load up contacts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think we paying customers should widely&nbsp;protest at strategies like this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the strong feeling since skype is with MS it constantly gets worse with every update.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>You need to insert a quickpart &gt; document property, and then change the Properties of the control through the developer tab.</p>

            <p>Tasks, mail, contafcts, calendar, and notes are all kept in the same place.&nbsp; If you're using an Exchange account for your mail, that's the Exchange mailbox.&nbsp; If you're using POP or IMAP, that will be the default data file, or PST).&nbsp; If you're using Hotmail/Live
 and the Outlook Hotmail Connector, it will also be in a PST.&nbsp; WIth Outlook closed, if you copy the PST, you'll be making a backup of your data.&nbsp; See
<a href="http://www.howto-outlook.com/howto/backupandrestore.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howto-outlook.com/howto/backupandrestore.htm</a></p>
<p>If you want to make a copy of only the tasks, create a new data file (File&gt;New&gt;Outlook Data File) and copy the Tasks folder to that PST.&nbsp; Close the PST (right-click its root in the Navigation Pane and choose Close), then close Outlook.&nbsp; You can then copy
 that PST anywhere you like and open it in the other instance of Outlook.</p>

    <title>Access 2016 in runtime opens forms off center - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sandras_1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Access 2016 in runtime opens forms off center</h2>
                    <p>I'm converting Access applications from Access 2010 to 2016.&nbsp; These apps/files are distributed as runtime applications to my users.&nbsp; (Ie, the file extension is .accdr)&nbsp; When the application is first opened, it automatically opens a Form which fills the screen.&nbsp;
 The file is set for "Document Window Options - Overlapping Windows"&nbsp; (not tabbed documents).&nbsp; So, the form opens and fits just inside the available space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the app is opened in 2010, the form opens just fine.&nbsp; When the app is opened in 2016, the form is opened off center so that the bottom part of the form is off the screen and there is blank/gray space above the form.&nbsp; I can open the same app as a .accdb
 file in full Access 2016 and the form is opened perfectly centered again.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Any ideas on what might be going on and how I could fix it?</strong>&nbsp; I have many forms which JUST fill the screen.&nbsp; Having the vertical scroll bar on the right side of the screen and that first form be off center is a big problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<p>It occurred to me, looking back to my DOS (pre-Windows) days that there had to be a way to place a form on an exact point on the screen, just as it's so obvious for the various elements that are placed within a form (ie the Top/Left properties).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found it for MS Access forms- try this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Set the form's AutoCenter property to "No."<br />
2) Look up the <strong>MoveSize method</strong> in VBA help.<br />
3) The uppermost, left corner of your screen would be 0,0. In the form's <strong>
On Open event</strong>, place this function:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>DoCmd.MoveSize 0,0</strong></p>
<p>-------------------------------------------</p>
<p>To take it a bit further, note that all measurements are in Twips (1440 per inch). You'll have to do the math to convert inches to cm. To set your form to a specific position in the window (I'm using inches measurements). For example, code the Form's On
 Open Event:<br />
<br />
DoCmd.MoveSize 3 *1440, 4 *1440<br />
<br />
3 inches from the left edge of the screen, 4 inches down from the top<br />
of the screen.<br />
<br />
To set another form's position similarly to position it .6 inch below the<br />
Form1. Code the Form2 Open Event:<br />
<br />
DoCmd.MoveSize 3*1440, 4.6* 1440<br />
<br />
Also 3 inches from the left edge of the screen, but 4.6 inches down<br />
from the top of the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Adjust the actual placement as required. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Does this solve your position problem?</p>

<p>Nice suggestion Al. So cool what the community will come up with.</p>
<p>@SandraS: knowing you are more than a basic user, it may make sense to read up on how to watch Form events and write code once for all forms. Search the web for "access form class withevents". This technique gives you a lot of power for example doing a MoveSize
 in all Form_Open events without ever writing that code there.</p>
<p>Personally I use such code to invoke code to color required fields with a different background color, and also to populate the ubiquitous DateCreated/DateCreatedBy/DateUpdated/DateUpdatedBy fields, among other usages.</p>
<p>Tools such as the excellent "MZ-Tools" can help write the tiny bit of "bootstrap" code that each form needs to have; then you write generic code in the class module. Highly recommended.</p>

<h2>            Averaging numbers with many decimal places</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to average 29 numbers that each have 16 decimal places, and I'm not equaling the total that I should. The numbers I need to average are 16 decimal places but they are formatted in Excel as percentage and to 2 decimal places, Ex: 4.71%, 6.66%,
 etc. I should get a total of 7.08% or&nbsp;.0707826932425863, but when I use the AVERAGE function I get 6.96% or .0696427458371844.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I use the ROUND function, like ROUND(AVERAGE(A1:A29),2), I get 7.00% or 7.0000000000000, which is closer to the 7.08%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What function can I use to equal the total I am supposed to, the 7.08% or&nbsp;.0707826932425863?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are any of the options under What If Analysis something I can use? I can't change the numbers, I just need to be able to tie out to&nbsp;the 7.08% or&nbsp;.0707826932425863.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Just for fun, if you use the following, you will get that value exactly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>=MROUND(B1, 0.0410539620807001)</p>
<p>&lt;copied down on your data&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I get your "average" of .0707826932425863.</p>
<p>However, that is not a normal way of rounding that I can see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This bad technique will only return about 4 unique values:</p>
<p>0<br />
0.041053962<br />
0.082107924<br />
0.123161886</p>
<p>

<h2>            how can I insert a bookmark in Word 2008 for Mac when &#34;add&#34; is greyed out&#63;</h2>
                    I want to link sections of my document's table of contents to relevant sections in the body of the document, but my bookmark box has "add" greyed out. Is there any way to do this? I have Word 2008 for Mac and OSX Snow Leopard.

            I don't have Word 2008. However, if the "Add" button is grayed out, Word does not think the selection or cursor position is a valid place to add a bookmark. For instance, I get that in Word 2011 if I try to add a Bookmark within a text box.
<div><br />
<div>In TOCs, page numbers are already working links to the TOC entries. (In Windows, you also have an option to make the whole TOC entry a link to the title, but it's not portable to the Mac.)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Here in Word 2011, I can add bookmarks and hyperlinks to selected portions of the TOC, in order to click on them and jump to another part of the document (just like with the TOC page numbers). However, all these are manual modifications to displayed text
 coming from the TOC field, and as such they are lost when updating the TOC.</div>
<div><br />
<div>What you could do is, once your document is finalized, make a copy of the file, then turn the TOC into regular text. This is done by selecting the TOC and pressing
<i>Command Shift F9.</i><b>&nbsp;</b>But this is a one-way street (you cannot convert it back into a field to update it).</div>

            More fundamental than Daniel's reply, but did you type a <span style="font-style: italic">
name</span> for the Bookmark? The <span style="font-weight: bold">Add</span> button doesn't become active until you type at least one character.<br />
<br />
Based on your description, though, I can't help but wonder how you're creating the TOC to begin with. Using Word's built-in TOC feature there should be no need for additional hyperlinks... As Daniel indicated, the page numbers of the TOC link directly to that
 position in the document.<br />
<br />
Hyperlinking text of the TOC entries to some other location seems rather contradictory to me - but perhaps I just don't understand your intent. FWIW, I believe I'd be tempted to format those locations with a particular style &amp; include that style in the TOC
 specs. In that way it would be included in the TOC itself.<br />

<h2>            Quick Parts</h2>
                    <p>I've created a number of Quick Parts for standard email responses. Unfortunately, when I reply, type in my QP and press F3, the font almost always reverts back to Times New Roman. Here are the specs of my Outlook:</p>
<p>- default font is Calibri</p>
<p>- Cut, copy and paste settings are set to "keep source formatting"</p>
<p>- I've saved my QPs with calibri font, but when I open Outlook and check my QPs in the drop down list, they've gone back to Times New Roman</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue has followed me through Office 2010, 2013 and now 2016. I've had to manually change the font to calbri or simply ignore the font change. Is there a way I can get my QPs to insert as it should?</p>

            Thanks for the speedy response! Unfortunately, the formatting did&nbsp;<strong>not</strong> stick when I created a Quick Part in Word. Everything was just fine except for the spacing. This happened when I inserted the QP with the settings Save in: "Building
 Blocks" as well as "Normal." I also tried to "insert content only" and "insert content in its own paragraph." Still, the formatting was not retained.

            <p>If you press Ctrl+Shift+S to display the Apply Styles pane in a New E-mail window in Outlook, which font has been specified for the Normal style? It is best to keep as many settings as possible identical. (The settings in Word are not relevant for Outlook.)</p>

            Thanks. Unfortunately, that's the same conclusion I came to as well. I was hoping that because I saved by Quick Part to be
<em>specifically&nbsp;</em>calibri 12, that format would stick when responding to emails. Oh well...c'est la vie.

<h2>            Nokia E72, Downloading issues on OVI store</h2>
                    
<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>yesterday I received my brand new Nokia E72, everything seems to work just fine except that i'm unable to download anything on the OVI store application. I've no problem connecting to OVI store, signing in, but after I choose my application I hit the "download"
 button none happen, i mean download status is stuck at 0%. I thought I had to wait, but after 15 min still 0%.</p>
<p>If you guys could give me some help on this, the phone is really cool but just a shame I can't use the OVI Store.</p>
<p>By the way I live in France, maybe the problem could come from there, and i'm using wifi to connect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<p>There should be no issue accessing store from Europe, but you couldn't access applications directed at Nokia MEA region for example. Did you just try today as there did seem to be some OVI access issues between 12.00-14.00 GMT so perhaps some routine maintenance
 was scheduled?</p>

<p>Hi HelenLPiper,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for letting us know the troubleshoot methods you have tried. Firstly, about the searching issue, may I confirm whether your Mac OS 10.14.4 is referring to Mojave?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, then this issue is a known issue about the search not working in the Outlook for Mac after the Mac OS update. Microsoft is aware of &nbsp;and investigating this issue currently. For more information, please see:&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><a href="https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/search-doesn-t-work-in-outlook-for-mac-after-macos-upgrade-b73de6f1-aeb9-4720-bbbe-de65ab50012e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Search
 doesn't work in Outlook for Mac after MacOS upgrade</a></span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are sorry for the inconvenience, meanwhile, if you are using Office 365 account, please use the&nbsp;<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook Web App</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;search for emails as a workaround. Your understanding
 and patience will be highly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover, if your Mac OS is not Mojave, you may do following steps to see if it helps:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Go to "~/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/Outlook/Outlook 15 Profiles/Main Profile/Data".&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Move the&nbsp;<strong>Outlook.sqllite</strong>&nbsp;file to your desktop.</p>
<p>3. When the Rebuild is completed, open Outlook and try searching again.</p>
<p>4. If you can successfully search for emails, then delete the '<strong>Outlook.sqllite'</strong> file from your desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While, if the issue persists after you try above steps, to help you better, please go to the
<strong>Help </strong>menu and click the option "<strong>Contact Support"</strong> to get further assistance. For your reference:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jennifer, thank you for your reply. Yes, I am referring to Mojave. We are a company and have several Mac computers. Most of the Macs with Mojave the search is working fine in Outlook. It is just the one mentioned above that is not working. I might try the
 instructions that you give for the Outlook.sqllite file even though this computer is on Mojave. I have also gone under the Help menu and clicked the Contact Support.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>With all due respect, the link suggests that this was fixed in Mojave 10.14.5. I just purchased a new Mac with 10.14.5, and have spent hours trying every "fix" in the book trying to get the search in Outlook to work.&nbsp; It doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fairness, I have Outlook 2011 (not 2016). Spotlight on my Mac is working fine, just not the search within Outlook. Are there any plans to complete the "fix" to include Outlook 2011?</p>

<p>I am on 10.14.5, on a 2018 MacBook Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rebuilding the index certainly improves the search results, but searches for subsequent messages ingested by Outlook deteriorate over time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are several problems with searching, and am flummoxed why this is not addressed. &nbsp;Here's some background:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I've been using every version of Outlook since 2008.</li><li>I receive perhaps 2000-4000 messages a day; some from colleagues, most from mailing lists from corporate listserver (mailman).</li><li>A majority of the mail I receive is from Linux systems and other devices on enterprise that our team manages (I'm a sysadmin)</li><li>Somewhere between Outlook 2011 and Outlook 2016 I noticed that searches stopped returning full results. In Outlook 2016 I had to run the Reindex tool that MS provides for this problem (doesn't work with Outlook 365/2019, but the above solution does work
 to fully re-index on Outlook 365/2019)</li><li>Reindex seems to fix the search problem temporarily for the day. &nbsp;When my Mac sleeps, or is powered-off, it seems that the re-connect and subsequent fetch of new mail doesn't get ingested into Spotlight properly, but I'm guessing here.</li><li>Both problems have persisted between OS upgrades (I don't upgrade, I build a new MacBook and start fresh each time) and in Outlook 2016 and 2019/365.</li></ul>
<p>The two main problems I have observed&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Search and Smart Folders return incomplete results unless fully re-indexed (<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">starting somewhere in Outlook 2016</span> with an Outlook software update (or perhaps caused by OS update?)</li><li>Rules (server-side) do not work reliably. &nbsp;In my experience, they never have. &nbsp;Note also that the search logic for Rules is very different from mailbox search. For example, a Rule to move a message from Inbox to a named folder based on Subject string mach
 will move 9 of 10 nearly identical messages. &nbsp;No debugging capability to see why it doesn't move the 10th message. &nbsp;I thought perhaps CR/LF in searched field was the issue, but haven't had the time to narrow down. &nbsp;The problem with Rules not being reliable,
 scaled across my daily ingest of 2-4k messages makes managing my mailbox an exercise in approximation of organization. &nbsp;I then rely on Smart Folders to get the job completed, but that doesn't work without daily re-indexing either. &nbsp;It's a mess when applied
 at larger scale.</li></ol>
<p>The search issues forced me to use Apple Mail for reliable search. &nbsp;MS is using Apple Spotlight for indexing. &nbsp;I'm sure Apple Mail is too, but Apple Mail gets it right, and so I can search reliably in Apple Mail. &nbsp;Unfortunately, due to some Apple Mail -&gt;
 Exchange protocol security issues, we're no longer permitted (blocked) by our O365 services in using Apple Mail, so I'm up a creek without a search paddle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've reported this issue, via Outlook 2016 feedback smiley-face before, and over the conversation with MS support they agreed this was a problem and that is is a known issue and that they were working on a fix. &nbsp;Haven't heard anything since, and the problem
 is huge for me, and now I'm hearing colleagues noting the same issues, and I provide them the reindexing advice above (yes, it works for Mojave too).</p>

<p>I would definitively NOT touch the sqlite database… That's only for extreme cases and it's likely to make your local emails disappear…</p>
<p>The steps you tried from the article on the knowledge base should have fixed the issue.</p>
<p>You might have Spotlight conflicts and crashes though. Did you try reindexing through the Terminal as suggested lower in the article? That's usually useful because the command will spit out comments if it starts failing to index something.</p>
<p>You can also look in your /Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports and&nbsp;~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports folders for crash logs related to anything with a name starting with "md". That owould indicate that a Spotlight-related process is crashing.</p>

<p>Talking about the sqlite database, you can also play with the terminal to check its health. I wrote a small blurb about it a while back:</p>

            <p>Hello Raihanul</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have neglected to say whether you are having a problem with wired or wireless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should first try&nbsp;a wired&nbsp;connection to determine whether&nbsp;the internet connection is up and running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you may need to type in your Wi-Fi password to switch to wireless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            Can I combine protected Checkboxes and mail merge fields in the same document&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm using Word 2010 and&nbsp;trying to create a document which contains both check boxes and mail merge fields.&nbsp; As I understand it, in order for end-users to be able to click on the check boxes, I need to protect the form.&nbsp; However, protecting the form prevents
 the merge fields from populating with the respective merge data.</p>
<p><br />
Is it possible to use both protected features (like the checkboxes) and the merge fields feature?&nbsp; If so, how?</p>

<p>My first sync successfully&nbsp;posted my photos on my MyPhone page from my storage card, but i deleted them from my page and when i tried to re-sync the same photos again it will not restore them. The only pictures it will upload are pictures that were not previously
 deleted. How can i fix this? I deleted the temporary internet files and cookies from my PC but this did not allow me to re-sync the same photos again. i have a samsung jack. i did select photos and storage card from the sync options tab so i know that isn't
 the problem.</p>

            Hi Tico101,<br />
<br />
Thank you for using Microsoft My Phone.&nbsp; When you delete items from the web portal, they generally get moved into the Archive.&nbsp; Look in the archive for your photos and choose to restore them.&nbsp; That should help fix your situation.<br />

<h2>            Pinned icons on the taskbar don&#39;t show or disappear until removal of Tasks and Search Icons &#40;regedit&#41;</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Issue:&nbsp; Shortcut icons that I pinned to the Taskbar would either inexplicable disappear or would fail altogether to show on the Taskbar.&nbsp; The icons would appear though, if I changed the taskbar settings to "Use small taskbar buttons."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Solution:&nbsp; In regedit, I edited the registry to remove the Tasks and Search icons from the taskbar. As soon as I applied the edits, taskbar operation became fully functional, as compared to Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Side issue:&nbsp; For me, the Search and Tasks icons on the taskbar were useless anyway.</p>

<h2>            Customers NOT Recieving Email to Hotmail.com &#38; Outlook.com Email Addresses from ESP &#40;despite SPF&#47;DKIM&#41; in place.</h2>
                    <p>Hoping someone here can help. &nbsp;I have an odd issue that has come up recently when users in my organisation attempt to send email to Hotmail and Outlook.com email addresses through our Infusionsoft application - the emails are not being received.
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All indications from our system reporting is that these emails are being successfully sent from our servers but do to appear to our members. The problem is that they people are PAYING for us to send share trading recommendations to them and if they
 cannot receive them then they are not willing to pay anymore!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tested this using a hotmail account I setup, and I see the following behaviour:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sending email in general works to the hotmail account. &nbsp;If I send an email through our Infusionsoft platform, they have issues recieving it. I have sent them links to add us to their contact list and safe senders list so hoping this will sate them
 in the meantime but would really like to settle this once and for all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We've got all DKIM and SPF records set up accordingly. These are the addresses that have been affected we know of:</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<div>
<div>
<div>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</div>
<div>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</div>
<div>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</div>
<div>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</div>
<div>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sort of at a loss as to why this is occurring. &nbsp;Any recommendations, or a way to check if there is something within the Outlook.com/Hotmail system that is blocking mail from my company domain?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you let me know.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

                    I want to remove quote marks ' ' from the email address. If someone who is not in my Contacts folder (in Outlook 2016) emails me, when I reply, Outlook puts a single quote character before and after the email address. This makes it difficult for me to
 track, sort and organize my emails. and can results in a Non-Delivery Receipt. Why does Outlook 2016 do this? How can I stop it from happening?&nbsp; Can also happen when we initiate an email to someone not in Contacts and they reply and we then reply to them.

    <title>Windows 10 stuck in boot loop after joining insider - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 stuck in boot loop after joining insider</h2>
                    Yesterday I decided to join and install windows 10 insider builds, when I changed it over it said it needed to restart, upon restarting it would show the windows logo then go to a black screen and sit there. If I move the mouse it shows up with a load
 circle on it but its flickering like it cant load something. I left it on while I slept because I was hoping it would eventually load or something, when I woke up it was still doing it. I attempted a system restore and got an error 0X8000FFFF, when I went
 back to system restore to see if I can restore to another point there were no more points and the one I just got through using was no longer there. I am currently on a windows 7 trial that I happened to have laying around so I could get on a forum and ask.

<h2>            How to resolve a circular reference error that does not exist&#63;</h2>
                    So I have the following arrays:&nbsp;

<div>C28:&nbsp;=IFERROR(INDEX(B20:H20,MATCH(TRUE,B20:H20&gt;A20,0)),"")</div>

<div>And the following values which have no dependents:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>B20:H20: all "1" except C20, which is "2"</div>
<div>B21:H21: all "1" except C21, which is "2"</div>
<div>B22:H22: all "1" except C22, which is "2"</div>
<div>B23:H23: all "1" except C23, which is "2"</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Whenever I change the "2"'s to "1"'s the error goes away, but whenever I put the "2"'s back I get a circular reference error. Since the values listed have no references, I don't see how this is possible. Any ideas?</div>

 circular references. The rest of the cells even the similar ones all around it don't seem to have a problem. Just seems to be in C28. Hit ctrl-shift-enter yourself to see my problem. Thanks for your help.

<br />
First, yes, when I array-enter the formula in C28, I get a pop-up about a circular reference error.&nbsp; More importantly, it says that Excel cannot list the references; also, the Circular Reference option in the Error Checking menu on the toolbar is greyed out,
 as you mentioned in a related thread.&nbsp; All of these tell us that Excel is very confused; that is, the circular reference is very complicated.&nbsp; As further evidence of this, keep an eye on the lower-left part of the status bar as you change the values in C20:C24
 from 2 to 1 to 2.&nbsp; Excel indicates different cells as "having" (being involved in) a circular reference.<br />
<br />
So do not expect to simply look at a formula and identify the circular reference directly or even within one or two level of references.&nbsp; Our inability to see the circular reference does not mean it is not there.&nbsp; It just means the circular chain of references
 is much longer than we (or even Excel) can follow easily.<br />
<br />
Second, the reason why the circular reference might depend on the constant values in C20:C24 is (my guess) that the circular reference arises from a condition of an IF expression or similar conditional function (e.g. CHOOSE).&nbsp; When we write IF(condition,expression1,expression2),
 Excel evaluates expression1 only if the condition is true, and it evaluates expression2 only if the condition is false.<br />
<br />
So one of the IF() formulas is part of the circular chain of references.&nbsp; Unfortunately, that is not too helpful because you have a lot of IF() formulas.&nbsp; BTW, some of those are not array-entered, as they should be.&nbsp; But that's a separate issue.<br />
<br />
Finally, the real question is:&nbsp; where do you go from here?<br />
<br />
I'm afraid I don't know.&nbsp; The workbook is very complicated.&nbsp; I don't know of any tool that will find circular references (perhaps someone else does), since the Excel Circular Reference Error Checking operation is greyed out.<br />
<br />
I would start over.&nbsp; That might sound foreboding, given the eventual complexity of the worksheet.&nbsp; But then again, many of the formulas are the same form.&nbsp; So once you get one set of formulas working, it might be a "simple matter" of copying and pasting them.&nbsp;
 The key might be to <u>correctly</u> array-enter the formulas that need to be from the get-go.<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />

            Hi Ivana,<br />
<br />
I had a look to your workbook and in my opinion, the formula in C28 has no circular reference but the workbook contains several circular references that you have to correct.<br />
<br />
When you get the circular reference warning, click OK and look in the statusbar to see where Excel has detected a circular reference, e.g. circular references: G74.<br />

    <title>Windows Phone playing mysterious notification sound on a regular basis - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rgkovach123  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Phone playing mysterious notification sound on a regular basis</h2>
                    <p>I have a Samsung ATIV S Neo on Sprint.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I set the volume to Zero, the mode to Vibrate, and disabled all notifications under
<strong>ringtone&nbsp;+ sounds</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet, I still get a short notification sound on a regular basis (roughly every 5 minutes). I have no idea what is playing the sound - it doesn't seem to be related to incoming calls, new emails, facebook updates, etc.. My only guess is that a system or network
 status is triggering the sound.</p>

            <div>Following with what Karolina had posted, you want to rule out one of the apps being the root cause. &nbsp;Go to "Settings" -&gt; "background tasks" and then block every app that you allow to run in the background. &nbsp;Then reboot the phone. &nbsp;You shouldn't have to
 reboot, but it wont hurt and is free.</div>
<div><br />
If you put the phone in Airplane mode, do you still get the notifications?
<div><br />
<div>Or it could be a hardware defect with your phone. Does your phone play the same sound when you connect or disconnect it to the charger? I remember that some people had a similar problem a few years back with the Samsung Focus. Apparently there was a bit
 of metal in the charging port that was slightly misaligned and it would trigger the charging tone. &nbsp;I'm not familiar with the Focus or the Neo, but if it has a removable battery, check the battery contacts. &nbsp;Also plug the phone into the charging cable and
 see if you still get the sound every 5 minutes.</div>

<p>The picture shows the protective film and silicone covers? Check the side keys (volume up/down) are free.<br />
The lighting bolt and wheel appear every time while the volume up key is pressed down during a phone bootup. To get it out of this mode, press and hold volume down and power keys together. This can happen with all WP8 devices.</p>
