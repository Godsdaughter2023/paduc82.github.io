<h2>            Tamil Indic keyboard is not working</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I am using windows 10 for sometimes, after the update was not able to use the Google's input tools which will allow me to type in Tamil. Whenever i'm switching from English to Tamil, it stops automatically.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And in my languages option Tamil is already present, and the input method was "Google Input Tools", though i have done all the settings to default, no luck.&nbsp;Kindly help me in this, its really urgent.<br />

            Hi Partha,<br />
<br />
<br />
To help you with this issue, you may try to re-install Google Input Tools. If it's not resolved, please contact Google. It's very likely that it has something to do with the software.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards.

<h2>            OEM keys &#38; bios &#47; firmware upgrades</h2>
                    Hi, I have a HP laptop that was originally Win 8 with an OEM key. That was subsequently upgraded to Win 10. I note that there are bios &amp; firmware upgrades available for my device but I have read that the OEM key is embedded in the BIOS. Can I upgrade the
 bios &amp; firmware &amp; the OEM key still be valid?

            This is a question for HP, not Microsoft, but you have a digital entitlement to Windows 10 that shouldn't be affected by a BIOS flash.&nbsp; You shouldn't upgrade any firmware, including the BIOS, unless there's a specific and compelling reason to do so, and
 the mere availability of updates isn't a compelling reason. <br />

            Cheers JimWynne - makes sense. I've had some problems with Windows upgrades that may or not be due to the fact that I've got a pretty old BIOS version - there've been 9 releases since my version, some of which mention fixes to bugs that could be connected
 to my upgrade issues but I don't have enough know how to confirm. I think the best option would be to start by doing a fresh install of Win 10 with the current, if old, BIOS &amp; see if the problems go away. If they do, I'll not touch the BIOS, if they don't,
 I'll get in touch with HP. Anyone disagree with that plan?

Hi,</p>
<p>There are many reasons why your system may crash due to DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL STOP error. This has many possible causes, but the most common scenarios are: Faulty drivers, Hardware issue or Anti-virus software problem.</p>
<p>The driver which appears to be causing the crash is the athr.sys.</p>
<p>The athr.sys is a file related to network adapter. So I would suggest you to uninstall and re-install drivers for network card.</p>
<p>Steps to uninstall and reinstall Network card driver:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on start button. <br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the search box type devmgmt.msc and then press enter.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select the Network card device and right click on it<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now select properties.<br />
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the properties window, under Driver tab, click on uninstall button.<br />
6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart your computer now; this will automatically install proper drivers for it.</p>
<p>You may also download and install latest drivers for it from the manufacturer’s website.</p>
<p>For more information visit <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</a></p>
<p>If you still face the same problem then, try the below steps.</p>
<p>Perform hardware clean boot on your computer.</p>
<p>Here’s the procedure to do it:</p>
<p>1. Go to Start and type device manager in the start search field.<br />
2. Type device manager and select device manager from the programs list.<br />
3. Right Click on Sound Card, Video Adapter, and Network Adapter one by one and click disable.<br />
4. Reboot the computer.</p>
<p>If this fixes your problem, enable to hardware devices one at time to find the exact device causing this problem.</p>
<p>After you found the device that causing the problem you can resolve by installing last driver or replacing the device.</p>
<p>Hope this information is helpful.</p>

            Try going to your local folder. Click on Local folder and you should be able to delete the recovered messages. I had about 50 of them. I don't know if they well come back. Be carefull of what you delete&nbsp;, start at the bottom of the list and delete the
 line with all of the numbers and work your way up the list.I hope this works for you good luck.&nbsp;

<p>Every time I try to uncheck the box in read-only then click apply and exit the window but then go back into the window to check to see if it did what I wanted it to do, the read-only box is checked when I want it unchecked. I need it unchecked so I can "edit"
 a file for a game so I can download all the images and have the game run faster. I've googled the problem for about a day and one solution seemed possible but a error comes up that says that the ACL is a invalid structure. So I googled that problem anbd the
 solution came to deleting all the ACLs' and putting yourself as the only admin or something along those lines. So I was wondering is their a way to get the read-only box unchecked and stay unchecked, so that I can affect the target box since it is grayed out?</p>

I don't know. Does Guild Wars have a User forum? Might be well to ask there if it does.

            Yes, the other arrows work just fine and do what they are supposed to do. I have a Dell Inspiron 15 laptop. The 'bn' appears wherever I have my cursor.

<p>So the 'bn' appears like a little pop-up on the screen near your cursor? And this just happens in web pages? What about in documents, etc?</p>

<p>It happens in web pages and documents, like where im typing</p>

<p>On a webpage, though there is no flashing line, since there is no area for text input (like in a Word document). Are you clicking on a blank area of the webpage, then trying to scroll down with the down arrow?</p>
<p>Also, did this just recently start occuring? Have you performed a reboot recently?</p>

<p>That depends on how often and regular your nephew and nieces are coming to play.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If they are visiting you every so often and don't need/want to have their game progress saved, you can simply sign them in as guests on your own account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But supervise them in that case, as everything they do on your account is under your responsibility. So if they go on a shopping spree with your credit card, or violate the Terms of Use or Code of Conduct, they are getting YOUR account banned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most ideal solution would be what I asked the parents of our nieces and nephews:</p>
<p>The parents created free Microsoft Accounts for their kids (and the parents themselves if they didn't have them yet) on
<a href="https://www.outlook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.outlook.com</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then the parents added their kids' accounts to their family at <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/family" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://account.microsoft.com/family</a></p>
<p>After that, the parents were able to set online and privacy settings for their kids at
<a href="https://account.xbox.com/settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.xbox.com/settings</a> to their liking.&nbsp;For example, my wife's brother allowed his older son to play online multiplayer and talk with strangers, while the younger sister
 would not be allowed to do that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a one time setup process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the parents set up the accounts, you simply add them to your console, and then you don't have to do anything. Simply have the kids sign into their accounts when they visit you, and they can play your games if you set your console as the "Home Console",
 and if the kids have bought games for themselves on their account, they can even play their own games on your console.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi markdavis, you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers

    <title>Constant disk use in Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peterjf1966  say:</h3>
<h2>            Constant disk use in Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>Hi there</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My Dell Windows 7 laptop's hard disk light is nearly always on. (I didn't even think this was abnormal until someone pointed it out to me!) I have seen many mentions of this issue&nbsp;in various forums, but have not found&nbsp;answer that I have not already eliminated
 from my list of suspects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The disk tab of Resource Monitor shows very high activity of an image called System (PID 4) and the Disk Activity box beneath shows that 'System' is nearly always reading my library files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Perhaps I should point out at this stage that I have got about 45,000 MP3s in My Music and about the same number of pictures in My Pictures.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few things I have eliminated are Windows Media Player library sharing, disk defragmenter and anti-virus. Also, it is not the file indexer, as the disk activity continues at the same level or higher after the index is complete.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whatever it is, it does not seem to have any impact on performance, which suggests that whatever it is is a background/idle process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I find out just what this 'system' image/process/program actually is, so I can do something about it? This is&nbsp;my specific question - as I have not seen 'system' mentioned anywhere in any of the answers I have read on any forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few bits of system info if it makes any difference:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows 7 64-bit Home Premium</p>
<p>586GB hard drive (single partition) with about 100GB free</p>
<p>4GB RAM</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm thinking of upgrading the HDD and adding some more RAM, but I would like to resolve this problem before adding any new components.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in anticipation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I was recently seeing constant disk access for my Windows 7 Pro system, with about 3% CPU use by the System (PID 4). Although 3% should not slow the system down significantly,&nbsp;my PC was sluggish to start and run basic applications.&nbsp;The disk light was flashing
 constantly. The&nbsp;resource monitor (accessed from the Task Manager) showed dozens of disk accesses by this System process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Following several threads and suggestions, I gradually stopped several possible culprits. Although potentially helpful, I stopped the Windows Search (indexing) service. I also stopped the SuperFetch service. These seemed to make only minor gains. I then
 stopped the Media Player and Media Center Network sharing services. Upon rebooting, my system is renewed and fast. My CPU sits between 0-1%, the disk is quiet, and ideal disk I/Os are in the single digits and small. I have not gone about adding back in any
 of these services to see if and which ones might be tolerable, but for now I am a happy camper.</p>

            <p>Hi Richard</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What first made a big difference was the indexer. At the time, I was using a registry cleaner which was clearing out the index and this was what first drew my attention to the issue. Like you, I have stopped the Media Player Network Sharing, which has made
 a difference. However, there are still times when the disk is going flat out - but only for relatively short periods of time, not for hours on end as before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think this is caused by two things. Firstly, my (Norton) antivirus does scans and other things while the computer is idle. Secondly, I see there are a number of tasks scheduled in the Windows Task Scheduler. These tasks are mostly scheduled for the small
 hours, which is when a lot of the disk activity occurs. I therefore think that this is the current cause, and as it only occurs for a few minutes at a time, I don't see it as being a major problem any more.</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 3 Windows 10 on screen keyboard</h2>
                    <p>Is anyone else having issues with the on screen keyboard for your Surface Pro 3 after the Windows 10 update? When I go to tablet mode an enter an app, the on screen keyboard will not pop up. An example is in the weather app. When I touch the field to input
 a city name, the on screen keyboard is nowhere to be found. I have to connect the type cover back to my Pro 3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions on this? Thanks. </p>

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for sharing your experiences with Windows 10 on our Surface.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the onscreen keyboard, the information I have is that, by design, you must manually open the onscreen keyboard by selecting the keyboard from the taskbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MODERATOR EDIT:&nbsp; If you don't see the icon, right-click (or press and hold) the taskbar and make sure the
<strong>Show touch keyboard </strong>button has a check mark next to it.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There may be a number of possible reasons for this type of issue to occur. However, the error message points out mainly to the driver issue, so that's where we are going to focus at.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a first troubleshooting step, we suggest that you check for updates on your drivers, particularly with the built-in camera.
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028443/windows-update-drivers-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">This link</a></strong> will provide more information on how to update drivers in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, you can also manually uninstall, reinstall or update your drivers in Windows 10, by simply following the steps
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_devices/how-to-install-and-update-drivers-in-windows-10/a97bbbd1-9973-4d66-9a5b-291300006293">here</a></strong>, provided by

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As stated on this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/310123/error-codes-in-device-manager-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft article</a>, the error message appears <span>if the hardware key does not contain a
<strong>FailReasonString </strong>value</span><span>. Typically, the device's hardware key contains a
<strong>FailReasonString </strong>value, and the value string displays an error message defined by the hardware manufacturer.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Since updating the device driver didn't help, we suggest that you use the automated troubleshooter first to test the computer for problems and attempt to fix the issues automatically. You may refer to the steps below:
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key</strong> + <strong>R</strong> and type <strong>Control Panel</strong>.</li><li>Type <strong>troubleshooting </strong>in the search bar and click on <strong>
Troubleshooting</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Hardware and Devices</strong>.</li><li>Follow the steps from the wizard to run the troubleshooter.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it turns out. </p>

<p>Thank you for the update. Try to roll back the driver to the last good configuration, then check if the error will persist. To do that, you may follow these steps:
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click the <strong>Start </strong>button and select <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</li><li>Right-click your camera driver, select <strong>Properties</strong>, and browse to the
<strong>Driver </strong>tab. </li><li>Press the <strong>Roll Back Driver</strong> option if available, and Windows 10 will begin the process.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>You may also download an earlier version of the driver for your operating system from the computer model manufacturer’s website and install it through
<strong>Device Manager</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us in the loop. </p>

<p>I made a post about this a few days ago and just wanted to ensure it got answered. The other post has alot more detail as to what went on but I came home from work and had alot of strange achievement as well as achievements in which the order was really
 muffed up. My son intially denied it so I contacted xbox MULTIPPLE times to see and figureo out what was wrong. I'm sure you guys have this o record. So my son admitted that he modified the more "harder to get achievements" in lego batman 2.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I am coming to you guys in hopes that you will reset me, as opposed to completely banning me. My son will not be playing my xbox again....AT ALL as i have made him a STEAM account. Please respond to this post as well as my other. Again, I'm rushing to write
 this since I work a long shift today but I'm hoping you guys will read my other post and reply!?!? thank you</p>

<p>Hey there xXPROGAMERXx</p>
<p>Welcome to the forums</p>
<p>I could not find your other thread, through Author search nor regular search. Only on the other Community forums :(</p>
<p>Now. In regards to what you have asked. All the Microsoft Community forums is mainly manned by community members with some Support Agents. This is to allow the community to help each other, and get faster help. Microsoft will attend threads when they need
 to, for the more in depth account issues that we can not attend because of such PII. As for your Gamerscore been reset. This would (In my understanding) not be possible, as only the Xbox Live Policy and Enforcement Team have such powers, and they do not come
 onto these parts of the forums. </p>
<p>The only way to have your Gamerscore reset is to have someone file a complaint against your Xbox Live profile. This will then send your profile up to the Xbox Live Policy and Enforcement Team where they will begin their investigations on your account. This,
 again, will take time considering the number of complaints they receive a day. If they see that you have violated the Xbox Live Code of Conduct. They will take Enforcement Action onto your Account. For modified Gamerscores, this would most likely (Again, my
 understanding) be reset, and your gamer zone to be branded "Cheater". You will also be kicked out of the Xbox Live Ambassador Program (Again, my understanding) because you have violated the Xbox Live code of Conduct.
</p>
<p>Also, I have seen this posted before in these forums, and over on the Microsoft Community Forums. It does say in the
<strong><a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-GB/Legal/CodeOfConduct?xr=footnav" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox Live Code of Conduct</a></strong>, "Your Account, Your responsibility" I know it sounds harsh, and crewel. But that is what is
 says.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>Please kindly note, I do not work for Microsoft in any way nor do I work for Xbox Live either. I am a community member like yourself, and am here to post and help. Everything I have posted is my View and understanding
 when reading the Xbox Live Code of Conduct, and from helping others in the past. I am not trying to annoy you or upset you with what I post, nor do I want to.</em></span></p>
<p>I hope this helps you,</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p>By comparing games for our accounts, he unlocked 2 achievements 1 day ago, and 2 achievements 2 days ago. Now, I am not saying how he did it is right, but because he did not unlock a bunch of achievements in a short time, the system will not flag the account.
 From what I know if you unlock a stupid number of achievements in a very short period, the system will catch what is happening. Anyway, it also appears that he unlocked them while online as they are time stamped. It is pretty likely that this would have gone
 unnoticed if you had not posted here. Seeing as you have admitted that &nbsp;he modified the more "harder to get achievements", it is possible that this might be reported and looked into now. While I doubt you will be banned if it is, you will be labeled a cheater,
 have all of your gamer score reset, and never be able to regain the achievements you had unlocked. You will likely also be removed from the ambassador program.

<p>Please make no mistake, I am deeply sorry for this incident and by all means have never ever been in trouble with xbox live. I understand that If I did not come here it would have gone unnoticed. However, I don't resort to these means to get ahead on xbox
 or anywhere. I hope my honesty does not bite me in the rear but if it does, I'd rather be banned for telling MS the truth than for me trying to push it under the rug and being known as a dishonest cheater.
</p>
<p>I hope to god that I don't get BANNED. I want to be reset because I earned all of m achievements (up untill now legitematly). I've spent over 50% of my time on xbox just achievement hunting for 100% in every game. I have spent well over thousands in digital
 video games and DLC. </p>
<p>I don't want to be banned. I deserve it for not going the extra mile to be responsible for my property. My son did not mean me any harm because me and him play lego batman CO OP together. He tells me that he knew I wanted the achievements and thus got them
 for me. He was trying to help. We had a little talk and that was that. But although he did not mean any harm I'm pretty positive i've blown this out of proportion. I just want ANY solution that does not end with me being banned. I will take a years suspension.
 This account is very special to me. I've had it for a year and a half and my face lit up when I hit 10g.

<p>Also, although I uninstalled all of these programs off of the family computer, some ones that caught my eye were
<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong>. Nothing else really seemed out of place. Can someone enlighten me as to what these programs do. I noticed that it deals with rofiles and whatnot but how would my son even do this. We have a xbox slim by the way.</p>
<p>Also, I decided to come forth because I want everyone and the enforcement team to be well aware that I am not included with the people who do this on the norm. This was a mistake and was not intended and i'd be sad to see all my achievements go (I 100% eight
 games) but you have to do what you have to do. I'd much rather a reset then an ban. I'm not a cheater but I'd rather be labeled one than banned. Has anyone from this thread ever experienced something like this?</p>

<p>From what I know, the only way the account would be permabanned is if he used outside means to gain them. I am going to use Dead Island as an example. In Dead Island, there was a duplication glitch where you could duplicate pretty much any weapon. You could
 then sell them to gain money. This would be considered cheating using a glitch in the game. But, in Dead Island, there were also many weapons that were made outside the game using a computer, and then imported into the game. These weapons were modified to
 have unlimited ammo, and dealt huge amounts of damage making the game pretty much a walkthrough. This would be considered using outside means. This is the best I can explain the differences.

<p>The program you listed is a program that would allow him to use a computer to modify the gamerscore. I really can not tell you if you will be banned or not. If this is reported because of this post, they might take your honesty into consideration. I have
 no idea how the enforcement team do things or what they consider before handing out a punishment, so I have no way to tell you exactly what might happen. All I can say is I wish you the best of luck with this.

<h2>            Problem with Motocross Madness 2 on Windows 7</h2>
                    Hi, I have Windows 7 64 bit. I have tried the MSconfig option and changed the maximum amount of Ram to 2G. I also tried running the program in Windows compatibility mode, and Windows Firewall is off but when I attempt to start the game it still comes up
 with the same error message, "A problem caused the program to stop working correctly, Windows will close the program and notify you if a solution is available." Please tell me somebody has had this problem and knows how to fix it?

            <p>I only have the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/games/motocross2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
demo</a> of the game and it runs on W7 32bit, so can't help with certainty. But even on the demo I had to do this (which I found on a site) before it would run correctly. And I read that the real game sometimes fails in this way as well.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><em>"However, this does require a quick fix. After installing, the demo will complain that a dll file is missing ( d3drm.dll ).<br />
<br />
&nbsp;If you know a safe site to download it from you can get it from there, OR I copied it from my XP system, ( C:\windows\system32 ) and copied it into my netbook program files folder for the demo, where the game's exe file is located."</em></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Finally, after a quick google I did find this -&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>"<strong>Working with Tweaks</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Motocross Madness 2 - Compatibility mode (XP SP3), Disable Visual themes and Disable Desktop Composition"</em></p>

</em></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Hope it helps.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>PS</strong> - are all the usual drivers up to date - video/sound etc? (always worth a shot).</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Another fav to try is right-click the game icon and 'run as admin'. Helps with some older games.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Also, use compat mode to try to run in 256 colors and 640x480 screen res. I read somewhere that some older games can't always cope with large screen res's of some modern monitors/desktops.</p>

</p><p>When doing the update on Windows 10, the system stopped and I then went through a process to reload all according to the instructions on the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the system reloaded I had lost my emails which is very annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This must be a problem with your update so what can be done to resolve this ?</p>

<p>Hello Jim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's possible that your emails were affected by the update error. We'd like to learn more about your concern so that we could provide the proper resolution. We just have a few questions for you:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Which application are you using to access your emails? For example, the built-in Mail app or Outlook 2016.</li><li>Which build version of Windows 10 is on your computer? To check, click <strong>
Start</strong>, type <strong>winver</strong>, and press <strong>Enter</strong>. It'll show something like 14393.1066.</li><li>Just to confirm, were all emails affected, or just emails in a specific folder?</li><li>Did you receive any error messages? If yes, please post a screenshot.</li><li>Have you tried checking your emails through a browser?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you done so far?</li></ul>

                    Hello people,
<div>I formatted my computer yesterday - windows 7 ultimate sp1 x64, and today when I was installing adobe acrobat update and python I got error 1723. I read some posts on this error and they are mainly concerned with java. However, I had installed java SE
 7.11 (offline installer) successfully and also uninstalled in completely today. But, problem persists. I also tried &nbsp;sfc/scannow, msiexec /unreg, msiexec /regserver&nbsp;but no luck. I also tried FixIt (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2438651) but no luck.</div>
<div>By the way, I am installing with admin privileges on my machine (not on network drives).</div>
<div>I am in scary situation, please tell me what to do...</div>
<div>If someone helps me urgently, it would be of great great help. Thanks.</div>
                </div>

    <title>Blue Screen on Startup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> taylor g.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blue Screen on Startup</h2>
                    <p>I have an Dell OptiPlex 755 running Windows 10 Home. The OS was installed from an installation media disc. Recently I have been having problems with my computer&nbsp;going to the "blue screen of death" on startup. This is only half of my blue screen problems,
 but the other half will likely be put into its own question. When it crashes on startup though, it gives me this error code:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">IRQL IS NOT LESS OR EQUAL</p>
<p>
</p><p>After it automatically restarts, it goes to the blue screen a second time while booting up (same error code). The third time it starts up it goes into automatic repair. It will diagnose my computer and attempt to fix it, only to come up with a screen that
 says this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Automatic Repair couldn't repair your PC</p>
<p>Press "Advanced options" to try other options to repair your PC or "Shut down" to turn off your PC.</p>
<p>Log file: D:\WINDOWS\System32\Logfiles\Srt\SrtTrail.txt</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually I can just go to the Advanced Options and click "Continue" to get on, it tends to start up with no problems after that. (The past few days it tends to crash a third time before this works.) I hunted down the "SrtTrail.txt" file. Here are the contents:</p>

<strong>Time taken = 4094 ms</strong></p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">---------------------------<br />
---------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm led to believe that the corruption of "bootres.dll" is the source of my problems, as the log says. I've done some looking around already and found that other people are having similar issues. With my searching around, I've tried a few things to fix the
 issue:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Open the elevated Command Prompt and run the System File Checker (following instructions provided by Microsoft's website).</li><li>Also ran the CHKDSK command in the same Command Prompt.</li><li>Gone through the Device Manager and checked for driver updates online for nearly every single device, including the power button for the sake of completeness. The
<em>only</em> device that I didn't check was my graphics card, but it's current driver is recent and I've never had problems with an outdated graphics driver. I will update it after this question is posted.</li><li>Had Windows do an update check several times via Windows Update.</li><li>Run the Windows Memory Diagnostics to check the integrity of the memory.</li><li>Updated my computer's BIOS to the latest version provided by Dell.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>None of these worked. The SFC just comes back with a message saying that no integrity violations were found, and CHKDSK doesn't find anything either. Windows Update and Device Manager both say that pretty much everything is up-to-date. The BIOS update didn't
 do anything besides mark off one more thing on my to-do list. The results for the Windows Memory Diagnostics were actually lost since my computer blue screened when it restarted at the conclusion of the test (same dreaded error code), but it never said during
 the passes that it found any memory issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Though there are two devices in Device Manager that concern me: "PCI Serial Port" and "PCI Simple Communications Controller." These two devices are missing drivers according to my computer. The automatic search for drivers online came back with nothing,
 no drivers could be found. I did some research, but my searching around yielded about half-a-dozen different solutions to these things, and I didn't feel comfortable enough to do any of them without some guidance for fear of hurting my computer worse than
 it already is. Here are the hardware IDs:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>PCI Serial Port</td>
<td>PCI Simple Communications Controller</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PCI\VEN_8086&amp;DEV_29B7&amp;SUBSYS_02111028&amp;REV_02<br />
PCI\VEN_8086&amp;DEV_29B7&amp;SUBSYS_02111028<br />
PCI\VEN_8086&amp;DEV_29B7&amp;CC_070002<br />
PCI\VEN_8086&amp;DEV_29B7&amp;CC_0700</td>
<td>PCI\VEN_8086&amp;DEV_29B4&amp;SUBSYS_02111028&amp;REV_02<br />
PCI\VEN_8086&amp;DEV_29B4&amp;SUBSYS_02111028<br />
PCI\VEN_8086&amp;DEV_29B4&amp;CC_078000<br />
PCI\VEN_8086&amp;DEV_29B4&amp;CC_0780</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I don't know if this would have any significance in the startup crashing, but there it is in case it is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've pretty much exhausted all possible solutions I've found without just completely reinstalling Windows 10. I'm planning on creating another installation media USB (a friend has the original disc) soon and attempting to repair this installation with that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case these are needed, here are the specs of my computer:</p>
<p>Dell OptiPlex 755</p>
<p>CPU: Intel Core 2 Quad Q9550 2.83GHz 4-core (either used or refurbished)</p>
<p>RAM: 8GB (4x2GB) (used)</p>
<p>PSU: Seasonic S12II 520 (520W) (new)</p>
<p>GPU: Gigabyte NVIDIA GT 1030 2GB Low-Profile (new)</p>
<p>HDD: Western Digital Blue WD10EZEX 1TB 7200rpm SATA (new)</p>
<p>BIOS: A22</p>
<p>OS: Windows 10 Home (64-bit, Version 1803, Build 17134.81)</p>
<p>Anything not listed is stock for the OptiPlex 755.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your time and any advice you can give me!</p>

            Hi Taylor, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

            Hi Taylor, the mini-dump file indicates your nvidia video card device driver as the culprit behind this . .. 
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button)
<br />Expand the Display Adapters Section
<br />Right click your video card and choose Properties
<br />On the Driver Tab, choose 'Roll back Driver'
<br />
<br />Restart your PC once done . . .
<br />
<br />If that does not resolve the issue, go to the support page for your device on the manufacturers website, then download and install the video driver they recommend, it may well be an older version to the one you are currently running

<p>Interesting, thank you. I was able to start up my computer without any issues this morning (before rolling back), but I still did as you recommended.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm assuming it rolled back the driver fine, and it started up fine, but now I am unable to access the NVIDIA Control Panel. I tried installing the recommended driver for my device from NVIDIA's website, but my computer crashed during the installation, same
 error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>IRQL IS NOT LESS OR EQUAL</p>
<p>
</p><p>It started up fine after that, but why would this be?</p>

<p>Having the same problem. Thought it was just the Fifa file being corrupt or something at first but I tried it with Battlefield from the disc and after 40 mins the same thing happened. I'm thinking that I might have to do a factory reset.</p>

<p>Not sure, but could it be the Kinect hearing something that sounds like "Xbox Go Home"? I had that problem a lot with the original Kinect where it would randomly stop Netflix because it heard something wrong.

            I too cannot connect my Go 6100 to my MS Surface Book computer<br />
<br />
TomTom customer support have not been very helpful. After a month of silence they came up with the response below:<br />
"...on investigating your case for the surface PRO the technical team has informed us that the compatability on your computer can be fixed by making some simple changes in the system registry which the manufacturers would be able to help you as making changes
 on the computer system files is out of our boundary so we will not be able to help you with the same even though the solution can be easily found on the google search engine.<br />
Thus I would advise you to contact microsoft as they should be able to help you with your query as soon as possible."<br />
<br />
Well I tried MS support and they were not able to help - they had no registry changes to suggest and no specific answers relating to this problem.<br />
<br />
Note that the reply wrongly refers to Surface Pro - I have a Surface Book as I had made clear. There is mention elsewhere on the internet of a registry change affecting the CS enabled setting in the registry and then a change to the USB selective suspend setting
 in power settings. I have tried this and it does not work. It looks like this was the solution to a different problem affecting the Surface Pro 3.<br />
<br />
So can MS and TomTom get their act together to make TomToms talk to the Surface Book please?
