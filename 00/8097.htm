<h2>            Add 2nd phone number to a contact</h2>
                    How do I add a phone number to a contact?&nbsp; The directions given by Skype do not work because when I open the profile for a contact there is no selection offered to add a number.

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/d3aadfc2-813d-4114-8bc3-f1aed96359a7" title="ClevisLA">
<p>
</p><p>I am afraid to say that there is no option to add a number to your existing contact with the Skype version you are using. You will need to dial the number and save it as a separate contact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But this feature is available on <a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Classic Skype</a>. Just follow the steps below:</p>
To add a phone number to a contact
<ol>
<li>In your contact list, select the contact you’d like to add a phone number to.</li><li>In the chat window, click their profile picture.</li><li>In the contact profile, click <strong>Add Number</strong>.</li><li>Select the number type (<strong>Mobile</strong>, <strong>Home</strong>, <strong>
Office</strong>, <strong>Other</strong>), choose a country from the drop-down, enter a valid phone number and then select

<p>
</p><p>This feature is also available on Skype for Windows 10 which is a preinstalled app for Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On your Skype app, go to your contact, right-lick their profile and you will be able to see the option to "<strong>add number</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that helps.</p>

            <p>Suggestion/s:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Start the Zune software on the computer. <br />
2.&nbsp; Connect your Zune player by using the Zune Sync Cable. <br />
3.&nbsp; Click Settings, and then click Device. <br />
4.&nbsp; Click SYNC OPTIONS, and then click ERASE ALL CONTENT. <br />
5.&nbsp; When you receive the message:</p>
<p>Please Confirm. Are you sure you want to remove all content from this device?</p>
<p>Click YES. <br />
6.&nbsp; After the device has been erased, sync your content back to the device. If you have lots of content to sync, you may want to disconnect the device after several files have been synced to make sure that the files have been transferred successfully.
<br />
7.&nbsp; Try playing a few songs on your Zune to see if the error persists.&nbsp;</p>

            Try executing the merge to a new document and then printing that.&nbsp; You may have to fiddle with the height of the row in the Directory type mail merge main document to achieve a layout that aligns with the labels.

            I don't have access to a thermal label printer to check, but I am pretty sure that you don't set this up as a label merge, but as a 'letters' merge with the page size of a single label. That would certainly be the first thing to try.<br />

            <p>Thanks to Graham and Macropod for your replies.</p>
<p>I also have a problem where I am trying to print product labels from MS Word 2010 to a Datamax M-4208 thermal label printer. The label is just set up as a one page document which successfully prints on a label, but if I want to print 200 of these product
 labels, there is a short pause between each label as the job prints, thereby prolonging the job considerably. Do you know what I would need to do to get the 200 labels feeding continuously until the job is finished?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            The delay is probably due to the way Word has to communicate with it (though the printer's drivers), combined with delays in the printer's own paper handling abilities.

            <p>So is that to say that Office 2016 is not supported by the current Mac OS, which is OSX 10.11 – &nbsp;El Capitan? I didn't know that. But criticising users who are using the current Mac OS is absurd. El Capitan has been in beta for months, and there was plenty
 of time for MS to test Office 2016 on it. Obviously, Apple are not going to hold release of a new OS for MS to catch up. Perhaps it should have been MS who held up until their software ran reliably on a current OS?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me, Office 2016 has frequently crashed and is excruciatingly slow in launching and also slow in normal use. Having already spent the money on Office 2016, I have had to revert to Office 2011, which
<em>does</em> run reliably on Apple's current OS. &nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thing is, there has been a Public Beta out for El Capitan for over 12 months now.&nbsp;<span>Microsoft should have seen this coming. What I can't figure out is why wasn't issues with Office 2011/2016 brought up by the testers or vendors with access.</span></p>

            <p>I wholeheartedly agree. &nbsp;I have a handful of developers that require the latest O/S to run Xcode for iPhone app development. &nbsp;Further, that is absurd to even suggest downgrading my operating system to accommodate an application that doesn't even fully work

<p>We are now on 10.11.0. &nbsp;You have had plenty of time to get this worked out, and yet you still want to bog down and sell buggy code and expect us to accommodate this lack of commitment to quality that Microsoft has toward there Apple products by downgrading
 or waiting for someone to fixe theses issues?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have worked with Microsoft for over 16 years throughout my career with various faux pas (Windows NT's Service pack 6 that went to 6a real quick, Windows "ME" and Windows Vista make me cringe, and then Windows 8.) &nbsp;How, or why, have the Mac's fallen into
 this lost-cause category? &nbsp;It's a darn shame. &nbsp;I have had an open ticket for over 6 weeks now that has had barely any attention. &nbsp;When Outlook 15.0 was released, I could not send an email to save my life without having Lync (my Fortune 100's main means of
 online communication) cause both it and Outlook to run processing up the wall at showing both apps cpu usage at 150-160% usage in Yosemite 10.10.0 through 10.10.5. &nbsp;If this were a PC problem, they would have jumped right in and responded immediately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And then there is Skype for Business, Lync's replacement. &nbsp;Still, no Mac client. &nbsp;<em><strong>But, they just released 14.2.1 for Lynx. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">BLESS THEIR HEARTS.</span></strong></em>&nbsp;It fixes the issue with crashing itself
 with Outlook 15.14.2, but it's a buck short and a day late. &nbsp;Why not spend the time developing a modern, 64-bit Skype for Business client that is fresh, new, and isn't being bug chased all over the Mac universe? When Lync was coded (or office 2011 for that
 matter), Microsoft also neglected to take into account that the HFS+ unicode file system will allow back-slashes in its file system, so when a mobile user account (roaming AD, essentially), it creates the user's home folder in the context &nbsp;"DOMAIN\user". &nbsp;I
 discovered this over a year and a half ago, reported it, and it still remains unaddressed. &nbsp;I ultimately had to go through my entire Apple OS X infrastructure and change the default way that it creates the users home folders so it wouldn't crash each time
 an end user would try to send an instant message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bottom line, I am almost ready to really attempt to convince my company to drop Office for Mac. &nbsp;I am rock-solid stable when I use native Apple Mail, Calendar, etc. instead of Outlook and discuss using an open source Office-like suite, all for free and without

</p><p>I do not work for Microsoft. Yes, El Capitan is now in production, less than 3 weeks after the final beta was released to developers. Major software that takes years to write can't be rewritten in less than 3 weeks. Apple released many different beta OS
 versions since last June. Sure, developers can try to re-write based on the ever-changing betas, but the final gold master was only out less than 3 weeks before Apple released it to everyone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>An entirely new operating system is a MAJOR change. We're not talking about little cell phone or tablet apps. Microsoft Office apps are large and intricate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft has already released updates to Microsoft Office that address some of the problems. One was released just yesterday for Excel and Outlook 2011. For Pete's sake, give Microsoft a reasonable opportunity to rewrite their applications for an entirely
 new operating system.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Please keep in mind this is a user-to-user forum. Microsoft provides the forum, but that's about all. If you want your comments to get to Microsoft employees, this isn't a communications channel for that purpose. Moderators are just fellow users and volunteers.
 We don't work for Microsoft and we don't speak for Microsoft. We (participants in this forum, me included) don't know how or why Microsoft sets their priorities any more than you do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are correct that Microsoft Office apps, although freshly written in Cocoa are 32-bit, not 64-bit applications. I don't know why they aen't 64-bit or multi-threading, but I assume making them 64-bit and multi-threaded involves more work (costs more).
 As is painfully obvious, Office 2016 apps were cut down to the bone feature-wise. As updates are released, it is also obvious that Microsoft is chipping away at getting their Office applications into more robust applications that run in El Capitan as well
 as older Mac OS versions. Microsoft still has a long way to go, though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now, my opinion is that Microsoft Office 2011 is the most robust office suite of any brand that runs in Mac OS X. I think the next most feature-rich suite is LibreOffice version 5, but it is a far cry from Microsoft Office 2011 or 2016, so unless your
 needs are modest, it won't suffice. My own needs are such that LibreOffice just doesn't make the cut.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are many specialty applications that you can use as alternatives to Microsoft Office 2011 desktop, but they tend to be "one shot wonders." Prezzi makes dizzying presentations. Google and Microsoft Office web apps are both pretty good and are great
 for co-authoring, but most people rarely do that. Office web apps are feature-sparse otherwise. There are several word processors that can hold their own. Even though I have Microsoft Word, I often use TextEdit when &nbsp;I know my documents will contain only text
 and I don't need any fancy formatting or other ingredients. TextEdit never seems to get the credit it deserves. There's nothing I know of that competes strongly against Microsoft Excel.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I think part of the frustration here is that we've been pushed into this annual subscription model with Office 365, and Mac users have yet to get anything good out of the deal. Until this year, we were paying an annual subscription just to use the same Office
 2011 we'd been using for years. Now we finally get something new and it doesn't work on the current OS X. And while yes, the gold master just came out a few weeks before launch, the OS has been in beta for several months. By the time you get to the gold master,
 you're looking at tweaks before going live, not major overhauls of which Microsoft can claim to be completely unaware.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The entire selling point for Office 365 -- particularly since we're paying the same amount as Windows users but don't have apps such as Access, Publisher, or even a fully-functional OneNote -- was that we'd always be up-to-date and the subscription model
 would enable Microsoft to stay ahead of the curve and release fixes and even new features with ease. The current problem with El Capitan and Office 2016 puts into stark reality the fact that this promise isn't being kept.</p>

                    When I take a picture in onenote on my s9+ it sets the aspect ratio to 3:4. Is there any way of taking the picture as 9:16? That's what my camera default to when used outside of onenote. My old phone used to do this fine. Can't seem to find settings for

<p><span>Hi <strong>Jim</strong>,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As we’ve tried checking multiple devices at our end, the option to be able to change the aspect ratio when taking in pictures directly in OneNote for Android is unavailable. This seems to be working as design in
 the current version of the app and would capture a photo based on the default settings within the camera of the OneNote for Android application. Having said, you may post this as feedback to our

<h2>            User blocked from sending email outside organisation because he is suspected of sending spam</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We use Office365 and have a user who has been blocked from sending email outside our organisation, because the user account is being suspected of sending out spam email. We have had to unblocked the account via the Protection action center 3 times already
 over the past 5 days. After unblocking, it can take up to 2 hours before he is able to send email again outside the organisation. This is not acceptable in our business sector.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We of course have verified that the user is not sending out spam emails. How can we prevent his account from being blocked from sending email outside our organisation?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Evelien</p>

            Hi Evelien,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your post. A user will be blocked from sending any more emails because continuously sending emails from Office 365 that is classified by the server as spam. If a user is blocked, you can unblock this user in the Office 365 action center as you know.
 But for spam policies and security reason, it’s infeasible to set a user’s account prevent from being blocked by server forever. If it’s inconvenient for you and you really want such related settings, it’s recommended to
<a href="https://office365.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">submit a feedback</a> about it and your comments will be valuable. Thanks for your time and understanding.<br />
<br />
Besides, not only can individual users be blocked by the service, but specific web sites, domains, and IP addresses can be blocked as well. In some cases, domains or web sites can be added to a block list just because they appear in a spam message. As the Office
 365 admin, you can try to get users, web sites, domains, and IP addresses removed from third-party block lists (You can get the information about third-party block lists by referring to the bottom part of

            <p>Hello Divyang Paterl_1317:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to the forum regarding the issues you are having syncing your Facebook account.&nbsp; This general sync error can be caused by several things.&nbsp; Please try the below suggestions and let us know if any progress is made.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The first thing we would like you to do is clear your cache. Go to settings &gt; applications &gt; Internet Explorer &gt; delete history.</li><li>Once you have done this we would like you to try and sync your Facebook account via both Wi-Fi and Data separately. Go to settings &gt; Wi-Fi &gt; ON and settings &gt; data/mobile &gt; OFF. Then go to settings &gt; emails + accounts &gt; tap and hold the Facebook account
 &gt; select sync. If you still receive the error, turn Wi-Fi off and data on and try again.</li><li>Next, we would like you to set the date and time on your phone manually. Go to settings &gt; date + time &gt; set the automatic setting to OFF &gt; set the current date, time and time zone. Once you have done this, go to settings and sync your Facebook account again.</li><li>Next, we would like you to reset the password for your Facebook account, make sure the password is 13 characters or less.&nbsp; Once you have changed the password for this account, remove the account from your phone and add it back with the new password.</li><li>The final thing we would suggest is to delete the Facebook account from the phone and the Facebook app from the phone. After you have done this, sign into accounts.live.com with the Microsoft account on your phone. From here, go to account settings and
 click on preferences. Here you will have the option to link and unlink accounts. Make sure that Facebook is not currently linked. Once you have done this, go back to the phone and sync your Microsoft account and then add the Facebook account to the phone.
 If the account now adds, go back to the website and link the accounts again.</li></ul>
<p>Please let us know if you have any other questions or concerns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark W.</p>

                    On 13.4.17 my free Word for iPad updated (to 2.0) and will no longer allow edit or save functions. Tried reinstalling app from cloud but no change. Anyone any ideas? Is this a glitch in the update, as it worked fine last time I used it?

<h2>            How to transfer or copy contacts from Lumia 900 to X3-02.5&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have just bought a Nokia X3-02 in the nice blue color. I really like this phone - I think I am going to like it a lot when I am going to use it. I am not a dedicated smartphone user as many other are - I only use my cellphone for sms and speaking. But
 I have had a Nokia Lumia 900 for the last 4 months. A very nice phone also and I liked Windows Phone. But that phone is overkill for me - too big and too heavy. But one thing I liked very much about it was that it could syncronize directly, wirelessly with
 Windows Live e-mail account. So I made a Windows Live e-mail account, just for phonenumbers to be used in my contacts in my phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it somehow possible to syncronize contacts in Nokia Suite with this Windows Live e-mail account?? And then to syncronize with my pretty little new cellphone? Hope to get an answer soon - would like to start using the phone...&nbsp; :-)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or is it possible in other ways to copy the contacts from Lumia 900 to X3-02.5?? I tried phone switch, but it gives a message on X3-02.5, that this is not supported by Lumia 900. I also tried to export contacts from Windows Live, and send to X3-02.5 via
 bluetooth. I receive it at X3-02.5, but the file format is not supported. In Nokia suite I tried import, but Nokia suite only supports vcards....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope somebody can help me....&nbsp; :-) I hope it is somehow possible to use the Windows Live account more or less directly.</p>

<p>Hi. Thanks for the answer. But I don't have Microsoft Outlook - unless it is there somewhere in Windows 7, as a part of Windows 7. I am using Thunderbird and I was actually trying to import the contacts from Windows Live mail into a new address book in&nbsp;Thunderbird
 - but it didn't work very well. But I am also thinking that maybe it would be better to use a empty e-mail program (if via e-mail program is the best work around), in order not to mix the phone contacts with my e-mail contacts.</p>

<p>Oh ! You may consider using Google contacts. i am not sure since haven't used it for such purpose..but I think it gives different options for the Sync.. From phone to Google contacts or vice versa... so chck if after uploading you can change this setting
 and get it back from Google contacts to the new phone ...</p>

<p>Ok let me see if I understand correct: Are you saying that Google contacts may be compatible with my new cellphone, but Windows Live mail is not compatible with my new cellphone (as I have already found out). Then I could of course hope that Google Contacts
 can import from Windows Live mail and then test, if I can "connect" Google contacts and Nokia X3-02.5 somehow.</p>

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Ok - I have tried to login to google and to import the contacts from the csv file I made from Windows Live mail. But I cannot get the cellphone to sync with server. I tried these two server adresses: m.google.com and
<a href="http://syncme.se/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://syncme.se/</a>&nbsp;but when I try to sync I get the error message that these settings are not valid for syncronization (or something like that - doesn't remember the exact words).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Am I doing something wrong? Should the phone be connected to the computer with USB, when I do it? Can Nokia Suite import contacts from Google Contacts??</p>

            Hi peterostrowski1 
<br />
<br />Rest assured, uninstalling and re-installing Office/Excel will not affect your personal data at all
<br />
<br />However, before you do that, please follow these steps to perform a full repair of your Office installation . . .
<br />
<br />Open Control Panel - Programs and Features
<br />Click Microsoft Office in the list of installed applications
<br />At the top, click 'Change'
<br />On the resulting dialog, click 'Repair' - choose the Online Repair, it is a comprehensive fix
<br />
<br />That should fix any issues with your Office Installation . . .
        </p>

<p>Hello Richard,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Since you performed the possible ways to free up space on your phone, it is best that you do a hard reset. The
<strong>System &amp; reserved</strong> and <strong>Apps &amp; games</strong> storage that consume a lot of space on your phone can only be reduced by doing the said method. Take note that hard reset will erase all files stored on your phone including applications,
 text messages and media files. Please don't forget to <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17232/windows-10-mobile-back-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">create a back up</a></strong> to avoid any data loss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To do a hard reset:</p>
<ol>
<li>On Start, swipe over to the All apps list, then select <strong>Settings</strong>.
</li><li>Select <strong>System </strong>&gt; <strong>About </strong>&gt; <strong>Reset your phone</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Feel free to post back if you have any questions.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Word 2013 won&#39;t allow me to edit or add a graph&#47;chart</h2>
                    <p>As stated above microsoft word 2013 won't allow me to edit or add a graph/chart in any document i open, even if I create a new one. This has never happened before and it has always just worked fine before,I haven't done anything new or checked anything different,
 the only thing i haven't done is make graphs for awhile but that should not just mean it stops working all together. When I click on "insert a graph" -&gt; i get a window that lets me choose the graph/chart i want but when i click ok the window refreshes and
 continues like that repeatedly, i can never get past "ok", copying graphs works but i can never edit the data on the graphs, i click "edit data" but nothing happens. Also restarting my laptop did not solve the problem.
</p>
<p>Plus when i tried to do the same on Microsoft Powerpoint it no longer works either but i get a message "The program or feature "\??\C:\ProgramFiles (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office15\EXCEL.EXE" cannot start or run due to incompatibility with 64-bit versions
 of Windows." I'm very confused and this has never happened Before. Does anyone know how to fix this?</p>

 speakers - properties - advanced - and in default format select ( 16bit 96000hz ) apply, and you will have sound. This solution is also for microphone, just go in recording devices - right click microphone - properties - advanced -&nbsp; and in default format select
 (16 bit 96000hz ). with this you will also solve audio problems in Skype. I know that this is temporary solution, but I'm guess that guys from Microsoft will solve this problem in the future.</span></p>

            <p>I too have been having a heck of a time with Windows 10 and VIA audio. I have sound, but I am unable to use the sound equalizer or subwoofer bass boost. I make changes but the sound remains the same. I use both the new windows 10 equalizer menu, and I've
 also tried the VIA audio deck tray program. The sound is terrible and I can't adjust any settings. Very frustrating for someone that likes good sound. Please fix this Microsoft!</p>

 Book.&nbsp; The issue seems to be related to the fact that my Surface Book uses Exchange ActiveSync for its email identity while my Thinkpad is loaded with the older POP/SMTP email identities.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">I hope this observation may be of some help to you.&nbsp; I myself have given up on having more than one calendar on the Surface Book.&nbsp; Upon attempting to create one through the "folder" tab I receive a message stating that one cannot
 create a calendar for an Exchange ActiveSync account.&nbsp; No further help seems apparent or available.&nbsp; If someone else has found a solution to this I would be open to trying again.</p>

            Hi - as far as I know - yes (I cannot test it because I do not have any DRM, lost or otherwise myself) but MS tools like this will not usually run if they are unsuitable for your system - you would be alerted.&nbsp;Download the file first and then run it from
 the second link using Internet Explorer as advised (although probably Edge would work too) - I have passed this link on to other W10 users and not been informed of any issues but do please let me know if there are any. - Thanks, Ric.

                    I just received an email from my own work account email, stating it was a trojan virus hacking my email account. It included a password that is the exact same as my password only missing 1 digit. It stated I should deposit bit coin currency into an account
 or else it'd release a video of me 'satisfying myself' filmed off my own phones camera to all my accounts etc. It said I recently logged onto an adult site, which I didn't, but it also said it would have access to all my accounts so now I'm worried it's on
 my phone. I did a virus scan of my phone but nothing has turned up, how serious do I take this? Or what should I do?&nbsp;

<br />
<br />Hello Deeue
<br />
<br />This is a running phishing scam that you can safely ignore with the following precautions.
<br />
<br />What has happened is that details about your email address/password were taken from a breached database that was hacked from a websilte where you subscribed at one point in time (could have been from something years ago). This is the most common source where the spammers are getting your email address but could be from anywhere.
<br />
<br />What you need to do is
<br />
<br />- ensure that the password is not the one that you're still currently using &lt;anywhere&gt; - i.e.. your email account, financial institutions, Amazon, PayPal, Netflix etc etc etc
<br />- make sure that you don't use the same password on any of these accounts
<br />
<br />You can ignore and delete the messages. FWIW, as of this morning, I've now rec'd 433 of these things and usually get several a day for various of my email accounts.
<br />
<br />Some background info on this can be found at
