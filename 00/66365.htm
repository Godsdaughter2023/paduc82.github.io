<h2>            My Documents are no longer found in &#34;This PC&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi There</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a recent Windows 10 update, all of my documents, music, and pictures are no longer found in "My PC". Instead, I have to manually search for them by going to (C:) - Users - My User Profile - Documents. Furthermore, all new files I save are now being
 saved to onedrive by default rather than the hard drive/my user profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how to return it to as it was before, and to prevent new files from being saved to onedrive by default?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many Thanks</p>

            Hi JR101A, this is happening much too often at the moment, I think you are logged into a temporary account . . . 
<br />
<br />Please open Windows File Explorer 
<br />Navigate to C:\Users 
<br />Do you see your user profile appended with your computer name 
<br />Open that folder and check inside Pictures, Documents . . . etc. and see if your files are there 
<br />
<br />If your files are there: 
<br />
<br />Create a new user profile with Admin privileges 
<br />Log into the new user profile 
<br />Copy all your data from the old profile to the new profile (Documents Library, Pictures Library . . . etc.)

            Hi JR101A, I am really glad you found all your files . . .
<br />
<br />Where were the files located?
<br />
<br />If they were located in a folder named as your user profile appended with your computer name, then you are signed into a temporary profile - this is an error that has been happening with Windows Update
<br />
<br />If you feel you are not signed into a temporary user profile, you can simply put your files back to where they are supposed to be in your current user profile !

<p>Open the Contacts and select all, (Ctrl+A), then File | Print. This however will use a lot of paper. To conserve, open the Contacts and File | Export | Choose CSV format and follow the prompts. Save it wherever you like and print from there.</p>

<p>Here what I did on my Win 10 machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder if the same thing might work for you.</p>
<p>
</p><pre><p><span>I used a 4GB USB 2.0 flash drive.
Before starting the creation process, I performed a full format of the USB 2.0 flash drive just to be sure it had no bad sectors on it.
	Of note: 
	The creation process will format the target USB flash drive but I don’t believe it will perform a                      “full” format before copying files to it.
	The creation process will make the target USB flash drive bootable.
Now, on to the creation process !
Insert the target USB flash drive
Start \ run \ Control Panel
Click “Recovery”
Click “Create a recovery drive”
Click “Yes” to the “User Account Control” dialog, is you get one.
Uncheck the box that reads “Back up system files to the recovery drive.”
Click on the “Next” button.
On the next dialog, select the USB drive you want to become the recovery drive.
Click the "Next" button.
You should now see a dialog that warns you this procedure will delete any files on the target USB flash drive that was chosen.
Click “Create”.
Click the “Finish” button,
Of note:
	Be sure to eject the newly created recovery drive properly, so as to get a “Safe to Remove” message from the OS.
	This PC / right click on the newly created recovery USB flash drive \ click on “Eject”.</span></p><p /><p /><p><br /></p></pre>

</p><p>You can use a CD or DVD for a System repair disk.&nbsp; I recommend a CD because CDs are much more standard.&nbsp; I use them frequently and they rarely fail.&nbsp; If your system repair disk is not successful, it is likely that either your system is too corrupted or the
 hard drive is failing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not believe Win7 will make a repair disk on a USB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your system is one that does not have a DVD/CD drive, that is another story.&nbsp; In that case buy yourself an external DVD drive.&nbsp; About $30.</p>

</p><blockquote>I purchased a new flash drive thinking that I could create either a system repair disk or a system image onto it.&nbsp; When I try the system repair disk option, it will only allow me to create to my the file
 to my DVD drive.&nbsp; It does not recognize my flash drive at all.&nbsp; When I try the system image option, it recognizes my flash drive, but Windows says that it is not a valid destination.&nbsp; It keeps pushing me to my DVD drive as the only valid choice.&nbsp; I have hardly
 anything on my hard drive, and I made sure to get a flash drive that was twice the size of my Windows system files and personal files.&nbsp; Is there any way to get either a system repair disk file onto my flash drive in a Windows 7 environment?&nbsp;<strong> What is
 better: A system repair disk or a system image?&nbsp;</strong> I really don't understand what the difference is between the two.&nbsp; I have previously tried making repair disks using my DVD drive, but they would never complete without error.&nbsp; I was hoping the flash
 drive would solve my problem, but it has only created a new one for me.&nbsp; Could somebody please help me to figure this out?

<p>A System Repair disk is for basic repair options (Startup Repair, Command Prompt, etc.)&nbsp;for your operating system and is nothing to do with backing up your data or creating an existing System Image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This explains what&nbsp;it is and does:</p>

<p>_______________________________________________</p>
<p>
</p><p>A System Image is&nbsp;just that; an image of the installed operating system, the installed programs, your data, etc. etc. and should be saved to an external hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It makes an easy way to reinstall everything is you ever need to after file corruption or hard drive failure</p>

<p>Why do't you just make a CD/DVD and a flash drive that has an entire Windows SP1 installation on it instead of just a repair disk?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your system becomes afflicted some day (won't boot, etc.) do you think a repair disk (on CD/DVD or USB) will help you more than a genuine Windows SP1 installation CD/DVD or USB?&nbsp; Which do you think will be more valuable and useful?&nbsp; Do you think you will
 never have a need for some genuine Windows SP1 installation media?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've never made a repair CD/DVD or USB - I just make a bootable Windows SP1 installation DVD and a Windows SP1 installation USB and stick them in that box o' computer stuff.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For images, I use Macrium to make one a week keeping 5 weeks worth on an external USB drive (never a flash drive) and have a small USB thumb drive for booting Macrium also in that box o' computer stuff.&nbsp; When Macrium has an update, I refresh that bootable
 thumb drive and test it to be sure it boots and I can at least find/access my images.</p>

 then selecting as background image in the usual way. Hope this helps... Ric.</p>

                    Hi there! I recently built my gaming PC, and I named my user account: "Owen!". At the time, I did not know that java has a bug where if your username has a special character in it (eg "!") you can't use java. This would be fine if I could change my name,
 but in user accounts, there is no change your username option like most help pages have&nbsp;said. I have tried many different solutions to solve this but nothing has worked so far. Please Help!!!

            This is a good question. I would suggest you download Autoruns from <a href="http://www.sysinternals.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.sysinternals.com</a> and run it. After checking "Microsoft and windows entries" under options menu and restarting autoruns, disable whatever you find you dont care about uncheck from the windows explorer and internet explorer tabs in Autoruns. Please
 do not disable anything from drivers tab unless youare absouletly sure what you are trying to do.<br />
<br />
Restart the system in normal mode and check if you have the same issue. If it still reoccurs, disable the dll entry through autoruns only. It is definitely better way then deleting te file.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />
Have a great day.<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

                    I used my free upgrade disk from windows vista business to windows 7 starter with a new laptop, and now it's asking me for a new product key - the old vista business one on the sticker on the laptop is not recognised. What do I do?&nbsp;

<div>The Free Upgrades are all OEM licenses - and are ONLY valid on the

machine on which they are installed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The Free Upgrade was on a Like-for-like basis - so if you had Vista

<div>There are so many inconsistencies in your story that I have no idea

to begin.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This installation was done using a standard OEM_SLP Key - not a Free
Upgrade disk.</div>
<div>The Key is form a Hewlett Packard machine - this machine is a
Toshiba.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You will need to revert back to the original OS supplied with the 
machine,
using either a Retail Vista Business disk, or the manufacturer's Recovery
media.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Then you can use a legitimate Upgrade to get the machine to Windows
7.</div>

            I went into the shop first thing this morning. Different bloke, who was very confused as to why I'd been given this disk, but he was sure his colleague had his reasons. I made a bit of a fuss, and in the end he sent me packing with a copy of home premium.
 As much to shut me up and get me out of his shop as anything else I should imagine.

<h2>            Need help with US imported Xbox One &#40;110v vs. 230v&#41; Voltage issue. Converter&#63; Transformer&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I live in Sweden and have recently imported an Xbox One console from the US (the only available option at the time, as they were completely sold out everywhere) Anyway, I have the console and I have my stack of games, it's all there. The only problem I have
 is that I can't plug it in as there is a difference in voltage between the US and Sweden and I need to know what kind of converter or transformer to get and what it should say on it in terms of Volt, Wattage and Hz.</p>
<p>Microsoft support told me to get something called a "Same Voltage Power Supply", but I don't know what that is. I've talked to both the Swedish Microsoft Store and to the Swedish Xbox Support and neither of them could help me.</p>
<p>Will it work with a converter? Do I need a transformer?</p>
<p>Please help me out here. I just want to play my games. </p>

<p>You could look for a US to Swedish voltage converter or a step down transformer like a Goldsource® Step Up and Down Voltage Converter Transformer ST500.</p>

<p>Hi, I have the same problem and called 5 times the xbox support but they are not able/willing to help (I also got 3 different answers). You should try to convince ! crazy, isn't it?) the European support to send you the european power supply to replace yours.

 </blockquote> <p>Do you know why I came to you guys? Because I've been to Blizzard Support twice and they can't do anything about my game because it's on Xbox, they have no access to anything. Why can't you guys do anything about it either? It's been frustrating going back and forth to find both supports&nbsp;say they can't do anything and to contact the other. I don't know how I'm supposed to get my stuff</p>

            <p>In-game unlocks for loot boxes are done on Blizzard's side of things. If you purchased the Game of the Year Edition you should receive automatic access to those loot boxes. As you mentioned, the 10 free loot boxes aren't part of an add-on, which would be on our side of things.&nbsp;Be sure to provide proof of purchase to Blizzard support and let them know that we sent you to them with this information. Please keep us looped in with what they say.&nbsp;</p>

            No, there are no changes made on my computer prior to this issue and I never face this type of issue earlier. In my computer quick total security has already installed and quick heal technical support team helped me to get all documents (.pdf,.doc,.txt,
 etc). But no media content and software stored in my deleted drive &nbsp;recovered. I did not understand whether this is virus infected issue or hardware related issue.

<div>ntkrnlpa.exe: It is a kernel image file, located in system32 folder for Windows systems supporting PAE (Physical Address Extension). The process is the root program of Windows Kernel which facilitates various system services and essential components to
 system, without which the system fails to boot.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Note:</strong> Physical Address Extension (PAE): It is a memory extension feature of 32-Bit and 64-Bit processor systems (which are backwards compatible with 32-Bit) with 4GB or above RAM in 32-Bit operating systems with proper support for PAE.
 Due to PAE the system can make use of physical memory and the system performance increases.<br />

<h2>            Installation of .Net Framework 3.5 requires an installation of .Net Framework 3.5</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been trying to install .NET framework 3.5 on my computer. I already have 4.5, but a program that I want to use needs 3.5. Version 3.5 also include 2.0, so I'll need it for games, mods, etc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to install my program it says that it needs the .NET framework so I just go ahead and try to install .NET normally, by letting windows perform the task automatically. But I get
<strong>error 0x800F0906</strong>. So then I just try to install it manually by going to the Microsoft Download Center and downloading then installing it. I execute, with admin rights, the installer, but Windows Features pops up and says the installer itself
 depends on itself. It says that an app on your PC needs the following Windows feature: .Net Framework 3.5.&nbsp;I click on:
<strong>Download and install this feature</strong>. Then I get <strong>error 0x800F0906</strong>. again<br />

<p>
</p><p>-some form of "thanks"</p>
<p>
</p><p>-reason for error/issue</p>
<p>
</p><p>-hey read this (article)</p>
<p>
</p><p>-some form of "ask me anything if you need help"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway thanks man, i found out what was wrong. <strong>The Windows Update service was disabled.</strong>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But what I still dont get is: </p>
<p>Why would you need .NET Framwork to install .NET Framework? </p>
<p>
</p><p>also i think "Check if Windows Update Service is Enabled in System onfigurations in the Control Panel &gt; Administrator Tools" should be the first bullet in that help article</p>

            Hi Lonnie, <br />
<br />
To resolve this issue, please verify to us if you also have a Hotmail account added in your Live Mail, aside from yahoo and sbcglobal.net.<br />
<br />
Another one, we need you to provide us with 2 copies of the messages (.eml files) with photos that you cannot forward. To do this, here are the steps:<br />
<br />
1.Pull up your Live Mail.<br />
2.Drag the email that you are having problem with to your Desktop.<br />
3.Upload the email to the private data below.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
Windows Live Merelyn U<br />

<div>I do not have a Hotmail account.... I have SBCGLOBLAL which is now AT&amp;T the phone company at the time SBC went through Yahoo well still does my mail is loaded on my computer though YAHOO Mail then to my mail box which is Windows
 Live 2011.... I have found that if I go to Yahoo Mail I can forward my emails with not a problem at all with pictures in the body of the email.... But I am not able to do it with windows live I heard that this is a problem with windows Live and they are working
 on it but have not fixed it as of yet? I am still unable to forward any email that I receive with pictures in it....if the jpg file is attached to the email then it will forward but if the file is not attached it will not.... now since I do not have a Hotmail
 account does that mean that you are not able to help me?</div>

            Joseph B.... I have no idea what on earth you are talking about and it has nothing to do with my problem...&nbsp; I have not sent out any thing near that amount of emails with pictures... because it will not let me... you must have mixed me up with someone
 else... I said that I could not forward a email that I recived in the mail that has pictures in the body of the email not the files the pictures it will send the email with out the pictures in it... so the tex goes but not the pictures... so what does that
 have to do with a limit of how many I can send and have to wait until next month.... I am going nuts over this mess......

<div>Tine M... Moderator.... from your advice that I just read it seems to me that you have not read my earlier reply's... what I have found in my research is that the problem that I am having is not mine but Windows live 2011 ...
 that is that I AM unable to forward a message that I just received that has pictures in the body of the email that does not have a jpg file attached to the email it's self... I have found that if I forward the same email from Yahoo mail account it can be sent...
 also if I forward the same email from "Windows mail" that also can be sent... now from another moderator if I drag the email to my desk top then open up a new message and then I drag the email in to that email it will be as an attachment and most people will
 get it fine however people who have Hotmail will not receive it they will get the text but not the pictures...go figure...it is amazing to me that I can receive it but I can not forward it directly from windows live mail 2011... What I want to do is uninstall
<strong><em><u>"Windows Live Mail 2011</u></em></strong>" and put back on my computer"
<strong><em><u>Windows Mail".. </u></em></strong>I do use Windows Live photo gallery and I love that... but I hope that you realize your problem and get it fixed.... I have found that the Moderator's are not informed as to what is really happening to us who
 use the program... or I have not been exposed to one yet... </div>

            Hi <span>helpjean,</span><br />
<br />
<p><span>Error seems to be pointing at a non-Hotmail or non-Live email account configured&nbsp;with Windows Live Mail which attempts
 to send an email with pictures or photo albums. <br />
<br />
When Windows Live Mail sends pictures and albums, it automatically generates a photo album in Windows Live SkyDrive which is another service/feature available to those who signed up an account with Windows Live. This becomes a problem for non-Hotmail or non-Live
 accounts configured&nbsp;with Live Mail because their account can't connect to SkyDrive for the albums to be created.<br />
<br />
I'd recommend that you attach the files using <strong><span>Insert &gt; Single Photo</span></strong> in the ribbon menu.&nbsp;You still select multiple photos using that command but it won't be sent as an album, or an album won't
 be created in Windows Live SkyDrive.<br />
<br />
Another way is to attach the photos. It won't display the photos in the email, but it will be sent as attachments to the email.<br />
<br />
I also have additional questions for us to better settle your issue:<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>When you select all pictures in the folder, and then you click on
<strong><span>Email </span></strong>button in the menu bar, does the "Attach Files" dialog box appear?
</span></li><li><span>If yes, and you clicked on Attach, does the Live Mail client automatically open a compose box which contains the
 pictures to be sent? </span></li><li><span>Does the compose box contain any indication that the pictures will be sent as an album or will be have an album created
 for the pictures?</span></li></ul>
<span>I'd recommend you try the workaround first. Most of the time it works.<br />
<br />
<p><span>Thanks!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Hi Kathrina G. First I would like to thank you for your time and reply to my distress in Windows Live Mail 2011... I would like to tell you that I do not have any problems sending photos from my computer.. and to my surprise
 everyone gets my pictures that I send to them... Where I have the problem is .... in my email account where I use like I have said<b><em><u> "Windows Live mail 2011</u></em></b>" I am unable to<b><em><u> "forward"</u></em></b>
 a email that I have <span><span>received</span></span> from someone else that has photos in the body of the email that does not have an jpg attached to each photo... photo's only... Windows Live Mail 2011
 will not send those photos that are in the body of the email that I <span>
<span>received</span></span>.... Now if you could look at that and see what you could do to help me I would be very happy....</p>

    <title>Processor Speed and diagnostic test - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nasiecoon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Processor Speed and diagnostic test</h2>
                    Hello. This is just a general question nothing is wrong with my computer. I am wanting to run diagnostic test and processor speed tests. What would be a good program for me to use to do this in general across all processors as I also help my friends with
 their laptop programs. I have found this one (have not installed as of yet)&nbsp;https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Software. I have used this site when comparing processors as they have nifty charts that compare processors against each other and have found no problem.
 I however have not been able to find a diagnostic tool. Currently I personally use AVG driver update to find drivers that are out of date and I go to the products website to download the driver. I don't exactly trust downloading from 3rd party applications,
 I just use the antivirus as an extra line of defense and I have all these other applications I can use with my subscription so took advantage of that. I know Windows Defender can do this which is what I use and may continue

            Hi Nasiecoon 
<br />
<br />My name is Sarah Kong and I am an independent adviser that is here to try and help you with your issue.
<br />
<br />Normally the vendor of your PC has diagnostic tools in the BIOS.
<br />For example I have a Dell and when i boot into the BIOS there are hardware diagnostics tools i can run to make sure hardware is good.
<br />I used this awhile back and determined that my hard drive was faulty, replaced it and since then my Dell has been working great.
<br />Hope this helps.       
        </p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t sign into store from local profile in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>On Windows 10, I have a primary administrative user account that was previously local and is now signed in as a Microsoft account. All functions, including Store sign-in and app use and whatever else, work fine for that account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both of the secondary user accounts on the computer are still local, and in every case, no matter when I am in the Store or trying Cortana, or in Settings, or whatever, every single instance where I try to sign in as a Microsoft account for the secondary
 users, the dialog box appears for a half second and then disappears. And then I see the spinning cursor, which goes away when I move the mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no error message, just a fleeting glimpse of the sign-in box. </p>
<p>
</p><p>When I am signed on as the administrator, I can create new accounts using the Microsoft sign-in for those two secondary users, and then the Store, etc. works fine for them -- but that's useless, because all their info (apps, settings, photos, documents,
 data, etc.) is linked to their local sign-ins.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somehow, I have got to find a way to sign into the secondary users Microsoft accounts from within their local profiles, which is what I initially did for myself when I set up Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen numerous postings with this "disappearing log-in window" problem. What now?</p>

            <p>This is a significant issue that has us completely locked out of being able to fully use two of our user accounts. I've seen the same issue mentioned in other online help requests but so far no solution has presented itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's clearly some kind of a bug, because there are numerous places in the Windows operating system (Store login, System Settings, etc.) where one is presented with a link or button to login with a Microsoft account, but right now in every instance there
 is a brief flash of a login screen in the background and then it disappears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only exception to this is in my own administrative profile, which works fine and was successfully switched from a local to a Microsoft account when we upgraded to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My son is unable to work on projects he has in progress because the app store is completely inaccessible through his profile without the ability to sign in with his Microsoft account. He can't use my account/profile because all of his documents and data
 are located in his profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>

            <p>I finally found a workaround, and it was a bit of a pain but not awful. It took awhile, but it all works now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to create two new user profiles for my kids in the accounts settings area (windows key+"i" &gt; accounts &gt; family and other users &gt; add a family member). Even though each kid already had a "local" account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then we had each kid sign in to their newly-created profile with their Microsoft account one time. That automatically creates all the basic folders, settings, etc. for the profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, going back into my own administrative profile account, I went to windows menu &gt; this PC &gt; C drive &gt; users, and for each kid's "old" profile there (the old local ones), I double-clicked the profile folder, and when it opened, I highlighted all the folders/files
 that were inside it (documents, pictures, etc.), clicked control-c to copy them, went back a level to the users again, single-clicked the "new" profile folder to highlight it (but not open it), and typed control-v to paste all of those files from the old profile
 folder into the new profile folder. I said "yes" to replace what was already in there when it asked, since the ones I was putting there were the legit ones replacing the stock empty ones that had just been created a few minutes before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This basically created a duplicate new user profile for each kid, with all their photos, etc. inside. Of course I then had to tweak the settings by logging in as each kid (re-assign a desktop photo or theme, profile photo, relink google and gmail by logging
 into chrome to sync, etc.), so that was tedious. </p>
<p>
</p><p>But then when I was finally sure the new profiles looked and behaved just like the old -- and, most importantly -- we could now sign my kids into app store, cortana, all the expected things, and I doublechecked everything to be sure (!!), I got rid of the
 old profiles by going into the same accounts &gt; family and other users settings area and deleting them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now it all works!</p>
<p>
</p><p>But be careful. When you've copied all the folders into the new profiles and etc., check and doublecheck all the data in the new ones before you delete the old. It's not as scary as it sounds, but you don't want to miss anything.</p>

    <title>Can see, but unable to connect to, Wireless Router using Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can see, but unable to connect to, Wireless Router using Windows 7 &#40;Toshiba Laptop&#41;</h2>
                    
<p><br />
I wonder if anyone can help me please.&nbsp; I have seen lots of issues with Windows 7 and Wireless Networks and I am also experiencing a problem similar to others.</p>
<p>I have a fairly new Toshiba 505-S6980 laptop running Windows 7 64bit version.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All was working well a couple of months ago, connecting wirelessly to my O2 Wireless 2 router (the Laptop has a REALTEK RTL8191SE wireless adapter card).&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also have a desktop running XP that I use to connect to the same router.&nbsp; Whilst on the desktop, I noticed several weeks ago that the router was set up with WEP security rather than WPA, so I decided to change the router to WPA.&nbsp; The Desktop PC was fine
 with this but the laptop complained and would not connect, failing authentication and just stating "Unable to connect to xxxxx".&nbsp;&nbsp; At the time I assumed it just couldn't handle the WPA authentication for some reason and decided that I'd probably turn it back
 to WEP at a later date to get it working again.&nbsp; At some point, I did remove an 'O2 Connection Manager' that had been installed when I bought an O2 3G dongle, in case it was confusing the issue but it made no difference.&nbsp; In the mean time, I tried connecting
 the Laptop using a wired connection and that worked fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However I have now (several weeks later) decided I wanted to use the Laptop wirelessly again so set the router back to WEP expecting this to work, but it didn't. As per with WPA, it does not get past authentication when I put the security key in.&nbsp; So, I'm
 trying to figure out the problem.........</p>
<p>What's happening;</p>
<p>1) The laptop CAN wirelessly see my router (and my neighbours), but just cannot connect.</p>
<p>2) I can connect using a Wireless USB Adapter on the same Laptop.</p>
<p>3) I can connect the Laptop to the router using a wired connection and there is no problem.</p>
<p>4) My desktop running XP can connect to the router wirelessly as WEP or WPA so router is ok.</p>
<p>5) It was working several weeks ago!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I have tried;</p>
<p>1) I have installed the latest REALTEK RTK8191SE driver.</p>
<p>2) I have tried turning security off on the router, no joy.</p>
<p>3) I have removed all network profiles on the Laptop.</p>
<p>4) I have tried it with Norton Virus Scanner and Firewall turned off (but haven't uninstalled it) but no help.</p>
<p>5) I have tried doing a system restore to the earliest possible point and no help.</p>
<p>5) I have uninstalled the wireless adapter and its driver in Device Manager......... Windows 7 then see's it after a reboot and re-installs it (using the default older driver) but this doesn't work.&nbsp; I have then re-installed the latest version from REALTEK
 to make sure it's up to date.</p>
<p>What is odd is that</p>
<p>1) it works ok using a USB Wireless Adapter</p>
<p>2) the internal REALTEK wireless adapter works to a point as it can SEE my router, just not connect</p>
<p>3) it fails authentication almost instantly</p>
<p>My suspicions are that a Windows 7 automatic update or the O2 Connection Manager has somehow screwed it up.&nbsp; I have uninstalled the O2 Connection Manager and have tried un-installing the automatic updates&nbsp; but there are loads of them and I'm not sure how
 far back I need to go.&nbsp; Also, because it fails the authentication straight away, it seems it's not giving it a chance to actually work.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any ideas on how I can proceed or had a similar problem?!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Is the flash drive getting detected on the computer?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Follow these steps to transfer the iTunes library to a flash drive:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. Plug your USB flash drive into your computer's port. Launch iTunes on your computer<br />
b. Go to the "Edit" menu within iTunes and click on "Preferences."<br />
c. Click on the "Advanced" tab to see where exactly your iTunes library is stored. It will be an XML file.<br />
d. Open your library by going to the "Start" menu, selecting "computer," clicking on the appropriate drive and browsing to the location of the file.<br />
e. Open a second window in "computer" and click on the icon for your flash drive. Drag and drop your library to the drive. This could take a long<br />
time, depending on the size of your library.</span></span></p>

<p>A nightmare for all Xbox users, I assume. Anyway, I just bought a 7-Day Xbox Live Gold and I redeemed the code, yet it seems I keep getting the same error code over and over. What should I do?</p>

            <p>Are you trying to purchase a discounted game from the Deals with Gold or get the free download for Games With Gold? &nbsp;If so then the reason you're getting that error code is because a trial pass is only good for some Gold abilities such as online multiplayer. &nbsp;A trial cannot be used to take advantage of gold only deals.<br /><br /><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-CA/xbox-360/xbox-live/error-code-8c210003" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">8C210003</a></p>
