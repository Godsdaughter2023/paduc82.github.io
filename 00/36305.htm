<p>Gatling Gears is a good game I'm surprised it doesn't have its own section on the forums. Or maybe I missed it somehow.</p>

<p>Xbox.com does not care about giving every game its own forum anymore (which would only make things easier in the long run for those trying to search for info about that particular game), they only care about giving popular titles of their own choosing a
 forum. If you have concerns about a specific Xbox game, you best go to a different website. Xbox.com is not the place to talk about all Xbox-related games anymore.</p>

<p>Since there is no dedicated forum to this game, I guess I'll post here. &nbsp;I'm looking to play co-op through the campaign on the hardest difficulty with someone. &nbsp;If anyone's interested please send me a message, AgentLebowski.</p>

    <title>CRITICAL_SERVICE_FAILED Blue Screen Error during Windows boot, no - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            CRITICAL_SERVICE_FAILED Blue Screen Error during Windows boot, no memory dumps created</h2>
                    <p>I'm getting the following error during windows boot:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/80530520-89d2-494f-b820-9de6131208f6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/80530520-89d2-494f-b820-9de6131208f6" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to diagnose the issue from a temporary fresh Windows install on another hard drive. &nbsp;I can't seem to find any memory dump files in the Windows directory of the broken installation. &nbsp;Using the Registry Editor in the temporary fresh Windows environment
 I have loaded the SYSTEM hive of the broken Windows environment and these are the settings I have under the CrashControl registry entry:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5d7db683-7171-4536-8674-46ce6969e10b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5d7db683-7171-4536-8674-46ce6969e10b" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Why might the memory dump files not be created when the blue screen error occurs?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Tom</p>

<p>William,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; This has been a continuing problem since v1703 when they started phasing out the computer browsing service. This has been driving me crazy since then. Sometimes a computer would appear in the Network list and sometimes it would not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;It appears you have the 4 key services running, SMB1 Client selected, and sharing established so I don't know what might be the issue. The only thing you could try is to see if your router can be set up as the "master browser" or if your NAS is on all the
 time, see if that can be set up as the "master browser".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck,</p>
<p>&nbsp; JohnD</p>

</li><li>

<p><span>netsh int ip reset</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>netsh winsock reset</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>Between both solution i made everything work.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Reset both pcs, at this point both pcs saw themselves under explorer network. The NAs were no where to be found&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;and the router still no joy</span></p>

<p>Hello Once again</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I added a new freenas server&nbsp; to my network. I connected it to the connection that was used by a buffalonas server.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>at this point i am back to the situation i was 3 days ago. NO pc and no nas under explorer network</p>
<p>&nbsp;Again I can map the shared drives and i could access them, I can insert the IP address of my freenas server in explorer and it will add it to the network environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I performed your method 2 again on both computers and rebooted the pcs, the nas and the router</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>ipconfig /flushdns</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>ipconfig /registerdns</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>ipconfig /release</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>ipconfig /renew</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>netsh int ip reset</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>netsh winsock reset</span></p>
</li></ul>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<p>
</p><p>to no avail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>is version 1809 so flaky? or what am i doing incorrectly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My HTPC seemed to be working fine yesterday with all the network attached devices showing under networks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop on the other hand after doing the same process as i did on the HTPC no joy. It just showed itself and the HTPC but no nas</p>
<p>
</p><p>When i turned off my HTPC last night it was working well. It showed itself, the laptop my 3 NAS the printers my phone my vera control, my router&nbsp; and my amazon alexa</p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning after turning it on It only see itself and my laptop my phone my vera control, my router&nbsp; and my amazon alexa in the network section but no NAS</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>ON both laptop and HTPC</p>
<p>If i insert in the top menu bar \\freenas \\buffalonas and \\freenas2&nbsp; they both appear in networks and i can access the sub folders</p>
<p>
</p><p>If i close explorer and re open it both freenas disappear from my network environment., this makes replication, synchronizing and backup difficult and impossible to automate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>What else can i do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your patience in the matter</p>

 error message with this code&nbsp;0xC0EA000A. I have been on the phone with Microsoft support and they gave me a new Windows 10 key and had me manually uninstall my old license and reinstall the new one through the cmd program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that my windows is activated I'm still having issues in my windows store. Games open to the splash screen logo and close immediately after. I cannot download any new programs without getting the same error code&nbsp;0xC0EA000A from when I was trying to activate
 windows. I believe the store hasn't updated to realise that my windows is activated. Possibly because I reactivated windows through cmd?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried running wsreset.exe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have uninstalled and reinstalled the store through powershell.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have re-registered the default windows apps through powershell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have reset the store in the app section.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have ran the windows app troubleshooter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of these seem to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            Hi,  FancyPup1999998
<br />
<br />My name is Maritza and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />What I can recommend is that you completely repair the operating system, but first you must backup your files, although with this method the data is not lost but it is a good idea to backup as a security measure, third-party applications if they are uninstalled, check this link.

    <title>invert keypad on W8.1 tablet&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ithinktfiam  say:</h3>
<h2>            invert keypad on W8.1 tablet&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm using a Dell Venue 8 Pro. The virtual keyboard has the keypad as it would be on a phone, with 123 at the top, rather than like every other keyboard, with 789 at the top. That means I have to stop and hunt and peck rather than use it automatically like
 I do with my keypad on the keyboard of my desktop PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It there any way to tell W8.1 to reset the keypad to normal?</p>

            <p>That's yet another problem MS doesn't seem to get: This isn't a big phone, it's a small computer. The keyboard should match a normal computer keyboard. You get it wrong yet again. You're only lucky that I find Apple and Google to be more problematic.</p>

            <p>"This is an interesting case where the physical keyboard convention didn’t matter as much, because people have become familiar and very comfortable with the order of number pads on phones, ATMs, remote controls, and other modern devices. 1,2,3 order is simply
 easier for the eyes to scan and the brain to process than any other order" is a rationalization for not considering two things: How people are getting to tablets and how easy it would have been to provide user options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the first side, who are the people buying tablets? Are they kids who only know phones? No, on the whole they're business people moving from desktops and laptops to tablets when mobile. What are we used to using? Oh, yeah, keyboards. How do keyboards layout
 the numbers? That shouldn't be too hard to find.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, you do realize that the virtual keyboard is virtual, right? You're not manufacturing it as you do with a phone or the keyboard for you desktop. It shouldn't be difficult to have a Settings option to allow the user to configure the keypad in either
 pattern depending on user preference. After all, you already provide multiple styles for the main virtual keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't need to "know more about this topic." You need to learn more about considering customer needs.</p>

            <p>Dear Microsoft.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The issue with the "numpad the wrong way round" has been discussed ever since the launch of Windows 8. Everywhere I read about this issue, the people asking are somewhat slightly to heavily confused that the numpad has been inverted in comparison to a computer
 keyboard) and just couldn't believe that there was no option to reverse it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I myself are part of that group, I still can't figure out, why Microsoft forces it's users to relearn a part of the keyboard.</p>
<p>If that's your spirit, why not force everybody to have a Dvorak-Layout, as it is said to be more efficient and less straining? The old qwerty-Keyboard has been optimised for mechanical typewriters so they don't jam when writing fast.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The comparison with ATMs, telephone and remote control Keypads has been made many times. I don't get that: I usually don't type a lot of Numbers on my remote, also ATM-Card Pins are hardly longer than 6 digits. And even If you can and do make calls with
 your W8-Tablet, I think one hardly dials any numbers: What about Adressbooks? In Skype we have Usernames that we click and call.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, what I often do, is enter Numbers (as part of passwords or Usernames or in Excel-tables) that I usually enter on a numpad. This now got nearly impossible, as I am very much used to the "normal" Layout of the Numpad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This whole discussion has been over and over, so somehow I have little hope that something will change (except me choosing a different OS at some point in the future?). However there is still a small glimpse of hope: Only recently I found out about Excel
 on the Iphone which can edit files stored on your Dropbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c5bc9cff-a471-4d39-9158-dbde1b586efd" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now look at that Keypad! According to your (=Microsoft) Logic, isn't it HORRIBLE to have a COMPUTER numpad ON A PHONE!?!?!?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't mean to verbally hurt anyone but I can't understand any of this, I simply can't!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think it isn't a big deal for Microsoft to allow users to set their preference in this matter, especially after the many negative feedback you've gotten. However it would be a big deal for users like me who are annoyed by the Numpad the wrong way round,
 so I ask again: Dear Microsoft, please, PLEASE make an Option to invert the Numpad back to "normal".</p>
<p>If you need to try to convert users to your belief, do it and have your numpad "the wrong way round" by default. Just hide something somewhere that those who do not want to be turned can still work with your Software.</p>

            Just wondering...did you try downloading the complete <br />
file to your desktop before installing?<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System <br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />
<br />
Download Paint.NET<br />
<a href="http://www.dotpdn.com/downloads/pdn.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dotpdn.com/downloads/pdn.html</a><br />
(left click the link to the right..."Free Download Now")<br />
<br />
Once you have the zipped file downloaded...open the <br />
zipped folder and drag/drop the install file&nbsp; "Paint.NET<br />
.3.5.10.Install.exe"&nbsp;on your desktop. Then left click to <br />
install.

<h2>            skype account no longer exists just minutes after logging out&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now have a number of skype accounts due to issues logging into the system that are perhaps linked to confusion about linking to a Microsoft account. I logged out of the most recent skype account I have been using and when I tried to log back in, the account
 name indicates that no such account exists. This is strange since I can search my name through another skype account and find that supposedly non-existant skype account of mine in the skype search results! Not sure how to gain access again though. Any thoughts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Skype &#39;userinfo&#39; URI broken</h2>
                    <p>Hello. I'm trying to create an HTML link to a Skype profile as follows...</p>
<p>
</p><p>&lt;a href="skype:username?userinfo"&gt;View Skype Profile&lt;/a&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, the link doesn't seem to work. The Skype app launches without loading the Skype profile in question. I've tried it in Chrome on my Android phone, so far. Any ideas?</p>

<p>Codes 643 and 656 are all i was given for the 2 failures.</p>

<p>I am barely a passable amateur when it comes to these types of things. I've restarted the computer and attempted to install again, I've ran Microsofts "Fix It" program, I've attempted installing the 2 updates seperately. I can't seem to find any useful information
 on the net. My question would be, is there a solution to this, do i NEED a solution or are they not important enough to worry about, i could just hide them... Just... Just HELP!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Frustration... To the point where incoherant mumbling is creeping in... Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1. Which Fixit did you try to run? </span></p>
<p><span>2. Did you try to install the update manually?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You may refer to the following article and check if it helps to fix the .net framework update installation.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/976982" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">You receive error 0x80070643, error code 0x643 or updates may be re-offered when you try to install .NET Framework updates when using Windows Update or Microsoft Updates</a>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You may also try to download the standalone package of the updates and see if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=27703" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Security Update for Microsoft Silverlight (KB2617986)</a></span></p>

    <title>Cannot validate my account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> justinerowinski  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot validate my account</h2>
                    When I logged onto the internet today, I got a screen from Microsoft asking me to validate my account. Unfortunately, the only options they provide are to receive a call or a text to an old phone number that no longer exists.&nbsp; So, where/how do I edit my
 account info to reflect my new phone number?&nbsp; There are no options for this within the Profile section of my account, nor anywhere else I can find. Thanks.

<p>
</p><p>Are you able to post an image of what you see?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>You can use a combination of PrintScreen (keyboard shortcut) and the freeware version of IrfanView to create images to be displayed in Microsoft forums etc. IrfanView can be downloaded
 here:<br />
</span></span><a href="http://www.irfanview.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://www.irfanview.com/</span></span></a><span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To create an image press the
<strong>PrintScreen</strong> key to place the image in your Clipboard. Open IrfanView and select Edit,
<strong>Paste</strong>. More often than not you do not want the whole screen, as it contains unnecessary detail and a smaller image enables the creation of a magnified view of the selection you wish to display. The steps that follow enable you to quickly edit
 the image.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Place the cursor on the top left corner of the area you wish to select. Depress and hold down the left mouse button and drag the cursor vertically down the left side of your selection
 and then horizontally to the right along the bottom of your selection until you reach the bottom right corner of the selected area. Release the left mouse button and select Edit,
<strong>Cut –area outside of the selection</strong>. Select Edit, <strong>Crop selection (Cut out)</strong>.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To post images in the Microsoft Community forums they need to be no more than 630 pixels wide so select Image,
<strong>Resize/Resample</strong>. Check the boxes before <strong>Preserve aspect ratio (proportional)</strong> and
<strong>Apply sharpen after Resample. </strong>These changes<strong> </strong>become defaults so that you do not need to apply them when creating subsequent images. Under
<strong>Set new size</strong> you will see the existing size. Change the width to 630 and click on OK. The height automatically adjusts.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To save your image select File, Save as. My preference is for JPG Format.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To insert your image in a post to the Microsoft forum click the button second from the right on the Reply toolbar, click the Browse button to locate the saved image and click the Upload
 button.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This approach is more involved than using the Snipping tool but can produce better results in many situations.</span></span></p>

            <p>This not only does not work, but creates a roundabout.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>As you suggested, I logged into my Microsoft Account, and then clicked on "Your Info".&nbsp; This led me to a new page where I had several options, one being "Manage Your sign-in e-mail or phone number".&nbsp; I clicked on that link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That took me to a screen that said the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Help us protect your account</span></p>
<p><span>Before you can access sensitive info, you need to verify your identity with a security code. How would you like to receive your code?</span></p>
<p><span>Call ‎(***) ***-**76‎</span></p>
<p><span>To verify that this is your phone number, enter the last 4 digits including 76, and click "Send code" to receive your code.</span></p>
<p><span>Last 4 digits of phone number</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You'll receive an automated call that will give you a code.</span></p>
<p><span>Text ‎(***) ***-**76‎</span></p>
<p><span>I don't have any of these</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://login.live.com/pp1600/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">I have a code</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the same screen that has come up several times before prior to logging on to my homepage (which is set for Outlook.com).&nbsp; As I mentioned in my question, the phone number Outlook has IS NO LONGER IN SERVICE.&nbsp; It needs to be changed.&nbsp; So how can I
 edit my phone info?</p>

</p><p>It looks like a scam!</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>It is always sensible in this situation to run a check for malware</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I recommend that you run Disk CleanUp or cCleaner to remove temporary files as this will reduce scanning times by security software. cCleaner comes with a Registry tool. Do not use this
 tool as like any registry cleaner it can lead to the creation of very difficult to resolve system errors</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please download and install Malwarebytes (freeware version for home users only -not the Trial version –watch the checked boxes whilst installing), update definitions and run in normal
 mode. Disable other security software whilst you are doing scans.<br />

            <p>Gerry:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your reply of the 12th apparently never made it into my email inbox. I have only become aware of it because "someone" from the Microsoft Community sent me a pro forma email asking if my problem had been solved.&nbsp; No, it has not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In answer to your reply, I already have Norton 360 to check for malware, etc.&nbsp; Further, I do not believe this is a scam because the problem exists within my Microsoft account, after I have logged in using my own password.&nbsp; And as Microsoft Support Engineer
 Subham Chaubey has suggested in his reply, even by going through the regular steps of logging into my account to edit my information, the only option that is available is to verify who I am through a phone number that is NO LONGER IN SERVICE.&nbsp; Why is that
 the ONLY option I have?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Can ANYBODY help me with this, or am I expected to live with the fact that Microsoft has out-of-date information for me and I will never be able to change it?</p>

</p><p>There are many reasons why security products fail. Norton Internet Security is not infallible and many experienced contributors to these forums recommend removal of Norton. I would not install Norton on any computer under my control but I stop short of recommending
 removal, unless I can see it causing system errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you carry out the checks I suggested. It is better to be safe rather than sorry.</p>

    <title>Logitech V270 Bluetooth Travel Mouse stops working - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Logitech V270 Bluetooth Travel Mouse stops working</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Bluetooth Driver Issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have an HP Elitebook 2760p running Windows 7&nbsp;Enterprise&nbsp;x64. Periodically my Logitech V270 Bluetooth Travel Mouse stops working. This morning it happened in the middle of reading an email. The issue appears to be driver related, maybe an interaction with
 the Wacom drivers for the touch screen/pen (I found someone with a different HP Elitebook that has similar symptoms when both Wacom and Bluetooth are installed and active, but his solution doesn't work for me).
</p>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When things are normal, I see "Bluetooth Travel Mouse" listed in Devices &amp; Printers and in "Bluetooth Devices." When it is its error state, I see "HID Compliant Mouse" in devices and printers, but not in "Bluetooth Devices." Sometimes completely deleting
 the Broadcom 2070 Bluetooth driver and&nbsp;re-installing&nbsp;clears the problem, but usually not. In the error state, the "HID Compliant Mouse" disappears from Devices and Printers whenever I turn off the Bluetooth Radio, and it instantly reappears when I turn the
 radio back on, regardless of whether the mouse is powered or not. The mouse also gives indications that it is unable to sync with the computer. Initiating a&nbsp;re-sync on the mouse causes the LED to blink, but it&nbsp;never&nbsp;goes solid to indicate that it has connected.
 Completely deleting the Broadcom 2070 Bluetooth driver (including removal from Programs &amp; Features) apparently does not delete the data on the "HID Compliant Mouse" even after it was specifically uninstalled in Device Manager before the Bluetooth driver was
 uninstalled (with Delete the Software option selected) and then was reinstalled from the most recent version available from HP support (April 2011). I'm beginning to think that some configuration data stored in the registry is not properly deleted upon uninstall.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Sometimes the problem persists for months and then suddenly disappears on its own. The most recent previous&nbsp;occurrence&nbsp;lasted for months and was only cleared when the IT folks had to restore my machine back to their standard Win 7 image, because it had
 some a boot file corruption problem.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any ideas? </div>
                </div>

<p>I guess I'm not the only one out there, the Season Pass for Wolf Among Us is - so far - not working, i bought it months ago and now, with Episode 2 out its not working, i still need to pay even if the game says i own the Pass, so is there any way to fix
 this?</p>

<p>Or better MS, when you are going to fix that? Its pretty annoying, waited months for the next episode and now i cannot play it thanks to a not working Season Pass xD</p>

<p>I am having the same issue. Not being able to find any real info on this specifically, I tried the Customer Support route. From the response that I received, it looks like it will unfortunately be a short waiting game for those who purchased a season pass
 as the marketplace is updated to allow us to download the episode from the game menu. But is should be ready for us soon.</p>

<p>I thought I would give you a heads-up (just in case you didn't get a chance to see the info in other threads)&nbsp;since MS did update their<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> service status</a> specifically about this season pass, so the
 good news is that they are working on fixing it and providing updates. Currently it is "Do you own a Season Pass for “The Wolf Among Us” and are still receiving a prompt to pay for “Episode 2: Smoke and Mirrors”? We want to let you know we are aware of the
 situation and are working hard to fix the issue. Thank you for being patient in the meantime. Check back in an hour for an update." 2/5/2014 10:38:21 PM CST I would keep an eye on that link because that will be the best source for an update of when the episode
 will be ready for us season pass owners.</p>

<h3> jasonblock  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t get Minecraft Windows 10 edition to authenticate my key</h2>
                    <p>In 2015 I downloaded and installed Minecraft for Windows 10 Beta...over the years it has become a full fledged version and was working fine....until one day it wouldn't load. After several phone calls to Windows Tech support, they were able to get Minecraft
 to load properly, but now the issue is, when I launch the game, there's an option to "unlock the full game" but when I click on it and input my credentials, nothing happens. Essentially, it's like the game is in demo mode and all the content I've purchased
 over the years (skin packs and environments) aren't available. I've contacted Windows support about a dozen times over the last 3 months trying to resolve the issue and no one can help. I've been escalated to tier 2 support several times, but they can't help.
 Now when I call, I'm told that I will get a call back, but it's all lies and no one calls. Just this afternoon, I was told a tier 2 tech would call me back in four hours...after 6 hours passed I called back and was told a tier 2 tech would be on the phone
 in 4 minutes....after being on hold for an hour and 24 minutes, I hung up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what I'm trying to do....I'd like to have all record of my purchase of Minecraft removed from the Window's store records, so I can purchase the game again and perhaps fix the "authentication" issue I having. Does anyone know what department to contact
 for this? In one of my calls, I actually spoke to the Microsoft gaming division, but they were no help either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When Microsoft support fails, what resource is available...who can you call???</p>

<p>Hi Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>on numerous calls, we tried that to no avail. We also tried creating a different account on the computer, but after logging into the Windows store and installing Minecraft, the same issue prevailed. Unfortunately, the purchase of Minecraft is linked to my
 Windows account, so even uninstalling the game from the computer, does not remove the account information from Windows store. So after reinstalling, the same issue is there because there's not a problem with the game, there's a problem with Windows recognizing
 I own the full version. That is an authentication issue, not a game issue. That's a problem with the Windows Store, not Minecraft or Mojang (the creator of the game), which Mojang was purchased by Microsoft Studios, so even if it was a game issue, it's still
 on Microsoft/Windows Store to fix</p>
<p>
</p><p>My apologies if I seem short...I've been dealing with this for 3 months. I've had several Windows "tech" people log into my machine and try all sorts of things.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>One suggestion seemed promising, which was to do a "restore" of my computer at a date in time prior to the issue, but when I tried that, i got an error "0x80070005" system restore could not complete because it could not access a file. When i tried explaining
 this error to the tech support people, i got no help there either.</p>

            Hey there, JasonBlock
<br />Welcome to the Microsoft Community forums. 
<br />
<br />Have you tried resetting the Windows Store App?
<br />
<br />If not, please try resetting it by:
<br /> - Going to Search (Cortana)
<br /> - Typing WSReset, 
<br /> - Right Click onto the search result to reset Store App, 
<br /> - Click onto Run as Administrator, 
<br /> 
<br />The command prompt should open and the command should be executed. The Windows Store App will then be reset. However, please be aware that any purchases through the store app is connected and saved onto your Microsoft Account. You can access these at <a href="https://account.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com</a>
<br />
<br />Hope this helps, 
<br />Regards,

            Hey there, JasonBlock
<br />Thanks for replying back.
<br />
<br />Can you look to see if you have got Minecraft showing under purchases at <a href="https://account.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com</a> ?
<br />
<br />If not, try logging into <a href="https://minecraft.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://minecraft.net</a> and seeing if you have a product key for Windows 10 edition of Minecraft. I had one sent to me after I had beta tested Windows 10 Edition. 
<br />
<br />If you have got one, follow the instructions to redeem it. 
<br />
<br />Hope this helps, 
<br />Regards,

            Yes, the record of my purchase back in 2015 is there. It was $9.99 for the Minecraft Windows 10 Beta. Over the years Minecraft has become the full version, and I've played it throughout that time. Not sure if the fact that I purchased the Beta has now
 caused some kind of issue???

            i went to Minecraft.net but I don't have any purchase history there. When I first purchased Minecraft Windows 10 Beta, it was all handled through the Windows Store. I never had to go to any Minecraft or Mojang website for anything

<h2>            Quick Launch and Start Menu Slow To Populate</h2>
                    Recently Quick Launch and Start Menu take an inordinate amount of time to populate and in the process of waiting my computer is locked. It can take up to a minute or more for them to populate when computer is first booted. I am running Windows Vista Home
 Premium Build 6002 with all patches and updates installed. My system is otherwise faultless(?) When I click on either, the "box" comes up but is empty for quite some time. This is annoying and troublesome.

 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above information
 you should be able to restore with no problems.&nbsp; If this started recently, I think this procedure will resolve the problem without you needing to go through this admittedly long troubleshooting process (though I would&nbsp;at least check out the end after the separation
 line for guidelines to improve performance and save space as part of a regular maintenance process).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp;
 Here's the procedure: </span></span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
</span><a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span></span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD (perhaps made on a different computer).<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
If using the disk, cd to C:\Windows\System32. Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here
 or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s) using </span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will want to schedule itself to run at the next restart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Answer yes and then reboot to run the program.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive
 and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning&nbsp;startup (Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Event Viewer –
 or typing eventvwr from the command prompt starting from C:\Windows\System32).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:</span></span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></span></a><span><span>.
 &nbsp;Look in the System section.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may be infected with malware. Try to run anti-malware programs (in safe mode with networking if<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">necessary</span>).&nbsp;To fix this problem
 (if it is a problem) download,&nbsp;install, and run the following two programs:</span></span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;and</span></span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span></span><a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/</span></span></a><span><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download,
 install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried
 it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials</span></span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html</span></span></a><span><span>
 (with the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time). &nbsp;You may also want to try the free Avira at:</span></span><a href="http://www.free-av.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.free-av.com/</span></span></a><span><span>
 and Avast at: </span></span><a href="http://www.avast.com/index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.avast.com/index</span></span></a><span><span>.
 &nbsp;Reboot after completing all the scans.&nbsp; You may also want to try the free OneCare at</span></span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></span></a><span><span>
 and let it run all the options (except the registry cleaner) because that’s good maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, try a clean boot&nbsp;</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 If the problem goes away then it's just a matter of tracking down the culprit causing the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the procedures in the article.&nbsp; Once found, delete, remove, deactivate, or uninstall it.&nbsp; Once done be sure to reset Vista back to normal status as
 explained in the procedures. If the problem occurs in clean mode then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Boot into Safe mode with networking and see if the problem occurs there.&nbsp; Either result helps us narrow down the search for the cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may be having troubles with your device drivers.&nbsp;</span><span>Go to Device Manager by going to start / search box and type device manager
 and enter and then double-click on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Check each device for a red x, yellow ! or white ?.&nbsp; These identify devices with problems (probably drivers, but also conflicts or something else).&nbsp; Click on each for further details and troubleshooting
 tips.&nbsp; If you need to get drivers (and you should do any you have time to do - they may help in ways beyond just resolving this problem), do so from the computer vendor or device manufacturer (NOT from Microsoft Updates).&nbsp; In fact, you should turn off automatic
 driver updates from Windows Update as follows:</span></span><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/</span></span></a><span><span>.
 Proceed as follows to get the drivers: </span></span><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Once you have the drivers, you can install them through Device Manager as follows:</span></span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html</span></span></a><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Let's test your hard drive and RAM for hardware problems:</span></span></p>
<p><span>To test your hard drive, check the manufacturer and then get the diagnostic utility from:</span><span><a href="http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html</span></span></a></span><span>
 (and/or get one from your hard drive or computer manufacturer if they have one available – it wouldn’t hurt to try both).&nbsp; If it fails the test, replace it.&nbsp; If it passes the test, then there's probably nothing wrong with it.<br />
<br />
You can also test your RAM at </span><span><a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.memtest.org/</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 If it fails, test each chip individually to find those that are bad and replace them.&nbsp; If it passes, RAM is probably OK.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the
 system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve or at least identify the cause of your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back with results from what you tried and copies of some of the scans and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned
 out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span></p>
<p><span>=====================================================================================================================================</span></p>
<p><span>Some basic maintenance that may help:</span></p>
<span>
<div>
<p><span>A great many things influence the speed and performance and available space of your system - mostly the existence of
 various files and what's loaded on the system.&nbsp; There are ways to handle this in Vista (and you should follow all the suggestions) - and of course the amount and type of RAM and the speed of your processor and motherboard (but I'm just going to discuss software
 solutions here - you can go to your computer vendor/manufacturer for hardware solutions if any are available (I, for example, am maxed out at 2GB RAM by my motherboard and there is no better motherboard available for my model of laptop but if your system can
 handle it, Vista 32-bit can use up to 4GB of RAM and the 64-bit verion can use even more).</span></p>
<p><span>One very important thing to begin – do NOT use any Registry Cleaner or Registry Booster software no matter what it says (scans will tell you you have thousands
 of errors just to get you to download and install the program or worse, buy it) or where you got it (even safe sites sell these products but they are not worth the headaches they can cause).<span>&nbsp;</span>Most do nothing of value and some can do great harm
 (to the point where you need to do a clean install to fix the problem – and that’s not even counting the fact that many such programs are actually malware in disguise).<span>&nbsp;</span>Vista keeps the registry clean on its own quite well and doesn’t need any
 help.<br />
<br />
To improve your speed, do Disk Cleanup using: </span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76073-disk-cleanup.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76073-disk-cleanup.html</span></span></a></span><span>.
 Delete as much as you feel comfortable doing – nothing deleted there will harm your system in any way.<br />
<br />
Also do an Optimization: </span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Optimize-Windows-Vista-for-better-performance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Optimize-Windows-Vista-for-better-performance</span></a></span><span>.
 Do all of the options.<br />
<br />
Go to Start / Search options and type in msconfig and enter and then double click on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Go to the startup tab and uncheck any program that you don't need starting at startup.&nbsp; That will probably be the majority of items there -
 if not most of them (some are needed like the AV program and Windows Defender but most are there to make opening the source programs faster and make you think they're more efficient).&nbsp; This will free up a lot of RAM and help a lot in making your system faster
 (though perhaps not so much that you'll be able to notice the difference - but maybe depending on how much unnecessary stuff is loading at startup).<span>&nbsp;</span>When I did this on my system I removed over 90% of the entries and suffered no ill effects – to
 the contrary, I noticed startup was quicker, reponse times when working were better and I could open more programs at the same time and still have no problems, and shutdown was also faster.<span>&nbsp;</span>Better still, download Autoruns<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx</a>
 which is much superior to msconfig and click on the Everything tab and do what was suggested above.<br />
<br />
You can accomplish some of these tasks (and more that aren't entirely related) by using</span><span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></a></span><span>&nbsp;(which
 also searches for malware).&nbsp; I do this on a monthly basis just as a part of normal maintenance and I suggest you do the same (except for the registry cleaner – no not even Microsoft’s own product is entirely safe and the product has been removed from the paying
 marked for reasons unknown though it’s still available here for now but probably not for long).&nbsp; Make sure you select a full scan - it will take a few hours (mine can take around 5-6) but can work in the background so start it when it has enough time to complete.<br />
<br />
You also want to have good AV and AS programs on your system (so no malware is operating in the background draining resources).&nbsp; Windows Defender is a good AS program.&nbsp; The new, free Microsoft Security Essentials</span><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx</span></span></a></span><span>&nbsp;is
 an excellent AV/AM program that has one of the least impacts on system performance and resources according to reliable sources and it does the job very well.&nbsp; If you're using MSE, you don't really need Defender (but you would with any other AV program).&nbsp; I
 would also suggest downloading </span><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></span></a></span><span>&nbsp;and
 running it monthly to catch anything that MSE/Defender might miss.<br />
<br />
If you follow this advice and do it periodically (at least monthly) then I believe you will have as fast a machine as it is capable of going given the hardware.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hi Allison,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We are glad to know that you have chosen Windows 8 and it’s great to see you on Microsoft Community!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As per the description, the Windows 8 Start Screen crashes when you scroll through the area from where some of your Apps have disappeared
 unexpectedly and it comes back to the most recently used program (Internet Explorer 10).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let me have a better understanding regarding this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What are you referring to by “Apps have disappeared unexpectedly”? Were some of the Apps unpinned/removed from the Start Screen without your knowledge?</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you made any recent changes on the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do you have any third party security program installed on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>4)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Are all the Windows 8 Apps working properly on the computer? Are you able to launch them without any issues?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Please make sure that the screen resolution meets these requirements. You can check this by:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Right-click the mouse from the desktop interface and select “Screen Resolution” from the menu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>

</span></span></span>Check the screen resolution shown there. It should be at least 1024 X 768.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also try changing the screen resolution and check the issue.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s try out some basic troubleshooting steps and check the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1: Run the Apps Troubleshooter and then update and sync the Apps.</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Step 1: Run the Apps Troubleshooter</span></b></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Let’s first run the Apps Troubleshooter and check if that helps. The Apps Troubleshooter is an automated tool which we have developed
 to address a number of known issues that can prevent the Apps from running properly. This troubleshooter automatically fixes some issues, including suboptimal screen resolution, incorrect security or account settings etc.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 2: What to do if you have problems with an app?</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Click on this link and follow the steps given in it to update and sync the app license:</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If this failed to fix the issue, then let’s check if this is caused by any software conflicts in the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: Perform a Clean Boot.</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We also need to perform a clean boot on the computer to check if the issue is caused by any software conflicts. A clean boot helps to
 eliminate software conflicts and to determine what is causing the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Perform a clean boot on the computer by following the steps given in the link:</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow the “Step 3: Reset the computer to start as usual” under Windows 8 to
 reset the computer to start as usual from the above link.</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If this did not fix the issue, you can also try updating graphics card drivers following this method.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            1) All of my microsoft office apps are gone. The space where they're supposed to be located is just empty.&nbsp;
<div>2)/3) The only new change would be norton being installed onto it. Does windows 8 not use virus protection software?</div>
<div>4) All the apps work perfectly fine though.</div>

<h2>            Snipping Tool with Keyboard Only &#40;No Mouse&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I am looking for help in using Snipping Tool with only a keyboard (no mouse). Is this possible? I am thinking of people who cannot use a mouse due to physical limitations. I know how to make a hot key to start the program. Getting into the program is easy,
 but once it is open, I cannot figure out how to select a portion of the page (without a mouse).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already know you can use PrtScn to copy the entire page. I'm looking to copy just a small portion of the page with Snipping Tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much!</p>
