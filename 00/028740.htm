<h2>            Ms Project 2010-Peak Units percentage calculation</h2>
                    What is the formula used in MS project&nbsp;to calculate the Peak Units % ? I have only two tasks and the percentage value is changed from month to month.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>For any minute in the plan, Peak=Work (done during that minute)</p>
<p>Then for any larger slice of time, Peak is the highest peak number for all the minutes of that period.</p>
<p>This is calculated task by task (or to be precise, assignment by assignment) o whether you have 2 tasks or 10000 is not relevant.</p>
<p>Greetings,</p>

<p>RKBNAIR,</p>
<p>Your best bet is to add the Peak field as a column in your view (Resource Usage or Task Usage). Then hover your mouse over the field heading. A small drop down will appear that makes it very easy to get to the help file on Peak Units.</p>
<p>For reference, Peak Units can vary from minute to minute, hour to hour, week to week, etc. depending on resource loading and task scheduling. How it shows up on the timescale depends on how finely tasks are scheduled and the display timescale used. I suggest
 you set up a few example tasks and play around with them a bit. It will help you get a good feel for Peak Units.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>John&nbsp;</p>

    <title>xlicons.exe contains macros&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joeu2004  say:</h3>
<h2>            xlicons.exe contains macros&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I started Excel by clicking on its Quick Launch icon on the desktop toolbar.&nbsp; Immediately after Excel started (displaying a new worksheet), I got the message:&nbsp; "...\xlicon.exe contains macro".</p>
<p>What's up with that?</p>
<p>In part, the message is the result of my macro security level (medium).&nbsp; I clicked on Disable Macros, then exited Excel.&nbsp; When I restarted Excel the same way, I did not get the "contains macro" warning.</p>
<p>The "contains macro" warning is unusual.&nbsp; It has never happened before.&nbsp; I have not installed or updated Excel recently.&nbsp; I use Excel many times almost every day.</p>
<p>So why did I get it this one time?</p>
<p>I did a Google search and a file search.&nbsp; There is only file called xlicons.exe.&nbsp; It lives where it should, namely:&nbsp; C:\Windows\Installer\{90110409-6000-11D3-8CFE-0150048383C9} -- although a web page turned up in the Google search says that the path should
 be ...\{91CA0409-....</p>
<p>I have Office Excel 2003 SP3 and WinXP SP3.</p>
<p>PS:&nbsp; What exactly does xlicons.exe do?&nbsp; I cannot find a decent explanation online.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Most likely you have stored a macro in the Personal Macro Workbook by accident.&nbsp; Open Excel and press Alt+F11.&nbsp; Do you see an item in the top left window that says VBAProject (Personal.xls).&nbsp; If so expand it by click in the + if necessary.&nbsp; Then click the
 + beside the Modules folder.&nbsp; Right-click the Module1 and choose Remove Module1 and respond No the the next dialog box.</p>
<p>Close the VBA editor by clicking the top right red X.&nbsp; When you close out of Excel you will be asked to save Personal, respond Yes.</p>
<p>There is an alternate way, you can find Personal.xls on your computer and delete it.&nbsp; Sometimes this proves more difficult than it should be, particularly if you are on a network.&nbsp; If you use this method, exit Excel first.</p>

<p>Nope.&nbsp; And I think your theory is inconsistent with the facts I presented, specifically: &nbsp;``When I restarted Excel the same way, I did not get the "contains macro" warning``.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there were a macro in Personal.xls, I would expect to always be prompted when I start Excel, given that I set macro security to "medium".</p>
<blockquote>There is an alternate way, you can find Personal.xls on your computer and delete it.</blockquote>
<p>None exists on the system.</p>
<p>Of course, I cannot say for sure if one existed when I got the error, and it was automagically deleted afterwards.&nbsp; But I cannot think of anything that would:&nbsp; (a) cause Personal.xls to be created automagically (previously); and (b) automagically delete
 Personal.xls afterwards.</p>
<p>Nothing, that is, but a virus.&nbsp; I'm not willing to jump to that conclusion.&nbsp; Occam's Razor.</p>
<blockquote>Sometimes this proves more difficult than it should be, particularly if you are on a network.</blockquote>
Stand-alone personal computer at home.&nbsp; No shared devices, files or file systems on the network.<br />

<h2>            Unable to edit section of my site page</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've created a sharepoint site and I chose text layout to be of a banner row and two columns. It was all good till today morning but from morning it was not allowing me to edit anything in columns sections that I have previously compiled. Instead it only
 allows to edit the banner portion of it where I have not had anything so far. Not sure why!!</p>

<p>Hi KarunPallapothula,</p>
<p>To clarify the situation, could you confirm the following info?<br />
1.Check if the issue happens to the site admin.<br />
2.Create a new page in the site and check if the issue would happen. To create a new page: Access the site&gt;Click the gear on the upper right corner&gt;Select Add a page.<br />
3.Please let us know the detailed steps about how you edited the two columns.<br />
4.For "it was not allowing me to edit anything in columns sections", you may provide the detailed info and a screenshot of the symptom.<br />
Note: To upload screenshots, you can click <strong>Use rich formatting</strong> in the forum and then click the icon of
<strong>Insert/Edit Media</strong>.</p>
<p>Please share updates when you have time.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

<p>hi felix,</p>
<p>thanks for the repley, actually i am the one who has created it, i believe i am the site admin. here is the screenshot</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=cb643099-f75f-48dc-bb22-34504694b79b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dcb643099-f75f-48dc-bb22-34504694b79b" /></a></p>
<p>i've highlighted the layout i chose, three sections are those ones to which arrows are pointing to. as you can see i am able to write/edit in the first section which is highlighted with blue border where as i am not able to do write/edit in other two sections.
 interesting part is i am the one who has filled those two sections earlier. but now it is like i cannot even see the cursor on either of those sections. hope i have made myself clear.</p>

<p>hi karunpallapothula,</p>
<p>per my test, after i insert a picture or a web part into the column section and then click the columns, i can't see the cursor as below. when i click the direction key<span><strong> ↓
</strong></span>in the keyboard, the cursor would appear and i can edit the columns.<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=6329c3e1-0887-438b-a755-b3f2ff0e2d5c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d6329c3e1-0887-438b-a755-b3f2ff0e2d5c" /></a><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=d6eed319-bf31-42e2-b16c-f26ba7675725" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dd6eed319-bf31-42e2-b16c-f26ba7675725" /></a></p>
<p>if it is not your scenario, i'd like to confirm the following:<br />
1.confirm whether the columns are greyed out when you click them.<br />
2.select the columns and click delete, check if you could delete the contents.<br />
3.check if you could change the text layout.</p>

<p>hi</p>
<p>i've tried to select it and edit it but it didn't allow me to do so. yes, the columns are grayed out always. i could not even delete it. also, if i try to change the layout the changes apply only on top section but the bottom section is same without any
 change. i am forwarding the capture of the screen after changing the section layout. please compare it with the other screen capture i've sent previously.</p>

<p>Hi KarunPallapothula,</p>
<p>Thanks for your updates.</p>
<p>To further narrow down the issue, please confirm the following info, and then we could move forward.<br />
1.Check if the issue happens to other users who can edit the page.<br />
2.Edit the page in different browsers and check the outcome.<br />
3.Create a new page and edit the Text Layout, and check if the issue would happen.<br />
4.To see if the issue happens to the site collection, you may access another site collection in the SharePoint Admin center and try editing the page.
<br />
5.For the SharePoint site you created, did you use&nbsp;a customized site template or the default site tempates(e.g. Team Site, Blog,Community Site, etc.)?</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Felix</p>

<p>hi karunpallapothula,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
as the issue only happens to the specific page and it needs time to find the cause, we recommend you create a new page and set it as the homepage for a better practice. to do that:<br />
in the new page, click <strong>make homepage</strong> under <strong>page</strong>.<br />
&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=2f6e6d66-9917-4dd1-9e35-6b7ef43cc892" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d2f6e6d66-9917-4dd1-9e35-6b7ef43cc892" /></a><br />
if you still want to use the pervious page, i'd like to confirm the following info for further investigation:<br />
1.confirm whether you have activated <strong>project functionality</strong> in the
<strong>manage site features </strong>of the<strong> site settings</strong>. if so, it would create a new layout for the project summary, and then other layouts can't be edited.<br />
2.check if you could click <strong>edit source</strong> to make changes to the html code. to do that:
<br />
click one of the two columns and then click <strong>edit source</strong>. if so, you may also try copying the sources to the new page.<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=506be0e9-fc15-4db6-9815-33fc8c3606d2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d506be0e9-fc15-4db6-9815-33fc8c3606d2" /></a><br />
3.to see if there are any strange web parts in the page, you may add <strong><em>?contents=1</em></strong> at the end of the page url in the browser. if so ,you may select and delete them to see the outcome.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
please share updates when you have time.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
thanks,<br />

<p>I've had similar problems with editing content on a page and though my issue is a little different, it could be related.

<p>I demonstrated the issue to Msft engineers via a service request but they have no clue how to fix. Unfortunately, O365 is a poorly made product &nbsp;that suffers from many quirky problems.

<h2>            Vista Enterprise, Windows Mobile 5, and the Symbol Barcode Scanner MC9060</h2>
                    <span>Hello all,<br />
                    <span>Hello all,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have run into an issue now that our systems are being upgraded to Vista Enterprise. Our Symbol Barcode Scanner MC9060 which uses Windows Mobile 5 and MS ActiveSync 3.8 or greater will not connect to the Vista machines. It works fine with our remaining
 XP machines but these will soon be upgraded too. How can we get the scanners to connect to the Vista machines? This is a military network which has strict requirements and controls with respect to software so ideally, we would not want to add any additional
 software. Hopefully the answer is something with permissions or settings. Any help with this issue is greatly appreciated!!<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

            Hi,<br />
With Windows Vista, Microsoft requires users to use Windows Mobile Device Center to synchronize with Windows Mobile 5 or later devices.&nbsp; There is no option to install and use ActiveSync with Vista.&nbsp; You can download Windows Mobile Device Center at

http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/en-us/downloads/microsoft/device-center-download.mspx</a><br />
<br />
Also, you should be aware that ActiveSync 3.x has security issues.&nbsp; See - <a href="http://www.pocketpcfaq.com/faqs/activesync/securityadvisories.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            This is most likely a hardware concern since reducing the size of text caused the sim phone app to disappear. Let's get in touch with the B2X team by talking to their support agent or chatting with one of their support agents. Go

<h2>            Error &#40;Miscrosoft.AnalysisServices.BackEnd.StorageException&#41; while creating relationships in Excel 2016&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys. Please help me out here.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>I am trying to create a file to maintain a small shop's accounts+stock data. I have completed the file so I tried to optimize it by converting the ranges to tables and creating relationships between common data between sheets.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are 4 tables regarding stock, ie, Purchases, Sales, Return and Lost/Damaged. I am trying to link the "date" column of these 4 tables with a 5th table containing only the dates for the current year.</p>
<p>The problem is I can connect/link ONLY one table with the dates table and as soon as I try to link table to dates table, I see this error:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">We couldn't get data from the Data Model. Here's the error message we got:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Exception of type 'Miscrosoft.AnalysisServices.BackEnd.StorageException' was throw</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can link another table if I remove the first relationship, so data in all tables is fine. It's just that I can only create one relationship.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope I was clear about my question, if not, kindly let me know. I'll try to add more info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks and Regards.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Linking your 4 tables to the 5th one is possible but there's an important requirement: the Dates Table must have a unique identifier (can be a Date). If you get the about message it probably means there are duplicates in that Table.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To easily check you can use Conditional Formatting + If you haven't read it already I would suggest

<p>ah thank you, and yes, you seem to be able to connect the tables successfully.</p>
<p>I have two questions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Your "dates" column have dates from 1 Jan 2018 to 31 Dec 2018 but other tables also have dates for 2017, does that impact anything?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I have a query for my sales table and I use that query to create a relationship. Is this query impacting my ability to create further relationships somehow?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reason I have a query for sales table is that my original 'sales table' have 7 columns for 7 possible items per invoice. and I use a query on that table to unpivot the item columns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can upload my&nbsp;file (after removing possible personal data) if you wish to look at it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>
</p><p>UPDATE: Excel didn't throw any error now that I have deleted some sheets and recreated all relationships again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I guess excel relationships are hit n miss kind of thing. Few days earlier, I was having a similar kind of problem with pivot table and could only solve it after re-installing the office.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And because I deleted the sheets, I'll have to create the file again. Will update you if I see the same error again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It's completely fine, I understand. :) </p>
<p>I'm willing to wait. I'll upload the modified file tomorrow for you to look at. I'll reduce the number of&nbsp;sheets (only stock related sheets) so you can understand it easily without much effort.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Meanwhile, I'll also try to re-study the shorter file myself.</p>

<p>I guess excel relationships are hit n miss kind of thing. Few days earlier, I was having a similar kind of problem with pivot table and could only solve it after re-installing the office.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi again!<br />
Yeah the file finally worked but I still have one more question if you may.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Earlier, I had a huge table with almost 70 columns, having information on (opening, purchased, sold, returned, lost and closing) quantity for each code for all 12 months. and another table for the same info but just with monetary value instead of quantity.&nbsp;<br />
Therefore, I replaced it with this connected Pivot Table. Pivot&nbsp;Table is showing the correct data but I need two more things from it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Cannot add a column for opening and closing stock for each month. Cannot add a custom column in Pivot as it is greyed out.</p>
<p>2. I want the Pivot to show all months even when there is no transaction.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible? If yes, then just point me in the right direction, I'll read more myself :)<br />
<br />
Thanks man!</p>

<p>Hey man</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>2. I want the Pivot to show all months even when there is no transaction.</strong></em><br />
If problem understood you can implement the solution documented <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/651102/excel-2010-powerpivot-how-do-i-show-items-with-no-data" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> (Andi Mohr's answer from Nov 7 '13 at 11:03). Did it (easy). Updated sample still available
<a href="https://1drv.ms/x/s!AsuqEFbTJNgcgZluYpUGoxywFjCGDA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> (my tblMonths shows FR values: janv, févr... vs Jan, Feb…). As you'll see I implemented the measure on Qty Sold - could have taken something else. I kept the initial # Sold field (from tblSales) just to check the measure is OK</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>1. Cannot add a column for opening and closing stock for each month. Cannot add a custom column in Pivot as it is greyed out.</strong></em><br />
Not sure how your Pivot is setup and TBH I'm not an expert in Pivot and PowerPivot. There are people on this forum as well on
<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=sqlkjpowerpivotforexcel&amp;filter=alltypes&amp;sort=lastpostdesc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Technet</a> who are definitively better than me.</p>
<p>I suggest you raise a new thread re. this question of one of those forums. To be better served you will need to provide at least a snapshot of your current Pivot + a snapshot of the expected result</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps</p>

<h2>            Indexing does not work in outlook 2013, windos7 Ultimate, 64 bit</h2>
                    After installing Office 2013, Indexing foor outlook does not work anymore. Every time I start outlook for the first time after a reboot, a pop-up window tells me that the system is installing additional 64 bit components. I think that may be related to
 the indexing issue.

            Thanks Girish
<div><br />
<div>I tried the repair option and so far indexing seems to be working again. I still get the message that says something like "please wait while windows configures office 64 bit components" but that does not seem to affect the search function.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am quite reluctant to uninstall Office 2013 as I am not sure how to make sure I can recreate the accounts in exactly the same way as they are now. Is there a way to preserve all content of outlook while uninstalling and re installing?</div>

            Sadly This, Like All Other Recommendations Has Not Worked.<br />
<br />
My colleagues and I have tried on several Windows 7 machines, which previously ran office 2007 or 2010 - which was uninstalled prior to purchasing, downloading and installing 2013.<br />
<br />
Microsoft's slow response to acknowledge this widespread issue, let alone fix it is leaving a very sour taste in our mouths.<br />

            I'm having the same problem too.&nbsp; I have tried doing a repair and a&nbsp;fresh reinstall but neither worked.&nbsp; The only thing I can think of is some kind of setting is hanging up since the original install was an upgrade from 2010&nbsp;instead of a fresh install.&nbsp;
 I am also seeing some weird things happening since I installed IE 10.&nbsp; Systems with Office 2010 are working fine with IE10 but mine with Office 2013 with IE10 is having issues.&nbsp; My next step is to downgrade to Office 2010 and see if that fixes the issues.

            Same issue here. &nbsp;I tested something on a Windows 7 Professional machine. &nbsp;I installed Office 2010 and then turned on the Email Index Add-in within the Add-ins of office. &nbsp;I went to start and typed the subject of an email I knew I had in my Inbox. &nbsp;The
 search immediately displayed some Outlook Files matching the search and other Files matching. &nbsp;I then installed Office 2013 on the same machine keeping the same profile. &nbsp;After opening Outlook for the first time I checked the Add-ins. &nbsp;Sure enough email indexing
 was disabled. &nbsp;I enabled it, closed Outlook, re-opened Outlook and disabled again. &nbsp;I did this 2 more times to prove the point. &nbsp;So then I enabled it and left Outlook open and did a search. &nbsp;Outlook files do not come up. &nbsp;So I check my indexing options. &nbsp;Made
 sure .ost and .pst were checked and they were changed the Advanced setting to index files and content. &nbsp;and click on rebuild. &nbsp;After indexing approximately 20

<p>re-installing the software is a huge pain in the neck.&nbsp; I had to do it about 12 times for a previous issue regarding an OUTLOOK email that wouldn't send from the outbox.&nbsp; So - two microsoft products that didn't work together.&nbsp;

<p>Why can't you work out these bugs before sending it into the marketplace?&nbsp; Windows 8 roll out was a disaster.&nbsp; Who does usability over there - the same guys who rolled out Obamacare?&nbsp; Who is your marketing director?&nbsp; Seriously guys, have some pride in your

</p><p><span>I completely agree with the above comments but had an even worse experience:</span></p>
<p><span>When<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">upgrading from Windows 8.1 to 10, Office stopped working. &nbsp;I nearly suffered a metaphorical heart attack because I couldn't find the installation key and tried without success to find a&nbsp;location
 from which to download Office 2013 – before discovering that Microsoft has deliberately broken<span>&nbsp;</span>all the links.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I then tried without success to access the Microsoft call back service. &nbsp;After 20 failed attempts, I&nbsp;discovered that&nbsp;the site only works for US numbers - but&nbsp;helpfully&nbsp;doesn't tell you that.</span><span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Even when, after finding a number, hanging on interminably, getting through to Microsoft, receiving an impossibly long URL to download Office 2013 - let's recall that,<span>&nbsp;</span>not long ago,&nbsp;I paid for this bloody software
 - you have to install all your email accounts (I have around 20), plus macros and other templates for Outlook, Word and Excel. &nbsp;I'd saved the details but they still have to be installed manually. &nbsp;Unbelievable.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I then discovered that&nbsp;Outlook wouldn't send emails.&nbsp; No answers of course from Microsoft but found the fix embedded deep in another site - and that, although it had finished indexing, it can't find a single thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I ran the Office quick repair and it made no difference.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I then ran the online repair and it removed Office without replacing it.&nbsp; Sent out for a further supply of heart pills.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I went through all the above again - I am trying to run several businesses at the same time - and took a half day to clear out the old installation properly and reinstall.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Indexing still won't work and so I’ve given up with Microsoft, downloading a free alternative indexing service called Mailstore Home.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Shame on you Microsoft. &nbsp;When it comes to our next software review, you are the last company we shall use.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>PS &nbsp;Just found the answer:&nbsp;https://rickliev.wordpress.com/2013/06/28/outlook-2013-search-not-working/</p>
<p>But still won't touch Microsoft in future. &nbsp;Let's try Google docs.</p>

                    When I copy something in Excel 2011 and try to "Paste Special" it into Word 2011, "Paste Special" is grayed out. I can still perform a normal paste. Before I upgraded to Mountain Lion, it worked fine.

<p>Since you are using Yahoo, the Sent Items, just like your Inbox, will sync with your account server. What you're trying to achieve is a desktop sync. Therefore Outlook on your desktop must be configured to use Yahoo.</p>

            Correct, PPT doesn't generate a file in a different type of file format 'on the fly'. The feature is for directly sharing a
File&gt; Save As</span> or <span style="font-weight: bold">File&gt; Print</span> to create the PDF, then attach the PDF to the email message.<br />
<br />
Another possible option: If you're using Outlook or Entourage as your email client have a look in the PPT AppleScript menu [looks like a scroll right next to Help]. There are Sample Automator Workflows there which you might be able to use but I haven't tried
 them myself.<br />
<br />

            Hello, Hello,
<br />
<br />First you must deactivate Office from old computer.
<br />Go to www.office.com/myaccount and then, in theCurrent PC Installs section, click Deactivate.
<br />
<br /> Now, login back to www.office.com/myaccount with the same Live ID which was used. 
<br />
<br />This should allow you to use the same license to re-install
<br />
<br />No one here has access to your account records. Here is the best way to contact the people who do:
<br />
<br />Online chat:
<br /><a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en/contact/menu/msa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/...</a>
<br />
<br />Telephone Support: Pick the number by country:

<br />
<br />I hope this can help you get it straightened out. Please let me know if you have any more questions or require further help.

            Hi Anna,
<br />
<br />Try uninstall then reinstall Skype:
<br />
<br />Press Windows Key+X 
<br />Click Windows Powershell (Admin) 
<br />
<br />Enter the following command then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Get-AppxPackage -allusers Microsoft.SkypeApp | Remove-AppxPackage
<br />
<br />  Open start menu
<br />    Type in "powershell" 
<br />    Right click on "Windows PowerShell"
<br />    Run as Administrator
<br />
<br />Then paste the following command
<br />
<br />get-appxpackage -AllUsers Microsoft.SkypeApp | foreach { Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml" }
<br />
<br />Press Enter
<br />
<br />After the install process finishes, you have the Windows 10 Skype app back
<br />
<br />Still not working?
<br />
<br />Uninstall Skype 12:
<br />
<br />Press Windows Key+X
<br />Click Windows Powershell (Admin)
<br />
<br />Enter the following command then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Get-AppxPackage -allusers Microsoft.SkypeApp | Remove-AppxPackage
<br />
<br />install the 8.30 version which Microsoft is replacing Skype 12 with on Windows 10:

<br />
<br />Still not working:
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a>
<br />
<br />File a bug report so the engineers are aware of the problem.
<br />

<br />
<br />NOTE: We’re letting you know that support for Skype version 7 will end on November 1, 2018 on desktop devices and November 15 on mobile and tablet devices. When support ends, we’ll begin requiring updates to version 8. Although you may be able to use older versions for a little while longer.
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. Since September 2018, we started seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week.

    <title>Outlook 2016 Stuck loading profile - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aron roberts  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 Stuck loading profile</h2>
                    <p>we us Microsoft Office 365 for Business. We recently upgraded from office 2013 to 2016.</p>
<p>On one of our devices whenever the user try to open his outlook it hangs on loading profile and sits there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Opening it in safe mode does not work.<br />
</p>
<p>Creating a new profile did not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if I open task manager outlook immediately finishes loading profile and opens.</p>
<p>This happens without closing any other applications or ending any process. Just opening task manager for some reason allows it to open. It will hang until task manager is open 2 minutes or 5 hours doesn't seem to matter.</p>

            Hi Aron,<br />
<br />
Based on my experience, the issue is more likely to be related some third-party program/software. So, to narrow down the issue, you can re-open your Outlook in a clean boot via
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/kb/929135</a>. <br />
<br />
Moreover, to exclude the potential network environment influence, you can test on another PC under a different network environment and see if the issue persists.
<br />
<br />
If the issue persists, it is recommend that you un-install and re-install the Office 2016 programs.
<br />
<br />
We welcome any update is heard from you and we will further assist you if it is needed.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Alan<br />

            <p>I will be sure to try the suggestion about clean boot to see if that makes a difference.</p>
<p>I just find it odd that outlook is able to load the profile as soon as task manager is open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About testing on a different device/network the device is the only one on the network that has the issue.</p>
<p>In addition it is a laptop and has the issue from users home or hotspot. so it is unlikely to be a network issue.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>something else strange is happening though.</p>
<p>When the user changes folders from inbox to sent or visa versa the application hangs.</p>
<p>Opening task manager fixes this also, not closing a program just opening the task manager.</p>

<p>Do you really think that customers will put up with known bugs? </p>
<p>
</p><p>The internet is full of this problem and Microsoft has no clue how to fix it.</p>
<p>I went with ThunderBird open source email. Few buttons and was up and running. Microsoft expects people to put hours into sorting out these bugs. How about publish a solution or create a fix-it. I work in IT and am telling everyone to stay away from Office.<br />

<p>You cant install Java on the Surface RT. If you want to install something it will have to come from the Store and if its not in there then that is it.&nbsp; Are you trying to play a game?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Heres a good read on how Windows RT works</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t search emails on Outlook.com - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> benleclair  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t search emails on Outlook.com</h2>
                    <p>Just moved to paid Outlook.com from paid Yahoo Mail after ten years. &nbsp;Really like it so far, but I'm unable to search emails. &nbsp;Says it can't connect?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought it was because I transferred my mail over (and it's a lot) but it's been almost a week. &nbsp;Is this because it's indexing? &nbsp;If so, how long does this normally take?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: &nbsp;One more weird issue. Sometimes when I go to check the box next to a message it selects the bottom message??? I accidentally deleted a couple emails wondering what was going on. &nbsp;(Was able to grab them from deleted items.)</p>

<p>
</p><p>Unlinking accounts is no longer possible, therefore you cannot unlink your accounts and to proceed with account deletion, you will need to link your Skype account to a Microsoft account, this is due to the full migration of Skype to Microsoft and one credentials
 to all Microsoft products.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, you cannot delete the Skype account alone without deleting the Microsoft account as well. In this case, I can only suggest to create a new Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still wish to proceed with the account deletion, please refer to this link:

                    Hi!<br />
<br />
My hotmail account, *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, password was changed by my ex gf. It's been a few years and I'm not sure of how to retrieve the email. I was told my friends to write it here for help. I believe the account would be inactive by now but i would like
 to retrieve the email back if possible. Do let me know if you need to know more details and will try my best to assist you.

Thank you so much!<br />

<p>Not that I can remember, however Windows 7+ (and maybe Vista too) made some changes so that pop-up and notification type windows won't take focus by default. This annoyed some people at my work after they got Windows 7 computers because some of their core
 applications were integrated together so if they clicked a button in one app it would open another app, and in Windows 7 the new window would stay behind the main window since it couldn't take focus. I get why it annoyed those users but I still think it's
 better that new windows don't automatically appear over the top of whatever you are working on.</p>

    <title>Deleted Email Account deleted through Outlook reappears, causing - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Deleted Email Account deleted through Outlook reappears, causing problems</h2>
                    
<p>I'm an IT Help Desk contractor and I've got a question about Outlook and how it manages the email accounts it gets email from.</p>
<p>I'm the one who installed Office 365 on my client's PC. &nbsp;When I did the initial configuration of Outlook, I made what I thought was a mistake in entering the client's email accounts. &nbsp;I had already added one email account. &nbsp;I added a second email account
 (I don't remember "how" I did it) but then I remembered a colleague's advice about these email accounts and "deleted" the second email account.</p>
<p>As I remember it, I did the "deletion" by right-clicking on the second email account, selecting the option that said "remove" and then clicking "OK". &nbsp;I then went back and added the second email account my clients monitors the somewhat "old-fashioned" way
 - through the Control Panel and the "Email" icon there. &nbsp;That worked. &nbsp;In total I entered 5 email accounts to monitor. &nbsp;I started up Outlook, and everything looked "OK".</p>
<p>Here's the problem. &nbsp;When I started trying each email account making sure it did indeed receive email, I quickly found that 6 accounts/inboxes were present - not 5!</p>
<p>Let's call them Accounts # 1 - 5. &nbsp;Each email account I entered was present, but there was an "extra" one that had the same "name" that I had given to the "deleted" account in the beginning. &nbsp;That account is in reality a duplicate of what's in Account #2
 - it's just "named" the mistaken name I gave it way back in the beginning of my setup of Outlook.</p>
<p>The "problem" comes when the client exits Outlook and comes back into it. &nbsp;The "true" Account # 2 - not the one with the bad name I had made - disappears from Outlook - and, in it's place is the badly named one I had "deleted". &nbsp;What I "think" is happening
 is that Outlook is seeing 2 email accounts - the poorly named one and the correctly named one - with the same email address and is dropping the "true" Account #2 because it's second in line behind the correctly named one.</p>
<p>Not only does the correctly name Account #2 disappear, but, when you try to click on the poorly named account, it throws an error box where the window is titled "Microsoft Outlook" and the message says "Cannot expand the folder". &nbsp;So all the email for Account
 #2 suddenly become inaccessible.</p>
<p>The only way to clean this up is the go back to the Control Panel, go to the "Mail" icon, remove the "Outlook" profile, and then recreate it again. &nbsp;Doing that still lets the user get to Accounts # 1 - 5, only now, clicking on the poorly named inbox/account
 shows all of the email for the correctly named Account #2. &nbsp;A very maddening situation!</p>
<p>Even more maddening is that when I log onto Account #1's OWA - Outlook for the Web - I only see "Account #1". &nbsp;If I look under "connected" accounts, nothing is there. &nbsp;If I go to the "true" Account #2's OWA, I still only see Account #2's email and no other
 accounts are listed under "connected" accounts. &nbsp;And "No", this is not a "Shared" mailbox.</p>
<p>I have contacted Microsoft Support twice about this - both times, we couldn't come up with a solution.</p>
<p>For Microsoft Support Try # 1, we thought that changing the slider in "Offline Settings" under "Change Account" to "All" instead of something like "6 months" or "12 months" worked. I changed the setting, and went into and out of Outlook at least twice, but
 around the third time, the same error of the "true" Account #2 disappearing and the "Cannot expand folder" error would come up.</p>
<p>For Microsoft Support Try # 2, we "did" figure out that the problem was with Account #1. &nbsp;The "deletion" of the wrongly named account didn't really work, and now the wrongly named account (actually Account #2) is still associated with it. &nbsp;However, our messing
 around with the Outlook Profiles messed up Outlook so badly that it wouldn't launch and would produce an error message saying that "There's a problem here" and that we urge you to "reinstall Outlook". &nbsp;I fixed this myself by simply getting rid of the bad profiles
 and recreating it correctly.</p>
<p>I did find a page on the Internet saying the Outlook Profiles aren't stored in a "file" - they're actually stored in the Windows Registry. &nbsp;I tried taking an export of the Registry both before and after the errors started coming up. &nbsp;On a test machine on
 which I "could" replicate the client's error, I did find an entry where the Outlook data file folder paths was indeed blanked out in the "After" shot. &nbsp;I changed that setting in the registry on my test machine and, sure enough, it worked! &nbsp;I thought I had
 found the solution!</p>
<p>When I did a before and after error registry comparison on the client's PC (a Windows 7 machine whereas my test machine was running Windows 10), I did not have the same luck. &nbsp;The whole Outlook registry keys looked somewhat different in the before and after
 shots, but in that same registry key that on Windows 10 got blanked out, in Windows 7 it wasn't blank. &nbsp;So I struck out there as well.</p>
<p>I'm at a loss on how to fix this. &nbsp;The Microsoft Support people ran SARA on my client's machine, but couldn't find anything. &nbsp;We even tried an "Online Repair" of the Office 365 installation on the client's PC, and that didn't help either.</p>
<p>What can I do to solve this problem! &nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Any</strong>
</span>input would be appreciated.</p>

<p>hi wayne,</p>
<p>i read the whole thread and the issue seems complicated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;first of all, i need to confirm whether the main problem is that the deleted email account reappears in the outlook client.&nbsp;</p>
<p>if so, based on your description, i understand the issue persists after recreating a profile, running sara, and repairing the outlook client. and the issue was temporarily fixed by exporting the registry and reinstalling the outlook client. given this situation,
 i would like to share some information with you: delete .ost/.pst file, then only add the #2 account and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>if it still occurs, to check if it is related to the other 4 accounts, try adding those 4 accounts and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>here are the steps to delete the .ost/.pst file:</p>
<ul>
<li>click the file tab. </li></ul>

<ul>
<li>click account settings &gt; account settings.&nbsp; </li></ul>

<ul>
<li>click the data files tab &gt; select the entry in the list of data files that has a tick next to it &gt; click open file location to open the directory that contains this file in windows explorer.
</li></ul>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=2b155074-e093-4103-89fb-af7e36fbe925" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d2b155074-e093-4103-89fb-af7e36fbe925" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>exit outlook and delete the offending ost/ pst file. </li></ul>

<ul>
<li>start outlook; the ost/pst file will be recreated. </li></ul>

<p>I apologize for not getting back to you sooner! &nbsp;Things have been rather busy.</p>
<p>Your suggestion of deleting the files and then letting Outlook restore them didn't work. &nbsp;The same "Cannot Expand Folder" error message came up which means that Inbox became inaccessible again.</p>
<p>However ... I "think" I worked out a solution that's not "elegant" but at least it works.</p>
<p>You remember I said my client had 5 inboxes - Accounts 1 - 5 - and that Account 2 disappears when you exit Outlook and come back into it. &nbsp;Well, what I did find was that the poorly named version of Account 2 that I had "thought" I had deleted does come back
 and - at least when you initially start with a newly recreated Profile - does show email from Account 2.</p>
<p>What I found was that if I, one by one, enter the Accounts, I can get the email for Account 2 to re-appear. &nbsp;Here's what I do:</p>
<p>1) Enter Account 1</p>
<p>2) Start Outlook. &nbsp;It pulls up mail for Account 1, but it also still shows the poorly named Account 2 after a weird pause.</p>
<p>3) Exit Outlook</p>
<p>4) Go through the Control Panel to enter Account 2 in the Profile</p>
<p>5) Start up Outlook. &nbsp;Account 1 shows its mail and Account 2 shows its mail, but poorly named (formerly deleted) Account 2 "also" shows the mall from Account 2.</p>
<p>6) Exit Outlook</p>
<p>7) Go back into Outlook. &nbsp;Account 2 disappears and poorly named (and formerly deleted) Account 2 is still there, but when you click on it to see the Inbox, it gives the "Cannot expand folder" error message.</p>
<p>8) Instead of exiting Outlook, I go to Outlook's front page (under "File" I think) and re-add Account 2 through there.</p>
<p>9) Now, I exit Outlook</p>
<p>10) Go back into Outlook and Account 2 still isn't there, but the poorly named (and formerly deleted) Account 2 now shows all the mail for Account 2.</p>
<p>Now, whenever you go into and out of Outlook, Account 2 still isn't there, but at least the poorly named (and formerly deleted) Account 2 still shows the correct email. &nbsp;You can receive mail through it and send mail through it without any problems.</p>
<p>For Accounts 3 - 5, I add those accounts like I did Account 2 (the second time) - through that File page. &nbsp;Those accounts also work fine.</p>
<p>"Why" this works - though it doesn't "look" right - I really don't know. &nbsp;I personally think that if an expert looked through the Exchange Administration pages, it would be clear "why" the formerly deleted Account 2 hangs around with Account 1. &nbsp;I, myself,
 have looked at almost every page of the Exchange Administration web interface, and I haven't seen anything that tells me the poorly named (and formerly deleted) Account 2 is in any ways associated with Account 1, but that's how it works in real life.</p>
<p>The client is OK with this. &nbsp;They are now used to the weirdly named Account 2 and getting their work done. &nbsp;So, I would say this problem is "solved" - though I really don't like the solution.</p>
<p>Thanks for trying to help me!</p>

<p><span><span>Well, if you going to adopt a web interface, then you really much have to adopt a web server also.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The reason for this is many, but a stand-alone browser will STILL have to use + open that back end database. And if you write all your code inside of the browser, then you essentially still
 writing a desktop program. So to answer your question, being JUST limited to the desktop browser is NOT really able to open + pull data from that file share. And you would STILL be required to have use of a shared folder on your local network. (So JUST adopting
 the web browser will NOT allow users say outside of the building or people on the road to use the resulting application.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>And worse, the browser would require references to the ACE/JET database engine. And that would mean say an iPad or smartphone browser would not work. (You would be limited to 100% compatible
 windows computers, and EACH windows workstation wold STILL requite the Access database engine to be installed on each workstation.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>What the above means, is you still be writing software 100% limited to windows PC computers that run on the user’s desktop.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To eliminate the above issue, then in addition adopting a web browser, you ALSO have to adopt a web server. If you adopt a web server, then you get to write SERVER side code. The result is that
 the access database engine ONLY needs to be installed on the web server, and thus any standard web browser on an iPad or anything else can then run that application.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>So keep in mind that when you write a web application, then the web server you choose has to support all of the tools and systems you plan to develop that web based system with.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>So if you choose say a Linux hosted system, then you can’t install windows software on that web server (which means you can’t use Access). So most web applications that run on Linux are built
 around the so called “lamp” stack (Linux (the OS), Apache (the web server), M is MySQL (the database server), and “p” stands for PHP – the web side programming language you use.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>So when choosing a web server, you have to:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Adopt the program system and tools that he web server offers.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Adopt a set of programming tools you like and THEN choose and ensure that the web server allows you to run that software.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>So while the browser can run on near any computer, the web server not really any different then you’re desktop. You have to install the required programming tools and systems onto that computer). So while the web server can “spit out” web pages to be
 consumed by any computer, the web server will be LIMITED to ONLY the programming systems and languages that the web server supports.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>So if for example you like VBA, and thus choose vb.net and the net platform to develop a web application, then the web server has to be a windows based web server and support the .net programing system.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>In summary:</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>You have to choose a set of programming tools and development tools that you like and THEN ensure that your web server supports those programming systems. If the web server is missing “any” part of the systems you choose to develop your software with,
 then you can’t install + run your software on that web server.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>And keep in mind that if you use Access as the database, then you not use ANY feature of Access except that of the tables. (Since web servers don’t support access forms or reports). Since you are ONLY uses Access to store the table data and zero other
 features of Access, then you likely best to adopt a server based database like MySQL or Microsoft SQL server.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>So if you choose Linux as your web OS, then you likely be using the Apache web server, and your database choice likely will be MYSQL.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>If you want to use say vb.net, and SQL server (or Access), then you have to choose a web server that runs on the windows OS. That means you likely choose IIS (that is Microsoft web server system they offer). And since the system runs on windows, then
 the database system can be SQL server or Access. However since you only using the tables from Access, then you might as well just choose SQL server, since all it really does is hold table for you, but SQL server is FAR better and works far better with the
 IIS web server then does Access.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>If your programing language for the web server is PHP, the likely the LAMP stack is a better choice. That quite much suggests a Linux server (but that does not support Access). I never used PHP on IIS – but it likely is supported.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>However, coming from a VBA environment, then I much prefer using Visual Studio, and VB.net. The reason for this is that vb.net is VERY similar to VBA, and creating of web forms in Visual Studio is a drop + drop process VERY much like Access.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>So in addition to your given tools, you also have to choose a web server. </span>
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">

<p>&gt; I'd like to know if JavaScript would be enough to Pull and Push data to and from an Access back-end.</p>
<p>No. JavaScript is a client-side technology. It runs in the browser's sandbox, and as such does not have access to database resources or file system (beyond what the browser can do).</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt; However don't have access to these tools</p>
<p>Both are a free download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt; I'd like to replace </p>
<p>Like? You will need a better reason than that to replace a working solution and embarking on a rewrite in an environment that you don't understand very well yet.</p>
