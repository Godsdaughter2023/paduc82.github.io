    <title>Windows 10 Jpeg stuck in upper case - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> justmaxt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Jpeg stuck in upper case</h2>
                    <p>Can anyone tell me how to stop windows 10 from defaulting all JPEG files to upper case extensions? I have Photoshop set to lower case file extensions, but once I save my work in a windows file - it reverts back to .JPG</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way I have found so far to make the file stay lower case&nbsp;.jpeg is to access the file via file zilla, change the extension to lower case. I work with a lot of images this is very time consuming.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I rename the file in windows 10 file manager (I have file extensions visible) - it immediately changes them back to upper case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help?</p>
<p>
</p><p />

    <title>Bitlocker unable to unlock drive using Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Bitlocker unable to unlock drive using Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi There</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded a HP laptop to the newest windows 10 version and as per organization requirements started bitlocker encryption on the windows drive. &nbsp;While the encryption was running the user who uses the computer, for some reason had restarted the computer while
 encryption was in progress.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the restart, it showed an error 0xc0000225 "Unable to find file winload.exe"&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was not displaying the Bitlocker unlock screen so as to unlock the drive.</p>
<p>I also saved the recovery key and have it printed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although after booting using a win10 usb and using CMD off the bootable usb to try unlock the drive, it did not work.</p>
<p>I used the command &nbsp;x:\&gt;windows\system32&gt; manage-bde -unlock e: -rp "the 48digit key"&nbsp;</p>
<p>but it said the password wasnt able to unlock the drive. Not sure why as I have the right key.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also note that I used the new encryption method that works only on windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried removing the harddisk and connecting it to another PC that has windows 10 version 1511 and when clicking unlock drive it says that I need a newer version of windows to unlock the drive. How can that be when I have the newest version??</p>
<p>
</p><p>The user has some important data to recover and any help is appreciated to unlock the drive</p>
<p>The HDD is also a samsund SSD drive</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

    <title>Minecraft Windows 10 Edition not Showing up on Account - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Minecraft Windows 10 Edition not Showing up on Account</h2>
                    <p>I bought Minecraft Java edition while you got a free Windows 10 code included, and I claimed it on my account. I got a new computer, logged into the same account and saw that it was missing. I know for a fact this is the right account because the gamer tag
 matches the gamer tag of which I saw in a video I recorded on my old PC. I would like to play Minecraft Windows 10 Edition, but the code I redeemed is no longer there.</p>

<br />Press Control + Shift + Esc
<br />Click File &gt; Run new task
<br />Type: control userpasswords2
<br />Click Add
<br />
<br />Enter a user name
<br />Password, confirm it, create a hint
<br />Click Next
<br />Click Finish
<br />
<br />Click OK
<br />
<br />Sign into the new account.
<br />Open File Explorer on the Taskbar &gt; This PC 
<br />Open the drive where Windows is installed 
<br />Open Users 
<br />Look if your old account old is there with your files 
<br />
<br />If they are, you can copy them over to the new account.

            Hi Sarah, this is happening much too often at the moment, I think you are logged into a temporary account . . . 
<br />
<br />Please open Windows File Explorer 
<br />Navigate to C:\Users 
<br />Do you see two user folders that look like yours?
<br />Open those folders and check inside Pictures, Documents . . . etc. and see if your files are there 
<br />
<br />If your files are there: 
<br />
<br />Create a new user profile with Admin privileges 
<br />Log into the new user profile 
<br />Copy all your data from the old profile to the new profile (Documents Library, Pictures Library . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />If you still have not found your files, look for a Windows.old folder on your C Drive, expand that to open the users folder contained inside - check there for your files, icons . . .etc. 
<br />
<br />If you do find your files . . . etc. there, copy them out as soon as possible as Windows will remove the Windows.old folder in time       
        </p>

    <title>Missing desktop icons and taskbar with Windows Xp - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Missing desktop icons and taskbar with Windows Xp</h2>
                    
<p><span><span>Hello, I have never posted to one of these before but I am at a roadblock with my pc. I recently, last week, did the routine updates and
 everything seemed fine until my pc rebooted so the updates could take affect. Once it rebooted I lost my desktop icons and taskbar. I searched through many online forums for a solution to this and attempted around 15 of them with no luck. I am running Windows
 XP sp2 on a Dell. I will sum up the problem - </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1) no desktop icons,
</span></span></p>
<p><span>2) no taskbar,</span></p>
<p><span><span>3) right click functionality is not working,
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4) I can view files/programs via task manager but cannot open anything in this manner,
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5) I cannot get my pc to boot up in any of the available SAFE modes, attempting to do so either freezes up the computer or I get a desktop
 with ‘safe’ in all four corners and nothing else. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>6) I am missing explorer.exe from the processes list</span></span></p>
<p><span>7) I cannot launch or open any programs via the task manager. I mention this as many forums have advised to run programs through the task manager, i.e.
 file/new task(run)/enter file path or selecting browse. Entering cmd, explorer.exe, etc., I am unable to run any files or programs.</span></p>
<p><span>8) I do not have the Windows XP start up disc.
</span></p>
<p><br />
<span>I think that about covers it. Any help or suggestions anyone can offer would be appreciated.

<p>I would normal try these steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scan if there is any virus/ malware and then try the below steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Delete temp files : Start &gt; Run &gt; Type " Temp " . hit enter .&nbsp;</p>
<p>delete all the files/folders that are stored &nbsp;( Ensure all the application are closed )</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Delete local temp files &nbsp;: &nbsp;Start &gt; Run &gt; Type " %Temp% " . hit enter .&nbsp;</p>
<p>delete all the files/folders that are stored &nbsp;( Ensure all the application are closed )</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Delete prefetch files .&nbsp;</p>
<p>Start &gt; Run &gt; Type " prefetch " . hit enter .&nbsp;</p>
<p>delete all the files/folders that are stored &nbsp;( Ensure all the application are closed )</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also , i would reset IE settings to default and remove 3rd party addons that are unnecessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Increase the virtual memory to 2 times the actual memory size.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. If none of these work. I would recreate user profile with elevated ( Admin ) access.</p>

<h2>            Xbox Live Thieves And Crooks&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>BE WARNED! THEY WILL STEAL FROM YOU AND THEN LIE TO YOUR &nbsp;FACE!</p>
<p>Back in October I had noticed on some of my billing statements that I was still being charged a renewal fee from Xbox live (which I hadn't played in months.) At that time their website was down so I couldn't go in and make any changes to my account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not knowing about the website issue I spent a long time trying to figure out how on earth to remove this recurring service. Eventually I was able to get threw to customer support and talk to a rep about CANCELING my service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I guess they don't know what canceling means. At that time the rep had said they would be able to refund PART of the subscription cost, about 8$ of the 10$ they where charging me. He then proceeded to tell me that to make up for the dollar or two I would
 lose he could put me on a 1$ for one month live account. Ok, that's cool whatever I have xbox live now and I basically get my money back.</p>
<p>New bank statement, new charges. Apparently this 1$ deal he gave me totally contradicted EVERYTHING I had called to accomplish I.E. CANCELING my account. It set me up for another auto renewal service that hit for another 9.99 a month (yea, I just got suckered.)
 What a convenient thing to do knowing the website was down and I had to "Cancel" my service directly with him. At the end of this conversation I had felt pretty good, I got part of my refund, and basically a month of Xbox service that I didn't use anyways
 for 1$.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is where it got fun!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I get an E-mail &nbsp;11/27/2011</p>
<p>"Dear Me,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
We are contacting you because we have been unable to charge your credit card for your Gold – 1 Month service(s) being billed to you through Microsoft Online Services. The following credit card is the current payment method on your billing account: "</p>
<p>Now you can understand my reaction to this. I'm furious! I canceled my service in OCTOBER It's December so why are they STILL billing me?!?!?! I immediately jumped on my Xboxlive account online and found where my auto renewal service was and TURNED IT OFF!</p>

<p>WTF! 3 months after CANCELING my service not once, but TWICE now and they STILL managed to bill me! Ring Ring Mr. Customer Service Man! I get a guy named Kyle. Kyle is pretty cool. At first he was like "well yeah, you have a auto-renewal subscription." After
 talking with him for a few minutes he asked to place me on hold so that he could take some time to look into my previous account notes and see what he can figure out. When Kyle comes back he sides with me. "It says right here in the notes that you called October
 9th, 2011 to cancel your account." Thank you Kyle you understand my frustration! He asked me about the 1$ service I was given and I explained it exactly how the first representative had explained it to me. "Were you aware that this would actually put you back
 into a 9.99$ renewal rate?" Uh, NO?! Why would I cancel my account JUST TO RENEW IT AGAIN RIGHT THERE?! Kyle was very understanding and was about to refund me and completely solve my issue (so I hoped.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>*Click* &nbsp;I accidentally hung up on him. Single handedly the biggest mistake of the month!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I have to call back and hope to god I get someone like Kyle, no such luck. In fact I'm pretty sure I met Kyle's evil twin brother Kevin. Now pardon my language here but this guy was an *** from the get go. He was rude, pushy, would not listen to anything
 I had to say, didn't give 2 craps about what I had just talked about with Kyle, had no intentions of looking into the account to see what might have been going on, extremely impatient, and just plan impolite. Without me even having any clue what was going
 on he said "here is your confirmation number." "A confirmation number for what?" He then got even more impatient and I'm pretty sure his horns grew a little larger. "Do you want the confirmation number or not?!" I just got charged for this TODAY, can I get
 a refund? No.</p>
<p>Of course not... even though 10 minutes ago I was told the opposite.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I go from talking to someone who was completely understanding to my situation and about to actually help me out, to this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I did what any normal person in that situation would do, asked for a manager! And let me tell you, this guy was way to excited to get me to a manager. *Red Flag!!!*</p>
<p>After waiting for oh, probably 10 minutes, I finally got Alex or something along those lines. I very calmly and politely explain to him what the situation was and how I had canceled my account twice now and JUST got billed again for this service. After I
 was done talking there was a long pause................................ Ok? "Ok? What do you mean ok? That response in it self made everything click. No wonder why he was so anxious to put me on the phone with his "manager" (who should absolutely by ANYONES
 standards be a manager and a CUSTOMER SERVICE manager at that.) I explained that I a.) wanted to make SURE that my subscription was canceled and b.) get a refund for at the VERY LEAST this month they charged me.</p>
<p>*Recap* I was charged the SAME EXACT day I called to dispute it.</p>
<p>He then told me that they do absolutely NO refund (uh load of crap cause they did it the first time I supposedly canceled my account and Kyle was about to do it for me just 20 mins ago.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now seriously, forget the other months that they have been charging me for something I canceled. This was the SAME EXACT DAY THEY CHARGED ME! Are you serious? I feel completely robbed and I wish there was a better way to keep track of these customer service
 people cause they truly deserve to be fired.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You just stole my money, and lied to my face about it!</p>
<p>*Recap again* Kyle had said that in the previous notes it clearly stated I called to CANCEL MY ACCOUNT. I mean it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure this one out. There was an easy solution to this whole thing and I am absolutely DISGUSTED by the
 way this was handled. I have never once given a bad customer service review and NEVER even thought about posting something like this before.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am going to make sure situations like these are heard. Facebook, Twitter, forums, you name it because this kind of customer treatment is absolutely unacceptable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shame on you Xbox, Shame on you "customer service" reps. It's sad that you have to completely humiliate a company that you were hired to represent in a positive manner.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The single most powerful form of advertisement, word of mouth. You obviously know what I'm going to be advertising for Xbox.</p>
<p>Whatever the situation might be something needs to be done about this kind of treatment of once loyal customers. If you do any sort of search on the internet for Bad Xbox customer service it's like a gold mine of complaints.</p>

<p>11 Positive Comments out of 99 Total Comments is 11.11%.</p>
<p>Uh, those numbers do no lie.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"A bunch of scamming rip off artists. They auto renewed my account without my consent (required by California law) and then continually refused to refund the money when I verbally required them to. When I informed them that California law was very specific
 about consent and auto-renewal refunds, even quoting the legislation to them, they refused to speak to me further. They pointed me towards their Legal Services division - WHICH HAS NO PHONE NUMBER OR EMAIL ADDRESS AVAILABLE. You can only contact them by letter
 to a corporate headquarters address and hope they contact you back.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Needless to say, I'm turning in my XBOX to get a PLAYSTATION. At least Sony provides you with a resolution center and works with you - plus you get BlueRay DVD.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
*** YOU MICROSOFT. You just lost a long-time customer."</p>
<p>"ve tried to cancel my Gold Membership twice now. Both times xbox has screwed me. The first time I had to have them change my email address because they were sending notifications to an address that had been closed for months (I was told earlier that they
 had my new email and everything was settled....it wasnt). Once I contacted them about why I was charged when I told them to cancel my yearly subscription, they said everything was done and fine....it wasnt. I got charged again months later and decided to just
 keep it for the hell of it because the man on the phone was nice enough to convince me to. I am currently going through the extremely long and difficult task of trying to cancel again before I get charged for another year, but they are telling me now I can't
 because I have charges that aren't paid.....ummm? What the ********? They have my card and could just charge it if I did, and I HAVENT BEEN ON MY XBOX IN TWO YEARS NOW. That is not an exaggeration. I have been so bothered by xbox, they have actually kept me
 paying because I havent wanted to deal with them. I have decided I need to finally end it. I've been playing PS3 for those last two years, and I would never in a million years go back to xbox. OH YEAH, if you havent had the Red&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360_technical_problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Ring
 of Death</a>&nbsp;yet...you will. Back when I used my xbox it happened to me, I sent it in and they fixed it (it took over 3 months, and a lot of convincing. How were they allowed to completely lie to the public years ago and make the absurd comment that the red&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360_technical_problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">ring
 of death</a>&nbsp;only happened in something like 10% of systems? That was probably one of the biggest lies ever by a company for one of their products. Every single person I know that has had an xbox (dozens upon dozens) has had their xbox die due to faulty equipment,
 only to have xbox harass them about fixing it. Im done complaining, Microsoft and Xbox are complete garbage, and I could care less if their support team is comprised of fellow Americans. They havent done a better job in any possible way from what I've seen."</p>
<p>"Time for the Attorneys General people!!! My recent experience with X box live and then their customer service has been nothing short of criminal. After charging my bank account 74.99, all on their own, they refunded the 74.99, (it took 8 days),then immediately
 charged 49.99. When I called to figure out why they were drawing funds, they explained that the account had been hacked by someone Chinese and the only way to recover the money was to help them launch their investigation. That was the first phone call, two
 weeks ago. I'm on phone call 9 or 10, customer service person including supervisory, is probably 13. I was actually told to "go ahead and contact the attorney general, do you think you're the only one to ever say that?" Her name was Lisa and her very first
 comment to me was that her only job was to get me off her phone. I was actually told by one of their reps that the second charge for 49.99 was done automatically by their system because a refund had been generated so the system automatically charged a lesser
 charge. After hours on the phone, my son has no x box live, which was also prepaid, by the way, my bank account bounced multiple transactions and now has to be investigated for fraud, and I'm still out that 49.99. I was told they are not required to give refunds
 according to my agreement. I wasn't asking for a refund of anything except for the amount that they stole from my account and the unused Live time that had been prepaid and was now not usable through no fault of our own. I was lied to repeatedly, I was told
 they turn over people like crazy and everyone gets trained differently, I was told that everyone works there is fairly new so I can't expect them to know what they're talking about. Everyone's going to have to start going after them through their state's AG.
 It's not that their service is just horrendous. Record your telephone calls and save them for evidence. It's criminal behavior."</p>
<p>"this x box live customer service is the worst i ever received in my whole life i have to call 2 times to have my&nbsp;credit cardremoved from there system and they keep charching me 9.99 i think those people need extra training because you have to keep calling
 and repeat the same thing to them and they don't listen."</p>
<p>"XBOX Live&nbsp;has the worst customer support I have ever experienced in all my 27 years of living. I have called a total of 8 times in the last 2 days - over 3 hours on the phone. I swear their billing department does not exist because 6 people have transfered
 me to billing and i have never gotten through. These people are awful and I am disgusted. A year Gold Membership is not cheapand for what people spend yearly on this service there should always be someone available to talk to concerning&nbsp;<a href="http://www.balancetransfers.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">a
 credit card</a>&nbsp;or billing issue. I never thought I would encounter a company with worse customer service than Charter Communications but I did;&nbsp;XBOX LIVE. I am appalled."</p>
<p>I think you have had enough examples.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey Higher! I'm sorry to hear you are having some frustration with your account. It sounds like you called to turn off your auto renewal, and then when you agreed to the new $1 promo, it got turned back on. You can now turn off your auto renewal here on
 Xbox.com (<a href="http://xbox.com/accounts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://xbox.com/accounts</a>) to make things easier for you. Regarding any billing issues or refunds, you'd need to contact phone support again. Again, I'm very sorry for all the confusion.
 Please let me know if I can be of any further help. Thanks! </p>

<p>They are better in that you can sometimes find them cheaper but I would say that's about it.<br />
Don't think it's going to prevent someone from hacking into your account. Cause it sure as hell didn't help on my end.<br />

<p><strong>Earlier today, my computer suddenly (and I do mean suddenly, in the middle of listening to a song) started playing all sounds with an awful, metallic reverb that nothing seems to get rid of. I was using Realtek HD Audio driver, with no sound effects
 or environment settings turned on. I tried restarting, uninstalling and reinstalling the audio driver, and a system restore. Despite this, the problem persists. I finally got rid of Realtek altogether and am now using the microsoft High Definition driver but
 still no change.&nbsp;</strong></p>

            I had the same issue. In the end the only way I could get rid of it was to uninstall the audio device through the control&nbsp;panel&nbsp;&gt; device manager. When I rebooted to complete the uninstall the audio device reinstalled cleanly and the unwanted reverb was
 gone. Just reinstalling the audio driver over the existing driver didn't work for me. Here are more details if you need them:&nbsp;<a href="http://geek.theothermartintaylor.com/2011/05/windows-7-sound-issue-reverb-stuck-on.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://geek.theothermartintaylor.com/2011/05/windows-7-sound-issue-reverb-stuck-on.html</a>

            Intel Turbo Boost is simply a display of the current clock speed of the CPU. Even if it isn't working properly, there would be no impact on the performance of your computer. If you see the blue bar bouncing up and down as you use the computer, I would
 think it's working properly.

<p>I hope that is temporary, otherwise this new forum is lame. lol</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyways.. We have 2 teams open in our sim league in it's final season of Madden 11 (currently week 6)</p>
<p>Both Giants, &amp; Bills are open, some trades have been made so their rosters are not completely the same as the real teams, but often they are better. lol</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            This is one of the issues which has crept in after recent Windows update. You need to do following -
<br />
<br />Go to the computer manufacturer's website
<br />Input your computer's model number and go the driver's section of your model
<br />Download the Audio driver from there
<br />Install the driver by double clicking on exe file
<br />Reboot your computer
<br />
<br />If you face any problem in locating audio driver for your computer, let me know your computer's make and model.

            Hi LianeGilbert
<br />
<br />Maybe was caused by Windows Updates, then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here: 
<br />
<br /> 
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4026994/windows-10-fix-sound-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/402699...</a> 
<br /> 
<br />For sound problems first try this checklist: 
<br />
<br /> 
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4026994/windows-10-fix-sound-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/402699...</a> 
<br /> 
<br />Then if necessary work through the following steps:  
<br /> 
<br />1) Update the sound driver from the PC manufacture Support Downloads webpage for your exact model 
<br />
<br /> 
<br />3) Run the Playing Sound troubleshooter at Start button &gt; Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  
<br /> 
<br />4) Try rolling back the sound driver in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button. Choose Sound controller device, then Driver tab, then Roll back if available.  
<br />
<br /> Also check this information below:

<br />
<br />Let me know if I can help you further! 
<br />
<br /> 
<br />

            Did you update to 1809? 
<br />Currently there is a bug with this version which imo is causing the audio driver to be removed or replaced with a Microsoft one, the solution is to visit the manufacturer’s website to download the audio driver, beware as MS is mis-stating that it’s the Intel audio driver which is missing rather than Realtek audio for some people. 
<br />You can also try to uninstall the audio driver then run scan far hardware changes to reinstall said driver.

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for letting us know your concern. This issue can be caused due to the following reasons:</span></p>
<p><span>•Pending Windows Update.</span></p>
<p><span>•Anti-virus software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>•Hardware conflicts.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Have you installed all the Windows Updates as discussed above?
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To troubleshoot this issue, I would suggest you to try these methods and check if it makes any difference.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Make sure you have installed all the Windows updates offered to your computer such as important as well as optional and unplug all the external devices attached to the computer (for example: printer, web camera).</span></p>
<p><span>Once all the important updates are installed successfully, try to install the Windows 8.1 update from Windows Store. If the issue persists, try to reset the Windows Store Cache and check.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>To reset the Windows Store Cache.</span></p>
<p><span>- Press the Windows and the X key and select Run option.</span></p>
<p><span>- Type wsreset.exe and press enter.</span></p>
<p><span>- Restart the computer and then go to Windows Store and check if you are able to install Windows 8.1.</span></p>
<p><span>If issue persists, try method 3.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If you have installed any third party security software, go ahead and temporarily disable it and then check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable
 your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software,</span></p>
<p><span>You should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 4:</span></strong><span> I would suggest you to run DISM tool command and then try to upgrade. Please go through the below link:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj980032%28v=winembedded.81%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj980032%28v=winembedded.81%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396</a>
</span></p>

</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span>Hope this information helps. If you have any concerns, let us know.</span></strong></p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 4 Volume Button Backwards</h2>
                    <p>Just got my Surface Pro 4. Not sure who the genius was who put the volume button on backwards... increasing volume is the left side of the button?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone find a way to reverse this? The right side should increase volume, and the left should decrease volume, in my opinion.

<div>I believe it's the same way on the Surface 3 (non pro). There's no way that I am</div>
<div>aware of to reverse this. It does seem backwards --</div>

<h2>            Keyboard doesn&#39;t work in games</h2>
                    I recently purchased Microsoft FSX steam edition. It booted up normally but as soon as I tried to use the keyboard it would perform the original function and not the game function. I tried to put my computer in game mode but that didn't help. I am running
 Windows 10 and have tried the reboots and updates.

            When you say, 'game function', are you referring to FSX-SE key strokes that give the required response? &nbsp;E.g. If you press CNTRL + period, do the park brakes operate on the aircraft? &nbsp;If that does work, can you further explain the problem you are facing?

            Whenever I try and use any of the F- keys they perform their original function. Some of the other keys do work like the parking brake function.

<p>Okay, as I understand your post, when you have your F.Lock on and you're in FSX, then for example, Spot View, Chase View, Wing View, etc. which are by default allocated to the F keys, don't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that is so, have you checked your Settings in FSX-SE to check whether those F keys are still allocated to the functions you require? &nbsp; How does your 'S' and 'A' keys work (if still in default mapping)? &nbsp;Do these keys still change your inside and outside
 views of the aircraft?</p>

            <p>Hi Jim,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you so much for providing all the relevant information regarding the issue and mentioning all the troubleshooting steps that you have already tried on the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We would like to know - What are the recent changes that you have made to the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since, you have already tried booting the computer in safe mode, low resolution mode and also refreshing the computer, this issue seems to be due to some problem with the hardware. I would suggest you to get in touch with the Acer Support and check with
 them. You may reach them from this link:</p>
