<p>Hi Kumarsan,</p>
<p>We don't know which system DLLs were replaced by the transformation pack. Best option is to perform a System Restore rollback to a date before the transformation pack was installed.</p>

<h2>            How to test full hardware problems</h2>
                    <p>Ok, so last night my surface fell off my small metal cabinet folder, it's one standard drawer size and one small rectangular size. So far no damage to the screen which is good news, but a minor scratch on the grey metal bezel right beside the cover type.
 I hope there's no other scratches on the screen. it fell less than 2 feet, landed on carpet of course, but hit the drawer that was slightly sticking out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway i was wondering how to do a full diagnostics for hardware check on the Surface 3. So far everything seems to be fine, but i just want to make sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alan</p>

            <p>Just use it. &nbsp;There are no moving parts inside and no real internal utilities to perform for testing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I got my Pro 3, I had the box on its' edge when I opened it and the tablet fell 2.5 feet to the floor face down on a carpeted floor. &nbsp;Not a blemish on it and I powered it up, hooked up the charger and just started using it.</p>
<p>

    <title>Display has shrunken, 1-2&#34; black bars on sides of screen. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> grimm ghos7  say:</h3>
<h2>            Display has shrunken, 1-2&#34; black bars on sides of screen.</h2>
                    I have a Microsoft surface pro 4 running windows 10, and this issue first revealed itself after I closed a game I was playing. The display on my screen won't fill the entire surface pro. I've tried messing around with the resolution, but that didn't do
 a thing. It is as though the surface pro doesn't realize there is about 4 inches of screen to use. I've tried reinstalling my display drivers (I have an Intel Iris 540 graphics card), and rolling back to previous versions to no avail. I was told to try to
 change the aspect ratio options, however those options aren't anywhere to be found. Is there any way I can fix this issue? Thank you in advance to everyone who can help :)<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8cd9d311-44d6-4180-a397-2da3649d00d6?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8cd9d311-44d6-4180-a397-2da3649d00d6?upload=true" /></a>

            Hey Grimm,
<br />
<br />That's gotta be annoying... hopefully I can be of some help here.
<br />
<br />Right click a blank space on the desktop, do you see the Intel Graphics Settings option in the context menu, as shown here: <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000005596/graphics-drivers.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support...</a>

            Never mind, Grimm,
<br />
<br />I found a great article that could get you to get back to 16:9 or the original aspect ratio that your computer uses: <a href="https://surfacetip.com/set-custom-resolutions-on-surface/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://surfacetip.com/set-custom-resolutions-o...</a>
<br />
<br />In essence, install the Custom Resolution Utility (CRU) and open the CRU executable, be sure to run it as an administrator. Change it to the appropriate settings and apply.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps, let me know if this doesn't work or if this solves your issue. Good luck!

            It sounds like your Windows screen resolution has been set to something not supported.
<br />
<br />Right click on the desktop
<br />Select "Display Settings"
<br />Click on the "Resolution" drop down
<br />Scroll through the list and pick the one with "(Recommended)" beside it
<br />The screen should flicker, reconfigure and (hopefully) display correctly.
<br />There will also be a prompt asking if you want to keep the new setting, if the display is correct, say yes.
<br />
<br />That should fix the problem.

            Hi Yunie.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />See here for how to fix missing battery icon: 
<br /><a href="https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/restore-missing-battery-icon-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/restore-miss...</a>
<br />
<br />Also instead of disabling in Dev Mgr, try uninstalling the Battery device driver, restart PC to reinstall it which is effectively a Reset whereas disable is not.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

 and it displays that there was a problem getting my PC ready to use, and an update might fix it.&nbsp; it prompts me to connect to the internet, and restarts.&nbsp; that's not the problem, the problem is, i've done this 7 times.&nbsp; I would like to know exactly what is

            Hello,
<br />
<br />I suggest you perform a clean install, mech better than resetting to factory settings..
<br />Create a Windows 10 installation media on a USB flash drive (8 Go min) from this website after careful reading of the instructions on it. 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />Then connect the W10 installation USB flash drive to your PC, next start your PC and immediately press the required key (see note (1) at the end of the message) to access the boot menu and select the USB flash drive to boot on it. 
<br />Then perform the new installation of W10 following the instructions displayed by the installer. 
<br />During installation, do not provide a product key, W10 will be activated automatically via the digital license of your PC. 
<br />On the "Where do you want to install Windows" screen, delete the partition (s) intended to receive Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />The access key to the boot menu depends on the manufesturer and model of your PC, look at the list below

            Hi Matthew.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />The problem is likely that the Reset choked to death on a corrupt install.  This is the reason no tech enthusiast will even run a factory or Upgrade install because they'd expect endless issues like this.  
<br />
<br />The solution is to follow these illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media (if necessary on another PC) install the Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key here:  <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn everything that works best and how to apply it with your own hands.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

                    <p>I want to display wirelessly from my computer to my TV. My dxdiag says : Miracast: Not Supported by Graphics driver. All the information I can find on the GTX 970 says it should support this feature. I want to get the Microsoft widi adapter but don't want
 to waste my money if its not going to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've cleaned my computer of graphics drives and reinstalled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've updated my chipset drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm on a custom build with a windows 7 to windows 10 upgrade. What gives? why doesn't this work?</p>

    <title>How to display different virtual desktops on different monitors - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to display different virtual desktops on different monitors</h2>
                    <p>I like the new virtual desktop feature in windows 10. Finally !! they decided to implement that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I however would like to be able to setup different desktops on different monitors. Here is a simple scenario.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I setup two virtual desktops lets call them desktop 1 and desktop 2. Now I have two monitors on my machine, monitor 1 and monitor 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what I would like to have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Display Desktop 1 on Monitor 1 and Desktop 2 on Monitor 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I distribute my windows across the two desktops and here is where the problem starts. When I activate Desktop 1, i see all the windows there on Monitor 1 but Monitor 2 goes blank (just the wallpaper shows). When I activate Desktop 2, I see the windows there
 on monitor 2 but now monitor 1 goes blank (just the wallpaper shows).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to able to activate both dektops at the same time on different monitors. Anybody else out there that was able to do this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>Hi Ravindra,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was going to ask for the same feature as this person is explaining.&nbsp; Is there any way of putting this in as a feature request.&nbsp; If so, where would the feature request need to be submitted.&nbsp; I think it's something that the virtual desktops is missing, being
 able to have 2 virtual opened on two different screens.</p>

<p><span>It completely defeats the purpose of wanting to have multiple desktops. It just shows a lack of oversight that no one ever considered a user who has&nbsp;multiple monitors.</span></p>

<h2>            Deleted HDAudio.sys&#59; HDAudiobus.sys and .info files</h2>
                    Hello, I have been having serious sound issues with sound reversal on my corsair headset, and was browsing their forums and came across a fix that said these two drivers were the source of the issue.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So I followed a fix I found over there that suggested deleting the files; I failed to take my plenty of years experience in computers into consideration and did NOT make back ups.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Now my headset works fine, but my surround sound speakers that are plugged into the 3.5mm jacks on the back of my MB are not working; and they do not show up in the playback devices as before.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?<br />
<br />
EDIT: In device manager, High Definition Audio Controller has a yellow exclamation point; and I have tried finding the driver but it obviously has been removed from my computer completely; through the route of changing ownership to myself and deleting the files.

            Bump as help is still needed. I have installed the codec and drivers and still no sound comes from the speakers plugged directly into the colored 3.5 mm jacks on the motherboard.

<h2>            Windows Live Writer has stopped working.</h2>
                    I have been trying for some time now to get Windows Live Writer working--it never has. &nbsp;Every so often, I'll give up, but it keeps getting&nbsp;recommended&nbsp;to me, and that will bring me back to try again. &nbsp;It has been uninstalled/reinstalled/repaired numerous
 times over several months, but so far, nothing. &nbsp;

            Obviously, you have Windows Live Writer installed,&nbsp; otherwise you wouldn't have the activity log.<br />
<br />
And while having the activity log reported here, you don't mention the type of blog that you're trying to connect to;&nbsp;&nbsp; which blog service.<br />
<br />
Windows Live Writer is compatible with several&nbsp; blog services.&nbsp; Common problem with gaining access to these blog services is not putting in the correct URL, user ID and password.<br />
<br />
Maybe you could give us some more information about which blog service you're trying to log into,&nbsp; and in the meantime just verify your user ID and password.&nbsp; You may want to go so far as to copy and paste the information,&nbsp; so that you can verify that when
 you're logging into Windows Live Writer, trying to create a new blog account,&nbsp; that you're pasting the correct information.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps... <br />
<br />
Later,<br />

            I am trying to connect to Blogger, however I don't actually get far enough to input that information into Writer. &nbsp;The program crashes essentially&nbsp;immediately--occasionally, but not often I will see a splash screen, but generally the error message is the
 first thing I see after attempting to start the program. &nbsp;It is possible that at some point in the past I was able to input that information--if so it was long enough ago that the password at least probably has changed--so perhaps it has been retained in some
 file which has survived the numerous un/re-installations
<div><br />
<div>Many thanks,</div>

            Seeing that you have already tried to reinstall Windows Live Writer several times and it's made no impact work progress into getting it work, I have three immediate suggestions…<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; update Internet Explorer to the latest version, if you haven't already.&nbsp; Windows Live Writer requires several components from Internet Explorer to function correctly.&nbsp; even if you don't use Internet Explorer as your default browser,&nbsp; you still have to update
 Internet Explorer for Windows Live Writer.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; update .NET&nbsp; on your machine to the latest version,&nbsp; version 4. according to the activity log that you supplied,&nbsp; it shows that you're using version 2…<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CDcQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fdownload%2Fdetails.aspx%3Fid%3D17851&amp;ei=Qt5-UKGCIIPE9gSN84DgDQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNHw-GsFI2jHVlAfBtfobQM0I7EV9Q&amp;cad=rja" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CDcQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fdownload%2Fdetails.aspx%3Fid%3D17851&amp;ei=Qt5-UKGCIIPE9gSN84DgDQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNHw-GsFI2jHVlAfBtfobQM0I7EV9Q&amp;cad=rja</a><br />
<br />
3.&nbsp; if the first two options don't work for you,&nbsp; as a test,&nbsp; create a new user profile in Windows.&nbsp; switch over to the new user profile and try to start Windows Live Writer.&nbsp; some problems with Windows Live Writer have been linked to a corrupted user profile
 in Windows;&nbsp; the specific problems with user profiles being corrupted&nbsp; have never been disclosed,&nbsp; sometimes creating a new user account allows Windows Live Writer to start.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps... <br />
<br />

            I am already using the latest version of IE (9.1.0), but sadly even after updating .Net Writer still doesn't work. &nbsp;I tried creating a new user account, and it doesn't work there either, though on the new account it will let me input account information
 before it crashes.
<div><br />
<div>Since it would let me put in account information in the new windows user account, I tried it both with the blogspot blog that I want to use, and also with a newly created wordpress account. &nbsp;The program crashed for both.</div>
<div><br />
<div>However, I noticed in reviewing the update log that the .Net update didn't seem to take with regards to Writer, though Windows shows me using .Net version 4.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I tried repairing, but it still shows the same problem, and continues to try to use .Net version 2.</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the investigation of our Support Specialists, the logs indicate that the settings are failing to load.&nbsp;To troubleshoot the problem, please rename:
<strong>C:\Users\&lt;USERNAME&gt;\AppData\Local\Windows Live Writer</strong> to <strong>
C:\Users\&lt;USERNAME&gt;\AppData\Local\Windows Live Writer.OLD</strong> and <strong>C:\Users\&lt;USERNAME&gt; \AppData\Roaming\Windows Live Writer</strong> to
<strong>C:\Users\&lt;USERNAME&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Windows Live Writer.OLD</strong>. If the issue persists, kindly&nbsp;verify if&nbsp;you are&nbsp;able to open Writer under a new&nbsp;Windows Profile.</p>

<h2>            EM2012.exe is not responding</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Emergency 2012</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to run&nbsp;Emergency 2012 (a 2011 game) on my computer and my computer meets the min.&nbsp;requirement&nbsp;of the game. I can get to the menu then when i start the&nbsp;actual&nbsp;game play, the VDU turns black then back on, then black again. Eventually&nbsp;it popped out
 and said EM2012.exe is not responding. How can I solve this problem?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Keyboard Spacebar Stuck</h2>
                    <p>In addition to the trackpad issues, keyboard spacebar key sometimes remains "stuck" - any application I access, the spacebar key is depressed and I can't stop it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Happened twice, reboot didn't help. Rebooted a 3rd time, seemed to do the trick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure if anyone else is having issues, there's no way I'm keeping this beta product and won't recommend it to others.</p>

    <title>Win 7 Pro Configure Printer Port Error 0x0000007b - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ralph_reg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 7 Pro Configure Printer Port Error 0x0000007b</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an HP Photosmart 7510 printer on a home WIFI network. &nbsp;We received a new Cable Modem with WIFI and had problems getting the printer to print. &nbsp;I'm running Windows 7 Professional and checked the &lt;Printer Properties&gt; &lt;Ports&gt; and noticed that the printer
 was on a port CN25P352VT05PX with a description "HP network re-discovery port monitor".</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I attempt to configure the port or delete the port I receive the error "An error occurred during port configuration. Operation could not be completed (error 0x0000007b)". &nbsp;I've worked around the problem by adding a port with the printer IP address as
 a Standard TCP/IP Port.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The printer is working but I'd like to resolve this configure port problem if possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any suggestions you may have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ralph</p>

            <p>In case anyone else comes here in search of a solution ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It&nbsp;<em>appears</em> that the current generation of HP printer drivers are, once again, trying to be clever. &nbsp;In this case, it looks as though information identifying the physical device is stashed away in the driver somewhere (presumably in the port information).</p>
<p>
</p><p>That may not correlate with your experience, but that's what's caused this issue for me - a printer was replaced (an HP '276DW')&nbsp;<em>with an identical printer, and on the same IP address</em>. &nbsp;Replacing a printer isn't exactly an uncommon thing to have
 to do, but it appears that if you do so, it completely breaks whatever ports you might already have configured.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What worked for us was:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go into "Devices and Printers" (this is on a "Windows 7" box), find your errant printer, and remove it. &nbsp;If it's a multi-function device, you'll have multiple entries - remove them all.</p>
<p>Use the normal "Add Printer" wizard. &nbsp;Fill in the blanks, let it auto-detect everything, et voila!</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's about 1/2 hour of my time utterly wasted, so let's hope that information helps someone else :-)</p>

<h2>            &#91;Malabal Tor Adventurer&#93; Achievement - 39&#47;40</h2>
                    
<p>Seeing as I cannot get an answer on this from the TESOnline Team on Twitter and I do not have an unexpired invitation code for the actual ESO Forums for Xbox One, I came here.</p>
<p>Currently in-game, as many people already know, The Prisoner of Jathsogur quest in Malabal Tor is heavily bugged yet won't receive immediate attention as the fix cannot be implemented in as a simple Hotfix. It's a bit more complicated than that so we most
 likely won't see a fix for another 2-3 weeks at best.</p>
<p>I am here to ask about the Adventurer Achievement in this zone, hoping that someone may hold the answer. I am currently at 38/40 quests completed in Malabal Tor &amp; I have one that is ready for turn in to bring that up to 39. Now I am still going to be short
 a single quest, and I am curious if the quest within the Tempest Island dungeon count towards the achievement. I could just bring it to the test myself and jump in but I am leveling strictly with friends and today isn't a day that will work for us, but due
 to my wondering mind, I have an itch to know now if it will work or not!</p>
<p>Does anyone know, or do you have any possible insight? Anything is greatly, and deeply appreciated. I hope everyone enjoys the game!</p>

<h2>            Buy a PS4 its better</h2>
                    <p>Did&nbsp;anybody else have several times problems with the diskdrive?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Well i bought a xbox. After a few month i could contact the support the first tim out of four. My xbox didnt read any disk no more. I dont se credit cards so i prefered to buy a new xbox while the old one was send in to the support. After two weeks they sendet me a new xbox back so i sold this one. I lost 80 sFr. Arround 80$. So far säthere is not much to complaine because it was my will to buy a new one. But this is repeating now the 4th time and my lost is now arround 320$ plus the time it takes to reinstall all my games and apps. They did send me xbox live for free as a sorry. But if you try to enter this code it says infalid. Just for new costumers. I want to finish so my last point is the support. They did reactivate my going support request so now i have to pay 160$ more just to repair it because i forgot to send it with dhl. Thanks a lot microsoft you lost a very good costumer but hey there are enouthg other people to rip off.</p>

</p><p>So you had a problem with your X1's optical drive, sent it in for repair, while it was out for repair you bought another X1. When your original X1 FINALLY&nbsp;returned from the xbox repair center you sold the newest X1 and thought. "Cool, MS repaired my xbox." only to have to keep sending it back for the same repair over and over again? Is that correct?&nbsp;</p>
<p>If so, then at least in N, America, you aren't alone. For xbox's repair centers, as well as Sony's I will add. Are a joke! Made&nbsp;even worse by the invalid Xbox live code consolation prize they sent... So... Double whammy!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Things aren't much different over at Sony, so don't get your hopes up too high. For bad business practices and shames of in warranty repairs seems to be the norm these days by BOTH companies.&nbsp;</p>

 </blockquote> <p>Sony does a better job of moderating negative comments, and for that matter, ANY threads. My day one X Box, set up that Christmas on the 27th, finally got traded in at GameStop because of drive problems. My friend's PS4, a little less than 2 years old, started having drive problems; off to GameStop for a trade. As Goth has said, "<strong>I have both and enjoy both. They're also cheap like Xbox Ones are.</strong>". Even cheaper with a trade in credit. Lol.</p>

 </blockquote> <p>yeah i think you are right. Exactlly this was my problem. I just doesnt think its ok just because its a console. Imagine a car company selling you 4 times a car with damaged breaks. I paid a lot to microsoft but to be fair im going to get sony a chance i dont even care anymore about my games i allrady have. By the way they are all downloaded because of my never ending issues. Im not violent but im pissed. Very bad costumer support. Im disapointed i was with xbox now for years and invested a lot. Well thanks for your replays guys. Hope you dont get the same.</p>

 </blockquote> <p>i dont think you did get my point. Ive got enouthg money thats not my problem i could buy 4 more xbox one. Its the fact that they wasted a lot of my time by calling them and walking to the shop to buy a new one. I dont use credit cards i pay everything cash so i had to buy a new one for the time they needet to repair. At the same time i broke my back so it was a lot of stress for nothing. Thats why my xbox runs a lot. So in a country like switzerland which is pretty expensive its not ok to sell rubish like this. Now after the xbox one which i just bought new doesnt work again. Im done. And i bought games and ingame contant for a few 100 a month sometimes. Everytime the consoledidnt work again i had to reinstall. Its like apple vs samsung. Apple is ok but samsung just makes the race. Still thanks for your few.</p>

            Hello <br />
If the error code you are getting 8024402f.<br />
You have the other requirement that on update page says recent checks for update as NEVER.<br />
Here is possible solution This is the second week a possible solution has been found tally so far 19 out of 20 computers using either Windows 64bit and Vista32bit have been corrected.<br />
<br />
I have had this problem as well and tried alot of recommendations but none apparently worked.On the update box on my computer has&nbsp; recent time update tried had NEVER.<br />
So if you have this maybe this will work for you I tried quite a path with all having the same apparent result with the error 8024402F Coming up.<br />
This is such a mad mad world we live in (murphies law seems to be in control.)<br />
Do exactly the opposite what is logical<br />
First set your update setting to NEVER RECEIVE UPDATES, then UNTICK the two boxes below if they are ticked (one about any one can update,) and the other about being informed about available updates.(That one a box comes up are you shore you want not to be notified
 etc.)<br />
NOW USING MURPHIES LAW&nbsp; Leave all settings as is eg NOTHING SHOULD WORK<br />
NOW CLICK THE UPDATE BUTTON SURPRISE SURPRISE YOU NOW CAN UPDATE.!!!!!<br />
After updating ,check for further updates after the first batch.<br />
Then the settings can be put back to normal eg Receive updates Automatically, the tick the other two boxes.<br />
<br />

<p>My LB button on my Xbox One controller became loose about 1 hour ago, I can't get it to go back in and I'm having trouble with it. I can pull the left part of my LB button up and see the inside of it, but it won't click back in. Idk if it broke or what.</p>

<p>This seems like a controller hardware issue already. I would best advise you to send it in for replacement. You can process your replacement order here -

                    <p>Good day</p>
<p>
</p><p>My hardware sticker indicates that I have a Windows 10 Pro digital license, I installed Windows 10 Pro accordingly.</p>
<p>Now when I try activate my digital licence it says that I have a Home Single Language licence and must install correct version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise how this is possible and what could be the cause of this, I have activated many machines without fail in this regard but today suddenly things changed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please revert with reasons and a fix to resolve urgently to activate the Pro version which is what I require.</p>

            Hi Michael, this is a known issue with the Microsoft Activation servers at the moment, you do not need to do anything, this matter will be resolved automatically
<br />
<br />Quote From Chat Support 
<br />" 
<br />Microsoft has just released an Emerging issue announcement about current activation issue related to Pro edition recently. This happens in Japan, Korea, American and many other countries.I am very sorry to inform you that there is a temporary issue with Microsoft's activation server at the moment and some customers might experience this issue where Windows is displayed as not activated. 
<br />Our engineers are working tirelessly to resolve this issue and it is expected to be corrected within one to two business days.

            Microsoft are aware of a problem with their activation servers which is affecting Windows 10 Pro users, the error states they have a home license.
<br />They’re working on a solution which may take a day or so.

    <title>Windows update installation Error Code OXC0000142 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows update installation Error Code OXC0000142</h2>
                    <p>*Original Title: <strong>Problems seemingly caused by Windows Update since 10th December 2014</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>My 5 months old computer came with Windows 8.1 X64 pre-installed and I created Recovery Disks when I first got it home. I have Windows Update set to advise me when updates are available so that I can choose to download them. On 10th December I was advised
 that a number of optional and important updates were available. I chose to install all of the important updates and one of the optional. They downloaded OK, but the installation seemed to get stuck part way through the installation. I left it overnight to
 see if the installation would complete. It didn't.<br />
<br />
I then thought to Restart the computer and try downloading the updates again. The Restart screen with the circling dots appeared, quickly followed with a small window saying that cmd.exe was unable to start correctly and advising Error Code OXC0000142 and to
 click OK. However, before I could click OK, the window closed. But the computer just got stuck again, showing the Restart screen. I left it for a lengthy period before deciding to turn the computer off and then back on again manually. After starting the computer
 again manually, it advised that Windows Configuration was undoing changes previously made.<br />
<br />
I then went back to Windows Update and again tried to download and install the updates but ended up in the exact same loop outlined above.<br />
<br />
I then thought to try System Restore but that failed, presumably because of getting stuck at the Restart screen and having to turn off the computer manually which I am guessing prevented it from configuring the Restore point. Thinking that I might have picked
 up a virus or some kind of malware I ran a full system scan and boot scan with Avast antivirus, allowing it to fix the problems found. I then ran Spybot Search &amp; Destroy, allowing it to remedy problems found. Then I downloaded and ran **** Cleaner, again allowing
 it to make the recommended changes. Between each of those scans I attempted a Restart but every time ended with the same loop outlined above.<br />
<br />
I've now scanned the Microsoft forums and followed the instructions for how to use the System File Checker at
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833?wa=wsignin1.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833?wa=wsignin1.0</a> and got the result "Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them. Details are included in the CBS.Log %WinDir%\Logs\CBS\CBS.log." I've tried following the links
 "To repair the corrupted files manually, view details of the System File Checker process to find the corrupted file, and then manually replace the corrupted file with a known good copy of the file." by opening them in a new tab. But, I just seem to be re-directed
 to the same page that I started from.<br />
<br />
I have managed to locate the CBS.log and to open it in Notepad, but I am at a loss as to how to interpret this very lengthy file. However, I note that the end of it, it says:
<br />
<br />
"Transaction completed. All files and registry keys listed in this transaction&nbsp; have been successfully repaired<br />
2014-12-14 09:58:35, Info&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CBS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trusted Installer is shutting down because: SHUTDOWN_REASON_AUTOSTOP<br />

<br />
I am now at a loss as to how to proceed. The Command Prompt says that it "found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them." And yet the CBS.log file says "All files and registry keys listed in this transaction&nbsp; have been successfully repaired". Which
 should I believe? I am reluctant to use the Recovery Disks that I created, as I understand that they are for single use and that I would lose all of my data.<br />
<br />
Can you please help/advise me what to do next? Please bear in mind that I am retired and not especially tech-savvy. Thanks in anticipation.<br />
<br />
Mike K<br />

            Hello Mike,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>Based on the issue description, I understand that you are having issues installing the Windows updates after downloading the updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can understand how frustrating it could be when computer behaves unusual, but I really appreciate your efforts to resolve this issue.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To understand this issue better, please help me with the following information:
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>1. Have you connected any external devices other than mouse and keyboard?</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;Are you&nbsp;able to install other update offered to you? </p>
<p>3. Is the issue specific while installing any particular update?</p>
<div>4. What is the KB article number of Windows updates installed or failed to install on the computer?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<p>
</p></div>
<div>It seems there are some important updates which are required by Windows 8.1 downloader and if it finds those updates missing in a computer, it shows the error message.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><div>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong> I Suggest you to run Windows update troubleshooter and check if it helps</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might be able to automatically fix some problems by running the Windows update troubleshooter.</p>

</p></div>
<div>
<p><strong>Method 3:</strong> If the issue still persists, I Suggest&nbsp;you to run DISM tool command.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">a.&nbsp;Press Windows key + X key together on the keyboard.</p>

<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">e. To close the Administrator: Command prompt window, type Exit, and then press Enter.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</p></div>
<div><strong>Method 4:</strong> If you have any third party security software installed on the computer, let’s uninstall it and check if that’s the cause for the failed installation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Important Note:</strong> Security software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software,
 you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</div>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Thank you for your reply. To answer your questions:<br />
<br />
1. No external devices connected to my computer other than mouse and keyboard. I presume that speakers and modem/router do not count.<br />
<br />
2. Update reports the following as being successful: KB3013126, KB3012199, KB3013410 and KB3013769.<br />
<br />
3. &amp; 4. The Update process "hangs" with the following: KB3008923, KB3008925, KB2976978, KB2989930, KB2994290, KB3004394 and KB3013816. I have tried installing them both as a collection and individually. Each type of attempt produces the same abortive result.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1</strong><br />
<br />
Followed your link to run Windows update troubleshooter and chose "Open with Diagnostics Troubleshooting Wizard". Firefox appeared to save it rather than run it. BUT I could not find it anywhere in my Save folder. However, I found the troubleshooter in Control
 Panel and ran it from there. It suggested running it as an Administrator, which I did. It reported problems found and fixed
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I ran Windows update again. Again, it "hung" when trying to install the 7 updates mentioned in "3 &amp; 4." above. Thinking that perhaps I should have restarted my computer to allow the changes made by the troubleshooter to come into effect, I ran the troubleshooter
 again, restarted and then tried installing the updates one by one. I was successful with KB2989930, KB3004394, KB3008925, and KB2994290. The following updates were not successful: KB3008923, KB2976978, and KB3013816.
<br />
<br />
Would it be of any help to attempt to manually download and install the problematic updates?<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2</strong><br />
<br />
I would rather NOT embark upon this path unless it becomes absolutely imperative. The reason is that I feel myself to be utterly incompetent and lacking in confidence when it means "messing" with the Registry. To use a metaphor - I can drive a car, but would
 not consider "messing" with the engine or electrics.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 3</strong><br />
<br />
I ran "DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scan health" and got this result:&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Error= 87<br />
DISM doesn't recognize the command-line option "health"</p>
<br />
I have not run "DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restore health"&nbsp; since I neither know nor understand whether or not it is dependent upon the first command being run successfully.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 4</strong><br />
<br />
Uninstalled Spybot Search &amp; Destroy after restoring the changes it had made resulting from the single use that I had made of it. I made another attempt to download/install one of the previously failed updates but it failed again and followed the previous pattern.
 Since you said: "In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done." so I allowed Avast antivirus to remain active. However, having
 checked that program's settings, there is not an option to disable it temporarily. Checking the Action Center in Control Panel, it advises that there is an anti malware program called "|Obit Malware Fighter" but which is turned Off. I cannot locate it anywhere
 in order to uninstall it.<br />
<br />
Your final reference to "Update to Windows 8.1 from Windows 8" appears to me to be redundant since 8.1 came pre-installed on this computer.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you for your patience in trying to help me with this problem.<br />
<br />
<br />

            Hi Mike,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for replying&nbsp;with detail&nbsp;of required information.</div>
<div>Based on you reply, I understand&nbsp;that you are having issues installing 3 updates KB2994290, KB3004394 and KB3013816&nbsp;out of 7 updates.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I suggest you to place the computer in clean boot state the then try to install all the 3&nbsp;pending updates manually and check if it&nbsp;successfully installs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7,
 or Windows Vista. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.<br />

            Hi Rizwan<br />
<br />
Thanks for the reply. It looks like you might have mis-read my last message. Just for clarity, the updates which are causing me problems are (as I stated previously):
<strong>KB3008923, KB2976978, and KB3013816</strong>. Well, you read the last one of the three correctly ..... but I guess that you are a busy man, and it's only too easy to mis-read.<br />
<br />
Before I proceed to follow your last advice I have a few questions. Please bear in mind that what you are asking me to undertake means that I must operate well outside of my comfort zone, and that I am not especially technically or computer literate.<br />
<br />
1. What are the links for <strong>KB3008923</strong> and <strong>KB2976978</strong>?<br />
<br />
2. Should I download the installation files before placing the computer into clean boot state? Would it even be worth trying to install them normally by double clicking the files with Windows 8.1 in its normal state?<br />
<br />
3. When in the clean boot state, what applications (if any) will I have access to? Will I have internet access and access to things like the Desktop, File Explorer and Firefox? I think that I would need all of them in order to comply with your suggestions.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your patience - Being unfamiliar with this kind of stuff makes it quite scary for me.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your patient assistance.<br />
<br />

            <p>Hi Rizwan<br />
<br />
I have now downloaded the setup files for KB3008923 and KB3013816. But following your advice to search the Microsoft Download Center for KB2976978 was totally unsuccessful in retrieving anything that would link to a manually downloadable installation file.
 The best that it could offer was <a href="https://support2.microsoft.com/kb/2976978/en-gb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this Support page</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried installing KB3008923 and KB3013816 while running Windows 8.1 in normal mode but in both cases I get the message "Windows Update Standalone Installer - The update is not applicable to your computer". Would this be because my computer is X64 based
 and both of those files have the suffix X86?<br />
<br />
I have read and understood "<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to perform a clean boot in Windows</a>". However, under "What is next when I have a clean boot environment?" I am not able to follow the link for "How to start the Windows Installer
 service when system services are not loaded". (I'm using Firefox, if that makes any difference). It simply loops back to the original source page regardless of whether I click in the page or right click and choose "Open Link in New Tab". Can you please provide
 that information?<br />
<br />
So, before I can feel confident enough to proceed to trying your clean boot suggestion,
<strong>I think that I need answers to three questions</strong>:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What services/applications will be available to me in clean boot mode? <strong>
Specifically, will I have internet access and access to Windows Update, Firefox and File Explorer?</strong> (I have asked this of you previously, but have not received a substantive reply).<br />
<br />
2. Can you provide manually downloadable links for KB2976978, KB3008923 and KB3013816
<strong>which are appropriate for my Windows 8.1 computer?</strong> (System Information advises that I'm running Windows 8.1, Version 6.3.9600 Build 9600). The download links that you previously offered for two of those three were deemed "Not applicable to
 your computer" by my machine.<br />
<br />
3. How do I get the instructions linked to in <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
KB929135</a>, and as outlined above, to "How to start the Windows Installer service when system services are not loaded"?<br />
<br />
In conclusion, may I say that I am not trying to prevaricate? You are a Microsoft Support Engineer and perhaps this all appears so, so easy to you - I am a humble and relatively new computer user with almost zero technical knowledge, skills or ability. What
 looks easy to you seems to appear rather scary to me. Please try to understand that! I really want to get this problem sorted out once and for all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am deliberately being so ultra-cautious simply because of the advice contained in
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">your clean boot advice page</a> - "We strongly recommend that you do not use the System Configuration utility to change the advanced boot options on the computer unless a Microsoft support engineer directs you
 to do this. Doing this may make the computer unusable."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, dear me, just why am I afflicted with this problem? and exactly what is the responsibility of Hewlett-Packard (the manufacturer) or indeed, Microsoft?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you celebrate it, then do have a Happy Christmas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards</p>
<p>

            Hello Mike,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thank you for your Christmas wishes and replying precisely with detailed information.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Based on your reply I understand that you managed to download the setup files for KB3008923 and KB3013816 directly from the Microsoft Download Center, but in attempt to install them in normal mode as I had suggested in my previous response you get an error
 "Windows Update Standalone Installer - The update is not applicable to your computer".
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Yes, as you have mentioned it right the probable for that error could be because if you have downloaded the 32 bit version of download on 64 bit Windows 8.1 Operating System.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
To answer your question&nbsp;"under "What is next when I have a clean boot environment?" I am not able to follow the link for "How to start the Windows Installer service when system services are not loaded". (I'm using Firefox, if that makes any difference). It
 simply loops back to the original source page regardless of whether I click in the page or right click and choose "Open Link in New Tab".
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I suggest you to use Internet Explorer and&nbsp;just left click once&nbsp;from the mouse on to the option
<strong>"How to start the Windows Installer service when system services are not loaded"
</strong>this will redirect you to the steps of How to start the Windows Installer service. If you still have issues refer to my answer to your 3rd question.</div>
<div>&nbsp;<br />
Answer to your 3 questions:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Q1. </strong>What services/applications will be available to me in clean boot mode?&nbsp; Specifically, will I have internet access and access to Windows Update, Firefox and File Explorer? (I have asked this of you previously, but have not received a substantive
 reply).<br />
<strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, you will have access to all Microsoft applications and services except the third party services and applications.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Q2.</strong> Can you provide manually downloadable links for KB2976978, KB3008923 and KB3013816 which are appropriate for my Windows 8.1 computer? (System Information advises that I'm running Windows 8.1, Version 6.3.9600 Build 9600). The download links
 that you previously offered for two of those three were deemed "Not applicable to your computer" by my machine.
<br />
<strong>Answer: </strong>The Direct download link for KB3013816 on your windows 8.1 64 bit is:</div>
<div>Update for Windows 8.1 for x64-based Systems (KB3013816)<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=45194" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=45194</span></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
There is no direct download link for KB2976978 and KB3008923 for Windows 8.1 64 bit, I suggest you to kindly follow the manual procedure of placing the computer in clean boot state and install the KB2976978 and KB3008923 updates.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>How to perform Clean boot in Windows 8.1</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. Press Windows key + R key together on the keyboard. </div>
<div>2. In the Run command search box type msconfig in the search box, and then tap or click How to start the Windows Installer service when system services .
<div>3. On the Services tab of the System Configuration dialog box, tap or click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box, and then tap or click Disable all.</div>
<div>4.On the Startup tab of the System Configuration dialog box, tap or click Open Task Manager.
<div>5.On the Startup tab in Task Manager, for each startup item, select the item and then click Disable.
<div>6.Close Task Manager.</div>
<div>7.On the Startup tab of the System Configuration dialog box, tap or click OK, and then restart the computer.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Q3.</strong> How do I get the instructions linked to in&nbsp; KB929135, and as outlined above, to "How to start the Windows Installer service when system services are not loaded"?<br />
<strong>Answer: </strong>1. Press Windows key + R key together.<br />
2. In the Run command search box type services.msc<br />
3. Hit Enter or click on OK.<br />
4. Locate for Windows Installer Services in Services Windows.<br />
5. Right click on Windows installer services and select restart.<br />
6. Set the Startup type to Automatic.<br />
7. Click on Apply and OK.<br />
<br />
This procedure will start the Windows installer service if it is stopped.<br />
<br />

            Hi Rizwan<br />
<br />
First, apologies for the delay in updating you but I've been away from my own home for five days for the Christmas holidays, and so I have not had access to my desktop PC..<br />
<br />
I've now followed your instructions to try installing the three outstanding Windows Updates in Clean Boot mode. Before I did so I ran the Windows Update troubleshooter as an administrator. When in clean boot mode I encountered the exact same difficulty with
 installation as has been apparent in normal mode. The three updates appeared to download but again the installation seemed to get stuck and would not complete.<br />
<br />
When exiting the clean boot mode and being prompted to restart, the computer again got stuck on the Restarting screen with the circling dots and I got the Error Code OXC0000142 again. To complete the restart I had to switch the power off and then back on again.<br />
<br />
So, it seems like little progress, if any has been made. What should I try next?<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
<br />

            Hi Rizwan<br />
<br />
Thanks for your most recent advice with the corrected command line for DISM. I have now attempted to run that command line in an elevated command prompt. The operation appeared to be progressing to 40.0% when it suddenly aborted and jumped to 100.0%. What follows,
 between the rows of asterisks is what I have copied/pasted from the command prompt window:<br />

Clearly the operation failed, but I do not know what "Error: 0x80240021" means. Similarly, I do not know how to interpret the lengthy log file which it generated. I adain tried installing the updates, and perhaps it goes without saying that they still keep
 sticking part way through the installation.<br />

I shall await your further advice. Happy New Year!<br />

            <p>Andre, thank you very much for your speedy reply! Shortly after posting my question i opened my start menu and noticed that Windows wanted me to shutdown/restart my computer to install updates (note that this wasn't the case earlier). So I restarted my computer
 and re-ran MGADiag and now the validation code says "0", so I assume that means the problem is solved, correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again, thanks for your quick response!</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: Windows had installed some updates yesterday or the day before and I believe that may be what triggered the issue.</p>
