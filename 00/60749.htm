                    <p><strong>Original Title</strong>: Windows 10 File Explorer</p>
<p>
</p><p>File explorer has started going into search mode when I open it instead of bringing up my folder tree.&nbsp; A green bar works it's way across the screen and says "Working on it".&nbsp; It started doing that in Quick Access Mode and now it does it in This PC mode

</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 3</strong>: <strong>Test for picture files that may contain corruption</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Corrupt images can sometimes issues with Windows Explorer. If Windows Explorer stops working while working with pictures or browsing folders that contain pictures, there may be corruption is one or more picture files. To test for this issue, follow
 the steps below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Click Start and click Computer</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click Organize and select Folder and search options from the dropdown</span></p>
<p><span>3. On the Folder Options window, click the View tab </span></p>
<p><span>4. Place a check in the option to always show Icons, never thumbnail</span></p>
<p><span>5. Remove the check for the option to Display file icon on thumbnails</span></p>
<p><span>6. Click OK to close the Folder Options window</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Now, go to any folders that contain Pictures or Videos and see if you can reproduce the issue. If Windows Explorer does stop working, the folder that you were viewing possibly contains one or more pictures files that are corrupt or contain corrupted
 thumbnail data. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Note:</strong> After adjusting the options to Display file icon on thumbnails, and Always show Icons, never thumbnail, files no longer display thumbnails so pictures and other files will display as the default icon for their file types.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you can reproduce the error with these options set, the issue is not with pictures or videos and you should return the Folder options to their original settings.</span></p>

            <p>I am experiencing this too, and it has nothing to do with any of the aforementioned possibilities you mentioned. In fact, ever since the "Anniversary Update", the issue has worsened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's an example of a new problem I've experienced since the anniversary update:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just now, I was using Explorer to rename some video files in a folder. Each time I would rename a file, the green "working" bar would start up- perhaps, I thought, Windows is re-indexing the newly renamed file- but even if it was, that green bar moved so
 slowly, and for such an extended period of time (it kept on for at least 30 seconds before I killed it), that it's clear it's just one of those buggy Windows glitches that we experienced, long-time Windows users are ever so familiar with. And no, the folder
 does not contain a lot of files- it only contains 10 video files, so it's not as though it was processing a lot of files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each time I renamed another file, I had to click to the X at the end of the bar to stop whatever it was doing- it was just out of control annoying. This problem certainly has nothing to do with my video driver- or corrupt files- these video files were newly
 added to my drive, and my drive/files have had no problems or signs of corruption.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The anniversary update also changed some major settings for my Windows audio that I had to hunt down and reconfigure, but that's for another post.</p>

            <p>1. Check your hard disk for errors and bad sectors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Disable any non-MS shell extensions using Nirsoft's ShellMenuView and ShellExView.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Check if the problem affects other user accounts too (create a new one temporarily for testing if required).</p>

            <p>FIXED!!!</p>
<p>All you have to do is to disable windows search.</p>
<p>Press windwos button and r&nbsp;</p>
<p>Type msconfig</p>
<p>Go to service&nbsp;</p>
<p>Find windows search</p>
<p>Ucheck tickbox</p>
<p>Apply then okay</p>
<p>It will say id you want to restart click on restart</p>
<p>This will fix the problem by disabling it you cant search anymore in file explorer but it will fix it</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it works&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks Ahmed,</p>
<p>The sixty second fix!!!! After hours and hours of trying out other suggestions</p>
<p>I can still go straight to the directories or files that I want, and even do global searches for single words, which, with over 75,000 files is what I need to do and what file explorer is capable of.</p>

                    Hello, I'd like to post a friend's music to Facebook and it seems I need to convert it from mp3 to mp4. &nbsp;Is there a built-in Windows method of doing this (I use 8.1), or a trustworthy online site I could use? &nbsp;Any advice will be much appreciated as I am
 a complete novice at this sort of thing! &nbsp;Many thanks.

<br />
=============================<br />
<br />
If needed re-install/update the drivers :<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - SOUNDS - look for HD Audio - Mine says RealTek High Definition Audio&nbsp;<br />
(that is an example and yours may have an entirely different name/maker).<br />
<br />
Write down description make and model - double click on it - drivers tab - write down version. Now<br />
Click UPdate Drivers which may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers. Then RIGHT<br />
CLICK on it and UNINSTALL&nbsp;- REBOOT - this will rebuild the driver stack.<br />
<br />
1st go to system maker's site and look for latest driver Download - SAVE - go to right click on and RUN AS ADMIN<br />
(This is your fallback.) REBOOT after each driver installation.<br />
<br />
NOTE : Sound drivers often rollback so check the version after installation and the reboot to see if the
<br />
version you installed is there, if not repeat the install&nbsp;- reboot until it is. It can take several tries depending
<br />
on how many rollbacks it does.<br />
<br />
Then do same for Device Maker's site.<br />
<span><br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<h3> thomasrollison  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lost desktop shortcuts and links after the update.</h2>
                    <p>So all I was trying to do was relocate my personal files, downloads and music and such, following the EXACT prompts offered by the os. Location, move, apply, etc. Just stop filling my C drive with all of that and move it over to me secondary drive. Except
 Windows decided that now my downloads are my desktop and my desktop is completely gone ! Oh, okay. do a system recovery to a restore point before the last update. Great ! Except even worse. Desktop still completely awol. Bottom line my desktop with all of
 my most important links and shortcuts is gone. What the **** is the point of having prompts if all they do is fubar your computer?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If anybody thinks I can't follow a simple prompt just stop. The OS SUCKS ! It can't follow it's own prompts. So now what? Yet another rebuild of a windows computer? On and on and on. If I wanted to be a computer tech I would have gone to school for that.

            <p>It's far worse than I thought. The loss of all my desk top was just the most immediately obvious. I don't know what the **** is going on with Windows. It suddenly can't seem to do anything right. I was following the prompts for changing the location of user
 files by going into the properties of each folder, moving them off of the C drive and onto my second drive. The Desktop folder disappeared in the process, as did the actual desktop. I then did an exact reversal of the process. It did not magically reappear.
 Rather it did disappear from the new location only to then end up disgorged into the recycling bin ! I only discovered it by accident as I've been getting a ridiculous number of balloons stating that the recycling bin in a folder of my NASD server is corrupted
 and do I want to empty it? No matter how many times I say yes or no it comes back again and again and again. There is no recycling bin in that folder or any other folder on the server by the way. Maybe there should be?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>I looked at the properties of the recycling bin and found that it shows three locations! Local disk (C): 237GB available&nbsp;, Storage Space 929 GB available ( my second hard drive ), and my archival music folder on the server showing 0 GB available. Is this
 normal? Mean while when I looked inside the recycling bin I found all my desktop shortcuts, etc. not in a folder but all separate mixed in with a bunch of other garbage. I thought about just hitting 'restore all, but there was a bunch of stuff I really did
 not want to restore so I went through the really long process of deleting each of those first. Got through that, then hit the restore all and, of course, everything disappeared again ! This time it really looks completely gone. But even better, I then went
 into the folders I did think I had successfully moved only to find that the documents folder is completely empty as well. ( Yes, I told the computer to move all the files from the old to the new location when it asked). Gee, nothing important in there ! Just
 a lot of invoices and licenses and such ! But hey, look how nice and clean the recycling bin is!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can anybody possibly ask with any seriousness why people don't trust updates ? More often than not they only make more problems. But thank you, Microsoft, for making it impossible to not accept updates.&nbsp; Seems like utter contempt for your clients. Or
 should I say, soon to be ex-clients?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have no clue where my mail program went but when I click the mail button my outlook and or live.com emails are there.&nbsp; But when I try and send documents they say there is no file association check default settings.&nbsp; First of all the documents are all in
 zip folders now&nbsp;which they were not before the updates.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried going through default programs but no luck there.&nbsp; I can not figure out how to associate files with my computer or mail program.</p>

<h2>            Calendar App in Windows 10 PC Not Showing my iCloud Calendar Since I put in the wrong Information for iCloud</h2>
                    <p>I want to change the information for my icloud account; since I put in the wrong information. It's not coming up under manage accounts; but when I try to re add it; it says it's already added. I really need to get this fixed if anyone can help.</p>
<p>I went to settings&gt;manage accounts&gt;; expecting iCloud to come back up so I could fix it; but it didn't show. But as I said above; if I try to re-add it; I get a&nbsp; message that it's already added; but won't let me access it.</p>
<p>Anyone have any information on this? </p>

<h3> plush productions  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 1809 update &#34;Undoing changes&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I recently got the update installer for Windows 10 version 1809 and once it installed, it would restart then go to the updating windows screen. It would get about 15-16% done then it would restart. Upon rebooting, under the loading circle it would say undoing
 changes. I tried installing the update twice and both times it said undoing changes. After checking winver, it still said it was on version 1803. If you could possibly help me figure out what went wrong, that would be awesome! Thanks!</p>

            Hi Plush 
<br />
<br />My name is Fernando.  I am an Independent Advisor.  I am here to guide you with your updates.
<br />
<br />One option is you can try rolling back to the previous build.  I would recommend reset Windows 10 keeping your files and apps . . . 
<br />
<br />To do this
<br />1.	 Start your PC as Windows attempts to load and the spinning dots appear, press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds.  This is known as a Hard Shut Down
<br />(Do this twice )
<br />2.	Turn on your computer for the 3rd time and it should come up in the Recovery Environment
<br />3.	You will be prompted for System Repair/Safe Mode/Command Prompt
<br />4.	Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Revert to previous build of Windows 
<br />5.	If this is unsuccessful, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps,
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask me any questions and let me know how it goes. 
<br />
<br />Respectfully,
<br />
<br />Fernando Y.

<p>I Do have a couple of questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Would reverting to a previous version affect any programs installed?</p>
<p>2. If windows can't find a previous version and my only choice is to reset, is it possible to find another way without resetting my PC? If not, I do understand. I will choose to keep my files and I can just simply reinstall some programs. Although, some
 apps may need reactivation.</p>

            Hi,
<br />
<br />Try using the ISO file-If it fails, tell us to troubleshoot further.
<br />The fastest way to get the upgrade is through Media creation tool or ISO file.
<br />Please download Media Creation Tool from the link below and select Upgrade this PC at the first screen.

<br />All steps, including upgrading using ISO file and Media creation tool, are covered here:

 have a T100TA with a 32Gb drive and notice after a fresh install that there is 7Gb in a restore partition and wondered if it is safe to delete to gain more space IF it is safe to do so and how. I can install another OS if going that route is better.

            Hi Mick, that is a physically separate storage (not a partition) to the main storage on your device.
<br />
<br />It therefore cannot be merged into your C Drive to give you more storage
<br />
<br />Open a Command Prompt as Adminsistrator:
<br />
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter:
<br />
<br />diskpart
<br />
<br />A new Command Window will open
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter (then note down the drive number of that disc):
<br />
<br />list disk
<br />
<br />Run this command (replace driveNo with the drive number) and hit Enter:
<br />
<br />select disk driveNo
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter:
<br />
<br />online disk
<br />
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter:
<br />
<br />clean
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter:
<br />
<br />convert mbr 
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter:
<br />
<br />create partition primary
<br />
<br />Run this command (assign a drive letter not being used on your system) and hit Enter:
<br />
<br />assign letter=D
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt, can you then access that drive in file explorer?

<h2>            Blue screen when computer is idle</h2>
                    
<p>I upgraded 64 bit Vista to 64 bit Windows 7. The upgrade was easy and everything appears functional. When the computer is idle it will intermittently shut down with a blue screen and restart. This happens many times per day. I just paid for a license for
 a product that is more troublesome than the older product; so, why would I be charged $49 for you o fix it?</p>

<p>Hey gtragitt,</p>
<p>Thanks for posting in Microsoft answers!</p>
<p>a.&nbsp; Since when have you had this issue? <br />
b.&nbsp; Any changes made to the computer recently?<br />
c.&nbsp; Do you get any error message?<br />
<br />
The issue may be related to drivers. You may have to download and install the latest display and graphics drivers to fix the issue.</p>
<p>To download and update driver, you can use the following methods:</p>
<p>1. Use Windows Update. You might need to set Windows Update to automatically download and install recommended updates.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
2. Install software from the device manufacturer. For example, if your device came with a disc, that disc might contain software that installs a driver for the device.</p>
<p>3. Download and update the driver yourself. Use this method to install a driver that you download from the manufacturer's website. Do this if Windows Update can't find a driver for your device and the device didn't come with software that installs a driver.</p>
<p>Refer the below link for more details on the same:</p>
<p><strong>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</strong></a></p>
<p>If Windows can't find a driver for your device, and the device didn't come with driver software, you can look for a driver on the device manufacturer's website. Driver updates are often available in the support section of such sites.</p>
<p>Once you find the updated driver, follow the installation instructions on the website. Most drivers are self-installing—after you download them, you usually just double-click the file to begin the installation, and then the driver installs itself on your
 computer.</p>
<p>So, refer the manufacturer’s website for latest drivers.</p>
<p>If the drivers for Windows 7 are not available yet, you may download the Vista drivers and install the same in compatibility mode.</p>
<p>To install programs or drivers in compatibility mode, follow the below steps:</p>
<p>1. Open the Program Compatibility troubleshooter by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type troubleshooter, and then click Troubleshooting. Under Programs, click Run programs made for previous versions of Windows.</p>
<p>2. Follow the instructions in the troubleshooter.</p>
<p>Refer the below link for more details:</p>
<p><strong>Make older programs run in this version of Windows<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows</strong></a></p>
<p>Also, run a full system virus scan with an antivirus program with up to date virus database definitions to make sure your system is not infected with viruses.</p>
<p>You may also run an online scan from the below link:</p>

    <title>Blocked Microsoft Account and problem with unblocking - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Blocked Microsoft Account and problem with unblocking</h2>
                    <p>Old title: Blocked Microsoft Account</p>
<p>My Microsoft account is blocked. Actually at first my Microsoft Surface Pro 3 is blocked as I've tried install a second OS.
</p>
<p>After that I attempted to login at Microsoft account to get the BitLocker encryption key in https://onedrive.live.com/recoverykey. But I didn't receive security code by SMS on my phone ( earlier I get code by SMS on the same phone).
</p>
<p>After that I registered a new phone number, confirm the security code received by SMS.<br />
<br />
But this time my account is blocked for 30 days.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I talked once and chatted several times to get the account unblocked. I repeated the same story again and again but no solution. All my office file is on that surface pro 3 and I'm about to lose my Job because of not accessing my files. From Microsoft End there
 is no logical explanation of blocking my account.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Is there any solution?</p>
<p>

                    <p>Was watching a few videos on MSN.com and a few on Yahoo.com and I kept getting these dag blasted pop ups about flash storage and they kept on and on and, finally I just quit watching videos. I clicked on the question mark to see if I could figure out what

            <p><span>Hi Puttzk,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you so much for your reply. I apologize for the delay in responding to this thread.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let me provide you some information regarding this query. Normally, the flash player takes very less amount of space for the application to store the information and if the amount of space required
 is less, the user may not get the prompt for the permission to allow the space.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, the flash player and other plugins might also be used by some virus or malicious software applications on the computer and in such cases, the amount of space required by them would be higher.
 In this situation, the user gets the prompt asking for the permission to permit the required space, so that if the application that uses this space is from a trusted source, then the user can permit this and if not, then the user can block this application
 from accessing the space.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thus, this behavior is a part of the additional security for the Internet users using the flash player applications.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>Hope this is helpful. Please get back to us, if you have any further queries on this issue.</span>

<p>Hi</p>
<div>Maybe this can Help.</div>
<p><em><strong>---------------------<br />
</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>The following looks like a long story<strong> (it is only 600 words)</strong></strong></em>.<em><strong> I do not know what the user's overall knowledge is, and what exactly was already done. Thus the info goes through the motions
 of configuring and checking most of the common aspects of Windows OS' LAN features.</strong></em></p>
<p>All aspects should be checked, stating that it<strong> "worked before"</strong> , or perseverating on<strong>"I did Not do any thing</strong> ", is not a way to deal with<strong>current Sharing problems.</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>----------------------</strong> </em></p>
<p>Win7 when configured on peer-to-peer Network has <strong>three</strong> types of Sharing configurations.<br />
<br />
<strong>HomeGroup Network</strong> = Works only between Win 7 computers. This type of configuration makes it very easy to Entry Level Users to start Network sharing.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<strong>Work Network</strong> = Basically similar to the previous methods of sharing that let you control what, how, and to whom folders would be shared with.<br />
<strong><br />
&nbsp;Public Sharing</strong> = Public Network (like Internet cafe) to reduce security risks.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;For best results log to each computer's System Screen and set all the computers to be on a Network with the same name while each computer has its own unique name.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_name.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_name.jpg</a></p>
<p><br />
Make sure that the Software Firewall on each computer allows free local traffic. If you use 3rd party Firewall On, Vista/XP Native Firewall should be Off, and the active Firewall has to adjusted to your Network IP numbers on what is some time called the Trusted
 Zone (consult your 3rd Party Firewall instructions<br />
<br />
General example,&nbsp; <a href="http://www.ezlan.net/faq#trusted" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/faq#trusted<br />
</a><br />
Please Note that some 3rd party Software Firewalls keep blocking aspects of Local Traffic even it they are turned Off (disabled). If possible configure the Firewall correctly, or totally uninstall it to allow clean flow of local network traffic. If the 3rd
 party software is uninstalled or disables, make sure that Windows native Firewall is<strong> On</strong> .</p>
<p>------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>If your network is comprised of Win 7 only and you want a simple Network, use this.</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After configuring the Homegroup scroll down to the <strong>Permission/Security section.</strong></p>
<p>-----------------------------</p>
<p><strong>Networking&nbsp;Win 7 with other version of Windows as&nbsp; Work Network.</strong></p>
<p>In the Network Center, clicking on the Network type opens the window to the right.</p>
<p>Choose your type of Network. Notice the check mark at the bottom, and check/uncheck it according to your needs.</p>

<br />
<strong>When finished with the setting of the system it is advisable to Reboot all the hardware including the Router and all computers involved.</strong></p>
<p>-------------</p>
<p><strong>If you have Permission and Security issues, check the <strong>following</strong> settings.</strong></p>
<p>Point to the a Folder that meant to&nbsp; to be share. Right click and choose properties.</p>
<p>In the properties</p>
<p>Click on the Security tab shown in the pic bellow to the right) and check that the users and their permission (shown in the pic bellow center and left) are correctly configured. Then do the same to the Permission tab.</p>
<p>This screen shot is from Win 7, Vista's menus are similar.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/Permission-Security.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/Permission-Security.jpg</a></p>
<p><strong>In both the Security panel, and the Permission panel you have to highlight each User/Group and examine that the Permission Controls are checked correctly.</strong></p>
<p>When everything is OK, Reboot the Network (Router, and computer).</p>
<p><strong>* Note</strong> . The Groups and Users shown in the screen-shoot are just an example. Your list will look the way your system is configured.</p>
<p><strong>**Note</strong> . You have to establish specific users. <strong>Everyone</strong> means all of the users that already have an account and been established as users. It does not mean<strong> Everyone</strong> that feel that they would like to login.</p>
<p>---------------------</p>
<strong>***Note.</strong> Some of the processes described above are done Not for Windows sake but to compensate for different Routers and the way their firmware works and stores the info about the computers that are Networked.

 support they worked on it and said they could fix the problem for 80.00$.well thats as much as i paid for the printer so declined,was told that if i downloaded a driver for my printer and that should solve my problems,well i did this from lexmark,but problem
 persisted.so as a last resort i downloaded a driver tuner from lion for 30.00$ this was advertised as the fix i needed.well needless to say this did not fix the problem.now my printer is hooked up by usb cable,yet wifi light continues to blink,it was wifi
 connected but i got rid of the wifi and went to usb.but this is not the problem since printer functioned properly after i switched from wifi to usb.can somebody please help,i really need printer and scanner. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
