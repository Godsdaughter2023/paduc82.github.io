<h2>            Where can i see call duration&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>How can I see the call duration from a specific internet call to another skype username (not to a landline)?&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is not in usages as the forum suggests. Those are only sms and calls to landlines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new interface does not show call history within in the chats you had with a specific person/user. This used to be available</p>

<p><span>Hi,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>That feature is not yet available on the new Skype app. I’ll take note of your feedback and let our developers know about it. Let’s see if the
 feature will be added to the new Skype app. Please wait for further updates! </span>

<h2>            Vista&#58; Local only NO INTERNET</h2>
                    
<p>Currently, we have installed a new wireless router (Netgear N300) and my laptop is the only computer that does not connect to the internet. The little icon to the left of my screen just says ACCESS: LOCAL ONLY.</p>
<p>BASICALLY,</p>
<p>I have Windows Vista Home Premium, Toshiba Satellite Laptop</p>
<p>I can connect if I use a cable, but its an inconvenience</p>
<p>I can connect wirelessly at my friends' houses and public locations</p>
<p>I HAVE TRIED:</p>
<p>Various microsoft fixes such as restting TCP and something about DCHP Broadcasting</p>
<p>Disabling ipv6</p>
<p>Norton Removal tool- I cant seem to get this to work properly. I save it to my flashdrive, open it, and a black command promp opens for like 5 seconds and closes. nothing else happens afterwards</p>
<p>and messing around with various wireless properties and other stuff I cant remember</p>
<p>I have been without internet for about a week. If someone can help me, it would be much appreciated!!!</p>

<p>I'm assuming that you ###'ed out your router's IP address. That number would actually be helpful in the troubleshooting process to determine if you're actually getting a connection to the router. I should mention that giving your router's internal IP address
 isn't a breach in security and no one can&nbsp;identify&nbsp;it back to you (so it's safe to post it on the forums).</p>
<p>Destination host unreachable can mean a few things but without knowing which IP address sent back that response, it's hard to tell you what to do next. If you can post that, that would be fantastic!</p>
<p>Also, you may want to try updating the wireless drivers. If you visit the link below, choose Windows Vista and WiFi from the drop down boxes. The driver you're looking for should be&nbsp;<span><a href="http://www.csd.toshiba.com/cgi-bin/tais/support/jsp/modelContent.jsp?ct=DL&amp;os=&amp;category=&amp;moid=2226347&amp;rpn=PSLB8U&amp;modelFilter=L305-S5921&amp;selCategory=2756709&amp;selFamily=1073768663#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Atheros

<p>Go to &nbsp;support.xbox.com/.../offline-system-update-diagnostic-tool and then download OSUDT3 file and follow the directions. &nbsp;It took me 2 tries but it worked. &nbsp; Make sure that when you copy files to your flashdrive, you only copy files inside the $SystemUpdate
 folder and not the entire folder. &nbsp;Basically, you should only copy 8 .xvd files. &nbsp;Even if you don't hear the beeps as it says in the instructions, let the buttons go after 20-30 secs and the update should start automatically. &nbsp;Your console may turn on and
 off couple times, but the update should eventually complete.</p>

<h2>            PC is locked asking for System Start Password - Scam&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect my system has been hacked, and no, I did not fall for a call from someone saying my system has been hacked. I actually called them!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Long story:</p>
<p>I was having an extremely slow response using Yahoo mail, and while looking for some guidance on their help/support site, I ran across their support phone number...so I called them. They answered as the Yahoo support personnel...and after some long discussion
 they asked to assist by using the direct connect to view some stuff. He said the problem wasn't Yahoo but that my network has been hacked and said that I was infected with SpyEye. He provided me with a local pc specialist, and an 800 number to call if I'd
 rather not drive to the repairman. He quoted me multiple sets of fees dependant on which avenue I wanted to take.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Short story:</p>
<p>Once I was 'infected' I ran MalwareBytes, and another virus detector. No infected files were found. So I logged off for the night. This morning I powered up and was greeted with a System Startup Password was required. I've never seen this before. And I have
 been locked out of my system ever since.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to reboot and use the F8 to get to startup in safe mode, but for some reason the F8 function key would not function. Upon looking through these message boards I suspect that friendly Yahoo support guy had enabled the SysKey 'feature'. I tried to
 boot off my recovery disks but before it would boot from the dvds, I got the startup password required window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, now what do I do? Do I remove my hard drive and try to delete the syskey.exe files via another computer? I am running Win 10 on a HP Envy laptop. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>We understand your requirement in this regard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the description, I suspect that the problem lies with the compatibility of game on Windows 10 platform. Suggest you to check installing the games in compatibility mode.

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a. Download the game setup file from the developer's website.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">b.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Right-click on the game setup file and click on
<strong>‘Properties’</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">c. Click on the <strong>‘Compatibility’</strong> tab and check the box
<strong>‘Run this program in compatibility mode for’</strong> and select <strong>
Windows 8/8.1 </strong>or <strong>7&nbsp;</strong>operating system from the drop down menu and proceed with the installation. Once this is done, restart the computer and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">-OR-</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">d.&nbsp;Go to&nbsp;<strong><span>‘Compatibility’</span></strong> tab and click

<h2>            Windows 10 worthless&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I just bought a new laptop with Windows 10.&nbsp; My old laptop was Windows 7.&nbsp; Frankly, they need to go back to Windows 7 and actually wait to update until they have something that works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been on the site to look for ways to fix things over and over - I never once looked for help with Windows 7.&nbsp; I've called Microsoft several times to get things set up and fixed.&nbsp; One would think Microsoft would realize that Windows 10 is costing them
 immense of amounts of money just with technical help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, they take you into this account things that means they keep me out of my computer unless I have a password.&nbsp; This is my computer, not theirs!&nbsp; I finally found a way to correct that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, I tried using their Microsoft Edge web browser but I had to do so many steps for simple things, like in order to open something in my favorites I had to click on 'hub', then click on 'favorites', then the icons&nbsp;are so big that I had to page down several
 pages to get to the item I wanted.&nbsp; That's several more steps than just having a favorites icon on the top of the screen.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's easier to just type the name in again!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had all kinds of errors -&nbsp;video errors that blank the screen and you have to reboot,&nbsp;constant internet errors that require&nbsp;restarting the internet (doesn't matter if it's Internet Explorer or Edge - happens in both), &nbsp;and just the fact that everything
 is soooooooo slow.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just starting the computer in the morning takes forever!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My old laptop was five years old and was getting slow so I 'upgraded'.&nbsp; Frankly, it was much faster than this one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apple has to be laughing their way to the bank since Windows 10 came out.</p>

<h2>            Crashing While Reinstalling Windows</h2>
                    <p>Hi I recently bought some parts to build a new PC. When I first built it it worked for about four hours with no crashes. I was playing one of my favorite games with no issues. I then went on to Google Chrome and that is when the first crash happened. These
 crashes kept happening so I decided to wipe the hard drive and try reinstalling Windows. I was running Windows 10 before the crash so I tried reinstalling it. I keep running in the MEMORY_MANAGEMENT error when it gets about 7% installed. I have no idea what
 is causing this problem and I would like some help to try and figure out why my system keeps crashing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>Motherboard: Gigabyte H110M-A</p>
<p>CPU: Intel Core i5 - 6400 Quad Core</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Microsoft virtual Wi-Fi mini port adapter is an adapter which is used to turning a single piece of hardware and radio into virtually unlimited adapters. Virtual Wi-Fi is a software layer that abstracts the wireless LAN card hardware into multiple virtual
 adapters. This device is just a virtual device and it should not affect connecting the wireless network with the physical wireless adapter.</span></p>

            <p><span>Hi Greg_967,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Windows 7 installs the virtual device if a hosted network cable wireless adapter is present on the computer. This virtual device is used exclusively
 for performing software access point (SoftAp) connections.Enabling or disabling the wireless Hosted Network enables or disables both virtual Wi-Fi and SoftAP.
</span></p>
<p><span>a. Go to
<b>device manager.</b></span></p>
<p><span>Refer the link:
</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-Device-Manager" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Open Device Manager
</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>b. Right-click on the
<b>virtual adapter</b> and select <b>enable.</b></span></p>
<p><span>For further information refer the article:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd815252(v=vs.85).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Using Wireless Hosted Network and
 Internet Connection Sharing</span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A verified way to install the Network Editor, first is through command prompt “VMware-player-*.exe -e c:\vmptmp”.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>a. Click <b>
Start</b>, type <b>cmd</b> in the Start Search box, and then <b>
right-click</b> cmd in the Programs list.</span></p>
<p>
<span>b. Click <b>
Run as administrator</b>, and then click <b>Continue</b>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type the password, or click Allow.</span></p>
<p>
<span>c. At a command prompt, type the command, and then press<b> ENTER</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>Then in the c:\vmptmp folder locate the c:\vmptmp\network.cab file and extract (double-click the .cab file) the vmnetcfg.exe (Virtual Network
 Editor) file to the VMware Player working directory usually "C:\Program Files\VMware\VMware Player" or "C:\Program Files (x86)\VMware\VMware Player".&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>You can create a shortcut for it and place it with the VMware Player shortcut if you want easier access to it. It will take a while for the file
 to be fully extracted so tell the OP to make sure to let it complete properly.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 unable to update past ver 1703</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Up and&nbsp;though&nbsp;ver 1703 Windows 10 was able to update itself without problems.&nbsp; Ever since 1703 Window 10 updates fail to install.&nbsp; What is irritating is I often get the message "We can't tell if your PC has enough space to continue installing Windows 10.&nbsp;

 and just running my 500 gb&nbsp;C drive.&nbsp; &nbsp;If I could stop Windows from trying to update it wouldn't be so annoying, but since I can't it is quite frustrating.&nbsp; &nbsp;I just can't believe that MSFT can't fix this especially since the update precheck tells me everything

            Hi,
<br />Please tell if you are using Windows update or Media creation tool or update assistant. If you haven't tried Media creation tool, try it.
<br />
<br />Try updating to 1809 using Media Creation tool and if it fails let us know.
<br />
<br />The fastest way to get the upgrade is through Media creation tool or ISO file.
<br />Please download Media Creation Tool from the link below and select Upgrade this PC at the first screen.

<br />
<br />All steps, including upgrading using ISO file and Media creation tool, are covered here:

            Hi Scott.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />What I'd do at this point is install Media Creation Tool from this link, choosing the button to Install Tool Now and then open the installed app and choose Upgrade This PC Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the latest version (which you need anyway) and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />
<br />If necessary you can use another PC to create the bootable media or download the ISO to transfer  back to the problem PC and open the media or click to mount the iSO file, right click Setup to Run as Administrator.   
<br />
<br />If further problems then follow these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />These special steps lead up to if necessary choosing to save nothing when running the media which almost always works, and is close but not as good as a Clean Install which is also offered as an option.  Your files should always be backed up if you value them at all. 
<br />
<br />If these do not help then report back any verbatim error message or behavior.  
<br />
<br />If you want to temporarily block the update then immediately after it fails try running the Hide Updates tool downloaded and installed from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />If it won't find and hide the Update then you can set a Metered Connection to turn off Windows Updates for awhile until the version matures and you can try again using the method I suggest which always works best:   <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />Almost everyone with major version upgrade problems who Clean Installs the same version does not have those problems.  This Clean Install should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Scott, it depends on the age of your PC, if that is an older model, updates past 1703 will not be suitable to your hardware, especially your chipset and that may be why the updates are refusing to install . . .
<br />
<br />If your PC is not very old, version 1809 has been released, you should go straight to that version to bring your system up to date and make all previous updates obsolete . . .
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Temporarily disable any 3rd party Anti-virus you may have installed
<br />
<br />Then, double click the ISO and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

    <title>Windows 8.1 unable to boot, repair options unsuccessful - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 unable to boot, repair options unsuccessful</h2>
                    Hello, I hope someone will be able to help me.<br />
<br />
I got a BSOD last night (I think it referred to a page fault in nonpaged area). It was my second or third time for this to happen. However, since then, I haven't been able to boot into Windows. I have tried as many of the recovery options as I can. Obviously,
 the more information I can provide, the better my chances of someone being able to help me, so here goes:<br />
<br />
- If I boot up my PC, the Windows icon appears. The screen fades and I get a message "Diagnosing your PC". then under "Automatic repair" I can choose Restart or Advanced options.<br />
- If I click restart, the computer reboots, I get the following message:<br />
Your PC needs to restart. <br />
Please hold down the power button. <br />
Error code 0x00000074<br />
Parameters:<br />
0x0000000000000001<br />
0x0000000000000002<br />
0xFFFFF801973535C0<br />
0xFFFFF80199B68348<br />
- After searching for these error codes, I suspected a memory problem. However, I was able to do a memory check via the command line (under advanced options in Automatic Repair) and another memory check via the bios. Both checks were passed with no errors.
 I have three sticks of memory in the PC and I have tried booting with only one stick at a time but I the PC will not boot whichever stick I use.<br />
- I have tried refresh your PC your PC under advanced options, I get the message "There was a problem with refreshing your PC. No changes were made."<br />
- I haven't tried reset your PC as I don't want to lose all of my programs and settings associated with a reinstall unless it is the absolute last resort.<br />
- I have tried System Restore, it offered me the chance to restore to a save point 3 days ago which I attempted but it failed. Now when I try it, Windows says that there are no restore points available.<br />
- I have tried Start up repair, which does not succeed.<br />
- I have tried booting into safe mode (startup settings &gt; restart &gt; option 4) but I can't even get into safe mode.<br />
- I have tried a number of things from the command prompt. I have checked the log at windows\system32\logfiles\srt\srttrail.txt and It said that Wdf01000.sys was corrupt. I tried copying a new copy of this file over but it did not make a difference. Every time
 I attampt an automatic repair, it tells me either "Startup Repair has tried several times but still cannot determine the cause of the problem" or "x is corrupt" which seems to be a different file each time.<br />
- I have tried a memory test, chkdsk /f and Scf /scannow from the command line. The first two show no errors, the third won't start.<br />
- I have tried a virus check via the Avira Antivirus Rescue Disk which did not detect any problems.<br />
- I haven't tried System Image Recovery as my most recent system image is very out of date.<br />
- I have tried repairing using my Windows 8 installation disk but that just takes me to the troubleshooter I'm already using.<br />
<br />
I hope someone out there has another suggestion that I could try. I really don't want to have to reinstall Windows; it will take me forever to get everything back installed the way it is now.<br />
<br />
Any ideas? I'm open to trying anything and will try things that I have already tried again if you think it might help.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's really unfortunate that you are facing this issue. Your efforts to try and fix the issue is really appreciated.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>First, I would suggest you to unplug all external devices (expected keyboard and mouse) and try to start the PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The boot loader could be corrupted. I would suggest to follow these steps and check if it helps.<br />
a. Boot from the <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Windows 8 installation media</span>.</p>
<div>
<p>b. Click on <b>Repair your computer</b>.</p>
<p>c. Click on <b>Troubleshoot</b> and then select <b>Advanced Options</b>.</p>
<p>d. Click on <b>Command prompt</b> and type the following commands and press <b>
Enter</b> after each command:</p>
<p><b>Bootrec /fixmbr</b></p>
<p><b>Bootrec /fixboot</b></p>
<p><b>Bootrec /rebuildbcd</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if it helps.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Thank you for your help. Since I wrote the message above I have tried a few more things, one of which was trying to fix the boot loader as you described above. After each command I got a "successful" message, but it did not resolve my problem. However, I still
 had peripherals connected to the computer, so I'll try again with everything unplugged.
<br />
<br />
One thing that was a little puzzling was that after the /rebuildbcd command, the number of Windows installations found was 0.
<br />
<br />
However, even though I haven't found how to fix the problem, I think I found what has caused it. A thorough check on my hard disks (I used a Seagate Seatools boot disk) showed that my Windows drive failed the test and was reported to have bad sectors. This
 surprised me a little as it is a fairly new SSD. However, it is very likely to be the reason for my BSODs and my inability to boot.<br />
<br />
So I would like to know it you have any advice for saving this Windows installation, or will I have to reinstall a fresh installation? I'm hoping that there is still something I can do.<br />
<br />
I have cloned the Windows partition on the faulty SSD to another hard disk, hoping that I could repair the cloned installation on a healthy hard disk, but so far I have tried everything above and still no success.
<br />
<br />
If you have any further advice, I would be very grateful to hear it. As I said, I really don't want to have to reinstall Windows again but if it can't be helped, that's what I'll have to do.
<br />

</p><p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I've had an identical experience. After trying all of the approaches to solving the problem Jumm and RajithR describe, I still find myself as stuck
 as Jumm. My computer simply won't boot beyond the error message.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The problem started when I hard-booted my system, after Window's 8.1 presented a blue screen only. In all fairness, I had closed down a process,
 which led to the blue screen showing in the first place. Perhaps the hard-reboot happened before critical information could be written to the hard drive, but that's a guess.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The error message that keeps returning is:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Your PC needs to restart.</span></p>
<p><span>Please hold down the power button.</span></p>
<p><span>Error Code: 00000074</span></p>

Hi Rajith,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your suggestion. I did try Sharif's solution, however, to no avail. I guess this problem is a tricky one. In addition I tried the “sfc”
 command to scan the Windows directory and although a cbs.log found corrupt files, the tool was unable to fix some of them and the initial error code "0x00000074" is still persistent during system boot.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Should anything else cross your mind or anyone else’s , I'd be glad to experiment.&nbsp;Quite frankly, my wife and I feel exasperated, as our family pc
 is currently unusable.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apologize for the late reply.<br />
</p>
<p>Are you still facing this issue?&nbsp; If yes, please answer these questions:</p>
<p>1. Were you able to boot to Safe Mode?</p>
<p>2. How did you perform an SFC scan?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are able to boot to the desktop and also as System File Checker (SFC) found corrupt system files, I would suggest that you run the DISM tool to fix corrupt system files.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to run the DISM tool. </p>
<p>a. Open an elevated command prompt. To do this, swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your input! I'm afraid your suggestions are no longer necessary, as I installed a brand new version of Windows 8.1. it's quite possible that putting your suggestions to practice would have offered the required sollution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>

<h2>            Skype keeps getting upgraded to a horrible Discord Looking APP&#33;  LOVE Classic&#33;  NO CUTESY&#33;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Okay... maybe I'm just an old fart that doesn't like change.... &nbsp;But this change makes me ILL! &nbsp;I tried to make a call this afternoon and it looked like I was looking at a Discord Clone! &nbsp; O&gt;M&gt;G&gt;! &nbsp; Toss that garbage out! &nbsp;Had to go get the install
 download for the "Classic" Skype! &nbsp;I use it for phone calls all day long. &nbsp;Love the classic MENUS, the ability to change settings as I need for different uses. &nbsp;I love the ability to easily share screens.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; This new thing was dumbed down, extremely limited, and hard to make adjustments for the odd call that needs volume and mic adjustments. &nbsp;And I could not share a screen. &nbsp;My Contacts are stuck under a little icon and I have to keep hitting it to see them.
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I keep reloading classic, and my Windows keeps "Upgrading" me to the new one I DESPISE!</p>
<p>
</p><p>HOW THE HECK DO I STOP THIS FLIPPIN' UPGRADE! &nbsp;I will quit using Skype if this is what I will have to work with.</p>
<p>It is NOT professional at all. &nbsp;It's a Kid's chat program, not something an adult with business to do would use!</p>

<p><span><span>Hi Blarney77,
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Good Day!</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please be advised that at Skype, we regularly release updates to our software so that we can introduce new features, improve existing ones
 and fix bugs.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>We always recommend that you use the latest version of Skype, which is why Skype automatically updates to the latest version by default.
 If you prefer to choose when to upgrade, you can switch off automatic updates.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can disable Windows 10 updates from automatically downloading on your computer. Just a heads up, Windows will remember the connection
 which was set as metered. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Which means it would start automatically downloading updates once you are on a different, non-metered connection.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you have further questions, kindly reply to this thread.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you!
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

                    <p style="color: rgba(221, 221, 221, 1)">Original Title: Windows 8 tablet "Can't connect to this network"</p>
<p><span>I am in help desk support. I have wracked my brain, my colleague’s brains, and used my googlefu to no avail.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0"><span>I have a Win8 basic (cheapest OS) HP tablet 1000G2 that I am having troubles with. I have a network that requires WPA2-Enterprise with PEAP. It will not connect to this network, it will however connect to a neighboring network
 without any security settings. I have fixed this issue once before and the same fix is not working.</span></p>
<p><span>The kicker... I have another exact same tablet that we got the same day...&nbsp;No issues connecting</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Problem:</strong></span><span>&nbsp;It does not take the security settings that the server is prompting for. It prompts me for my credentials, but gives this error: "Can't connect to this network" I did research last time and the collective reason
 was that the security settings weren't correct.</span></p>
<p><span>Solution that worked last time:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Connect to a network with open sec settings.</span></li><li><span>Open network and sharing center</span></li><li><span>Change adapter settings.</span></li><li><span>Right click wireless adapter click status</span></li><li><span>Wireless properties.</span></li><li><span>Security tab.</span></li><li><span>Change my network settings</span></li><li><span>Reconnect to my network</span></li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 0"><span>The tablet has been fine until today. These steps above do not resolve the issue anymore.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0"><strong>THERE IS NO VIRUS PROTECTION BESIDES WHAT WINDOWS OFFERS ON THIS DEVICE!</strong></p>
<p><span><strong>Troubleshooting steps I have tried:</strong></span><span>&nbsp;deleting all the wlan profiles with</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0"><span>Change any properties one at a time that I thought might deal with this.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0"><span>Removed all HP bloatware/3rd party connection managers.</span></p>
<p><span>Troubleshooting I tried last time:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0"><span>Uninstalled and installed adapter drivers.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0"><span>Tried the windows diagnose</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0"><span>Googlefu "Can't connect to this network" and you come up with a bunch of pages I have clicked on them and none of the solutions have worked.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0"><span>Please if you have any solutions let me know! I am at my wits end with this dang thing.</span></p>

            This might come as result of a corrupt update file. Try to delete the avatar app, restart your console and download the app again.

<h2>            lifecam hd 3000 not working with win 10</h2>
                    I have win10 and a new LifeCam HD-3000 (which, by the way, arrived as just the camera, no documentation, nothing but the camera and a "product guide" book which is NOT a guide at all and no cd with any software). I tried downloading the driver/dashboard
 and it won't install. Gets partway and says something about not being able to install. I found a website that says it's compatibile with win10. The software dl page https://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/d/lifecam-hd-3000 says nothing about win10 and the
 win8 is the one that wont install. The camera "works" in that I can use skype with it but I have no way to access any dashboard. I bought the camera from B&amp;H so it isn't a fly-by-night outfit selling black market stuff. They are closed for 2 days or I'd call
 them.

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to visit the computer manufacturer's support website and download the latest driver available for camera compatible with Windows 8.1 and install it in compatibility mode.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may refer to steps provided in the article below:</p>

            <p>Except of course there are no win 8.1 drivers for this webcam that works wonderfully with skype, owned now ofc by microsoft, but although it receives sound and vision using facebook cannot send either to the other party.<br />
<br />
If you give advice at least make it factual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is an old problem since win 10 reared its ugly face and it is still a major problem even with the full win 10 software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It feels like Microsoft are trying once again to lock us all into using only it's products.</p>

    <title>Stuck at login screen after waking up from standby - Windows 10 build - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aliaksandr21  say:</h3>
<h2>            Stuck at login screen after waking up from standby - Windows 10 build 14393</h2>
                    <p>My laptop had a couple of automatic windows updates recently, and I noticed in the past couple of days, I keep getting stuck at the login screen after waking up from standby. My current windows version is Windows 10 Home build 14393.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a password set for my login screen, but whenever I enter my password, the circled dots appear in the middle of the screen, dissappear after ~15 seconds and the screen then turns black, and reverts to the lock screen. Entering my password doesn't let
 me login, and only takes me back to the lock screen. The only thing I can do is restart my laptop, at which point I can login again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a bug with build 14393 or maybe some kind of malware? I do have Bitdefeder antivirus free edition on my laptop, and it hasn't detected any malware yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated. Many thanks.</p>

    <title>Upgrade to 8.1 Leads to Blue Screen Loop of Death - System Thread - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnnymb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Upgrade to 8.1 Leads to Blue Screen Loop of Death - System Thread Exception Not Handled</h2>
                    I am typing this on my iMac because my Dell XPS 14Z is on life support.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Upgraded to Windows 8.1 Pro 64 Bit yesterday from Windows 8, and the computer seemed fine. Overnight it was Shutdown and I restarted today and have ended up in a Microsoft-induced 'Loop of Death'...&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I booted I got a diagnostic screen, and then went to a blue screen which said my PC ran into a problem and needed to restart. It collects info (great - collecting info, I can't wait)...&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It then sends me to this same screen again and suggests I search for: "System Thread Exception Not Handled' online (thank goodness I&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It then tells me it's Preparing Automatic Repair... Diagnosing My PC... Automatic Repair screen...&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>- Restart sends me back into the Loop above</div>
<div>- Advanced:&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;* Continue sends me back into the Loop above</div>
<div>&nbsp;* Turn off allows me to wait for as long as I want until I want to use the PC then ... er... see above</div>
<div>&nbsp;* Troubleshoot is the ONLY option...&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Reset - can't do as I don't have a Windows Installation (hey, don't 99% of people either get pre-installed versions, or download upgrades??). &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and Recovery media - I can't do because I've only just upgraded to Windows 8.1 and it SEEMED fine last night</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Refresh - ditto (same problem with no installation CD or recovery media)</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Advanced Options - is the ONLY option again, and then from here:</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * System Restore: no, because 8.1 didn't setup a restore point (don't ask me why, it was working with 8.0)</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * Image Recovery: not there with 8.1</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * Start Up Repair: doesn't work</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * Command Prompt: works... and then what???</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * Start Up Settings ... and then only Safe Mode works &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So, I can only get to use this PC, if I boot in Safe Mode and then I have these problems. In Safe mode I cannot create a Recovery Disk, I cannot update drivers. I cannot downgrade back to 8.0... I can just about use the computer.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>AND ALL THIS FOR A TINY START BUTTON THAT HAS NO MENU. One year later, and we get a little button that does the same job as the Windows button on the keyboard. Is that IT?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please I just want Windows 7 back, you can keep Metro, it's pants... You can keep Windows 8, 8.1 and anything following this update... I have lost complete confidence in Microsoft and just want a PC which can work. Perhaps I need to put Linux on it?</div>
                </div>

            I am finally able to resolve the problem. &nbsp;It is due to display driver problem. &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Go to control panel -&gt; device manager in safe mode. Disable Nvidia display adapter and restart.</div>

<div>Hope it helps.</div>
