            Hi James, an Office Update has caused this . . .
<br />
<br />Press F9 on a workbook - does it calculate?
<br />
<br />If so:
<br />
<br />Click File - Options
<br />
<br />On the left Click Formulas
<br />
<br />On the right, in the Workbook Calculations section, set that to Automatic
<br />
<br />That's It

<h2>            Deleting an entry from the AutoComplete list of email names and addresses in the Outlook app</h2>
                    <p>Outlook 2016 and Outlook Mail both allow you to delete an undesired entry from the AutoComplete drop-down &nbsp;list of names and email addresses that appears when you begin to type an address in the To box in a new email message. (See the steps below.) However,
 the Outlook app does not. Here is a workaround:</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, go to&nbsp;<strong>Outlook Mail</strong>;&nbsp;click <strong>New</strong>, <strong>
Email message</strong>; in the <em>To</em> field, type the first few characters of the email address entry until the undesired name/email address appears; mouse over (do not click) the undesired name until you see the “X” icon displayed next to the highlighted
 name, click <strong>X</strong> to remove the name from the list.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c58a4c7c-c839-4ba6-8fc2-33cd0409e3ab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c58a4c7c-c839-4ba6-8fc2-33cd0409e3ab" /></a></p>
<p>Open the <strong>Outlook</strong> <strong>app</strong>; click <strong>Menu bars</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Settings gear</strong>; under
<strong>ACCOUNTS</strong>, click the name of the Outlook account; click <strong>Reset</strong>
<strong>Account</strong>; once the account has reset, click X to close; tap the <strong>
New Message&nbsp;</strong>icon; in the<strong>&nbsp;New Message</strong>; screen, type in the
<em>To</em> box and the undesired email address and name should be gone.</p>

            <p>The Outlook app is what I use on my iPhone and iPad to access my email. Since Microsoft has resolved their server/sync issues, it's a far superior app to Apple's Mail app. For example:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/75fa9d47-b512-4056-b7cf-4c0103638cd9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/75fa9d47-b512-4056-b7cf-4c0103638cd9" /></a></p>
<p>The Outlook app includes an amazing <strong>Help &amp; Feedback</strong> feature that includes&nbsp;<strong>Contact Support</strong> and
<strong>Suggest a Feature</strong>. Support responds usually within an hour or so, although they were not able to help me with this. I figured it out through trial and error. 164 people have requested this feature--that's a very high number when compared with
 other suggestions under Suggest a Feature.</p>

            Thanks for getting back to me Arlene. When I open a new email and start to type in the To: field I do see suggested email addresses but do not see the "X" to the right as in the picture you provided. On my iPad I have Outlook app v. 2.39.0 and on my iPhone
 6+ Outlook app v. 2.38.0. Both devices have IOS v 10.3.3. Is there another setting I need to check?

<p>You have to hold your mouse pointer over the address you wish to delete and the "X" will appear. Remember, this has to be done in Outlook Mail (online) as the first step. I just tested the step and it works fine.</p>

<p>Hope you can help:&nbsp; I've removed the offending autocomplete email addresses from my Outlook 2010 on my laptop.&nbsp; However your instructions don't seem to apply on my iPad as there is no mouse to use to hover over the erroneous entries, and they keep coming
 up.&nbsp; Can you explain again for iPad please?</p>

            There is no mouse on the phone either. You first use Outlook 2016 or Outlook Mail on your PC as directed in my original post and then go to your Outlook app on your iPhone or iPad and reset the account. Try following the steps exactly in my original post--remember
 you begin on your PC first and then go to your device.

<p>Yeah, thanks for that!&nbsp;&nbsp;Could my problem&nbsp; be that I am using Outlook 2010 on my pc and not 2016?</p>
<p>I have cleared out the offending email address from my various Contacts lists&nbsp;in the Address book in Outlook 2010, and&nbsp;the wrong address&nbsp;no longer shows up when I start typing on the pc.&nbsp; The offending email address does still pop up on the iPad and the
 iPhone so I wonder if there is another source of addresses?</p>
<p>I have checked the Contacts app supplied with the iPhone and iPad.</p>
<p>If you have time I would appreciate any comments</p>

<p>I don't think the version of Outlook would be a factor, but I have no idea. I just stumbled upon this workaround through trial and error. Did you take these steps:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Open the&nbsp;</span><span>Outlook</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>app</span><span>; click&nbsp;</span><span>Menu bars</span><span>,&nbsp;</span><span>Settings
 gear</span><span>; under&nbsp;</span><span>ACCOUNTS</span><span>, click the name of the Outlook account; click&nbsp;</span><span>Reset</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Account</span><span>;
 once the account has reset, click X to close; tap the&nbsp;</span><span>New Message&nbsp;</span><span>icon; in the</span><span>&nbsp;New Message</span><span>; screen, type in the&nbsp;</span><em>To</em><span>&nbsp;box
 and the undesired email address and name should be gone.</span></p>
<p><span>If you did reset your account in the Outlook app, I'm all out of ideas. You could try Outlook app support: In Outlook app, tap
<strong>Menu </strong>bars, <strong>? Help</strong> icon; under <strong>Help &amp; Feedback</strong>,
<strong>Contact </strong><strong>Support</strong>; a new conversation will display and you can describe your issue. There is also
<strong>Suggest a Feature</strong>&nbsp; in Help where you can request this functionality you and I have struggled with. Good luck with everything, Geoff.</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>FYI: I just followed by steps again to delete an undesired entry, and after resetting the account, the offending name was gone.</p>

<p>So I&nbsp;had been&nbsp;using my old&nbsp;Zune playlists on my Win7 computer with my new Win10 phone (I just purchased the Lumia 950). Incidentally my Win7 computer died last week, and I just got a Win10 computer to replace it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All my Zune playlists were showing up on my phone and computer, but some were not syncing correctly. I had to manually delete the songs that it wouldn't play,&nbsp;play the song (by double-clicking it from the computer), then add it to the playlist using the
 "+" symbol. Also, because I was using my older Zune playlists, they were not syncing at all to my phone at this point, even though all the songs were playing on the computer correctly. So I created a new playlist from Groove (on the Win10 computer),&nbsp;selected
 all the songs from the Zune playlists (using the selection tool), then added it to a new playlist that I had just created on the Groove music app. The new playlist (with the same old songs) were then able to sync with my Win10 phone automatically. The old
 playlists that were created by Zune were not showing up, or they were showing up but the songs were not syncing. If there are songs that are not syncing, you might need to manually copy the songs over from the computer to your phone using the computer's File
 Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, I didn't understand how to put songs and playlists on OneDrive (there is a music folder, and I could put songs on it,&nbsp;but I had no idea where the playlists were stored on my computer), so I don't have any songs or playlists on OneDrive. I'm not
 sure what I'm not doing correctly, but I just downloaded the songs to my phone by turning "Available offline" to "On" on my phone's playlists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A bit backwards, but it seemed to have worked. All my old purchased songs from Zune seem to translate fine with Groove music, and my old ripped CDs seem to be playing fine as well. I had not purchased any new songs in a while because Zune's music purchasing
 stopped working for whatever reason when Win8 came out.</p>

I hope this helps you...good luck.

            You can use Windows Media Player in Windows 10 to sync to a&nbsp;Windows 10 Mobile device. You can create playlists and autoplaylists.&nbsp; This is not without issues however, as after a certain number of files the Groove Music client on the Lumia will stop updating
 changes to its database; see other threads here with 'sync and groove' for search terms.

 a fix coming soon? I am already at two months with this 950 and it is still not ready for prime time. I know MS is trying to do next level stuff here, but there needs to be some improvements quick.

            Thanks for the quick response. My phone has been running the entire time. I even left Groove open for the past two days. I had about 50+ Gigs of music and all of the albums and artists seemed to have made it back, except for the album art on about half.
 No playlists made it back. I got impatient and just deleted all of the music off of my SD card on my 950 and was going to start syncing it again slowly.

<h3> iamvirtual  say:</h3>
<h2>            Complex spreadsheet in Excel 2016 Pro is super slow even though it is not taxing the computer</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Spreadsheet does scheduling analysis for a manufacturing company. When loading, does database queries and then does not need
 to do any queries after that. The spreadsheet has a drop down field where the user selects the particular production line (machine) for which the schedule should be analyzed. The cursor turns into the lovely blue rotating circle and chugs away for around 3
 minutes or so.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The owner of the company created the spreadsheet and needs much faster performance. We have tried it in 32 and 64 Bit versions
 of Excel. No real difference.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I have been running this on my laptop which has a Core i7 4800MQ 2.7GHz quad core processor, 16GB RAM, and a 1TB hybrid drive.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I have checked in Resource Manager (Windows 10 Pro 64Bit). The computer is not being bottle-necked in CPU, Memory, Disk or Network.
 Excel is only using around 12% of the CPU (~98 threads). I went into the power settings on the laptop and set it to the highest performance profile. No real difference. I have made sure that Excel is set to use all CPU cores and hyper-threading.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">We looked at the network traffic details in Resource Monitor and noticed that it appears to be communicating across the Internet
 to Microsoft's servers (did a little research on the various IP addresses to which it is trying to talk and they look to be Office 365 related hosts, even though this is Full Office 2016 Professional and not Office 365). I have done the right mouse click on
 the Excel.exe line in Resource Monitor and selected Analyze Wait Chain and it indicated that Excel is running normally.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I have turned off the network connections on the PC (pulled Ethernet cable and turned off wireless) and the spreadsheet still works
 but the performance does not change at all.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">We are considering getting a faster PC to run this spreadsheet since it is very important to us. I can pick up a workstation class
 PC with two physical Xeon CPUs and a ton of CPU cores. But I am not sure that it will make much difference. If I am not running out of CPU resources on my laptop with 4 cores and 4 hyper-threading "CPUs," I am not sure that the spreadsheet will complete its
 calculations any faster.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Just to provide a little more background on me so you understand I am not a green newbie, I am the IT Manager, with over 20 years
 of IT experience in systems, desktop and server operating systems, networking, storage, virtualization, etc.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">So here are my questions:</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Any idea why Excel or Windows 10 is capping its usage of the CPUs around 12% (I briefly saw it it 13% a few times) instead of using
 more of the CPU resources and finishing the calculating sooner?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Is there any kind of utility that might give more insight into what Excel is doing during the twirling blue circle so we can see
 if there is a way to streamline the processing within Excel?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I do believe there is some VBA code in the spreadsheet as well. Is there a way to see if the hold-up is on the VBA end?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Any help you provide or advice would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Thanks!!</span>

 I thought we would go back to the very basics of Excel and spreadsheets in general and talk about the very important fundamentals of setting up and designing an efficient spreadsheet.&nbsp; While it may seem quite easy to design your own spreadsheet once you have
 become reasonably proficient in using Microsoft Excel, it is unfortunately very rare that the proficient user for Excel will understand the necessities of designing and setting up a spreadsheet in a correct and efficient manner.&nbsp; A spreadsheet which has been
 designed and set up properly should have no problems in performing recalculations, opening, saving and closing etc.&nbsp; A poorly designed spreadsheet will cause constant frustration as it will take far too long for formulas to recalculate.&nbsp; To make matters worse,
 if the spreadsheet has not been set up in the correct manner, it will become extremely difficult, if not impossible, to use many of Excel's built-in features that are ideal for working with spreadsheets. ET MR Macros.docx . Excel Recalculation http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb687891.aspx

 ET MR Macros.docx . Handle Volatile Functions like they are dynamite http://chandoo.org/wp/2014/03/03/handle-volatile-functions-like-they-are-dynamite/ If you’re building large models, then you may want to use volatile functions – including OFFSET(), INDIRECT(),
 and TODAY() – with caution, because unless you know what you are doing, they *might* slow Excel down to the point that data entry is sluggish, if not downright tedious. In fact, you *might* want to consider getting out of the habit of using these functions
 at all if there are&nbsp; alternatives, and you might want to replace volatile functions in your existing models with non-volatile alternatives…I have reduced recalculation time in large models from minutes to milliseconds by doing just that! ET MR Macros.docx

 Excel is without doubt a very powerful spreadsheet application and arguably the best in the world. However, many people often design their spreadsheets with no foresight at all. This means most spreadsheets have poor foundations and have limited life spans.
 Perhaps the number one rule when designing a spreadsheet is, we should start with the end in mind and never assume you will not need to add more data or formulae to your spreadsheet, because, the chances are that you will. A good spreadsheet should have about
 80% planning and 20% implementation. While this can seem extremely inefficient in the short run, I can assure you that the long term gain will far outweigh the short-term pain. Remember that spreadsheets are about giving correct information to the user, not
 possible erroneous information that looks good. Let's look at how a spreadsheet should be set up efficiently. ET MR Macros.docx . Stopping a Formula from Updating References http://excelribbon.tips.net/T010786_Stopping_a_Formula_from_Updating_References.html

 from the average anything that is not a number or is less than a tolerance. ... 10 formulas using this UDF on 32000 cells ... . (Part 2) – using Excel Functions ... https://fastexcel.wordpress.com/2011/06/06/writing-efficient-vba-udfs-part-2/ In part 1 of
 Writing efficient VBA UDFs I looked at more efficient ways for the UDF to process a Range of data by reading it all into a Variant array. In this post I look at a case (using Excel Functions from within the UDF) where the most efficient way is somewhat different.
 . (Part 3) – Avoiding the VBE Refresh Bug... https://fastexcel.wordpress.com/2011/06/13/writing-efficient-vba-udfs-part-3-avoiding-the-vbe-refresh-bug/ In this post I look at a bug in Excel that slows down your UDFs and show you how to avoid it.&nbsp; There is
 a little bug in the EXCEL Visual Basic Editor (the VBE) : each formula that contains a UDF changes the VBE title bar to say “Running” whenever a UDF is being executed during the calculation, and then switches it back again when the UDF has finished. . (Part

 only be calculated once. This can be a significant problem if your UDF takes a long time to execute. .

 Range is Slow ... https://fastexcel.wordpress.com/2012/12/02/writing-efficient-udfs-part-11-full-column-references-in-udfs-used-range-is-slow/ xcel users often find it convenient to use full-column references in formulas to avoid having to adjust the formulas
 every time new data is added. So when you write a User Defined Function (UDF) you can expect that sooner or later someone will try to use it with a full-column reference . Part 12: Getting Used Range Fast using Application Events and a&nbsp;Cache https://fastexcel.wordpress.com/2012/12/05/writing-efficient-udfs-part-12-getting-used-range-fast-using-application-events-and-a-cache/
 In the previous post I suggested that one good way to speed up retrieval of the Used Range last row would be to use a Cache and the AfterCalculate Application event. I have now tested this approach and it works well: here is the code for the demo function

 For several years people have been asking the Excel Dev team to add the capability to create Intellisense for UDFs to work the same way as native Excel functions. Well, now Govert van Drimmelen, author of the wonderful Excel DNA, has made a solution available
 for both VBA and XLL UDFs. It is now available in public Beta test. Have fun with this.

    <title>Outlook 2016&#58; How do I set the default inbox to Imap Gmail&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stanrose  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016&#58; How do I set the default inbox to Imap Gmail&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have just rebuilt my system with a clean install of Windows 10 and Office 365 (2016). I have several email accounts defined in Outlook, including Imap Gmail, MSN, Outlook.com and a roadrunner account. Before I did the reinstall, mail would open to my Gmail
 (Imap) inbox. Now it opens to the Outlook.com inbox.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe the determining factor for which inbox is the default is determined by which account is the default in the data tab of Account Settings. When I try to set this to Gmail, it says you cannot set the default to a non-standard OST or PST file. Yet,
 the Gmail data file seems to be an OST file (....\Outlook\[my-email-name]@gmail.com.ost).</p>
<p>
</p><p>My previous system (before the clean install) started with Windows 7, then was upgraded to Windows 8.1 then upgraded to Windows 10, and Office 2010 was upgraded to Office 2013 then upgraded to Office 2016. Is it possible that the earlier versions allowed
 this and it carried forward but is now not possible, or have I missed something trying to set it up?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks very much.</p>

                    <p>Apologies in advance because this seems so basic that I'm sure I'm just doing it wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to dial a number in Skype (so I've clicked on the numberpad icon and am now presented the full numberpad) I cannot see the actual number being entered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see at the top the country, then a 'Skype-to-Phone' option for choosing which credit/account the call is charging, then the actual numberpad.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Phone is an Blackberry KeyOne and the Skype verion is 8.28.0.41.</p>

            Ideally, it should show your the number which you are dialling. Can you try to reset your app?
<br />
<br />Open Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Locate Skype &gt; ForceStop &gt; Say yes to prompt if any comes (You won't lose any data) &gt; Now uninstall and reinstall Skype from Play Store.

<h2>            Access 2010 Exporting a report to Excel 2010 Problem - only Excel 2003 available</h2>
                    <p>When using Access 2010 and I generate a Report.&nbsp; Using the Print Preview Ribbon I click on the&nbsp;"Export to Excel Spreadsheet" icon.&nbsp; The&nbsp;"Excel - Export to Spreadsheet" popup dialog is displalyed and in the File&nbsp;Format area there is only "Excel 97 - Excel
 2003 Workbook (*.xls)" and "Microsoft Excel 5.0/95 Workbook (*.xls)" as export file type options.&nbsp; I need to export to "Excel Workbook (*.xlsx)", which would be Excel 2010.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>In the "Excel - Export to Spreadsheet" popup dialog if I press the "Browse" button associated with the File Name it only allows me to see ".xls" file types within the folders, even though the same file names appear using the ".xlsx" file type.&nbsp; Again, in
 the browse window, only&nbsp; "Excel 97 - Excel 2003 Workbook (*.xls)" and "Microsoft Excel 5.0/95 Workbook (*.xls)" file types are available to filter by.</p>
<p>How can I get the "Excel - Export to Spreadsheet" popup dialog to recognize the ".xlsx" file type for Report Export?</p>

            <p>Hey Mike - </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't find any documentation on this but apparently it's a <strong>limitation of Access 2007 and 2010</strong> - they cannot export reports to the new
<strong>2007/20010 XLSX</strong> fomat. I have tried on a couple of computers here and have just noticed it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am able to export tables and queries but not reports. Evidently Microsoft hasn't figured out how to render reports correclty in XLSX format.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I guess&nbsp;the obvious&nbsp;workaround would be to export into Excel 2003 and then open the file and convert it manually in Excel but that would be inconvenient. Unfortunately getting anyone from Microsoft&nbsp;to respond to your question&nbsp;or fix&nbsp;anything is virtually
 impossible. If someone did, they would probably ask why do you need to export a report to Excel - which has nothing to do with why they didn't make their products to work as they have before.</p>

            <p>The export&nbsp;reports to a spreadsheet was depeciated in Access 2007 and brought back in Access 2010.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The exporting of a report was never a very satisfactory experience.&nbsp; Look at what you are really wanting and you may find that&nbsp;exporting a query is what you really want anyway.</p>

            <p>I had researched this for hours this morning and had already found the same conclusion -
</p>
<p>1) Seems to be a known limitaiton of Access 2007 and later.</p>
<p>2) Only affects Reports, any other type of Export from Access includes the .XLSX file type.</p>
<p>3) The work around is to Export as .xls, open in Excel, Save As .xlsx.</p>
<p>I am responsible for all Access Systems at my work place and several people have mentioned this annoyance to me.&nbsp; I just needed to make sure there was not a setting or reference I was overlooking.</p>

            <p>His questions was - <strong>Why can't I export to XLS but not XLSX</strong>. As a report developer, we are asked (read: compelled)&nbsp;to do what Managers and CEOs demand, not what is the smart or correct&nbsp;thing to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why did Microsoft bring&nbsp;the export&nbsp;back but ignored their own new and improved&nbsp;2007/2010 format which handles formatting&nbsp;better (supposedly)? Another half assed solution from MS.</p>

            You keep saying the solution is to export a query, when that is not always viable. Line totals can be mimicked in a query, but column totals cannot. Repeatedly saying to export a query is not helpful.

<br />I am assuming that you are referring to Microsoft ToDo tool. if, yes, please read below. 
<br />
<br />How can I sync my account? 
<br />To sync your to-dos and lists between computer and phone, just log in with the same account on each device. Microsoft To-Do updates every 5 seconds, so all of your changes should be displayed automatically. If you notice that your app isn't updating, just head to your account settings and tap Sync. Since your to-dos are stored on Exchange Online servers, they will also sync automatically to your Outlook Tasks.  
<br />
<br />In this article please expand "Outlook Tasks Integration" and read through the FAQ

<h2>            How to to cope with the message&#58; &#34;The document is too large for Word to handle.&#34; in Word 2010&#63;</h2>
                    How to to cope with the message: "The document is too large for Word to handle." in Word 2010?<br />
<br />
Sorting (alphabetizing) a long table (almost 1500 pages) in Word 2010 file (nearly 4MB) (on several Windows 7 x64 Ultimate systems; 4 GB RAM; all of at least 200 GB free disc space) keeps coming up with the message: "The document is too large for Word to handle."
 What should I do?<br />
<br />
Thanks a million in advance for your time and expertise and step-by-step instructions in simple language.<br />
<br />

            Excel should work.<br />
<br />
If your table is not highly formatted, you could export it, then copy to a text format file, and use an external sort utility.<br />
<br />
I've used this one&nbsp;&nbsp; http://unxutils.sourceforge.net&nbsp;&nbsp; for times when Word and Excel couldn't handle the file size.<br />
<br />
Another alternative would be to switch to 64 bit Office, that is if you have 64 bit Windows.<br />

<h3> rnes  say:</h3>
<h2>            I am not able to save a favorite in any folder but the root folder in IE9 beta.</h2>
                    
<p>To save a favorite I have to save it to the root folder of Favorites and then move that entry to the folder I want.&nbsp; I do not get any errors, it just does not save it.</p>
<p>Has anyone else experienced this?&nbsp; Is there a fix?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>This might be happening due to permission issue. You may take the ownership of the folders and check if that helps. To take permissions of the folders</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Locate
 the file or folder on which you want to take ownership in windows explorer</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Right
 click on file or folder and select “Properties” from Context Menu</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click
 on Security tab</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>d)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click
 on “Advance”</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>e)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Now
 click on Owner tab in Advance Security Settings for User windows</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>f)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click
 on Edit Button and select user from given Change Owner to list if user or group is not in given list, then click on other users or groups. Enter name of user/group and click ok.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>g)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Now
 select User/group and click apply and ok. (Check “Replace owner on subcontainers and objects” if you have files and folder within selected folder)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>h)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click
 ok when Windows Security Prompt is displayed</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>i)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Now
 Owner name must have changed.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>j)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Now
 click Ok to exist from Properties windows</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Now check if you are able to add favorites to the folders.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>If taking the ownership does not help then follow the below given steps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click
 Start, type<strong>shell:favorites</strong> and press ENTER. The Favorites folder of your user account will open. Copy the full path shown in the Address Bar.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Open
 an elevated Command Prompt.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>To
 do so, click<strong>Start</strong>, </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Type
 cmd in the start search box</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Right
 click on the search result and select<span>&nbsp;</span>‘Run as Administrator’</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Type
 the following command:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>icacls<em>&lt;favoritespath&gt;</em> /setintegritylevel (OI)(CI)low</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Replace the tag<strong><em>&lt;favoritespath&gt;</em></strong> with the actual path to your Favorites folder,
 enclosed with double-quotes)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Example:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>icacls "D:\My Favorites" /setintegritylevel (OI)(CI)low</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You should now see this message:</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><em><span>processed file: favorites<br />
Successfully processed 1 files; Failed processing 0 files</span></em></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>d)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Optionally,
 to verify if the Integrity Level is correctly set for the Favorites folder, run the icacls command followed by the Favorites folder path, but without any switches, as below:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>icacls "D:\My Favorites"</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You should see the following line in the output:</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><em><span>Mandatory Label\Low Mandatory Level:(OI)(CI)(NW)</span></em></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>e)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Type<strong>EXIT</strong>
 to close the Command Prompt window.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>f)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Now
 try adding Favorites and check what happens.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

            <p>Hi Sceta,</p>
<p>Well Outlook is down again on my laptop (but fine on iPad and phone), so I updated my Chrome Browser, updated Microsoft Edge browser and did a re-boot of my laptop. &nbsp;Still same results. &nbsp;This is really driving me crazy and for the first time in years I am
 seriously considering leaving MSN. &nbsp;Outlook works fine for a few days and then just locks up, then can't reload. &nbsp;I'm able to access my Outlook on my son's laptop. &nbsp;This was happening on my LG laptop which got replaced by a new HP laptop at Xmas time. &nbsp;So
 it can't be the hardware.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Can someone help me create a dynamic hyperlink in a picture? Essentially what I have is a drop down box with a list of games. On the same sheet, I have a picture with the Wikipedia icon. What I would like to do is select the game from from the drop down
 list and be able to click on the Wikipedia picture on the sheet and have my browser open to the Wikipedia page of the game.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Lumia 950 waking SLOWLY and other</h2>
                    <p>I've had this phone for several months and it has worked flawlessly the whole time.&nbsp; Fantastic device and I love it.&nbsp; Yesterday morning it had a "meltdown".&nbsp; TXTing would not show that anything had sent ... TXTs that I had received would not show I had viewed
 them and remained blue in the TXT menu ... When the phone is locked and you press the lock button to wake, it does not respond, so I press it again and it then shows the lock screen.&nbsp; Once again press and it may finally show the unlock screen and then you
 can proceed and it works as normal ... After unlocking about 50% of the time the screen is so dim you cannot see it.&nbsp; I've checked the settings and it is still set to auto, and switching it to manual and raising the brightness doesn't work.&nbsp; You have to just
 lock the phone and re-unlock it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>All of these issues started yesterday morning after the phone simply sat plugged in on my dresser all night.&nbsp; Any one have some or all of these issues?&nbsp; And does anyone have a fix possibly for me?&nbsp; I have not tried a factoiry reset as it's just a pain in
 the **** lol ... thanks for any help from anyone&nbsp; ;o)</p>

<p>If nothing helps, you may have to reset your phone.</p>

    <title>problem importing yahoo contacts into 365&#58; bad format - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joseph stateson  say:</h3>
<h2>            problem importing yahoo contacts into 365&#58; bad format</h2>
                    <p>I got the error message about the CSV being bad and I read where that could be fixed by opening the CSV in excel and doing a save-as.&nbsp; I did that but the contact file still will not load into outlook 365.&nbsp; There was a change in format as the "save as" file
 was 1/2 the size of the original. I did not expect that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that yahoo support community does not exist, that is why I am here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had no problem adding my at&amp;t account and gmail account to my own outlook 365 but my GF uses yahoo.com mail and there seems to be a real problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I added her account to her outlook 365&nbsp; using computer generated password (part of 2 step).&nbsp; No contacts showed up but she started getting mail.&nbsp; Seems like they should have automatically showed up.&nbsp; Why was the contact list empty when the account was added?&nbsp;
 Can I assume this is a yahoo problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then brought up yahoo and exported her contacts as CSV and tried that import which failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>there are 112 contacts, not a whole lot,&nbsp; still would take a while to re-create all the contacts manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surely there is a way to scrape the contacts from yahoo?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did read where yahoo says she is using old email and a new version of mail is due out.&nbsp; I could not find that new version.</p>

<h2>            Printing only document sections in Office 365 Word for Mac</h2>
                    Is there a way to print just a document section in Office 365 Word for Mac? I have a 700-plus-page document with dozens of sections, but would like to print off just one or two of them at a time (with their page headers) for reviewing. Thanks.

    <title>Issue with Outlook.com folder show&#47;hide function - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marykyryk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issue with Outlook.com folder show&#47;hide function</h2>
                    I found a similar thread on this issue from Oct 2013, but no resolution??&nbsp; <br />
<br />
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/oemail-ofolders/outlookcom-subfolders-randomly-collapsedexpanded/197fee8f-b351-4aa3-8222-63c78661213b?msgId=3eb40ff9-02c6-4905-b21c-e9e4633857a4<br />
<br />
Until 2 days ago, I did not have this issue.&nbsp; Now it's a problem.&nbsp; My browser has not changed (using Firefox 26), but have reproduced the issue in IE.&nbsp; I have also cleared my browsers cache, and that did not resolve the problem.
<br />
<br />
The show/hide behavior of folders is inconsistent and random.&nbsp; Here are the issues I'm experiencing:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; Clicking to the RIGHT of the folder name (NOT on the &gt; icon) will cause subfolders to show/expand.&nbsp; Therefore, if I just want to see the contents of a particular folder and click to the
<u>RIGHT</u> of the name, the folder expands to show all subfolders. <br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; The &gt; icon state is inconsistent.&nbsp; When subfolders are hidden, sometimes the icon is like this (&gt;) and sometimes it's like this ( v ).<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp; Clicking the &gt; icon on my main/top level&nbsp; INBOX folder is causing the first level folders to hide, but the second level subfolders are remaining visible.<br />
Here is what I mean....<br />
&gt;INBOX<br />
&nbsp; &gt;Folder 1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Folder 1A<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Folder 1B<br />
&nbsp; &gt;Folder 2<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Folder 2A<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Folder 2B<br />
<br />
When I click the show/hide icon next to INBOX, this is the structure that remains visible<br />
<br />
&gt;INBOX<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Folder 1A<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Folder 1B<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Folder 2A<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Folder 2B<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<br />

<p><span>Hi Murederm,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for your detailed information for this issue. As we know, items from an Exchange account are stored in the Outlook cache. If this cache becomes corrupted, it may cause synchronization problems with the Exchange server. To solve this problem,
 you can empty the cache in Outlook so that Outlook can download all the items from your Exchange account again. So you can try:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Make sure that your computer is connected to the Exchange server.</span></li><li><span>In the navigation pane, Ctrl+click or right-click the Exchange folder for which you want to empty the cache, and then click Properties.</span></li><li><span>On the General tab, click Empty Cache. After the folder is empty, Outlook automatically downloads the items from the Exchange server.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>Note: The above procedure deletes any information that is not synchronized with the Exchange server, including your contacts' mail certificate. Emptying the cache replaces the contents of the folder with the latest items from the Exchange server. Before
 emptying the cache, you may want to ensure that your Outlook information is backed up.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Meanwhile, if the “clear the cache” is not work for this issue, please send your additional information to the dedicated support channel, we have dedicated support channel for Outlook for mac issues. You can contact them Outlook for mac issues and
 getting better support (<strong><em>Go to Help &gt; Contact Support</em></strong>). And they will be happy to work with you.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Shaun,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your description, you are using an IMAP account configured on an Outlook client, and whenever you manually move emails to another folder in the Outlook client, It will disappear. Let me know if I misunderstood.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check if you have already have <a href="https://support.office.com/en-US/article/choose-which-imap-account-folders-appear-in-outlook-32103602-a568-4499-9d25-54fe236aee6a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
subscribed to that particular folder</a>, so it will appear on the Outlook client.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the problem still occurs, please provide the following information to narrow down the issue:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.) The email account type you use. (POP3, IMAP, Exchanged mode)</p>
<p>2.) Outlook client type and version number (Outlook 2016, Outlook 2013, Outlook for Mac, etc.). To check the version number, go to File &gt; Office Account &gt; Office Updates.</p>
<p>3.) Using office 365 account, non-office 365 account (gmail,Hotmail,Yahoo) or a subscription based account.</p>
<p>4.) The screenshot of the error or instance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking forward to your updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Ruel</p>

            <p>Hi Shaun,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now we know that you have configured an IMAP account on Outlook 2016. Please provide us the screenshot of the error, so we can further check this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding “a collegue moves emails to a folder in outlook software and they vanish rather than move but are shown in office 365 webmail as having moved…” Do you mean that the emails are shown in the folder on Outlook Web App, but not in the Outlook client?
 Is the same folder resides under the Inbox folder, found on your webmail/<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook Web App</a>. Please provide a screenshot so we can better understand the situation.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now check whether these folders are subscribed in your Outlook 2016 client. As you mentioned clicking the
<strong>IMAP Folders</strong>… option is not working, based on my test and as an example:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have created an IMAP account on the Outlook client, now I created a folder named “imap created”, then right click the
<strong>Inbox</strong> folder, choose <strong>IMAP Folders…</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6e98aab1-abf4-4fc5-bbac-a9020d53ed52" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6e98aab1-abf4-4fc5-bbac-a9020d53ed52" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>After that, IMAP Folders pop-up will appear, I will now choose the “imap created” folder that I want to
<strong>Subscribe</strong>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f2b18681-fbf5-4baf-b2d5-160c36339e06" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f2b18681-fbf5-4baf-b2d5-160c36339e06" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>Right clicking the other folders will also show the “IMAP Folders…” option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you still cannot open the IMAP Folders Subscribe/Unsubscribe settings: </p>

            <p><span><span>Hi Shaun,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Based on your 2</span><sup><span>nd</span></sup><span> screenshot, you setup your email as IMAP account but you are
 connected to Exchange, which is quite weird. I want to know how and what steps did you do to configure this IMAP account?
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please check on File &gt; Account Settings &gt; Account &nbsp;Settings &gt; &nbsp;Email Tab, the
<strong>Type of account</strong> you are using. Based on my test, I noticed I am <strong>
connected to: Microsoft Exchange</strong> when I configure my Business Premium plan account as Exchange mode. (check this screenshot)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/caa9f123-2e90-40dc-b225-616fe0a9db2f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/caa9f123-2e90-40dc-b225-616fe0a9db2f" /></a></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>But when that same BP plan account, configured as IMAP account it will only show
<strong>Connected.</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/edf6cc89-ceee-4413-84bc-dd746566366b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/edf6cc89-ceee-4413-84bc-dd746566366b" /></a></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To narrow down the issue, please provide us the following information:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1.) The steps how did you configure the IMAP account on the Outlook client.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2.) The Outlook 2016 client version. (File &gt; Office Account &gt; Office Updates section)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3.) When you configure your email as Exchange mode in the Outlook client, let me know if the emails are now viewable.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4.) Configure the IMAP account on another computer, and check if there is any improvement.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span><span>Did you import the folder (Data protection), to the Outlook client? If yes try changing the View to
<strong>IMAP Message View</strong> and see if the folders for IMAP appears as well as the emails. To change view, go to View &gt; Change View &gt; Click the dropdown &gt; select
<strong>IMAP Message…</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Looking forward to your updates.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Best Regards,</span></span></p>

</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apologies, the accounts are all setup as Exchange.... am using the term IMAP inappropriately. From the setup account configuration the account details are given and outlook establishes them as Exchange accounts as shown in the images yet the accounts are
 not being mirrored from the webmail.</p>
