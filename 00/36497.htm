            Hi Kevin
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

            Hi KevinMurray9
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />I am assuming you are able to get into your computer. If not, do let me know.
<br />
<br />To know what exactly is causing the crashes, I need to analyze minidumps generated by crashes with WinDBG. WinDBG is the only tool which can do end to end complete analysis of ..dmp files generated by BSOD (Blue screen of death).
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Minidump 
<br />Zip the contents of the folder corresponding to date and time of your crashes. 
<br />Upload the content to Onedrive or any other file sharing site for me to locate the problem. 
<br />
<br />If you are uploading Memory.dmp also, please upload it separately as the size of memory dump is very large.
<br />
<br />If you don't get minidump files in above folder, you will need to enable minidump generation. If you need help to generate Minidump - <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-system/blue-screen-of-death-bsod/1939df35-283f-4830-a4dd-e95ee5d8669d">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

            A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>

<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be a clean Install. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)

<p>This is a bit worrying. Ended up here after two new clients dropped off desktop PCs which are now not booting this error - both failed around the same time before the weekend.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of them is encrypted with Bitlocker and they don't have a record of the recovery key :-( That means all I can do is system restore and loose all their apps and files... not good news for them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other isn't protected but I'm just taking my standard Macrium Reflect image before messing about. I found these two articles about using DSIM to recover and remove pending actions:</p>

<p>https://windows101tricks.com/fix-windows-10-blue-screen-error-0xc000021a/</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now one desktop with this error I could accept but two completely different models must be more than coincidence... I hope Microsoft isn't heading for an October update kind of incident again!</p>

    <title>How do you create an input method editor &#40;IME&#41;&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> voodoo priest  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do you create an input method editor &#40;IME&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been having innumerable problems with keyboard layouts on Windows 8.1 that I didn't have with Vista and 7 and I seem to have narrowed the source of the problem down to the custom keyboard layout that I'm using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The physical keyboard on the computer (whether a laptop or a desktop machine) is fr_FR (French, France; an AZERTY layout).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The default keyboard layout provided by Microsoft does not contain characters such as É, À, È, Ç, «, », etc. which are however mandatory in "correct" French. I'm a translator and proofreader so these are important to me. Therefore, back in 2011, I used Microsoft
 Keyboard Layout Creator 1.4 to add these characters (about a dozen characters) to the keyboard layout. The final keyboard layout
<a href="http://waavsolutions.com/pages/fr/divers.php#downloads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Download link for a custom keyboard layout that builds upon fr_FR">
can be found here</a> (second zip file). MSKLC builds an installable package for the keyboard layouts created, and installing the package adds the layout to the list of layouts available on the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that each time I go through the login screen, whether by restarting the system or by locking the computer with Win+L, the Language option in the Control Panel says something like "input method not available" (whereas, when it was only a suspend/resume
 or Win+L, the layout is still in effect). As a consequence of not finding the keyboard layout, Windows reverts to en_US, which makes my password fail since this is a Qwerty layout, but the most annoying aspect of the problem is that the keys I can see do not
 match the characters sent to the system. Put simply, Windows 8.1 loses track of the custom keyboard layout each time I see the login screen. This did not happen with previous versions of Windows (Vista and 7).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before someone suggests the idea, yes, I have set the default keyboard for all accounts and the login screen to the one I have created with MSKLC using the
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/change-keyboard-layout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
procedure offered by Microsoft</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I can notice in the list of keyboard layouts is that the one I built with MSKLC has no keyboard family (AZERTY, QWERTY, QWERTZ, etc.) in the left icon (I can only see "clavier", French for "keyboard") and that the "Preview" button is grayed out. To
 me, all of that hints to a compatibility problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>My question is: what tool did Microsoft offer to build alternative input methods or keyboard layouts compatible with Windows 8, 8.1 or 10</strong><strong>?</strong> MSKLC was working fine but the specifications seem to have grown broader and since
 the latest version of MSKLC was in 2007, it's rather normal that layouts created with it no longer fit the bill.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's got to be an alternative to leaving us stranded like this. <strong>How do you create an "IME" for newer versions of Windows?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Please share the info if you have it. Thanks.</p>

<p>I think you have complicated the thing. In my Windows 10 I have found more than one French keyboard layout ready to use, and all of them can input&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">É, À, È, Ç, «, », etc. For example, I have seen French
 keyboard layout AZERTY(France) and Canada French (QWERTY).</span></p>

<p>As I change to Canadian French keyboard layout, I can input è È é É ç Ç à À like in the image above. As&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">«, », you can press AltGr+z and AltGr+x. That's strange enough(because according to multiple images(like
<a href="http://ascii-table.com/img/keyboard-058.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this one</a>), the key at the left of Z should gives you «», but anyway, you have it on your keyboard.</span></p>

    <title>Windows Explorer Crash - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> smaruk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Explorer Crash</h2>
                    
<p>I experience a strange problem since today. As soon as I move my mouse pointer on the start button of Windows 7 (Home Premium, 64Bit), the explorer crashes. There's no way I can open the Start-Menu.</p>
<p>I can start programs using desktop links normally, I scanned my system for viruses already and I didn't experience those problems in the past. The Explorer just crashed and then is restarted (and crashes again as soon as I try to get to the Start-Button
 of Windows). The only way to shut down my system is to use the task manager and I can only access programs by using desktop links.</p>
<p>Most entries here deal with explorer crashes while using the right mouse-button - I can use right clicks without problem. So what can I do to fix this?</p>

            Ok, Andre, thank you for trying to help me fix this, but this whole problem really made me mad, since I was not able to use my PC as I wanted. So I finally decided to reinstall windows 7 completely - hopefully the problem will not return, otherwise I will
 post again.

                    the letters on my MS Natural 4000 wear off extremely fast, why is this such an issue? i know of at least one other person that has had this issue and they just changed to a different companies product, i dont really want to do that as none of the others
 have a keyboard like it<br />
is they anything that can be done about this? or could you make letter stickers made for the keyboard available?<br />

<p>Converting an AV signal to a TV signal through a modulator and then again use a TV tuner to de-modulate the generated TV signal is not a very elegant solution.</p>

            <p>I absolutely agree with you, the solution was just trying to keep it within the functionality of Windows Media Centre. How WMC captures the TV signal to generate the recording is specific. You would need to ensure an alternative capture file is compatible
 with WMC playback</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you would need an HDMI capable Video capture device but bear in mind that HDMI supports
<span><strong>H</strong>igh-Bandwidth <strong>D</strong>igital
<strong>C</strong>ontent <strong>P</strong>rotection and there is a distinct possibility the STB may be looking for a HDCP compatible device on the output. How the output device responds if not connected with HDCP active varies with Snow, an error message or
 just a blank screen being used or the signal is reduced to low res mode.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>StarTech make both USB 3 and internal PCI-e cards but there is no mention of HDCP in the specs and they are not cheap. There are low cost "game capture" devices but active content does not need HDCP so these almost certainly
 do not support it.</span></p>

<h3> ricosuave95  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows update error 80000ffff after non-genuine&#47;activation issue &#40;which is now resolved&#41;</h2>
                    So, in the early-middle of february, I was one of the unlucky who was getting a windows not genuine error out of the blue, despite it being activated and working fine for over a year.<br />
<br />
anyway, after many trials and tribulations, one windows update hotfix was removed manually, and I was able to reactivate windows using my same key.<br />
<br />
however, since that time, or possibly before, I have repeatedly been getting 8000ffff errors on windows update, saying that the install failed.<br />
<br />
i have tried almost every fix on the web based on this, and I have not been able to resolve it.<br />
<br />
i am getting annoyed and desperate at why this has happened.&nbsp; the system was running like a top for almost a year, and some sort of activation/genuaine snafu seems to have pooched it.<br />
<br />
is anyone able to assist and righting this issue, or am I relegated to doing a complete reinstall?<br />
<br />
im running windows 7 ultimate, and can provide whatever info necessary<br />
<br />
cheers.<br />

            <p>I had this problem last fall. Struggled for days to get my product key accepted...Talked to a tech, tried to get a new key online and on the telephone. Nothing worked. I just crashed the computer and started from the beginning. It worked for two days then
 a blue screen with a yellow line down the side. Took it in for repairs last week. Tech said I needed a ram chip. He replace the board. But when I got it home I could not install any updates or anti-virus. I got the 8000ffff error code. When I took it back
 to the tech he decided to delete Vista and install a new operating system.</p>
<p>Sounds like this software not genuine really did some damage. </p>

<p><strong>Kinect looks up and to the right (my left) when auto-zoom is engaged via Twitch. &nbsp;I have seen multiple people with this issue but have seen no responses with any information on how to correct it yet. It does this with every game I try, no matter

<p>Exactly the same issue I have. </p>
<p>The weird thing is, that the very first time I tried this, it actually worked. Suddenly the camera started zooming erratically. The next time I wanted to use kinect auto zoom it had found a fix point in the ceiling to the left from me.
</p>
<p>I'm thinking that it's because of the light from the windows, but the kinect knows where I am, so it doesn't make sense to me... please someone address this issue? It has apparently been an issue since 2014, as I can see from older post.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 stuck at 26 while updating - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 stuck at 26 while updating</h2>
                    <p>Good day!</p>
<p>
</p><p>While trying to install the latest windows 10 update, I found the issue. After finishing the download, the system requires me for reboot and I accept it. Henceforth it starts preparing the update (at this stage everything seems fine) but straight after that,
 it reboots, starts to installing the update and stuck at 26%. The PC after that ignores reset button, the only thing that helps is to plug the power wire off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I referred to this page https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/windows-10-update-stuck-at-26/2e0262d8-1521-43fd-95a7-68b98d88dd31
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But nothing was helpful. I executed exactly all the commands via cmd. As it didn't help, I downloaded this https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have even checked all my hard disks as well as ssd via Acronis and Victoria, but they have revealed no issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't know what to do. I could have just ignore this problem, but even my ESET Antivirus always reminds me that there is an important update...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance!</p>

            <p>Hi! Good suggestion from @Lawrence. Anti-Virus programs are causing a lot of update problems. I personally would uninstall your Virus program and go with Windows defender and malwarebyes Pro!</p>

            <p>Thank you for submitting the link, I'll try to look through it in order to find appropriate solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I have just tried to update with Windows 10 Update Assistant, but the problem is still the same.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I remember that I couldn't install this update in autumn as per the same problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, the Windows 10 Update Assistant tells me that I'am currently using the 10240 version meanwhile the latest version is 14393.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe there is another way to install the latest update? I mean manually or somehow...</p>
<p>Or does anybody know whether I can check any update bug log or something like this? Since when update stucks at 26% there is no error, the whole PC just locks. When I reboot it, it restores the previous windows 10 version and my update starts downloading
 again...</p>

<p>Thank you, Lawrence</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it seems like not the 3rd party anti virus program is the clue, since update issues have been already existing earlier (when there was no anti virus software at my pc installed).</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read all of the replies to this tread at the point in time I am starting to write this reply, that being said it seems that you would be open to a better way to go about having your device up to date with the Windows 10 OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do know this. By far the best possible type of installation for performance and trouble free present and future&nbsp;operation of any OS is a clean installation&nbsp;of&nbsp;the OS&nbsp;on&nbsp;a freshly formatted main drive (C: drive). If you have had Windows 10 on your device
 and activated in the past then&nbsp;this is now easily possible, with activation,&nbsp;and the results will be well worth the bit of extra effort and preparation involved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For a complete tutorial containing the Why to, How to prep, How to do it, How to finish&nbsp;it and then Maintain&nbsp;it, follow the instructions and info&nbsp;at the&nbsp;link below.</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-install-windows-10/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-install-windows-10/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Do note that:</p>
<p>Everyone that I have recommended this to in the past&nbsp;that&nbsp;had found the suggestion(s) to be quite daunting to them in the first place,&nbsp;that I was then&nbsp;able to "gently twist their arm" into doing it, reported back to me that (when following the procedure(s)
 as outlined)&nbsp;things went all very quite well, seamless, and&nbsp;with less time and effort consumed than had already been spent trying to repair what they had had&nbsp;already to start with, and&nbsp;also, then, after being done,&nbsp;they reported&nbsp;back that they were very happy
 and satisfied&nbsp;indeed&nbsp;with the end result(s).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well I hope that this helps you, I would definitely recommend to you that you consider&nbsp;using this method to resolve the issues at hand that your device is experiencing,&nbsp;all things considered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that this helps you and Good Luck.</p>
<p>

    <title>&#38;quot&#59;Glitch of Doom&#38;quot&#59;. Does 5th Ann. have a - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            &#38;quot&#59;Glitch of Doom&#38;quot&#59;. Does 5th Ann. have a fix&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>My Wife and I spent many, many hours together adventuring through this game. We were quite leisurely in our play style. Too much so, it seems.</p>
<p>We ran into this horrific glitch (secondary animations freeze at a single frame. Dubbed "Abomb Glitch" or "Glitch of Doom") at around 500 hours(?!?!) and the game was unplayable from there on. We were heading to the "Shivering Isles" content and did not
 make it there.</p>
<p>Since then, I found word about this glitch online and discovered that although there was a fix available for the PC, and (I think) the PS3, there would be NO patch for the Xbox version due to the need to "patch save files", I think. Apparently this is a
 practice that Microsoft frowns upon.</p>
<p>We have not had the will to start another game in the meantime.</p>
<p>Now I see this 5th Anniversary Edition on the shelf at the gamestore.</p>
<p>Apparently none of the smaller DLC ( Horse Armor, Wizard Tower, etc.) are included.</p>
<p>Can anyone tell me if this awful glitch described above is patched up somehow?</p>
<p>If the glitch is not repaired, I am troubled that this edition was released in that condition. In fact, with the lack of a patch/fix for this problem and the fact that the DLC is not included, Bethesda is charging $30 this year for a game I could have purchased
 last year for $20 (new). I would be paying $10 extra for a Steelcase and some Skyrim promotional material.</p>
<p>If this is the case (no pun intended), I am very disappointed in what would seem to be a cynical exploitation of their fanbase.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please tell me it has been fixed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>The problem you are referring too is called save bloat and there is, to be frank, no way of avoiding it. It mainly happens after you've spent a great deal of time with a save. Every save is a ticking time bomb, and that's just how it is. The only way to
 prepare for it is to constantly make new saves and delete older ones. It's not a glitch, it's a problem with what the game is running on. If they could patch it, they would've a long time ago. And there is no patch for the PS3 version. The PS3 version of the
 game has slightly better graphics, and that's about it as far as advantages it has over other versions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So no, it hasn't been fixed. And it won't be. Ever. At least not by Bethesda.</p>

<p>My understanding was that 'originally' when the glitch was discovered, the way to get rid of it's effects was to &nbsp;edit the game save. Easy to do on the PC, not quite as easy on the PS3 but still possible, and "not gonna happen" on the Xbox due to Microsoft's
 aversion/policy regarding allowing editing of game saves.</p>
<p>My hope was that with a 'new' version of the game could have the code altered to avoid this behavior.</p>
<p>I remain disappointed that an answer either could not be found (which I find hard to believe), or wasn't bothered with due to the relatively small number of gamers effected.</p>
<p>I am left with Bethesda Softworks releasing the "Game of the Year Edition" (currently listed at $19.99) in a steel case (whoop-de-do!), with a coupon(!?) for $10 off with the purchase of 2 items available in the Fall. They couldn't even throw in the DLC?!
 And they charge $29.99???!!</p>
<p>I'll grant you, it isn't criminal, but have they no SHAME??</p>

<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>It's not save bloat. So making new saves all the time doesn't prevent it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The a-bomb is is something to do with the frame rate counter.</p>
<p>For every frame the game renders the counter goes up by one.</p>
<p>When the counter reaches a certain level the game will glitch causing some animations like fire and doors to stop working.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It takes something like 200 to &nbsp;500 hours for the frame rate counter to reach the limit. When that happens the animations stop working and there is nothing you can do to fix it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just got to hope there are no bugs like this in Skyrim</p>

<p>Hi</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;My be this is very basic dumb question.</p>
<p>I just bought xbox one . Few games like spark , NBA etc. I have 2 controllers&nbsp;</p>
<p>My dumb question is how can 2 different players take these two controllers and play in the game Just like Wii (Ouch)</p>
<p>Spark &nbsp;game says its a 2 player .</p>
<p>I don't want to buy gold &nbsp;package . &nbsp;Whenever I choose multiplayer it prompts me to goto gold package screen</p>
<p>That is irritating .</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hello LuminaryChimp55,</p>
<p>I apologize for the frustration that your enduring. In order to play your games online via multiplayer you will need to have an Xbox Live Gold Membership. However, if you're trying to play offline, you can play via splitscreen if the games allows it. You
 can bypass the use of a profile for some games that don't require the online feature by selecting "No" when asking to sign in with a profile, but won't be able to gain any achievement for that particular game.

<h2>            Can you send me the product key for Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    Hi, awhile ago, I downloaded Windows 10 Home from www.microsoft.com, which I am greatly enjoying! Well, now, I want to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro, but I just realized that I deleted my e-mail that has the product key number. Could you please re-send my
 product key number? My e-mail is *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. Thank you!

            I doubt any one here will send you a key. If you purchased a key for Pro from MS go to the Store.

<p>hello my son has an xbox and was connected to xbox live yesterday. well today it wont connect to xbox live. when i go to test connection everything goes through on it. i checked to see if my xbox and profile will connect and mine does. but his profile will
 not connect. this is the first issue i have had with his xbox. he got it about 2 years ago and he got a 1 year membership card for christmas last year, so i know its not that. another thing i dont remember his email i did for him or password to even sign in
 on a computer. any help besides redo a new profile for him would be helpful. i dont have any more money to get him a new membership to play online. he just used his money yesterday to get all black ops map packs for zombies. so someone please help.</p>

<p>Monitor goes to sleep and will not wake untill I unplug the monito from the wall and re-plug in the monitor... I have searched the internet and found this is a recuring problem when windows 7 is installed.</p>
<p>I installed a new HD in my Dell 580S computer and had a clen install of windows 7.</p>
<p>It seemed to work fine until it went to sleep for the night.</p>
<p>When I taped the keyboard this morning the HD ran but the monitor did not come on.</p>
<p>I had to unplug it from the wall and re-plug the monitor to make it come on.</p>
<p>I searched the internet and found that MANY MANY others have had the problem after installing windows 7</p>
<p>What could be the problem?</p>
<p>going to the powere settings and changing the balance settings did nothing to resolve the issue.</p>

<p><span>Hi Woody121,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Have
 you made any recent changes on the computer before the issue occurred?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you receive any error message?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 1</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>To enable a device to wake your computer</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Open
 Device Manager by clicking the &nbsp;<strong>Start</strong> button, clicking&nbsp;<strong>Control Panel</strong>, clicking &nbsp;<strong>System and Security</strong>, and then, under &nbsp;<strong>System</strong>, clicking &nbsp;<strong>Device Manager</strong>.</span><span>‌</span><span>&nbsp;If

<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In
 the list of hardware categories, find the device that you want to enable to wake your computer, and then double-click the device name.</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Make
 sure that this option is enabled for both mouse and keyboard on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 the &nbsp;<strong>Power Management</strong> tab and then check&nbsp;<strong>Allow this device to wake the computer</strong> check box.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Restart
 the computer and check if this works fine.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 2</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the above step fails then you will need to update the display card drivers on the computer by visiting the card manufacturer website and check
 if it works.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 3</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the above step fails then check in the event viewer to know the cause of the Windows media center<span>&nbsp;</span>crash and post back with
 the details.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>What information appears in event logs (Event Viewer)?</span></strong></p>

            <p>Hi Pietvan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please provide more information regarding this issue for a better understanding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) What is the exact name of the “<strong><em>Magix</em></strong>” program that you are trying to use on your Windows 8 computer? Are you trying to use “<strong><em>MAGIX Rescue Your Videotapes!</em></strong>” program on the computer?</p>
<p>2) Did you manage to install this program on your new Windows 8 computer? If not, what is the exact error message that you get while trying to install it?</p>
<p>3) If you have managed to install the program, then what happens when you try to access it?</p>
<p>4) Did you check the compatibility of this program with Windows 8?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, I would first suggest you to check the compatibility of the program with Windows 8 from the Windows Compatibility Center from this link:</p>
<p>

    <title>License Transfer Duration - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thecowwentmoo  say:</h3>
<h2>            License Transfer Duration</h2>
                    
<p>I've been wondering how long a license transfer lasts, as I have been trying to download something from my friend which has corrupted and not finished several times.<br />
<br />
I need to know how long the transfer lasts for, without it becoming illegal/making me eligible for a ban.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hello</p>
<p>You can transfer content licenses from one console to another once every four months.</p>
<p>If your console was recently repaired, or if you’ve purchased a new console, use the license transfer option on your console to transfer content licenses. Here’s how:</p>
<p>On your console, sign in to Xbox LIVE using the gamertag that you used to purchase the content.</p>
<p>Go to the Settings, and then select Account.</p>
<p>Go to Your Billing Options, and then select License Transfer.</p>
<p>Follow the on-screen instructions to transfer the content licenses.</p>
<p>After the licenses are transferred, you need to download the content again to update the local licenses. This way the content can be used by other profiles on your console and when you’re not connected to Xbox LIVE.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p><span>Don't use the Services to do anything illegal. You are responsible for your actions and the consequences of your actions on the service, not Microsoft.</span></p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>System Restore affects only Windows system files, programs, and registry settings and&nbsp;not personal files. It can also make changes to scripts, batch files, and other types of executable files
 created under any user account on your computer.&nbsp; The infections on your computer might have removed the documents and pictures.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the methods mentioned below and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:
</span></strong><span>You may try to undo the system restore and check if the files still exist. To undo the changes System Restore makes</span></p>
<p><span>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open System Restore by clicking the<strong><span>Start</span></strong> button. In the search box, type
<strong><span>System Restore</span></strong>, and then, in the list of results, click<strong><span>System Restore</span></strong>.‌&nbsp;If you're prompted for an administrator password
 or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p><span>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click<strong><span>Undo System Restore</span></strong>, and then click
<strong><span>Next</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Review your choices, and then click
<strong><span>Finish</span></strong>.</span></p>

 find out how to fix this.</p>

<p>Gonna be honest with you bro, it definitely sounds like a hardware malfunction. &nbsp;You can try resetting your network settings to factory defaults (My Xbox, System Settings, Network Settings, Wired Connection, Configure Network, Additional Settings Tab, Reset
 To Factory Defaults) and then clear your cache x2 (My Xbox, System Settings, Memory, Y Button for Device Options, Clear System Cache), recover your GamerTag, reboot your console and network (a.k.a modem/router etc.) and see if that helps. &nbsp;If not, you're looking
 at a repair through Microsoft. &nbsp;Hope that takes care of it bro, if not, best of luck to ya :-)</p>
