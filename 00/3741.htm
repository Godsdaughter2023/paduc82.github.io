<h2>            Deleted row 1 and cannot recover it</h2>
                    I deleted row 1 and applied conditional formatting, also formatted data as a table with headers. I now need row 1 so I tried inserting another row and unhiding the row but nothing brings it back. The first row in the sheet is #2. Please help if you have
 any suggestions for getting row 1 back.&nbsp;

<p>Hi Rocio,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are a few reasons why you are experiencing issues with inserting a row in your Excel file. For us to provide better assistance, we would need you to answer the following questions:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you encountered any error messages upon trying to insert a row?</li><li>Are you experiencing the same issue with other Excel files or the issue is isolated with a specific Excel file?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>For initial troubleshooting, we suggest that you perform a repair for your Office applications. Repairing Office applications can address most of the common issues with Microsoft Office apps. To run the Office repair, visit this

</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are looking forward for your response. </p>

<p>We appreciate your response. Since your concern is a file specific issue, we suggest that you recover the previous version of the Excel files. This is so you could have the version of the file where the changes that you made are not applied yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To recover a previous version of an Excel file, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open File Explorer, and then look for the Excel file you are experiencing an issue with adding a row.
</li><li>Right click the Excel file, choose Restore to previous versions.</li><li>Choose the version of the file where the row that you've deleted is still present.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If further assistance is needed, don't hesitate to reach out to us. </p>

                    <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Hello Team,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I'm writing to discuss about my concern with my phone.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I've bought the product on Dec 30, 2015. After a few days, I started noticing that my phone was overheating. This started when I was charging my phone using my adapter and also the USB. And I've
 even observed the same occurrence when I was accessing 3g or playing games. I realize that a few phones overheat during gaming but this is just excessive.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">So I was obviously worried so I personally took my phone to the service center at Begumpet to get it checked. I was told not to worry, because the phone is overheating at the back and that it shouldn't
 be much of a problem. If it spreads both ways i.e. Screen and the back, that's when the trouble starts. They wanted to check the phone anyway and put it under observation for a week and I've obeyed the instruction and collected my phone the very next week
 after assurance that everything was fine.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Little did I know that the issue I've been facing has come out with an extension. My phone started heating up excessively on both sides. (Screen and the back) And when I contacted you guys about
 this, I was redirected to the service center where the issue multiplied and which was defying its purpose of service here. I'm highly dissatisfied and the expected standards are going to the dogs.&nbsp;​</span></p>

<h2>            Error 805a0194 When trying to download App</h2>
                    
<p>i am unable to download the navigation app and get the error code 805a0194. I have restarted the phone which is a Lumia 620 purchased only a day ago. A full reset has not helped.</p>
<p>The reason I purchased a Nokia was for the navigation. Is there anything I can do other than return the phone</p>

<p>I downloaded the .xap file to manually install and this app is listed as unsupported so it will not let you manually install. Its easy to say the store is at fault but it looks to me like the app is not compatible with some phones hence the error code on
 download. I wont be impressed if the "free" navigation advertised as a feature of the phone doesnt work for the next few months.</p>

    <title>16G HD Zune frozen at restore screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> julieshapiro  say:</h3>
<h2>            16G HD Zune frozen at restore screen</h2>
                    <p>I've got a 16G HD Zune.&nbsp;&nbsp; It has frozen up on me at a point where it wants to be plugged into the computer.&nbsp; When I plug it in it says it needs an update.&nbsp; I say OK, it goes through steps one and two and then hangs up.&nbsp; The update eventually fails.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
 Zune software doesn't see that the zune is attached.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The really frustrating thing is I cannot turn the zune off or reboot it or anything.&nbsp; The only screen I get is the one that says plug it in, and then when I plug it in it says it needs an update, and then when it fails it says to unplug it and reverts to
 the first screen.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked with device manager and tried to uninstall/reinstall the device driver.&nbsp; I've also tried every combination of buttons I can think of (I believe).&nbsp; There are three possible buttons--top, left side, and just below screen.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have any suggestions?&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks so much.&nbsp; </p>

</p><p>Thank you for posting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing I can think to try would be a hard reset, but you have to be able to restart the device in order to do one.&nbsp; Restarting an HD would be done by holding the Power button for a few seconds.&nbsp; If that works to restart it, as soon as the screen
 goes black, before the Zune startup screen pops up, immediately hold the side button (the Media button) and front button (the Home button).&nbsp; Hold that until the screen says Connect Zune to Your PC.&nbsp; Plug it in at that point, and follow the prompts in the Zune
 software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your device won't restart, here's a support article for a nonresponsive device:<br />
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-on-other-devices/windows-phone-7/zune-does-not-respond" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-on-other-devices/windows-phone-7/zune-does-not-respond</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>We no longer provide repair services for Zunes, so if you continue having issues after that you'll probably want to look into 3rd party repair options.&nbsp; A Bing search for Zune Repair Locations will give a few results that should help.</p>
<p>

    <title>merging excel data into word form - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chrisrowell  say:</h3>
<h2>            merging excel data into word form</h2>
                    <p>I am trying you use a list of data from excel 2003 containing names, job titles and other such information in to a form in word 2003 that needs to be completed 100+ times.</p>
<p>I have an excel spreadsheet containing all the sections on the word form I need filling such as Team, Role, Name etc but rather than wite the form out 100+ times I was wondering if it is possible to extract the information row by row in to the word form
 to then save it or print it and then as I update the data in excel have another form completed.</p>
<p>Yes I could do this by hand for each users/form but as I already have the info from my HR deptartment and some of the information needs updating I thought I could complete the forms and update the details automatically.</p>
<p>I have looked at mail merging the form to the data but seem to be getting confussed linking cells to fields and it not quite working right. Below is a cut of part of the form that i need to fill. Some of it is check box and some of it is text as you can
 see so hence my confusion.</p>

            It sounds like you are going in the right direction for a Mailmerge, but
<div>
<div>&nbsp;a. for MailMerge, your Excel data needs to be organised in a simple tabular format, with one row in the Excel sheet for each Vacancy and (ideally) a header row at the top with a name for each column. If your spreadsheet is organised some other way, things
 will be difficult or impossible.</div>
<div>&nbsp;b. you mention "linking cells to fields". If you are copying cells in Excel and paste/linking them in Word, that is the wrong thing. In Word 2003, make sure you can see the MailMerge toolbar (View-&gt;Toolbars) and that you have connected your data source
 (use the second button on the toolbar), then insert one "Merge field" for each item of data that you need to insert.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;c. Mailmerge is designed to work with one record (i.e. Excel row) per form. If you need data from more than one row in your form, or data from different parts of the Excel sheet, you will either need to do a more complex mailmerge, or choose a different
 approach.</div>
<div>&nbsp;d. if your existing form is a word form with formfield fields, for mailmerge, they are the wrong thing and need to be replaced by MERGEFIELD fields.</div>
<div><br />
<div>For example, if your sheet has columns called</div>
<div>"PositionTitle", "PositionID", and so on, the relevant part of your document should look something like this:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Position Title:<span> </span>Position ID (where applicable):</div>
<div>&lt;&lt;PositionTitle&gt;&gt;<span> </span>&lt;&lt;PositionID&gt;&gt;</div>
<div>
<div><br />
<div>(assuming the values should appear under the captions)</div>
<div><br />
<div>(this may also appear as</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>Position Title:<span> </span>Position ID (where applicable):</div>
<div>{ MERGEFIELD PositionTitle }<span> </span>{ MERGEFIELD&nbsp;PositionID }</div>
<div><br />
<div>You can use alt-F9 to toggle between showing these { MERGEFIELD } codes and the "mergefield name with chevrons"/data preview views.</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;e. Once you have done all that, you should save your form (the "Mail Merge Main Document"). You should be able "preview" the merge and see what the form looks like with data from each row in the Excel sheet. You can then merge to a new document, check
 it, and print it.</div>
<div>&nbsp;f. Once you have performed the merge, the results are completely disconnected from the data source. So if you change a row in your Excel sheet, the output merge document is not updated automatically. You can, however, select an individual row using the
 Edit Recipients option, and merge to a new document containing the output for that one row. Or, if you have a column in your sheet called "Changed" for example, you can mark which rows you have changed and filter them in Edit Recipients.</div>

    <title>&#39;Connecting to Printer&#39; delay in Office 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jammybear  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#39;Connecting to Printer&#39; delay in Office 2010</h2>
                    When I print from Office 2010 applications (in Windows 7) the print dialog shows my default (and only) printer with the message '<b><i>connecting to printer</i></b>' which takes up to about 10 seconds to resolve to '<b><i>ready</i></b>'.&nbsp; If I click on
 'printer properties' another pregnant pause ensues before the print drivers own dialog box opens and, having adjusted properties, it can then take up to another 10 seconds before the print button responds to the click to print.&nbsp; It only happens with Office
 - everything else gets on with the job at a proper pace.<br />
<br />
I have searched for various answers to this.&nbsp; So lets lay a few to rest right here.<br />
<ul>
<li>Unchecking the '<b><i>print in background</i></b>' option makes no difference at all.&nbsp; My PC has a Core i5 2.5 GHz processor with 6Gb of RAM so there is plenty of power and resource available.&nbsp; What's more if I click on 'printer properties' again (just
 to see how it performs) there is another equally long pregnant pause.&nbsp; Had the first delay been due to loading the print drivers dialog it would now be resident in memory so not subject to those delays next time round.<br />
<br />
</li><li><b><i>Updating the print drive</i><i>r</i></b> makes no difference at all.&nbsp; I would have been very suprised if it had as all other applications like Adobe Acrobat Reader, Firefox, Thunderbird and so on do not exhibit these delays - they are peculiar to
 MS Office.<br />
<br />
</li><li><b><i>Using REGEDIT</i></b> to delete the HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Word\Data also makes no difference at all.<br />
<br />
</li><li>I have not reinstalled fonts - finding it hard to believe that other applications can work successfully with the same mainstream fonts like Calibri that Office might allegedly find 'broken'.<br />
</li></ul>
My conclusion so far is that it has to be something in the Office 2010 suite itself otherwise how come other applications perform as expected.<br />
<br />
Can anyone help?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
Al<br />

            Like you, other people have had other printing problems that were unique to Office.<br />
<br />
Have you tried other printers / printer drivers. Say non-physical printers like MS XPS or a PDF generator. Are they any better.<br />
<br />
What make and model of printer do you have?<br />
<br />
Have you tried OLDER printer drivers for your printer? <br />
<br />
Is your printer connected directly to the PC or is it on a network (even a home network were the printer is connected wirelessly or the printer is connected to the router to allow sharing with other computers)?<br />

<p>Another thing to consider is the mix of 32 and 64-bit. Many people have found that trying to mix 32 and 64-bit elements in the print stream simply does not work. So, if you are using 64-bit Office, as a final solution you may want to try uninstalling and

<div>
<p style="margin-left: 0">This link describes how the user solved an Excel crashing problem by switching to an alternate printer driver.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">I find it surprising, but it shows how closely Excel (and Word) are tied to the printer and printer driver.
</p>
<p>I had faced this issue as the printer driver caused the problem.</p>
<p>In my case,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Fault Module Name:&nbsp;hpz3r5k2.dll&nbsp;caused by the printer Officejet K8600 driver.</p>
<p>It is not compatible with excell 2010 during print preview.</p>
<p>After work out almost 2 weeks, I figured out the solution, found that printer driver Officejet K7100&nbsp;solved the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the printer Officejet K8600, I change the driver to Officejet K7100 series.</p>
<p>Voila, no more crash and restarting when using print preview and printing working great.</p>
<p>(You need to download the driver if you don’t have it)</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<div><b>Remove Older Printer Drivers </b></div>
<p>Oddly enough, this ended up being the cause of my problem. I had an older print driver installed on my Win7 machine and once I removed that driver, Word started working without any problems!</p>
<p>You can delete individual printer drivers by going into the registry. Note that simply going to Printers and Faxes and deleting a printer there does not delete the printer driver.</p>

<div>New Problem Printing with More than one computer on a network (add Print Server)
<div>
<p style="margin-left: 0">If you have a home or work network with more than one computer you may run into a problem after “upgrading” your OS on one machine.</p>
<p>A common reason for this problem is that the new OS has changed to 64-bit.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Many computers (especially older ones) come with 64-bit computer chips, but a 32-bit Operating system. When you upgrade the OS, the upgrade process recognizes you have a 64-bit chip and “automatically” switch to 64-bit for you.</p>
<p>The problem is that simple networked Printing is one area where you can’t mix “bitness”. If your print server computer (the computer the printer is connected to) does not match the bitness of the sending computer you will Often have a new problem that hadn’t
 existed before.</p>
<p>One solution is to get a separate “print server” device. This is actually a small, dedicated, limited function computer that ‘only does’ printing, accepting print job submissions from other computers on the network.</p>
<p>This article describes how to add one specific type of Print Server (there are many others available):

            Wow.&nbsp; Lots of answers and so soon.&nbsp; What a great forum.<br />
<br />
To answer some of your questions:<br />
<br />
The printer is an HP C7280 and it is connected wirelessly through a home network.&nbsp; It is also the default printer.&nbsp; All applications connect and print to it quickly.&nbsp; It's only MS Office that exhibits these annoying latencies.<br />
<br />
This has been the situation for a long time now - it's just getting under my skin now with more to print at present.<br />
<br />
It is the same for all Office documents - new and older docs.<br />
<br />
The print driver was updated from the HP website and is the latest version.<br />
<br />
Thanks to Rohn007 for a heap of sensible ideas to try.&nbsp; I'll work on that and get right back.<br />

            Interesting ...<br />
<br />
I followed the advice about installing a TEST PRINTER (no physical printer attached of course) and set it up for LPT1.&nbsp; The latencies did not occur when I went to print - it was ready immediately.&nbsp; Of course I couldn't actually print as there was no device
 to print to.<br />
<br />
Still thinking.<br />

            I wonder if the delay is in the wireless connection.<br />
<br />
Just for the "halibut", try connecting the printer with a wire, probably a USB wire.
<br />
<br />
I found this loosely similar problem:<br />
<div>
Win 7 / Office 2013 / HP Printing problem / HP MFP Printer
<p><span>have latest version of Office 2013 installed Windows 7-32bit. I can only print one time (one print job sent) from any Office app, if I try printing again (sending another print job to the printer from the same office app
 or even non-office apps like Adobe PDF) the job gets stuck spooling, never progresses or prints. I can only print again if I reboot my computer, and then only once if I print from an Office 2013 app.
<br />
<br />
I have confirmed this is an Office 2013 bug because I have Office 2010 still installed so the very same document will print on the same printer fine and I can print after that just fine. So once I try to print from any Office 2013 app, the print spooler hangs.</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>After the problem occurred again even though I disabled Windows Defender, I have now confirmed it is the Printer driver (HP MFP printer). I determined this by setting up a “virtual” printer and was able to print to it consistently &nbsp; with
 no problem. Interestingly, that printer was one from the Windows 7 normal selections and probably older than the printer I am trying to print to. Unfortunately HP has not updated my printer’s driver since 2009 and I doubt they will at this point. I still don’t
 know what has changed in Office 2013 vs. 2010 that would cause a working printer driver to have this problem.&nbsp;</p>
<br />
<br />
You can try this tool, I doubt it will help for this specific problem, but ...<br />

            <blockquote>I wonder if the delay is in the wireless connection.<br />
</blockquote>
<br />
Yes, I wondered that too.&nbsp; But as other applications - 64 bit apps whereas Office is the 32 bit model - drive the printer with no discernible delay I would say not.<br />
<br />
And thanks too for the HP Print Doctor thought.&nbsp; But I'd been there already with no result!<br />
<br />
As an old programmer and trained in the sciences I tend to think about these things in discrete modules that hand stuff back and forth to one another.&nbsp; If the other apps work OK across the network why would Office not do so?&nbsp; If I had a problem in my car I'd
 be sitting here thinking it through rather before changing any parts.&nbsp; Same with software.&nbsp; What are the common factors?&nbsp; Where must this problem lie?<br />
<br />
But being an old programmer I also recognise that a system of systems can produce some odd 'emergent' behaviours when they interact in unforeseen ways.&nbsp; Windows seems to be specially prone to such 'emergent' behaviours but maybe that's just the old cynic in
 me raising his ugly head.<br />
<br />
Still scratching.<br />

OK, lets treat Office as the offender. Here are some generic trouble shooting techniques for Word, for example lets see if they can identify a 3rd party addon that is causing the problem<br />
<br />
<div>
<b>A General Starting point when Word does something unexpected</b>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<p>As a general rule, when something seems to be going wrong, or at least not the way you want it to go, in Word “menu’ go to Tools and then Options, in Word “ribbon” go to File then Options, and study all of the various options,
 both turned on and off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may even get lucky and find some other settings that you want to try that have nothing to do with the current problem.</p>
<p>When I was teaching Word and other Microsoft Office programs at a private business college, I had three rules:</p>
<p>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Always check Tools Options</p>
<p>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>When in doubt, right-click on something</p>
<p>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If you’re wondering how to set up a special kind of material in a document, consider whether Word tables are suitable. The placement officer of the school came to me several times and asked how I thought she should set something up. Each time the answer
 was, “I’d use a Word table.” By the fifth time she had stopped asking--she got the point.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in">

<b>A good, simple quick fix is “Boot your computer”</b>
<p><span>The simplest fix is shutting down your computer normally and restarting it. Often subtle “corruption” happens to create unusual effects. Shutting down and restarting the computer resets all of the

</b>part of this procedure is disabling addins. If you want to take a shortcut, check to see if you have a BlueTooth device driver or addin, ie “send to Bluetooth”, installed. Disabling BlueTooth is rapidly moving to the top of my Office trouble shooting process.
 Blue Tooth drivers have been identified as the cause of problems with many different “random” symptoms. If you have BlueTooth, disable it in control panel, device manager and possibly as an addin in Office apps.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It’s not that I think there is anything inherently bad with Blue Tooth. The problem is with the people writing the drivers.</p>

<b>Don’t Assume ANYTHING!</b>
<p>Don’t assume some part of the trouble shooting processes listed below doesn’t apply to you. Often there are things going on in the background that you just aren’t aware of. For example, when installing software it is all too
 easy to have an unwanted app installed if you don’t carefully read every screen.
</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<div>
<b>Uninstall Recent Software</b>
<p>At this point, you have also think about any software or plugins that you may have installed on your computer. Annoyingly, this problem with Word can be caused by a program that is completely unrelated to Word!</p>
<p>Did you recently install some new hardware? A printer, scanner, label machine, web cam, tablet, etc? Have you installed any software? If so, uninstall it and see if the problem goes away.<span>&nbsp;

<p>As well, I just saw this problem and solution:</p>
<p>It started off just affecting the Outlook program, crashing before even opening the data store (OST file). &nbsp;I removed and readded the users' email account to no avail. &nbsp;I then attempted
 a quick office repair, followed by a full repair when the quick repair didn't work (I then had to re-activate Office for some reason...right before Word crashed). &nbsp;Now, after a restart, everything crashes a few seconds after opening with the below report.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, I was able to fix it by (and this makes no sense) removing the Epson XP 800 printer software.&nbsp; After talking with the user a bit more after lunch, he informed me that he installed this printer on his personal computer
 and that it also killed his Office pack.&nbsp; </p>
<p>After fully uninstalling all Epson software that would uninstall and a full regedit to remove the parts that wouldn't uninstall I was able to get his Office running again

            <p>Encountered this slow Word today with "Connecting to printer". &nbsp; Explorer when connecting to certain Libraries in Windows 7 was also slow, and we use mapped network drives to local filer servers. &nbsp; User had some printers that were not recognized custom print
 to PDF printers, and also some older network printers served from an older print server, and using Universal PS driver. &nbsp; Carpet bomb approach. &nbsp;Removed all printers, restarted Print Spooler Service, removed all Driver Packages from Print Management. &nbsp;Reinstalled
 all network printers with the latest PCL5 drivers. &nbsp; Issue resolved. &nbsp;No more word lag, no more explorer lag in Libraries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reminds me of an XP issue with certain fax drivers, and also with old network drive mappings that were no longer valid.</p>

    <title>Outlook 2016 only runs in Safe Mode - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davek9  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 only runs in Safe Mode</h2>
                    <p>In the last week, my Outlook 2016 won't start except in Safe Mode. This seemed to be related to several auto updates for Windows and for Office 365. For a couple of hours the other day Outlook had magically returned to normal, but then another update. I
 get the 'Microsoft has stopped working' message and have to close the program and go in via Safe Mode.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried deactivating all the COM add-ins, but it does not help. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In Safe Mode, I do not have any of my archive of subfolders - this part is freaking me out since this is my business email. I am hoping those emails are still in the .pst / .ost (I forget which is the current extension).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            updating office 2000</h2>
                    how do i update office 2000? I found this statement on the office 2000 SP3 download site: "Microsoft recommends that users install the Office 2000 SP3 update using the<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/ProductUpdates/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Office Products Updates</a>
 site. This site will detect your Office installation and prompt you to install exactly what you need to be completely updated. Thiscan minimize the time you spend downloading this update." but when I go there i don't see where or how to update office 2000.
 Can I install SP3 or do i need to install the older update in order?<br />

    <title>Hotmail connector scrambled umlauts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mcluki99  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hotmail connector scrambled umlauts</h2>
                    <p>Hey there!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I moved all my family's email accounts to Outlook.com (with my own Domain added in Domains.live.com).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I uploaded my old emails (stored in PST files) via Outlook 2010 with latest (german) Hotmail Connector installed. Therefore i just imported the .pst file into my Hotmail-Connected-Account and emails had been uploaded immediately.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2 issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>some folders had special characters in it -&gt; import stopped without telling me. I changed folder names in .pst and imported again -&gt; ok</li><li>all german "umlauts" in e-mail-subject or plain-text-e-mails are now scrambled in Outlook.com</li></ul>
<p>I guess the Hotmail connector doesn't handle&nbsp;"umlauts" correctly. [I tried a Office 2013 trial Version, which doesn't need the connector -&gt; it couldn't import pst-files because it isn't supported with Outlook.com :-/]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are my e-mails permanently destroyed or can I hope for a fix in the near future?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Just a couple of quick questions.<br />
<br />
1) Are you importing the .pst file with special characters into Hotmail mail folders?<br />
2) Which version of Outlook were you using before? Did you experience any similar issue in previous version Outlook?<br />
<br />
Let's try the following and verify the result<br />
<br />
1) Instead of importing the *.pst file, lets open it and verify the result.<br />
2) If you're unable to open it from current profile, create a new profile and then try opening the *.pst file.<br />
<br />
<span>Follow the instructions mentioned in the link below for instructions on how to create new profile:</span><span><br />

</span>Reply with the result for further assistance.<br />

Thank You.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) exactly. I tried to import a pst-file into my new Hotmail account using Outlook 2010. (I am switching from Exchange Server to Outlook.com)</p>
<p>2) I am using Outlook 2010. Never had any Problems, but i wasn't using Hotmail before...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I opened the pst-file in outlook 2010 instead of importing it. The file content itself looks good. I can see all folders with "umlauts" and special characters in it:
<a href="http://www.imagebanana.com/view/opihpn9l/datendatei.PNG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I guess the hotmail-connector destroys "umlauts" when uploading the mails and Outlook.com (or the connector) simply doesn't support folders with special characters? (which is not a big deal).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hi ED,</p>
<p>Distribution group last used information is not covered in the Get-distributiongroup command. And it’s not feasible to see this information directly in Office 365.</p>
<p>As a workaround, <a href="https://www.google.co.jp/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0ahUKEwifpb7kv7XKAhWGJJQKHTWECnEQFggbMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechnet.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Flibrary%2Fjj200668(v%3Dexchg.150).aspx&amp;usg=AFQjCNEsKm7jmOhKTgX37Cc43ia6JNJJCw&amp;sig2=PZGu_eBlxwUKDvIic5La-g&amp;bvm=bv.112064104,d.dGo&amp;cad=rja" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

                    <p>I have some documents with a huge number of styles that are not in use, and that I'd like to remove. I know I can delete them one at a time. Is there a way to delete a large number of styles not in use from a document? I'd like to leave it so that it only
 has styles in use within document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found that the document map tends to work poorly or not at all if there are many unused styles in the document.</p>

            Hi DJ:
My name is Ron.

Yes, having too many unused styles in the document complicates it. And can lead to document corruption.  I have several documents I collect info from the web into. They are constantly adding unused styles that I clean up.  Actually, it is a 2 step process. First delete unused styles, then I go through remaining "extra" styles and apply my standard styles before deleting the now unused style.

Here are some macros you can play with to find one that works best for you:
DETERMINING HOW MANY STYLES ARE AVAILABLE
http://word.tips.net/T000803_Determining_How_Many_Styles_are_Available.html 
Summary: Got a macro that processes or uses styles? You definitely need to know how many styles Word has available in the document. Use the Count property of the Styles collection to determine the figure. 

FINDING UNUSED STYLES
http://word.tips.net/T001488_Finding_Unused_Styles.html 
Summary: Use this VBA macro to determine which styles are being used in the current Word document.

<h2>            xv6800 w ActiveSync 4.5 worked well for 4 months &#38; no longer syncs</h2>
                    
<p><span>I was able to sync my Verizon xv6800 with ActiveSync immediately when I bought the phone in Feb 2008. I was using Outlook 2000 from Office 2000
 Professional.&nbsp;It worked fine (VERY slow compared to PALM OS &amp; HotSync!) until last week. It no longer syncs.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I uninstalled ActiveSync and reinstalled it from my Verizon CD; this didn't work. I uninstalled it and reinstalled it from microsoft.com; this
 didn't work.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I ran ActiveSync Troubleshooter. Even though I was able to sync for 4 months, the trouble shooter said Outlook 2000 was incompatible and I needed
 to upgrade to a newer version. I knew this was BS but went out &amp; bought Outlook 2007. It still doesn't Sync.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I contacted Verizon Customer Service &amp; was bumped up a level. He worked with me for nearly three (3) hours! He had never had a problem with Windows
 Mobile 6 that he couldn't fix. He tried everything. He came to the conclusion that it is a MS problem. Hence this post.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here is what happens when I use the USB connector:</span></p>
<p><span>1) Phone is detected.</span></p>
<p><span>2) ActiveSync window is displayed with "Connected".</span></p>
<p><span>3) ActiveSync goes to "Looking for Changes" after 15-30'.</span></p>
<p><span>4) Synchronization starts; it gets to 3 green bars after 3-5' and shuts down.
</span></p>
<p><span>5) ActiveSync switches to "Not Connected"</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>PC: Windows Media Center (XP PRO?)</span></p>
<p><span>Firewall: Kaspersky Internet Security (Yes I have paused protection &amp; the problem is still there. And yes I have switched to training mode and
 the problem is still there.)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Everything looks good in Outlook on my PC.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>HELP!!!</span></p>

<p>Thanks for the reply Jack,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll try to run it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I have solved the problem by reading some other syncing posts and some common sense. Here's what I did:</p>
<p>1) I "unchecked" the box next to "&nbsp;Enable advanced network functioality&nbsp;" under Settings/USB to PC. I was able to synch immediately. However, it took 30-45' to Sync.</p>
<p>2) I found WM-06 identified my Desktop PC as two different PCs. The two names were: Windows PC and Windows PC 2. It would not allow me to remove Windows PC 2 so I deleted the&nbsp;original one, Windows PC. It now Syncs great again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I now have one remaining issue. ActiveSync does not&nbsp;open automatically when I connect my phone via USB. This is despite the fact that I have a check in the box next to Open ActiveSync when my device connects&nbsp;&nbsp;(File/Connection Settings). My "Work
 around" is to open ActveSync manually and then close the window and ActiveSync shows up white in the SysTray. I then connect my device via USB and ActiveSync opens up and eventually Syncs my device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can live with this but do you have any suggestions to avoid the step above?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks, Mike&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Mike</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had to wait until I got home to check this out a little bit.&nbsp; I did not have a computer with me that was running activesync. You had indicated that you had to start activesync then close it to have it appear in the sys tray.&nbsp; Then if you connect
 your device it will open.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you click on that icon in the tray and go into Connection Settings, is the first box checked that says "show status box in taskbar"?&nbsp; And is the second to last box checked that says Open Activesync when my device connects?</p>

<br />A circular reference is created when you refer to same cell either directly or indirectly. We use circular references only when we need circular references.

<br />Excel circular references occur either when a formula refers to itself or when a chain of formulas links back to it’s starting point.
<br />Most of the time circular references are created by mistake (unintended circular references) and should be corrected. They can also be used to solve iterative or goal-seeking problems in Finance and Engineering.

<h2>            Composite key and foreign key question for Microsoft Access 2016</h2>
                    <p>In Microsoft Access 2016 I am trying to set up relationships between tables.&nbsp; When I set up a foreign key in another table the relationship shows with 1 on one side and many on the other side.&nbsp; However there is no key next to the foreign key.&nbsp; Can Microsoft
 Access 2016 put a key next to a field that I made into a foreign key?&nbsp; Does it make a difference whether or not when I see the table the foreign key has a key next to it or not?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, how do I make a composite key?</p>

<p>That's not how it works. The key symbol is only for PKs, not FKs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A composite key is created using the Indexes form (see ribbon) while the table is in design view.</p>

<p>A foreign key (FK) doesn't get a key icon. A FK is not a particular type of field, it's just how the field is being used. If you look at the Relationships Window you can identify PK's by the key icon, and FK's by the fact that they're at the end of an arrow
 from the PK in the related table. You must, however, check the "Enforce Referential Integrity" button on the Join Type popup when you create the relationship.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A multifield primary key is easy to create: just ctrl-click all the fields comprising the key and then click the Key icon on the ribbon. If you are joining a multifield PK to a multifield FK, you must drag all of the fields from the parent table to the corresponding
 field in the child table (and click the Enforce button).&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am not a fan of composite keys. They will cause you more headaches then they solve.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use an Autonumber field to generate a PK that can be used as a foreign key. If you need to impose uniqueness on a combination of fields, you can use a multi-Field unique index to do that. This is done in the Index function by selecting multiple fields under
 a named index with the name blank and seeting No Dups for the named index.&nbsp;</p>

            To create a composite primary key on two or more columns (fields), in table design view hold down the Ctrl key and left click on each of the columns, being sure to click on the 'field selector' (the small square to the left of the column name).&nbsp; Then right
 click and select 'Primary Key' from the shortcut menu.&nbsp; You should then see the key symbol against each of the columns.<br />
<br />
However, a table might have more than one candidate key, so alternative keys, whether single column or multi-column, must be defined as such by their inclusion in a unique index.&nbsp; For instance, it might be necessary to create a unique index on the EmployeeID,
 ProjectID and CityID columns in a ProjectEmployees table to prevent the same employee being assigned to the same project in the same city more than once.&nbsp; In pre 2007 versions this is done in table design view by selecting Indexes from the View menu; in later
 versions by selecting Indexes on the Design ribbon.&nbsp; In the dialogue which opens enter a suitable name for the index in the first empty row of the Index name column, ProjectEmployee say.&nbsp; In the Field Name column of the same row enter ProjectID, and with this
 row still selected, in the Index Properties below, select 'Yes' as the Unique property.&nbsp; Then enter EmployeeID in the Field Name column in the row immediately beneath ProjectID.&nbsp; Don't enter anything in the Index name column for this row.&nbsp; Then enter CityID
 in the Field Name column in the row immediately beneath EmployeeID.&nbsp; Again, don't enter anything in the Index name column for this row.&nbsp; Close the dialogue and save the table design.<br />
<br />
BTW the hypothetical example cited above is purely for illustration purposes.&nbsp; Such a table would almost certainly not be normalized to Fifth Normal Form (5NF) and would be in need of 3-decompostion.&nbsp; In the rare situations where such a table is normalized
 to 5NF, it would make more sense to designate the three columns as the composite primary key.&nbsp; Adding a surrogate autonumber column as the primary key would serve no purpose, as it is very hard to envisage a situation where the ternary relationship type modelled
 by such a table would be referenced by another table.&nbsp; An additional autonumber column would merely add an additional and unnecessary burden, albeit a relatively small one, on the database engine in the maintenance of a further index.<br />
<br />
While a foreign key is not specifically indicated as such in the visual representation of a table definition in the table design window, the visual representation as such being in the relationships window, it is designated as such in DDL.&nbsp; The following is
 an example from one of my demo files:<br />
<br />
CREATE TABLE DrugForms <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; (DrugName VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DrugForm VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CONSTRAINT PrimaryKey PRIMARY KEY (DrugName, DrugForm), <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CONSTRAINT DrugsDrugForms<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FOREIGN KEY (DrugName) REFERENCES Drugs (DrugName), <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CONSTRAINT FormsDrugForms<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FOREIGN KEY (DrugForm) REFERENCES FormTypes (DrugForm));<br />
<br />
BTW, drug form in the above refers to the form in which the drug is available, e.g. tablet, capsule etc.<br />

<h2>            Invoices are not visible</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I am signed up as a skype manager for a company based in Italy (so on your country list). For accounting purposes I need to print out invoices (the document must bare the name INVOICE, have a unique INVOICE NUMBER, VAT can stay at 0% if not applicable)
 of the credit purchases made (or the credit used month by month). When selecting the period I am interested in, I see my credit purchases, then I go to next month, select invoices, however, no invoices are there. I can only view REPORTS which from accounting
 point of view are worthless to me. Even if I select longer periods of time and hit INVOICES, I get no results. Apparently something has changed in the recent past, because it used to be easy to get a hold of the invoices. I advice you to review your steps
 on "How can I download a VAT invoice" as the actions recommended do not reflect what I see on my skype manager screen. Thank you. &nbsp;

</p><p>It is true that Italy is part of the countries where VAT or GST invoices are available to download for Skype Manager admins, however, Skype does not charge VAT or GST when you purchase or allocate Skype Credits, so these transactions will not reflect on
 VAT and/or GST invoices. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Your members' transactions&nbsp;<em>(Skype Credit usage for calls, SMS or Wi-Fi as well as purchases made with allocated Skype Credit)</em> will incur VAT or GST if the registered billing address of the personal linked address of the personal linked account is
 in a country where VAT or GST is applicable. </p>

It is because the checkbox control can't be formatted.&nbsp; So, what you could do is use the On Format event of the section of the report that control is in.&nbsp; You would then use something like:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Me.YourCheckBoxName Then</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.LineNameHere.BorderColor = vbRed</p>
<p>Else</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.LineNameHere.BorderColor = vbBlack</p>
<p>End If</p>

            <p>When you say "line", do you mean a line control or do you mean the entire detail section.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bob's suggestion is for a line control, but you forgot to specify the ForeColor property:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.GroupDiscount.ForeColor = vbRed</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OTOH, I suspect you meant the entire detail section.&nbsp; In this case you need to set the sevtion NackColor property:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.Section(0).BackColor = vbRed</p>
<p>and if you also want the text boxes to be red, set all of the text box's BackStyle&nbsp;to Transparent so the detail section's color shows through..</p>

            You say "the line" - do you mean a Line control on the form, or (as I'm guessing) do you want all the other controls (textboxes, whatever) on this line to change color based on the value in the field?
<div><br />
<div>If the latter, you will need to set conditional formatting on each of the controls that you want to change color - not on the checkbox. The conditional formatting expressions will reference the Boolean field.</div>

            Wait Marshall,
<div>I thought your suggestion for the section color didn't work but when I decided to print the report as is, the color showed in print preview mode. Unfortunately the section color was a little more than I was looking for. I really only want the fonts to
 change to red.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Why wouldn't the color show in regular report view?</div>
<div><br />
<div>I retried the other suggestions and check print preview but neither worked--both gave me coding errors.</div>

<div>That worked beautifully for one of the fields on the line, but not for the other. Also the boolean check box is unaffected. Still stuck, but getting closer.</div>

            <p>You'll have to explain more about the "one or the other".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And a checkbox control is "what you see is what you get" - it does not have a forecolor property; you just can't change its appearance. Sorry, but that's just the way the control works! You could bind a combo box to the Boolean field, with a List of Values</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-1;"Yes";0;"No"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use a column count of 2 and bound column 1, ColumnWidths 0";.125" or the like, and you can set its conditional formatting to show a black No or a red Yes. There are other options but... changing the color of a checkbox control just isn't one of them!<br />

<p>Hi Smoke,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To better help you, I have done more tests. In Outlook for Mac client, if you click the “accept and view calendar”, the shared calendar will not be added to your client. It is not like Outlook for Windows and Outlook Web App(OWA), you need to
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/open-a-shared-exchange-calendar-in-outlook-2016-for-mac-060b7bd5-de72-421c-be53-e80266468bd2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Open Shared Calendar</a></strong> so that you can add it.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After you have added the shared calendar, the primary calendar and the shared calendar will both show up in the shared calendar. According to your requirements, the users doesn’t want to share the primary calendar to others. However, for now the shared secondary
 calendars will not be shown individually in Outlook for Mac. I suggest you vote in
<a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/293343-outlook-for-mac/suggestions/15867837-sharing-secondary-calendars" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Outlook.com account no longer working with Outlook 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ms_surrey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook.com account no longer working with Outlook 2010</h2>
                    <p>I have an outlook.com account that has worked fine with Outlook 2010 (Windows 10) until the last few days but stopped working. I have tried removing and re-adding the account several times which appears to find the settings in the auto setup but when Outlook
 is restarted it cannot connect to the Exchange server (outlook.office365.com). Two other accounts (one IMAP, one POP) still work fine in Outlook 2010 and the outlook.com account is still OK when accessed through a browser or through the outlook app on my android
 phone.</p>
<p>The exchange server addin (UmOutlookAddin.dll) hasn't changed since Nov 2015. The update history shows no Windows or related updates in the last couple of weeks so there is no obvious local software update to explain the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on what may be causing this &amp; how to fix it? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem appears to have resolved itself. This morning I could not set up the outlook.com account using the standard automatic feature in Outlook 2010. Using traceroute it was clear that there were issues establishing the connection with the outlook.office365.com
 server - failed to do so within 30 steps 3 times out of 4 (in each case the connection step timeouts became more frequent once an IP address that I believe is associated with Microsoft / MSN was reached). By this evening the setup worked with no obvious issues.</p>

            Hi, this is all new to me.<br />
I tried again thanks and this time got through to the instructions so now have something to try.
<br />
It all looks quite complicated though so hope I can work it out.

            <p>You need to contact that/those providers. It may be possible that their addresses are either no longer valid or you should be using a newer mail server program or that the SMTP port is incorrect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please check with the receiving service to make sure your settings are correct.</p>
