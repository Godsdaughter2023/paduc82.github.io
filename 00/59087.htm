<h2>            Jabra Elite Earbuds paired and conncected but won&#39;t play</h2>
                    I have paired and connected my Jabra Elite Active 65t earbuds with my computer and they show up in Device Manager as functioning properly
<span>and they show up as enabled in Properties</span> , but when I go to Sound settings it says "No output devices found".&nbsp; They are on the list of playback devices in the Sound Control panel as both headphones and headset, but both are greyed out
<span>and they show up as enabled in Properties</span> , but when I go to Sound settings it says "No output devices found".&nbsp; They are on the list of playback devices in the Sound Control panel as both headphones and headset, but both are greyed out
 and show as disconnected.&nbsp; I have both Realtek Audio, NVIDIA High Definition Audo and Intel Display audio listed und Sound, Video and Game controllers but only the Realtek audio appears to be active.&nbsp; I can plug headphones into the audio out jack with no problem.&nbsp;
 The Realtek audio and Realteck Speaker/Headphones are the only output devices listed on the master volume settings.&nbsp; I do have speakers plugged in to the rear input jacks.&nbsp; What do I need to do to get the Jabra ear buds working?

            Hi Stephen.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I will give you everything that's working for others with the known issues with Bluetooth and headsets:
<br />
<br />First HEADSET:
<br />
<br />Right click Volume icon in System Tray at right end of task bar, Open Sound Settings, in dropdown menus at top make sure Headphones are selected.
<br />
<br />If not choose Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Also try the Hardware Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Go to the Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button, choose Sound controller device, on Driver tab choose Roll back or Uninstall, restart PC using keyboard to Ctrl Alt Del, on blue screen tab to Power Icon in bottom right, press Enter, arrow down to Restart, press Enter to restart to reinstall the driver. 
<br />
<br />Do the same for the headset device and/or it's microphone.  
<br />
<br />Update the Sound driver from the PC or Device maker's Support downloads web page.  While there also check that the Chipset, BIOS, Display, USB, Network and all other drivers are the most current.  
<br />
<br />BLUETOOTH Troubleshooting:
<br />
<br />See Fixes here:  
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14169/windows-10-fix-bluetooth-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14169/...</a>
<br /><a href="http://superuser.com/questions/823894/how-to-make-bluetooth-mouse-automatically-reconnect-to-my-microsoft-surface-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://superuser.com/questions/823894/how-to-ma...</a>
<br />
<br />Try the Bluetooth troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try turning off Fast Startup at Settings &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; Sleep &gt; Additional Power Settings &gt; Choose what Power buttons do &gt; Change settings that are unavailable &gt; uncheck Fast Startup.  
<br />
<br />Try Updating the Bluetooth driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model.  Install it even if it's the same or newer than the one in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.
<br />
<br />Right click Start button to access Device Manager, locate Bluetooth device (if necessary from View tab Show Hidden Devices), on Driver tab see if Roll Back is available, if not try Update Driver, first automatically, then Browse, then Let Me Pick to try all previously installed Drivers.  
<br />
<br />If these fail try to Uninstall the Driver, restart PC to reinstall.
<br />
<br />Then try pairing again, if necessary run the Bluetooth Troubleshooter again.  
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Group Policy Client Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> karlageorge  say:</h3>
<h2>            Group Policy Client Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>When I switch my computer on now I get the message that 'Group Policy Client' failed to sign on.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a result I cannot get Chrome to open to do all the things I need to. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried the redirects on here that suggest what to do but they don't work:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've run a malware scan and no issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've run an SFC scan and no apparent problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking at Services.msc, the service "Group Policy Client" has not started. In Select Properties for this service, all the buttons&nbsp;are greyed out so I can't do anything there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'm not a computer programmer so if anyone could suggest a resolution that doesn't involve me taking a degree in computing that would be much appreciated. Thanks</p>

            <p>Thanks for replying, but reading it, it seems I still need that computing degree. Anywhere got help for someone who's computing knowledge amounts to switching my laptop on and just using it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I'm completely lost by all those computing&nbsp;terms and the pictures illustrating don't look the same as Windows 10. Without that I haven't a hope). For instance what is: Adding “Take Ownership” To Right Context Menu. Where do you find this? I have no clue
 what you're talking about. Right context menu found where exactly? What do you click on to get it on screen?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this must seem embarrassingly easy if you do it every day, but I don't, so I don't understand what any of those words mean.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't take ownership of the key because the steps don't make sense (ie it says click on the&nbsp;Change Permissions button in advanced security settings, when there is no Change Permissions button, only something about inheritance, whatever that means)&nbsp;&amp; so
 I just get access denied on admin command prompt. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Also are you aware that all the helpful 'links' spam advertising? Doesn't exactly encourage me to click on anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry if I sound annoyed but I've wasted hours on this and it's very frustrating when I just want my computer to work!

    <title>Xbox 360 transfer cable not working&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> da jazza93  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox 360 transfer cable not working&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Recently got a new Xbox Slim (250gb hdd) and bought a UNOFFICIAL microsoft transfer &nbsp;cable off ebay for like $10.</p>
<p>I plan to transfer old content from my OLD 20gb hdd (fat model white xbox) to my new slim.</p>
<p>Plugged it in, no pop message, nothing to initiate transfer. Went into settings &gt; system &gt; storage and my 20gb hdd is coming up as 'unformatted' and I have no option to do anything with it.</p>
<p>The old 20gb hdd worked absolutely fine on my old unit, games loaded, data was showing etc. The old unit has been sold off unfortunately :(</p>
<p>What does this mean? Is the transfer cable not working? Has all my data been deleted on the 20gb hdd? I have tried several methods i.e. plugging the old hdd first, last, using back usb ports etc and nothing appears to work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can someone please help me!? Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi, please do not use that cable. Third party cables will wipe all the data from your hard drive and are not supported in any way by Microsoft.</p>
<p>The official cables do cost a little more but they work which is the important thing.</p>
<p>It may not be to late as long as you didn't configure/format the hard drive using that cable. Try to get hold of a genuine cable if you can.</p>

<p>Third party cables won't wipe all your data. They do however, don't write/read data properly. Which may result in some, or all your data becoming corrupt. Since your console isn't seeing it, then your cable is a dud. Don't use unofficial cables. If you're
 that hard up for money, buy a used cable. Unofficial cables are very risky to use as most of them come from people who have no idea what they're doing.</p>

<p>Hey guys thanks for the information, just regarding the use of 3rd party cables - so my data is still in tact and not deleted? I have so many saved games on it :(</p>
<p>Will using an official transfer cable finally read the hdd and show all the content in it?</p>

<p>It's difficult to say 100% that the data is still intact. Were you asked to configure the hard drive at all using the cable you have currently ?</p>
<p>The only way to be sure if the data is still there is to use a genuine transfer cable.</p>

<h2>            Code 37</h2>
                    I have one of those yellow triangles in my processor boxes on device driver and I get a code 37 which is "windows cannot initialize the device driver for this hardware".&nbsp; I did not know that processors had device drivers, but what do I do to correct it?&nbsp;
 When I had the same problem with my audio driver I uninstalled it and reinstalled it from my compter manufacturer's website.&nbsp; I cannot do the same thing for a processor, can I? (uninstall it)&nbsp; If&nbsp;I can, where do I find the driver for Athlon 64 dual core 5000
 processors?

Are you sure code 37 is linked to the processor and not the DVD drive? <br />

                    <div>
<p>I got these type of noises from where my HDD located (HDD No:- WD10JPVX-60JC3T0). Does anyone have any idea what type of sound is this? (like, clicking noise, head stuck noise, torn head noise, platter scratch noise, etc)</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>When the system boots up:- https://youtu.be/sI6xJNKqbjw</p>

<div>
<p>When opening google chrome:- https://youtu.be/wRw3pSs9Ns0</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>When the system boots up or in time of playing games or running a large program like Photoshop or HDD working at 100% sound is higher than usual. Another thing I noticed, when I make a clean install of Windows 10 (no program installed on the system, 'there
 is no such sound or you can say very much less sound'), and then I started installing applications these types of sound arises.</p>

            Hi BINOYGHOSH 
<br />
<br />When Windows starts or shuts down, you would expect your hard drive to be very bust, the new fast startup process in Windows 10, writes the state of your RAM to the hard drive when it shuts down and when starting reads that back . .. 
<br />
<br />Also when opening Chrome, there is a lot of user data to be read form your hard drive . . .
<br />
<br />Your hard drive does sound healthy, it has a fast read/write . . 
<br />
<br />However, what matters is the noise level, it is hard to judge that from the recording, I have no reference. If that is much louder than it was previously, that may indicate an issue with your hard drive.
<br />
<br />Is your hard drive located in a caddy securely and not touching the casing of your PC?
<br />
<br />If that is much louder than it used to be, you should backup your data, just in case . . .
<br />
<br />Download HDDScan from the link below and run that on your hard drive to test it . .

<br />
<br />I don't see anything in any of those reports to cause concern with regards to your hard drive, all tests seem positive . . .
<br />
<br />With regards to the noise, I cannot make a judgement on how loud that is, because I have no reference

            Hi BINOYGHOSH
<br />
<br />if you believe the noise is loud enough to indicate the read/write head(s) are in fact touching the platter(s)  then you may need to look to replacing that drive
<br />
<br />However from your recording, I did not hear that scratching sound, I just heard normal read/write head movement, though it may be loud . . .

<p><em>"in time of playing games or running a large program like Photoshop or HDD working at 100% sound is higher than usual."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Some HDD's make more noise than others, and some perfectly healthy drives do sound a bit 'grindy' when reading/writing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, what you may be hearing in these scenarios is what is called <em>'thrashing'.&nbsp;
</em>Win10 is supposed to do a better job of maintaining</p>
<p>HDD's than previous Window versions, but if the HDD sounds like it's working extra hard, and it sounds like the head is moving</p>
<p>rapidly back and forth more than usual when a game is loading levels, or you are loading large files the HDD may need optimising.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Traditionally, thrashing was more prominent when a HDD has not been defragmented and optimised in a long while which causes</p>
<p>games or large files to spread the data unevenly over a large area on the platter (particularly if you have installed several software/games,</p>
<p>and a lot of large files&nbsp; in short order), which can cause the head to have to move back and forth more than is desirable when the drive</p>
<p>is being read.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The optimising process, which is done by the defragmenting tool moves associated files closer together which reduces head movement</p>
<p>during reading.</p>
<p>You can run Windows Defragmenting tool manually if you suspect it needs to be better optimised.</p>
<p>(<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>Start Menu &gt; Windows Administrative Tools.</em></span>)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I generally defrag/optimise after installing a large game, and after doing a Win10 version update (if using an HDD rather than SSD for Windows).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Disabling the <em>Page File</em>, which has been popular since more people started having large quantities of RAM, can also</p>
<p>contribute to thrashing.</p>

<p>My hp laptop is 1 year 9-month-old. Can any of the following incident, cause the sound of HDD noise?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) In the past, I made dual boot windows with Kali Linux and Phoenix OS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) My RAM always 70% to 80% is in use. ( I have 4GB of RAM. When I run Bluestacks and ram&nbsp; level goes to 90% to 95% then HDD makes the noise much than usual ). Does low ram is the cause, for the noise? Do I need more RAM?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) If I connect my laptop to the internet about a week later or more, then HDD works at 100% (remains at 100% for 10 minutes to 20 minutes after connecting to the internet)</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) As I told earlier I have large no of applications installed on my HDD, there are 60 to 70 'background processes' and 40 to 50 'windows processes' are always active at the same time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) If I do a fresh install of windows and so there are no programs installed on my HDD, then the sound is very much less.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6) Got noise when I scan my HDD with an antivirus program.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I concluded that,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "much disk usage/ much processes running"&nbsp; proportional to&nbsp; "makes much noise"</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ANY HELP APPRECIATED.</p>

    <title>Dear Microsoft Support, Can you help&#63; Forza 5 Problem.... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dear Microsoft Support, Can you help&#63; Forza 5 Problem....</h2>
                    
<p>First, I love Forza 5.&nbsp; I bought the Day one LCE, the VIP and Season pass packs as well as a few token packs just to make sure I get my garage filled! But now, unfortunately, for some reason, a few of my cars currently in my garage (Which I have owned since
 Day One) have the DLC tag above them... Yet, when I click on them, I am stuck at the purchase options screen and the circle just continues to spin, and spin.... and.... spin....&nbsp; I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling Forza 5 (figuring all my cars are
 kept on the server). Yet, I still no longer am able to get in and use the folllowing cars:</p>
<p>2012 Aston Martin Limited Edition Collector Edition</p>
<p>2011 Audi RS 3 Sportback Limited Edition</p>
<p>2011 Audi Forza Motorsport TT RS Coupe</p>
<p>2013 Ford Focus ST Forza Motorsport Limited Collector Edition</p>
<p>and the</p>
<p>2011 Lamborghini Forza Motorsport Gallardo LP570-4 Superleggera</p>
<p>(All of these, I know I had as they were part of the Limited Collector Edition Day one pack)... But since the uninstall, they appear in my garage. Yet, I can't get into them nor re-download them.</p>
<p>In case you are wondering, here is my DAY ONE code, which yes, I redeemed on Day One:
<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong>) (last part omitted for security purposes). I can't re-download using this code as it was used once already by me.&nbsp; Can you please re-gift these cars back to me. You can check my previous purchases to verify I have every DLC pack
 and every car downloaded. Yet, I am frustrated by knowing I already own these cars IN MY GARAGE and still can't use them.</p>
<p>Also, of note, I don't think the ForzaRewards stats are tracking correctly as my Forza 4 and Forza 3 stats seem to be way off.. (I am at a much higher driver level and driver miles in the games. This too is verified by checking my profile in each game) than
 what the bar-graph on the forzarewards webpage would indicate... Shouldn't my rewards points be higher?&nbsp; Anyway, can someone at Microsoft and Turn10 please let me know whats up with the DLC and please contact me if you need any more info from me! I look forward
 to hearing from you and the re-gifted cars hopefully soon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hey buddy</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are actually public discussion forums.&nbsp; They're not the Official Technical forums for "Forza: 5".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can get help with XBox LIVE stuff on the "Support" tab at the top of these forums.&nbsp; They lead to actual Microsoft Employees who can offer you the correct technical assistance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally you can find Official Support on the official web site which you can log into with the same details you use to get on here:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hope that helps.</p>

<p>Let us know how you get on.</p>

<p>Try reinstalling the bonus content. From the Xbox dashboard find the Forza 5 tile, press the menu button, and click show all addons. From that menu you should see the bonus content tab and should be able to re-download the day one stuff.</p>
<p>Good Luck!</p>

<p>No one has an answer this is simple, when you buy the addons, the exclusive cars are available to you in the store, without DLC you can not purchase those cars. But even with the addons you buy the cars with XP just like all the cars, you buy them from store</p>

<h2>            Error 0x800736FD - installing SQL native client 10.0</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>as the object, I was trying to install the driver SQL native client 10.0 on a windows 7 x64 client to connect SQL express 2008 R2 database.</p>
<p>This connection, for many reasons, has to be made using this type of driver, but, when the process stopped with the error below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Errore durante l'installazione dell'assembly 'Microsoft.VC80.CRT, version=8.050727.1833", type="win32", publicKEyToken="1fc8b3b9a1e18e3b", processor architecture="x86".</strong><strong> HRESULT: 0x800736FD</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/48be7429-5a72-42d1-8e57-368797c618fd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/48be7429-5a72-42d1-8e57-368797c618fd" height="235" width="343" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" /></a></p>
<p>I've already tried every single suggestion that i found surfing the internet but they doesn't fix my problem.&nbsp; I verified that the system is compatible with the version of SQL native client, deactivated the antivirus, downloaded the C++ 2005 component etc...</p>
<p>Doesn anyone have any other suggestion to try?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>I solved with myself.</p>
<p>This special computer was affected by the virus cryptolocker. Because of this, many register keys and other files were encrypted also after removal of the infection so, windows update couldn't be able to download the recent updates.</p>
<p>Recent updates, probably contain requested components to install SQL NATIVE CLIENT 10.0.</p>

            <p>If compatibility doesn't work, you may have to try a virutal machine. <br />
<br />
If the program is not compatible, then you may try to install and run the program in compatibility mode.
<br />
Use the following steps for compatibility mode:<br />
1)&nbsp;Right click on the Program<br />
2)&nbsp;Click on Properties<br />
3)&nbsp;Click on Compatibility tab <br />
4)&nbsp;Select Run this program in compatibility mode and select Windows&nbsp;98 or whatever operating system the program was running successfully.</p>
<p><br />
Refer to the link here: Make older programs run in this version of Windows<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows</a></p>
<p><br />
If you run Windows 7 Professional or Ultimate version, install Windows Virtual PC and Windows XP mode (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/default.aspx</a>) and execute your software
 in Windows XP.</p>
<p><br />
If you run Windows 7 Home Premium, you cannot run Windows XP mode but you can try VirtualBox (<a href="http://www.virtualbox.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.virtualbox.org</a>) or VMware Player (<a href="http://www.vmware.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.vmware.com</a>) or any other 3rd party virtualization
 software and install a separate copy of Windows XP (either Home Edition or Professional) for that purpose. You can find virtualization software free of charge that will run on Windows 7 Home Premium.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is not advised to run games in Windows XP Mode. It was not made for games but more for business applications and graphic heavy games do not work well.
<br />
<br />
Thanks</p>

</span></span></span><span>Which troubleshooter are you talking about?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you’ve not tried running Check Disk, give it a shot. Normally check disk fixes problems related to hard disk. If you have any diagnostic tool

<p>&nbsp;First you must be signed in with a Microsoft account with administrative rights.&nbsp; Then if you are using a laptop open control panel click Power Options and from list&nbsp;on left click Choose what closing lid does and set it to sleep.&nbsp; Then click Settings&gt;Accounts&gt;Sign
 in Options and set Require sign in to never. Now if you have to leave your PC close lid or put desktop to sleep and when you return and lift lid or awaken you will be where you left off no sign in needed. You can leave in sleep mode for as long as you want
 with no adverse effects but on a laptop it will still use battery power at a reduced rate. Hopefully you will also have allowed the cumulative upgrades/updates.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5cdc9a19-3bae-4124-8487-0538722bca37" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5cdc9a19-3bae-4124-8487-0538722bca37" height="278" width="608" /></a></p>

    <title>Wacom pen not working after Huion driver installation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jenni s  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wacom pen not working after Huion driver installation</h2>
                    <p>I fought years with a Wacom Bamboo that I use in photoediting and a Cintiq HD 13 I wanted to use for painting, frustrated because which ever I installed broke the drivers and rendered the other useless. Mind these were both Wacom devices and every time I
 contacted Wacom support for help, in the end getting them seemingly to work but soon finding out they were glitching one way or another.</p>
<p>So I finally changed my Cintiq to a new Huion tablet, hoping the two different drivers would not clash with each other when Wacom was unable to get their own products to get along.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now they work otherwise but the pen pressure on my Bamboo is gone. I'm suspecting Windows reads it as a pressed down button when I touch the pen to the tablet. It makes a dot and when I move the mouse it registers the line. I've checked the setting for the
 pen and that all the shape dynamics options are on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm getting extremely frustrated with the whole situation and I'm not tech savvy, I just wish someone could help me to get my tablets to work. I just don't want to be booting and reinstalling drivers every time I want to switch my tablet. I've tried to google
 for help and found a lot of speculation but not actual useful advises.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anyone able to offer any help with my tablets?</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. There were no other changes except installing the Huion drivers, before that my Bamboo worked perfectly.</p>
<p>2. I haven't tried another computer, like I said before installing the second driver my Bamboo worked perfectly, and after installing the Huion driver the Huion works just fine.</p>
<p>3. It seems the pressure is only gone in Photoshop, I've made sure the 'pressure for size' and shape dynamics are on. For example in Clip Studio my Bamboo works fine.</p>
<p>4. Windows 10</p>
<p>5. I'm not sure what you mean by system and make, I'm running Windows 10 and the Photoshop version is CS6.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't find the '<span>Wacom professional touch service</span>' from my services, I have 'Wacom consumer service'. Restarting it makes no difference. I also have something called TabletServicePen which apparently is Wacom's
 and when I try to start that one I get a message saying&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Error 22: System can not find the file specified."</p>
<p>
</p><p>My drivers are the latest ones. Since it seems Photoshop is the one having the problem.. Can it be something between Windows and PS that's causing it to lose my pen?</p>

            <p>Hi Kieth,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur because of any of the following reasons: </p>
<ul>
<li>The Bluetooth receiver in the portable computer is incompatible with the Microsoft Bluetooth stack.
</li><li>The device signal is not detected by the signal transceiver. </li><li>There is insufficient power to the device or to the receiver. </li><li>There is a radio frequency conflict. </li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Let us try few of the troubleshooting steps below and check if you are able to access the mouse on your tablet.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Step 1: </strong>If the device is not detected on your computer try to&nbsp;run Hardware and Devices troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Hardware and Devices troubleshooter </span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">checks for common problems and makes sure that any new device or hardware connected to your PC is installed correctly.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong><span>Windows </span></strong>key from the keyboard, type
<strong><span>Troubleshooting </span></strong>and select it.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong><span>view all</span></strong> option on the upper left corner of
<strong><span>Troubleshooting</span></strong> window. </span></li><li><span>Select the <strong><span>Hardware and Device </span></strong>options from the list.
</span></li><li><span>Click <strong>Next</strong> to run the <strong><span>Hardware and Device
</span></strong>Troubleshooter.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Step 2: </strong>I suggest you to check if there&nbsp;are any drivers with exclamatory mark in Device Manager.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>Press <strong>Windows + X</strong> keys from the keyboard, click on
<strong>Device Manager</strong>.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Check for the drivers with exclamatory mark in yellow triangle.</span></span></li><li><span><span>If so, right click on the driver, click on <strong>Properties </strong>
and check the <strong>device status</strong>.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Also, try to update the drivers by click on <strong>Update driver software
</strong>under <strong>Drivers </strong>tab in <strong>Properties </strong>window.</span></span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, </p>
<p><strong>Step 3: </strong>I suggest you to contact the device manufacturer's website, download the latest chipset drivers, install them manually and check if it helps.</p>
<p>Installing the latest chipset drivers will help you to install the drivers for USB ports.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to the article by <strong>Andre Da Costa </strong>to install drivers: <strong>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope it helps. Get back to us with an updated status of accessing the Bluetooth mouse for further assistance.</p>

<h2>            Internet Connection Error</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something weird's going on with my internet connection. I am connected to the network provided by our hostel. I have Softether downloaded on my PC and Proxy Master on my phone. And I can't&nbsp;<strong>SEARCH
</strong>for VPNs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1)There's this Refresh button in Softether. It works on mobile data, used to work with wifi. But now it doesnt load vpns. I tried refreshing the vpns on my phone on the other app to check if the problem was with my laptop, but it didn't load.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2)There's no problem with connecting to a VPN already in the list. I Refreshed the vpn list using my mobile data, and then switched to wifi and connected, and it worked fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3 )There are other people connected to the same hostel network that don't have the same problem, so that's not the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4)The other issue is that I can't connect to the Steam Friends Network, or the CS:GO network. I can connect to the network with my wifi after connecting to the vpn using (2) above. But as soon as I discommect the vpn, steam Friends Network disconnects.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would again like to remind you that it's not blocked by FortiGuard firewall (used by our hostel) because other people on the same network don't have these problems. They started occuring a couple weeks ago for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            Hi, MaJorProbLemS
<br />
<br />My name is Smith and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />Try to repair your internet connection
<br />Click Start, and type "cmd". 
<br />- Right-click Command Prompt and run it as administrator. 
<br />- Copy and paste the below one line at a time, pressing enter each time: 
<br />netsh winsock reset - and press Enter. 
<br />netsh int ip reset - and press Enter. 
<br />ipconfig /release - and press Enter. 
<br />ipconfig /renew - and press Enter. 
<br />ipconfig /flushdns - and press Enter 
<br />
<br />You could also try resetting your DNS service with the following steps: 
<br />- Press Windows Key+R and type "services.msc" and press OK. 
<br />- Scroll down to find DNS Client. 
<br />- Right-click it and click Restart. 
<br />
<br />Otherwise, see if resetting your Hosts file to default fixes the issue:

            Hi  MaJorProbLemS
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />I have stayed in a few hostels over the years and I can tell you, their Wi-Fi networks are always severely restricted. Because it's used by multiple guests, they limit to essential web browsing, email, streaming music, and video. No large downloads often cannot be done on it. It's understandable too, since trying play games or download large files can negatively affect the quality of the network. 
<br />
<br />You would probably have to go front desk and maybe ask them to make some exceptions for your device on the network like maybe leasing you an IP address for the duration of your stay.

<p>Hi!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply, but as I mentioned in my question, the issue is not because of any network restrictions. I have been using Softether on the same hostel wifi for the last 8 months and the issue only appeared in the last couple weeks. I've played 558
 hours of CS:GO on the same wifi and Steam Friends Network also worked for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't try to look for an issue before today because I believed that our hostel might have made some changes, maybe added restrictions but I found that it is not so. Softether VPN and CSGO are both quite popular in our hostel and my friends have not been
 facing this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>:)</p>

<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Network adapters
<br />
<br />    Uninstall WAN Miniport (IP), WAN Miniport(IPv6) and WAN Miniport (PPTP).
<br />
<br />    Click the Action menu &gt; Scan for hardware changes
<br />
<br />    The adapters you just uninstalled should come back
<br />
<br />Check if you can then access the VPNs.

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the reply. I am afraid device specific solutions would not work, because I have the same issue when trying to load VPNs on my phone connected to the same WiFi. Nevertheless I gave it a try. Didn't seem to work.</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 4 will not turn on - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mathewgennard  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 4 will not turn on</h2>
                    <p>Surface pro 4 256GB 8GB.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Updated to latest windows updates and patches after that my machine powered off. I logged a call the Microsoft who talked me through the hard reset. Nothing happened. Microsoft offered a replacement to which my credit card would get a holding fee applied.</p>
<p>Couple of hours later i tried again and it booted up. Called Microsoft to cancel the replacement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today however the machine has died twice during light web surfing. Each time required a two button rest, power and volume buttons. This evening the pro has reverted to a brick. A very expensive brick.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have once again got in contract with Microsoft and been told a replacement will be sent. If the replacement is just as bad then i will request a refund for the surface pro 4, type cover and mouse. I shall then be going to a very reliable macbook. I am
 sorry Microsoft but i need reliable equipment for my job. At the moment i am losing faith. You are supposed to be the pinochle of software and hardware engineering. Please look at the forums and take some resoundingly l responsibility for this. At least provide
 some sorry of compensation for the problems we are having. Microsoft store credits for example.&nbsp;</p>

            My problem is similar.....when I close the keyboard the surface pro 4 goes into sleep and will wake up but not boot the display......I too called Microsoft and they requested that I do to system devices and reload telemetry driver which I did.....but problem
 continues.....I have to hard reboot and all is well again....but this is so frustrating.....this seems like such a normal operation that should not have an issue.....

 at 99% so I now that was not the issue today and most likely not the last time.</p>

            <p>It's a common issue that remains to be solved.</p>
<p>If you have Windows Hello activated, you should see the red IR emitter when&nbsp;waking the Surface from sleep. Meanwhile, the display remains inactive, giving the impression of a dead machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My girlfriend SP4 does exhibit the behavior often, mine never. Same device model. Go figure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The event viewer suggests an issue with the multi-touch device initialization.</p>
<p>I guess Microsoft will rush to fix this other very common problem according to forums.</p>

<h2>            Error code 0xC004F012 suddenly appears 2 years after purchase of new computer</h2>
                    <p>First I<strong> AM running a genuine copy of windows 10</strong>.&nbsp; At least I'd better be.&nbsp; I purchase my computer 2 years ago from Dell. It is new not reconditioned and worked fine until today.&nbsp; When I look online I see I am not the only person having this
 problem and they say it happened after an update.&nbsp; When I click on 'Troubleshoot"&nbsp; NOTHING happens even when I leave it alone for over an hour and a half.&nbsp; The next suggestion I receive is to 'Go to the Store to buy genuine Windows or enter a product key.&nbsp;
 This is a genuine windows product which worked fine for two years.&nbsp; I have never entered a product key.&nbsp; Dell sold me the computer with windows 10 preinstalled.&nbsp; There is no legitimate reason for windows 10 to suddenly deactivate.&nbsp; Microsoft needs to find
 out what is going on with the last 'Windows update" that caused this issue and supply us and exe to fix it instead of telling us to purchase a genuine Windows product!!!!&nbsp; But since it always seems to take several weeks to several months for Windows to supply
 'fix' we can download and run, can someone please tell me how to fix it myself!</p>

            Hi Gonzo_PT 
<br />
<br />Have you first downloaded and installed Adobe Air into Windows, then install that software, so it sees Adobe Air is installed?

    <title>Rocket League Purchase And Play Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> karn3dge  say:</h3>
<h2>            Rocket League Purchase And Play Issue</h2>
                    
<p>We own two Xbox One Consoles, one in the loungeroom and one in my sons room. Mine and my sons accounts are linked to both consoles.</p>
<p>I purchased Rocket League through my account on the loungeroom xbox. I also installed it on my sons xbox using the same purchase through my account.</p>
<p>Any account can play the game on the xbox in the loungeroom but can only be played on my sons xbox if I am logged in on his xbox. If I am not signed it it says to login as the person who purchased it, but as I said it doesn't do this on the other xbox even
 if I am logged in on my sons xbox.</p>
<p>Is there something going wrong? If so how can I fix this?</p>

            <p>Sorry to hear you're having issues but this is a simple fix.</p>
<p>The reason your son cannot play the game on his console is because you purchased the game. &nbsp;This is why he needs to have your account signed in to play it.</p>
<p>What you can do here is set your gamertag as Home on his console. &nbsp;Then any game you purchase will automatically be downloaded and shared to his console. &nbsp;He won't need to have your gamertag signed in to play it.</p>
<p>The only drawback to this method is that if you're sharing a Gold membership on the loungeroom console to other members of your family it will no longer be available to that console but only to your son's. &nbsp;The same would apply for games. &nbsp;If you switch Home then your tag would need to be logged in for others to play games on it.</p>

Oh, boy oh boy oh boy!<br />
<br />
Yet another "Upgrade"!&nbsp; Skype 8!&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<br />
W00t!&nbsp; And no other version will have any functionality beyond September 2018!&nbsp; W00t!&nbsp; W00t!<br />
<br />
I have been with Skype since 1.8 and backwards compatibility was always there.&nbsp; Especially "Back in the halcyon days" of hardware and software changing by the week.&nbsp; It kept us it folks busy, but it all worked.&nbsp; Just over a year ago 32-bit machines were no
 longer supported.&nbsp; So 100 million machines got thrown away, right?&nbsp; Wrong.&nbsp; Arbitrary, cavalier and capricious.&nbsp; Three words I would never have thought, (as recently as a little better than a year ago), I would ever use about Skype!&nbsp; (windows.&nbsp; Lx always left
 a little to be desired, except for th Ubuntu people.&nbsp; They're just whiners if it won't game, bot or pidgin).<br />
<br />
I was your biggest cheerleader.&nbsp; I was your best salesman.&nbsp; I am telling people who ask, "Go buy a Tracfone".<br />
<br />
I now have Skype 8.Whatever.&nbsp; It still has not addressed the myriad issue that I, as well as many longtime users as well as many longtime paid subscription users have addressed on these fora for a long, long time.&nbsp; I see the tactic - "Give us examples".&nbsp; That
 shows that you a) have not been "Listening".&nbsp; B) have been listening but don't give a fig. C) trying to keep the people with legitimate concerns and issues back on our heels...Expecting that we would rehearse them over and over while you folks sit and laugh
 at us chasing our collective tails.&nbsp; So happy that our misery is so bloody entertaining!&nbsp; It's the least we could do as payment for putting up with copy &amp; pasted boilerplate answers and promises that "All issues are taken directly "Upstairs" by a dedicated
 team of highly trained and motivated professional ground slugs."<br />
<br />
"We are listening to our users!"<br />
<br />
Yeah.&nbsp; We're listening to you, too.<br />
<br />
Listening to you laughing out loud at us.<br />
<br />
If only the G-ds would look down and give us an alternative!&nbsp; You'd be standing on line for bread and soup in five minutes!<br />
<br />
LjM.<br />
<br />
Hey, do us a favor?&nbsp; Let us know when something like that happens.&nbsp; At least we will have the opportunity to point and laugh at you.

<h2>            Safe Mode - F8 Key Is Not Working After Updates.</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
F8 key used to&nbsp;work fine before updates, what do I&nbsp;have&nbsp;to&nbsp;do to&nbsp;get it back?<br />
I know how to use msconfig boot options and other&nbsp;workarounds for SM, but all I&nbsp;&nbsp;want is F8 key working again.<br />
Tks.<br />
PS - The PC&nbsp;initial boot configuration still unchanged since from the first start.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp; I could not find any suitable answer on Google also.&nbsp;
