<h2>            SoftThinks Agent Services using large disk space</h2>
                    <p>When I first turn on my laptop, I can't&nbsp;practically&nbsp;&nbsp;use it because nothing will open without a huge delay.&nbsp; This can last for 5 minutes.&nbsp; I checked Task Manager and find the SoftThinks Agent&nbsp;seems the issue.

    <title>Intel Chipset and USB Drivers won&#39;t install properly - no Windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hortnerds  say:</h3>
<h2>            Intel Chipset and USB Drivers won&#39;t install properly - no Windows 7 equivalent&#63;</h2>
                    Compal CL51<br />
2G RAM<br />
32 Bit Dothan CPU Intel Pentium M 1.8 GHz<br />
ATI Mobility Radeon 9700<br />
100 GB HD<br />
Windows Experience Index: 3.4<br />
<br />
I was able to install Windows 7 Pro on my compal CL51 without any seeming hitches, except these:
<br />
Intel(R) 82801DBM LPC Interface Controller 24CC<br />
Intel(R) 82801DBM USB Universal Host Controller 24C4<br />
<br />
Also, the volume control from the function keys does not work even though the function keys for dimmness
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">do</span> work. That might be a chipset thing - I'm not sure because there aren't any other broken/alerted devices in the device manager.<br />
<br />
THe LPC interface just showed up as an unknown device without any drivers. I navigated through the Update Drivers -&gt; Let me pick -&gt; Show all hardware -&gt; navigated down to intel and the LPC interface. Paraphrasing, it said this was "not guaranteed to work with
 system 7. Are you sure you want to do this? Your system might break." I did it anyway, and now it shows up, but I'm not sure its functioning correctly, even though it says it is.<br />
<br />
The USB thing shows up, but then when I unplug the device that seems to use it (TrendNet Clearlink for Skype - Model TVP SP2) it gets a yellow alert triangle on the device manager. It won't recognize when I plug it back in. When I look at it's properties in
 Device Manager, I get this in the Device status: "Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems. (Code 43)". There is no 'troubleshooter'.
<br />
<br />
The windows support page on the Code 43 issue is useless, pointing vaguely at the device maker or intel - I can't be sure. (<span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310123)</span>
</span><br />
<br />
<em><strong>Code 43 <br />
Recommended resolution</strong> <br />
<br />
One of the drivers controlling the device notified the operating system that the device failed in some manner.
<br />
<br />
If you have already run the Troubleshooting Wizard, you might want to check the hardware documentation for more information about diagnosing the problem.<br />
<br />
</em>The only 'documentation' that came with this was a quick start and a user's guide. It halfway works. It just stops functioning correctly and you end up having to reinstall the drivers if you unplug the device. Every time.<br />
<br />
The nearest I can figure, I need Windows 7 support for all things Intel 82801DB/DBM on my computer. Intel's site is too vague in it's style of support for downloads. I couldn't tell what to download, or even if I had the right download.<br />
<br />
As to the function volume thing - I got used to using it in WinXP. I'd sure like it back in Win7.<br />
<br />
If someone has suggestions as to what to try next, I would be grateful.<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Thanks for the replies. I went to the Intel site.<br />
<br />
I downloaded the chipset identification software from the Intel site. I found out I have a 855PM Chipset. I then got on a chat session with Intel Support chat.<span><br />
<br />
The short of it is there is no upgrade path for this chipset with regards to Windows 7 from Intel.<br />
<br />
From the transcript of the chat:<br />
<br />
</span><span>Intel:</span> <span>Hello. Thank you for using the Intel Customer Support chat service. We are glad to be of service. How can I help you today?</span>
<br />
<span>you:</span> <span>I have a compal CL51 laptop that uses the 855PM Chipset, according to the identifier software I downloaded from Intel. I need Windows 7 drivers, but they are not available for Win7 in the support download area for that
 chipset. What can I do?</span> <br />
Intel<span>:</span> <span>I apologize but there are no drivers available for that operating system nor Microsoft* Windows* Vista*</span>
<br />
<span>you:</span> <span>When will they become available?</span>
<br />
Intel<span>:</span> <span>My apologies but this controller has reached its End of life so there will be no new software updates for new operating systems</span>
<br />
<span>you:</span> <span>I've got windows 7 running on the machine now. It seems to be working fine, except one of the device drivers comes up with the yellow triangle. I can do everything I need to except the function keys don't express volume
 control (volume up and down with function keys). How crucial is it that the chipset be correct for a functional system?</span>
<br />
Intel<span>:</span> <span>This new operating system should have all required software for this chipset to work, so it should be fine but with limited capabilities</span>
<br />
<span>you:</span> <span>Control Panel -&gt; Device Manager -&gt; Other Devices -&gt; Unknown Device -&gt; Properties -&gt; "The drivers for this device are not installed. (Code 28) There is no driver selected for the device information set or element. To
 find a driver for this device, click Update Driver."</span> <br />
Intel<span>:</span> <span>I apologize but we would fail to know to what device the Device Manager refers to, this chipset was not designed and it is not tested for Microsoft* Windows* 7, at this point you may use that operating system under your own discretion</span>
<br />
<span>you:</span> <span>Yeah, I figured. However, when I go to Control Panel -&gt; Devices and Printers -&gt; Laptop -&gt; Trouble Shoot it seems to think it's something called Smart@IO. Is that something by Intel?</span>
<br />
Intel<span>:</span> <span>It does not seem to be a controller from us</span> <br />
Intel<span>:</span> <span>You may need to check with the laptop manufacturer to see what devices are installed on this system</span>
<br />
<span>you:</span> <span>Under Control Panel -&gt; Devices Manager -&gt; Other Devices -&gt; Unknown Device -&gt; Properties -&gt; General it says "location: on Intel(R) 82801DBM LPC Interface Controller - 24CC "</span>
<br />
<span>you:</span> <span>That sounds Intellish.</span> <br />
Intel<span>:</span> <span>That is part of the chipset controller, however as mentioned, there are no software available for this controller that would run on Microsoft* Windows* 7 and this operating system should have all required software to make this mature
 product to work</span> <br />
<span>you:</span> <span>So the chipset problem is irrelevant?</span>
<br />
Intel<span>:</span> <span>It appears to be, please keep in mind that you are using a not validated platform</span>
<br />
<span>you:</span> <span>Is the fact that I cannot use the function keys to change volume of sound related to the chipset?</span>
<br />
Intel<span>:</span> <span>That is not part of the chipset</span> <br />
<span>you:</span> <span>So another driver is needed to make the volume function keys work correctly, not Intel...</span>
<br />
Intel<span>:</span> <span>Correct, most of those devices are third party components</span>
<br />
<span>you:</span> <span>Okay, so if I'm not using the chipset, what exactly does it control?</span>
<br />
Intel<span>:</span> <span>It will handle I/O control for peripherals such as USB</span>
<br />
<span>you:</span> <span>Okay, that could be why I can't seem to get some USB HID devices to work. Anything with Win7 Compatibility seems fine, though.
</span><br />
<span>you:</span> <span>I've been trying a TrendNet ClearLink TVP-SP2 Skype Speaker Phone. It works fine on other systems. Just not this one because of the end-of-life thing on Intel's end. Is it likely that if they have a Win7 compatible
 driver I could get it working, or am I stuck here?</span> <br />
<span>you:</span> <span>It even works fine on my wife</span> <span>
's new lenovo with Vista.</span> <br />
Intel<span>:</span> <span>You may need to check that issue directly with TrendNet and your system manufacturer</span>
<br />
<span>you:</span> <span>My system manufacturer will likely tell me that it's an end of life issue - referring me back to you Intel - but I bet you knew that already eh? &lt;grinning&gt;. I'll check with TrendNet to see if they can build a new driver
 for Win7. Thanks. This clears up a lot of stuff. Hard drives seem to work fine. Other USB devices also work fine, especially if they're rated to work with Win 7. Again thanks. Happy New Year.</span>
<br />
Intel<span>:</span> <span>You are welcome. </span><br />

            Hi  loncrawford 
<br />
<br />Wordpad is part of Windows 10, it is free and should already be on your PC . . .
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, then just type wordpad and hit Enter, does Wordpad open?
<br />
<br />If so, to make that more accessible:
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type Wordpad, then from the resulting list, right click Wordpad and choose 'Pin to Start'
<br />
<br />You will then have a new Tile on your Start Menu for Wordpad . ..

<h2>            Windows 10 still shows phone icon in Explorer, even after reboot.</h2>
                    In April, 2019, I connected my Android phone to my PC via USB and copied some files. Previously, after disconnectiong the phone, the icon would go away in Explorer... now it won't. I've rebooted and the icon is still there. I can connect either of my Android
 tablet and the tablet icon goes away upon disconnect (but not the phone icon). When I reconnect the phone, I get a second phone icon until disconnect (the first icon is still there). How do I get rid of the 'stuck' icon?

<p>Hi there.</p>
<p>No there is not a direct way to un-sync the controller from the xbox as it uses the IR sensor. The only option you have is to perhaps put a piece of black tape of the sensor to stop it receiving from the remote. The sensor is located just to the right of
 the eject button.</p>

 and just selected the D drive. I understand now that shouldn't have been done because all my files disappeared and my (C:) drive still hasn't changed in size. Now my Video folder is mimicking the D drive, when i look at the properties now it says it's a Local
 Disk. So when went to the location tab again and clicked "Restore Default" to C:\Users\Eva\Videos, an error pops up and says "Failed to build the list of regular subdirectories under "D:\System Volume Information. Access is denied"
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there anyway to fix that folder? And did i lose all the files in that folder forever?&nbsp;</div>
                </div>

            <span>Hi Evaliu,<br />
<br />
If you are able to see the videos folder available and if you are getting access denied, then I would suggest you to give the permissions to
<span>&nbsp;</span>the videos folder and then check if you are able to move the files.<br />
<br />
"Access Denied" or other errors when accessing or working with files and folders in Windows<br />

    <title>Problem with offline windows defender and windows driver verifier,,, - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> questions_  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with offline windows defender and windows driver verifier,,, possible incompatibility problem&#63; need windows defender and recovery help</h2>
                    <p>Viewing the settings menu for windows defender I saw an offline scan feature. &nbsp;It ran smoothly. &nbsp;Later though I experienced an incompatibility problem with windows driver verifier and windows defender offline.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a blue screen and inability to use a notebook computer I had its internal hard drive sanitized, the bios was changed from legacy to UEFI native without CSM, the notebook hardware was checked, the windows 10 professional was reinstalled on the drive,
 drivers were installed, files were reinstalled, office was reinstalled, and only a few programs were reinstalled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows defender ran smoothly in quick and full mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows driver verifier ran smoothly producing blue screens with a stopcode. &nbsp;A problematic driver was identified with the stopcode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows defender offline ran smoothly after the windows driver verifier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With two notebooks having spontaneous blue screens driver verifier was then ran on multiple computers and each computer displayed stopcodes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On one of the computers a driver was uninstalled and reinstalled and this driver no longer produced a blue screen or stopcode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first computer above with the sanitized drive had problems with a rerun of windows driver verifier after the windows defender offline scan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ordinarily to stop windows dirver verifier a power off then on, one to three times, triggered the menu for windows advanced troubleshooting options. &nbsp;Though this menu safe mode with administrative command prompt reliably stopped driver verifier with the
 verifier /reset command.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following progression happened each time to turn off driver verifier after finding a stopcode:</p>
<p>1) diagnosing your PC</p>
<p>2) automatic repair</p>
<p>3) advanced options</p>
<p>4) troubleshooting</p>
<p>5) enable safe mode with command prompt</p>
<p>6) verifier /reset</p>
<p>7) shutdown -r</p>
<p>8) passowrd</p>
<p>9) welcome</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Problems occurred though after running windows defender offline and then rerunning driver verifier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having run windows defender offline one time it now runs each time instead of moving to the advanced troubleshooting menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The windows defender offline scan was supposed to be a one time scan. &nbsp;It appears as though its a repetitive scan and cannot be turned off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It runs everytime when attempting to go from blue screen to advanced troubleshooting menu. &nbsp;And its scaning blocks the movement to the advanced troubleshooting menu to turn off windows driver verifier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears that running windows defender offline was not a one time scan as it run everytime there is an attempt to move from bluescreen to the windows advanced troubleshooting menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having run driver verifier after the windows defender offline scan this is what happens when an attempt is made to turn off windows driver verifier:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) black background with HP icon displaying preparing automatic repair</p>
<p>2) windows defender offline scan</p>
<p>3) return to blue screen with windows driver verifier stopcode</p>
<p>4) black background with HP icon displaying preparing automatic repair</p>
<p>5) windows defender offline scan</p>
<p>6) return to blue screen with windows driver verifier stopcode</p>
<p>7) black background with HP icon displaying preparing automatic repair</p>
<p>8) windows defender offline scan</p>
<p>9) etc..........a continuous loop<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other computers also had windows defender offline scans. &nbsp;With one computer unusable now I am afraid to use the windows driver verifier on the other computers to fix the identified driver stopcodes.<br />
</p>
<p>How can it be determined whether windows defender offline and windows verifier have incompatibilities or whether something happened to the newly installed windows 10 professional operating system on the sanitized internal hard drive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of my computers had windows defender offline scans after a run of windows driver verifier. &nbsp;Only one computer had windows driver verifier run after the windows defender scan and windows defender no longer allows movement to the advanced troubleshooting
 menu. &nbsp;It always runs a windows defender offline scan instead of moving to the advanced troubleshooting menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To fix the stopcodes found with the earlier runs of windows driver verifier I need to be able to uninstall and reinstall drivers and then recheck the notebooks with windows driver verifier. &nbsp;If windows driver verifier is rerun another computer that had windows
 defender offline run may go into the windows defender offline loop preventing recovery with the advanced troubleshooting safe mode command verifier /reset. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 ) How can the potential incompatibility be tested without making another computer unusable?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) How can the interference from windows defender offline scan &nbsp;be stopped so that the advanced troubleshooting options become available to then progress to safe mode with command prompt?</p>
<p>

            <p>The store sanitized this notebooks internal hard drive after saving the files in windows PE.&nbsp; They reinstalled the windows 10 professional operating system, drivers, and files.&nbsp; The files are not saved now as they are on the problematic drive.</p>
<p>The drive remains in a loop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It either displays a blue screen that is produced by windows driver verifier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or it displays windows offline windows defender scan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was not able to break the loop and get to the advanced troubleshooting menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Aren't there hardware methods and software methods to get to the advanced troubleshooting menu?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the power off and power on method doesn't this require the timing to be when the windows icon is displayed?</p>
<p>Normally the HP icon is displayed first and the windows icon second.&nbsp; A power off on the HP icon should or should not work?&nbsp; Doesn't it have to be a power on and off three times when viewing the windows icon?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which F key repetitively clicked works for HP computers?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How about the shift key?&nbsp; How is that supposed to work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where is there information on the hardware methods to get to the advanced troubleshooting menu?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The software methods are not possible as I cannot stop the windows driver verifier as it is not letting me get to administrative command prompt.&nbsp; Is there any way to override the system and get it to display administrative command prompt?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The recovery media that I have for this computer is a windows 10 professional dvd and driver recovery dvd.&nbsp; When the files were saved in windows PE they were able to do whatever they wanted to the internal hard drive.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I dont have the files backed up and don' know how to get to the advanced troublshooting menu.&nbsp; The windows defender keeps running in offline mode when I attempt to go from preparing automatic repair to diagnosing your PC to automatic repair to advanced
 options.&nbsp; Most of these don't appear as something is triggering the Microsoft Windows defender offline scan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does the recovery dvd have the options for advanced troubleshooting or will it install the operating system over the files?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does getting a flash drive and then installing a windows 10 iso onto it allow booting to the advanced troubleshooting menu?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The bios is UEFI native without CSM.&nbsp; Does the bios boot order need to be changed for this to work or does the default factory setting typically allow the USB boot to recovery media without going into the blue screen triggered by windows driver verifier?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does the windows PE environment need to be done again to save the files?</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the second computer that had a blue screen I was able to get back to windows.&nbsp; Then I used a browser and updated the windows operating system.&nbsp; It allowed saving files and applications.&nbsp; In contrast on the first computer I don't know how to enter the
 command verifier /reset without getting to safe mode with administrative command prompt to turn off windows driver verifier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also the internal hard drive is 750 GB.&nbsp; It is not encrypted.&nbsp; The computer has an internal flash cache.&nbsp; It does not have an internal SSD drive.&nbsp; The combination of internal hard drive and internal flash cache I thinks makes it a raid 0 system.&nbsp; At one
 time I had attempted to move the internal hard drive into the primary or secondary bay of another computer.&nbsp; It was not possible to get windows 10 disk management to identify the internal drive.&nbsp; The drive was only recognized by the bios and or Intel rapid
 storage technology.&nbsp; For a computer that was identical the Intel rapid storage technology would indicate the drive as being unavailable.&nbsp; And for an upgraded computerthe Intel rapid storage technology would display the drive as being incompatible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So that is a lot of information.&nbsp; I dont understand how to stop the driver verifier and get to safe mode.&nbsp; It appears as there are only hard ware options with the power on off, the F keys, the shift key, or recovery media via the optical drive or the usb
 port.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are aware or have a link for the hardware recovery methods to get to advanced troubleshoot that would be appreciated for this computer and for any future computer related issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you know how to save the fiels and use the windows 10 dvd in the optical drive please comment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if none of those are possible solutions please comment on how it may be possible to purchase a usb flash drive and then possibly install the windows 10 onto the drive and then maybe use it for advanced troubleshooting options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please indicate which of these are possible options to turn off the windows driver verifier or turn off the windows defender offline scan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And please indicate how to make sure that files are saved before the recovery steps.</p>

            <p>On a computer that only has its operating system and factory installed drivers and programs I just performed windows driver verifier.&nbsp; It produced a blue screen with stop code DRIVER VERIFIER DETECTED VIOLATION.&nbsp; Using advanced troubleshooting and administrative
 command prompt verifier /reset was used to turn of windows driver verifier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then a windows defender offline scan was performed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then windows driver verifier was performed again.&nbsp; It produced a blue screen with stop code DRIVER VERIFIER DETECTED VIOLATION.&nbsp; The notebook was no longer able to go to the advanced troubleshooting menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This computer went into the loop like the prior computer:</p>
<p>
</p><p>power on-----&gt;displays HP icon-----&gt;displays windows icon with preparing automatic repair-----&gt;screen changes to windows defender offline loading-----&gt;your PC is being scanned, it is a quick scan and takes approximately 2 minutes-----&gt;screen changes to HP
 icon-----&gt;screen changes to windows icon-----&gt;blue screen reappears-----&gt;power off-----&gt;power on-----&gt;HP icon appears-----&gt;windows icon appears with preparing automatic repair-----&gt;windows defender offline loading-----&gt;your PC is being scanned-----&gt;endless
 loop</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This is the second computer that displays the incompatibility of windows defender offline and windows driver verifier.&nbsp; The windows defender offline was only supposed to be a one time scan.&nbsp; Somehow it is being triggered by driver verifier to run.&nbsp; When
 the windows defender offline scan completes it goes into driver verifier triggered blue screen.&nbsp; Then power off and power on repeats the windows defender offline trigger to driver verifier produced blue screen.&nbsp; It is an endless loop......one triggers the
 other......the two windows programs are incompatible when windows driver verifier triggers a blue screen.</p>

            <p>The incompatibility of windows driver verifier and windows defender offline is displayed in this video shot with my samsung smart phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are many computers that displayed blue screens with windows driver verifier. &nbsp;To exit windows driver verifer advanced troubleshooting to safe mode with command prompt was followed by entering verifier /reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then windows defender in full mode was run.</p>
<p>Then windows defender in offline mode was run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then windows driver verifier was run again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every computer, now 2, went into a blue screen loop. &nbsp;There was no longer an option to go into advanced troubleshooting. &nbsp;There was no administrative command prompt to turn off windows driver verifier. &nbsp;And windows defender offline should not have been running
 as it was a one time click and there was no setting to have repetitive runs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There may or may not be incompatibility in a computer that does not display a blue screen with windows driver verifier. &nbsp;All of the computers that I tested immediately blue screened with stopcodes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are some of the stop codes on the multiple computers:</p>
<p>
</p><p>driver verifier detected violation</p>
<p>driver verifier detected violation: &nbsp;hpdskflt.sys</p>
<p>driver verifier detected violation: &nbsp;sddtoki.sys</p>
<p>driver verifier detected violation: &nbsp;soluto.sys</p>

<p>
</p><p>The windows defender should not be running with each boot. &nbsp;There should be an option to progress to advanced troubleshooting without triggering a windows defender offline scan.</p>

            <p>In this link: &nbsp;https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/bsod-finding-and-fixing-them/1939df35-283f-4830-a4dd-e95ee5d8669d &nbsp;there are comments on page file that I need more information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On multiple computers I have used windows driver verifier. &nbsp;This software is designed to find problematic drivers and produces blue screens. &nbsp;On the blue screens there is a stop code. &nbsp;Sometimes it displays a problem driver typically with a sys ending.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my computers after running windows driver verifier where a blue screen is displayed the minidump and memory.dmp file may not update. &nbsp;In addition a third party software program designed to process these files may not display any crash dump analysis as
 it too did not find any new minidump or memory.dmp files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The system settings were optimized by changing them per the above link: &nbsp;automatically restart was changed from the default checked to unchecked; write debugging information was changed from the default small memory dump (256 KB) to automatic memory dump;
 and the dump file was not changed and was left on the default setting of %systemroot%\memory.dmp</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I viewed the advanced tab on multiple computers I saw that the paging file size varied from 2432 to 8704. &nbsp;All of these computers are running either windows 10 or windows 10 professional. &nbsp;And all of the computers have either 8, 16 or 32 GB RAM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The paging file size has never been manually changed. &nbsp;Whatever is there is from an automatic change with each use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Was the link above for paging size for older versions of windows such as windows 7 and 8 or is it applicable to windows 10? &nbsp;Should any or all of the computers have their paging files manually changed? &nbsp;What are the pros and cons on performance? &nbsp;And will
 these changes then optimize the creation of minidump and memory.dmp files to obtain a minidump or memory.dmp for every blue screen produced by windows driver verifier?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Using two different Microsoft windows 10 programs I experienced the boot loop too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The two windows programs are: &nbsp;Microsoft windows defender offline and Microsoft windows driver verifier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was an unexpected finding on one computer and then it was reproduced on another computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the first computer I had run windows driver verifier and it produced an immediate blue screen. &nbsp;There was a stop code. &nbsp;Plans were to work up the stop code and look for minidump or memory.dmp files. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime windows defender offline was ran.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then after some work up of the stop code I ran windows driver verifier again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The run of windows driver verifier after a run of windows defender offline produced the boot loop. &nbsp;There were no advanced troubleshooting options available as each boot went to windows defender offline instead of the advanced troubleshooting menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The windows defender offline is only supposed to run once. &nbsp;There is no setting to make it run more than once or repetitively. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a windows defender offline residual that interacts with windows driver verifier. &nbsp;So every blue screen that is followed by power off and power on does another windows defender offline.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There were multiple computers that I had ran windows driver verifier and later windows defender offline. &nbsp;All of the computers had had an immediate blue screen. &nbsp;The plan was to uninstall and reinstall driver until there were no longer any blue screens for
 36 hours. &nbsp;Unfortunately windows defender offline had ben run on each of these computers preventing the recurrent use of windows driver verifier. &nbsp;Otherwise the computers could become entagled in the boot loop and become unusable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of my computers had only the windows 10 operating system and factory installed applications. &nbsp;On this computer I decided to see if the boot loot was reproducible. &nbsp;On this computer I had run windows driver verifier once. &nbsp;It had produced an immediate
 blue screen. &nbsp;Windows driver verifier was reset. &nbsp;Windows defender offline was also run once. &nbsp;So I ran windows driver verifier once again and it went into the boot loop making the computer unusable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When in the boot loop there are no advanced troubleshooting options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is an option to try a Microsoft windows 10 bootable iso. &nbsp;This can be downloaded onto a flash drive from&nbsp;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the bootable windows iso there is an option to repair the operating system.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the windows iso on a flash drive does not have the same advanced troubleshooting options like on the installed operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The advanced troubleshooting options on the downloadable windows 10 iso is missing all of the start up settings. &nbsp;On the installed windows 10 there are 9 subcategories in the start up settings. &nbsp;All of these are missing on the windows 10 bootable iso. &nbsp;
 There is no enable safe mode etc</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the windows bootable iso all possible repair methods failed:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reset this PC: &nbsp;The drive where windows is installed is locked. &nbsp;Unlock the drive and try again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go back to previous build: &nbsp;Windows ran into a problem and won't be able to take you back to the previous build. &nbsp;Try resetting your current build instead. &nbsp;(troubleshoot &gt; reset this PC)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start up repair: &nbsp;Diagnosing your PC with rotating dots. &nbsp;Attempting repair. &nbsp;Startup repair couldn't repair your PC. &nbsp;Press advanced options to try other options to repair your PC. &nbsp;Shutdown turns off your PC. &nbsp;Log file: &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>System restore: &nbsp;To use system restore you most specify which windows installation to restore. &nbsp;Restart the computer, select an operating system and then select system restore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it appears to me there are only two options:</p>
<p>1) Use a recovery DVD and reinstall windows 10</p>
<p>2) Use the windows 10 bootable iso and reinstall windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>On you tube I saw a video on how to unlock the drive using diskpart commands: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyBrjDpsXGc</p>
<p>This above step I have not yet tried. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using windows driver verifier on multiple computers produced immediate blue screens on each. &nbsp;To reset windows driver verifier advanced troubleshooting menu is routinely used and when in administrative command prompt verifier /reset turns off driver verifier.
 &nbsp;When in a windows defender offline boot loop there is no method that i know of that gets you to advanced troubleshooting where you can reset or turn off windows driver verifer. &nbsp;Again the windows defender offline prevents the movement to advanced troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are things though that I was not able to confirm:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know whether a computer that has no blue screens with windows driver verifier will or won't interact incompatibly with windows defender offline. &nbsp;Only computers that had blue screens had the boot loop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is unclear as to whether the passage of time after using windows defender offline could prevent the boot loop or whether it leaves a residual that must be removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When uninstalling antivirus programs such as Norton, Mcafee etc the control panel is insufficient. &nbsp;Each of these programs has a special uninstaller.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I know there is no uninstaller for windows defender offline.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also this was reproduced on one computer and I don't know how many computers it takes to determine whether it will happen on every computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nevertheless if you use windows defender offline caution is needed as the boot loops were unexpected. &nbsp;Also restore points didn't work. &nbsp;So you likely will need a computer store/technician to save files unless you have backed up the files onto an external
 drive or into the cloud.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows 8 Computer unable to connect to my home Verizon Wireless Router.</h2>
                    <p>Original Titlte:Is it wireless or win 8?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a new (2 weeks old) Dell Inspiron running win 8 (came installed) with Centrino N223 wireless.&nbsp;
<br />
I cannot connect to my home Verizon wireless router.&nbsp; The computer "sees" the wireless signal, but<br />
will not connect (WPA2 personal; correct key, have retyped many times).&nbsp; The N223 wireless card is<br />
working since it will connect at free wireless sites.&nbsp; All Win 7 computers in the house connect to the
<br />
home Verizon router with no problem.&nbsp; If the wireless card is working, and the router is
<br />
working, then&nbsp; .............&nbsp; ? &nbsp; <br />

            I'm having similar issue connecting my Windows 8 laptop to my Verizon Jetpack 890L or the hotspot on my cell phone.&nbsp; It does work with my phones hotspot if I change the network to CDMA.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; I have uninstalled my virus security protection suite<br />
2.&nbsp; Ran ipconfig /release then ipconfig /renew<br />
3.&nbsp; Ran ipconfig /flushdns<br />
4.&nbsp; ping the default gateway (192.168.1.1) and that fails<br />
<br />
My laptop works when I connect to my home wires network (cable modem router).&nbsp; Any more thoughts on this?<br />

<h2>            price local number</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to have a local number in the Netherlands. I want to see the prices. The website Skype says..
</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock"><em>"<span style="color: rgba(43, 43, 48, 1)">The cost of a Skype Number subscription varies depending on which country you want the Skype Number for and how long the subscription lasts (1, 3 or 12-months).</span></em></p>
<p class="contentCodeblock" style="color: rgba(43, 43, 48, 1)">
<br />
<em>To check the cost:</em></p>
<p><em>Go to the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.skype.com/go/store.buy.skypein" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Get a Skype Number</a>&nbsp;page. You'll be prompted to sign in if you aren't already.</em></p>
<p><em>Select the country you want the Skype Number for, and you will be given a number.</em></p>
<p><em>Select&nbsp;<span>Continue</span>, or&nbsp;<span>Show
 other local numbers</span>&nbsp;to choose a different Skype Number.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Select a billing period (1, 3, or 12-months), to view the prices.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>But If I do that, I need to agree all the term and I have the contract. So I cannot see the prices before I have the contract. Could you help me?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Taylor,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to follow the below methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: </strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">You can try turning off the User Account Control, follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1. Open User Accounts by pressing Windows key + X, clicking Control Panel, clicking User Accounts and Family Safety and then clicking User Accounts.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2. Click Turn User Account Control on or off. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">3. Select the Use User Account Control (UAC) to help protect your computer check box to turn on UAC, or clear the check box to turn off UAC, and then click OK.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: User Account Control (UAC) can help you prevent unauthorized changes to your computer. It works by prompting you for permission when a task requires administrative rights, such as installing software
 or changing settings that affect other users. We don't recommend turning User Account Control off. If you do turn it off, you should turn it back on as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Check whether the same issue happens when you login with built admin admin account.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Once you have access to Elevated Command prompt, follow the steps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1. Type "<strong>net user administrator /active:yes</strong>" and click
<strong>Enter</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">You will get a message stating that "The Command completed successfully"</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2. Go to the normal mode now and sign in from the built in administrator account which you have created.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information was helpful and do let us know if you need further assistance. We will be glad to assist.

            <p>Thank you, but neither of these options worked.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Option 1:&nbsp; I don't have an option called User Accounts and Family Safety.&nbsp; I only have User Accounts and within that option I do not have an option to Turn User Account Control on or off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Option 2:&nbsp; This did not fix the problem.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried that but for the volume icon it is marked as 'off' and is greyed out so I can't change it to 'on'. Would there be any reason that I can't change it to 'on'?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to customise the notification icons I choose 'show icon and notifications' for volume, however a box comes up saying 'This notification icon is not currently active it will be shown the next time it becomes active'. But I can't make it active
 as the box is greyed out...</p>

<h2>            Program not actually installed when I install it</h2>
                    I've been trying to install uTorrent today, and I've downloaded the installer from the website. I go through the installation process and at the end, the install wizard says the installation is complete, and I have "Launch uTorrent" selected when I close
 the wizard. Then nothing happens. I've tried reinstalling it, but it doesn't show up in my list of installed programs, on the start menu, on my desktop, and every time I reload the installation wizard, it acts as though this is the first time I'm installing
 the program. I'm at a loss for what to do, since I've already tried looking up this problem and nothing relevant comes up, just stuff like "installer won't let me install program cause it says it's already installed", that sort of thing. Any kind of help I
 can get on this? Thanks!

            Hello! Sorry you are having this issue. Hopefully we can fix it.
<br />
<br />So have you tried to look for utorrent in your file explorer? It may be hard to find with the default viewer so try the tool "Everything" I will link here. Just download and install it and then search for your program inside it.

            Hi DistantFreedom
<br />
<br />Have you checked the tray on your Taskbar to see if UTorrent is sitting there (you may need to press the up arrow)
<br />
<br />For the most part UTorrent runs in the background and only becomes active when you download a Torrent Magnet link . .. 
<br />
<br />Try downloading a Torrent form the web, are you asked in your Browser if you want to open UTorrent?

    <title>Screen Limits - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Screen Limits</h2>
                    I have 4 children with accounts on my computer, and only one computer that they share. Screen limits seem to work for all but one of my children... the one that wants to hog the computer. I'm set to check and update software weekly, and restart the computer
 every couple of days, but it still allows him to stay on all day. Any other ideas on keeping screen limits enforced when I'm not home?

<p>Hi Christie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have set up screen limits to your child, but your child can still use the PC even if the screen time has run out, it could be that the
<strong>Set limits for when my child can use devices </strong>is not enabled. If it is turned on, check the time limits and daily allowances that are set to the hours that you want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If all the settings are set up correctly for your child's account, check to make sure that your child is playing on the same account that you are managing in your family.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Family settings are account specific, so if your child is using different accounts, you will need to add those accounts to your family.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to an update from you.</p>

            I have both time limits and screen limits set for 2 hours and 3:30-10:00 pm, yet he's able to access it from his profile for up to 8 hours a day. If he were getting on to a different account, i wouldn't see that many hours listed on his account. And, i
 do not allow guest users either.

<p>I am working on a Skype web Integration module using the Skype Web SDK and for practical reasons I need to make a Distribution Group that contains a predefined list of contacts so the users don't have to manually add dozens to hundreds of contacts (the group
 length will change from a client to another).</p>
<p>For our tests, I made a DG in the Office 365 Admin center, let's call it "SkyUI" but I can't seem to find it in neither my Skype client nor my web application.</p>
<p>The search results in the Skype client will show a "No matches" message when typing only the group name, and when typing the full ID, a single-person-like entity with an unknown presence, which doesn't show any group when added in the contact list.</p>
<p>We do have other Office 365 groups that I can find and add properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example with the <strong>Skype client</strong>:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5cdc22e7-5932-4e37-8ea2-4f1785664415?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5cdc22e7-5932-4e37-8ea2-4f1785664415?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Full group ID</strong>:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4087bee5-841c-4437-bd95-201376632f44?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4087bee5-841c-4437-bd95-201376632f44?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>(Notice the entity avatar that is different)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example in my <strong>Web App</strong> (demonstration purpose only, you don't need to understand this SDK thingy or JavaScript):</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e0aff512-c5e4-497a-a151-36d1bb0c0fed?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e0aff512-c5e4-497a-a151-36d1bb0c0fed?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see the "SkyUI" group isn't found, yet its settings are similar to the other groups. Or are they? I might have missed some option but I have no idea which one, I don't see no relevant settings in the Admin Center, nor on the Azure portal.</p>
<p>And by the way, I do see the group and its members in Outlook.<br />
</p>
<p>I read multiple articles showing the same way of creating groups, and most of the topics matching my issue that I've found were about Skype for Business On-Premises, cmdlet shell commands etc, but we got everything online.</p>
<p>I tried a solution&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_sfb-mso_win10-mso_o365b/office-365-distribution-groups-link-to-skype-for/38de9183-8d5b-4f68-9f10-3f8337340e23">found here</a>:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Exit Skype for Business.</span></li><li><span>Navigate to&nbsp;</span><span>Users&nbsp;&gt; username &gt;&nbsp;AppData&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Local&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Office&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;16.0</span><span>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Lync</span></li><li><span>Delete</span><span>&nbsp;sip_profileName</span><span>&nbsp;folder.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Delete all files in&nbsp;</span><span>Tracing</span><span>&nbsp;folder. Do not delete the folder itself.</span></li><li><span>Login to Skype for Business again.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>The group is more than 24 hours old.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I sent a ticket but the tech support didn't fully understand my request and, after trying to convince me to go for SFB Server or use Teams&nbsp;(not really the kind of features we're looking for) instead of developing an app, eventually suggested me to ask someone
 else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other groups' owners haven't replied to my mail yet, so while I wait for their response, here I am.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>How could I solve this "problem"?</strong></p>
<p>I hope I provided enough details, let me know if you need more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to read your replies.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cedric F,</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: Here are the group settings, for what its worth.</p>

<p>Hi Cedric F,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After checking the logs, it seems that the&nbsp;group "SkypeUI" has been created and removed several times for doing the test, the deleted groups are in the "soft delete" area (still stored in server, but are inactive). And while days after, those deleted groups
 are hard deleted (deleted from server permanently) and the group "SkypeUI" new-created can be searched again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Iry</p>

<p>Have you got a old game sitting on your shelf and always fancied trying it on multiplayer but were too scared off getting handed it on a plate, or just plain never got around to it and before you knew it everyone had moved onto bigger and better things ????</p>
<p>If thats the case then keep reading, here at Console 3 we love old games. Mainly cos were skint... but also because theres some real belters out there that are largely forgotten and in many ways better than all those blockbusters that cost you £40 to put
 in your console.</p>
<p>Games like Lost Planet, Gears of War, Rainbow6Vegas, Ghost Recon, L4D, FarCry2 etc etc the list could go on. But one thing they have in common is that they are all great Multiplayer classics and don't deserve to gather dust on anyones shelves !!!!</p>
<p>So in the weeks ahead all members of Console3 will get the chance to vote for the game they want to see Championed by this Forum and which ever Title wins the most votes will be crowned Console3's Official Members Game.</p>
<p>The game chosen by YOU the members will have a place of honour amongst Console3 and all who gaze upon it will bow and pay homage...... ok maybe a bit far but all members will be encouraged to at least give it ago and join in a few multiplayer evenings if
 they can...</p>
<p>This title will last 6 months until a new vote is taken for the next Official Members Game... Sound Good ???</p>
<p>Well use the time you have left wisely and think about a few games you would like to see Console3 focus on. The only criteria is... they must be widely obtainable for a tenner or less so it won't hit our members household budget... and secondly they must
 have a multiplayer for at the very least four players so as many people who want to join in get the opportunity.</p>
<p>Get your thinking caps on and watch this space for more updates in the future...

<h2>            Windows update completely messed up my computer</h2>
                    <p>I have a 2 years old pretty good computer that after a windows update got completely unusable. It happened once which got fixed with a system restart disc but second time it didnt work. When I boot my computer after a update it goes completely black with
 a white mouse cursor not showing the login page nor a account selection. I tried every way of booting up the computer but every time it loads and before it logs on, it shuts down and restarts. Would highly appreciate if this would have a solution as quick
 as possible because need it for a project (using old laptop that doesnt support project software). Backup doesnt work, no restore points, system image doesnt work, system repair disc doesnt work, scans on hard disk etc. show no problems? Need help!</p>

            <p><strong>OPTION A:</strong> See <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode#1TC=windows-7</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The Advanced Boot Options screen lets you start Windows in advanced troubleshooting modes. You can access the menu by turning on your computer and pressing the F8 key before Windows starts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select <strong>Last Known Good Configuration</strong> [1] or, if no joy,&nbsp;<strong>Disable automatic&nbsp;restart on system failure</strong> (i.e., the looping you're experiencing). After selecting the latter, you'll get an error or BSOD screen displaying crucial
 information (which you can tell me in your next reply).</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>OPTION B:</strong> You may obtain <em>Microsoft-sponsored</em> <strong>
Premium</strong> (i.e., paid) <strong>Support</strong> via the Answer Desk =&gt; <a href="http://answerdesk.microsoftstore.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p><strong>OPTION C:</strong> If these procedures are outside of your technical "comfort zone" - and there is no shame in admitting this isn't your cup of tea - take the computer to a local, reputable and
<em>independent</em> (i.e., not a "BigBoxStore" or the Geek Squad!) computer repair shop &amp; let them fix it.</p>

            <p>​Hi,<br />
<br />
<span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft community!</span><br />
<br />
Yes, you may create recovery disc for windows 7. <br />
</p>
<div>Try the steps:<br />
a. Open the Start Menu, then type recdisc.exe in the search box and press Enter.<br />
Go to step c.<br />
b. Open the Control Panel (icons view), and click on the Backup and Restore icon. A) Click on the Create a System repair disc link in the left blue pane.
<div>c. Insert a blank unformatted CD or DVD into your CD/DVD drive and click on the Create disc button.
<br />
NOTE: If you are prompted to insert a Windows installation disc, it means that the files needed to create the system repair disc cannot be found on your computer. Insert a Windows 7 installation disc.</div>
<div>d. It will now start creating the System Repair Disc. <br />
NOTE: If a AutoPlay window pops up, just close it.</div>
<div>e. When it's finished, click on the Close button.<br />
f. Click on OK. <br />
g. Remove and label the new Windows 7 System Repair Disc from the CD/DVD drive.</div>
