<h2>            Does Word for Mac 2011 have a clip board&#63;</h2>
                    Does Word for Mac 2011 have a clip board for temporarily storing data before I copy it into a different document?
<div>Is the clip board emptied when I make the transfer of data out of it?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I keep getting the whirling color wheel while using Word for Mac 2011, and I am looking for ways to clean out unnecessary data from my hard drive. That is the reason for my question about the clipboard.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you.</div>

            The Clipboard is a service provided by OS X, not the application program. It stores only the last content copied or pasted... IOW, when you Cut or Copy the new content replaces the previous. The content is not deleted regardless of how many times you paste
 it.<br />
<br />
Unless there is an extremely large volume of copied/cut content, however, no disk space is involved. The Clipboard content is held in RAM &amp; is cleared when you restart your Mac or log out.<br />
<br />
If your HD is getting full what you need to remove are any files you've created but no longer need. Move them to another storage device for future use if necessary. Also, clear your browser caches &amp; remove any software you don't use. I suggest that you
<i>not</i> use any utility program that claims to 'clean up' your HD... They often cause more problems than they cure by removing support files needed by your programs.<br />
<br />
In order to help improve performance, make sure that Office &amp; OS X are fully updated, repair disk permissions &amp; restart your Mac. Keep in mind that an occasional restart [not just closing the lid if it's a laptop] helps keep things running more efficiently.<br />

    <title>Can the issues with the E7 camera be solves in software&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tharris---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can the issues with the E7 camera be solves in software&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello all!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I get that the E7 is horrible at macro shots. Ok no problem.&nbsp; But quite honestly it not so hot at photos in general. Even with photos taken at 5 feet (about 1.5 meters?) and beyond photos are usually soft, blurry, muddy and just plain out of focus. Oddly
 enough the video fares slightly better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What makes this situation all the more puzzling is the extensive photo and video editing software included. So at least you can sharpen it a little right on the camera. With that said, is it possible to introduce some kind of software update to the camera
 to improve the images digitally? Absolutely anything would be better than nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I edited photos and video for a newspaper for 6 years, so I'm especially sensitive to this. Now I work in litigation support at a law firm and I have a scenario to present since the E7 is presented as a business phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A client came down and needed photos of a product that was evidence scanned to PDF. Specifically she needed the ingredients. I took out my then N97 Mini took close ups of the product labeling in question uploaded them to a PC and converted to PDF and emailed
 it to the client all in less than 5 minutes. Something like this is absolutely impossible with the E7 obviously.&nbsp; So the camera is a huge disappointment and a bit of a shock since Nokia is usually spot on in its hardware design and a phone designated as a
 business phone is so handicapped. But that's a done issue. Back to my original question. Could the camera be improved with a software update and are those plans even in discussion?</p>

<p>Minor improvements are better than none. Not looking for anything spectacular I have dedicated SLRs and camcorders that I edit with photoshop on calibrated monitors but I don't carry that with me 24-7 but I do have my phone practically all the time. All
 I wanted was my pictures to be in focus within the phone's own specs. Nothing more than any other camera phone I've owned. As far as EDoF digital can't begin to approach real optics so I have no concerns or worries about EDoF at all. But amazingly I found
 an app that does improve the image clarity by quite a bit and is pretty much beyond what I was hoping for. And it's already in the ovi store. :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ShutterPro Premium is exactly what I was looking for and for $2.99 is totally worth it for the improvements you get&nbsp; in image quality. There's another app called CameraPro 2.2 that I read good things about. I might give it a try too but for now I'm good.
 Shutter Pro did the trick.</p>

<p>If you are using Outlook 2016 for Mac without any problem, it is safe to delete the old identities. They the backup files of the data when you use Outlook 2011 for Mac. However, to prevent data loss, you can save them to other device.

<h2>            Insert 3D Model Feature Missing from Ribbon in PowerPoint</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to insert a 3D model into a PowerPoint presentation. Despite having a system version up to date to support this feature it does not show up in PowerPoint on the Insert&gt;Illustration Ribbon. It also does not show up in the customize feature manager.
 Please see attached images for Windows 10 version and views of the customize menu/insert ribbon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have uninstalled and re-installed Office AND I have run the Online Repair on Office as well. The issue persists the same despite these attempts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a reason I still do not have this option? This is my first time attempting to use it.</p>

                    <p>My OS is Windows 10 Pro 64-bit, and I am running Office 2010 32-bit.&nbsp; I recently installed a 3rd-party&nbsp;Add-In and ran it for about a week.&nbsp; I then de-installed it&nbsp;using System Programs &amp; Services because I thought it was causing a problem with Excel OPEN
 and SAVE AS functions.&nbsp;&nbsp;When I try to use them I don't get a File Manager-type window to select a file or directory.&nbsp; It seemed to de-install okay, but the Excel problem&nbsp;did not go&nbsp;away,&nbsp;AND I still see the Add-In listed in the Excel Add-In tab.&nbsp; &nbsp; Is there
 anyway I can remove an Add-In through the Excel Add-In Tab?&nbsp; There didn't seem to be, or at least I couldn't find one.</p>

<h2>            Change email address separator from semicolon to comma</h2>
                    <p>Wow, I've done a lot of work trying to research how to get Outlook 2016 for Mac (desktop version) to allow commas to separate email addresses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows version allows it (File menu &gt; Options, or in some cases Tools menu &gt; Options).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how to set up Outlook to allow the comma to be used to separate email addresses, instead of the semicolon?</p>

<h2>            Office 2013 problems after Office 365 migration</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
Hello,</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
My office has recently completed an Office 365 migration. &nbsp;Afterward, all computers randomly experience this popup error box:</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
"We're sorry, but Microsoft Office has run into an error that is preventing it from working correctly. &nbsp;Microsoft Office will need to be closed as a result. &nbsp;Would you like us to repair now?"</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
"Office" can also be "Word," "Excel," or "Outlook."</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
The popup options are Repair Now, Help, and Close. &nbsp;However, Repair Now and Close just make the popup window close. &nbsp;They do not close the program or try to repair anything.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
What I have tried with no solution:</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
Repairing Office in the Control Panel</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
Reinstalling from the Office 365 login page</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
Changing the compatibility mode&nbsp;</p>

<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
Office 2013 and Skype for Business 2016 on mostly Windows 7 machines. &nbsp;However, the Windows 8 machine still has the same problem. &nbsp;Running Ccleaner seemed to help reduce the errors.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
Seems to happen more when Skype is running.</p>

    <title>Access Conditional Search Criteria using IF and date ranges - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> angelanderson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Access Conditional Search Criteria using IF and date ranges</h2>
                    <p>I've searched around, found some similar questions, but none that specifically addressed the date range issue. Here's the diddy..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>My table</strong> has three date&nbsp;fields (TradeDate, Processed Date &amp; Billing Date).
<em>These are likely different for each record. (i.e. it traded prior to processing and billed out a week after processing)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>My form</strong> has User selected txtStartDate and txtEndDate. It also has a list box of "fitler By"&nbsp; (1=Processed Date, 2=BillingDate, 3=TradeDate)</p>
<p>&nbsp; <em>This way the user can select which set of Data they need. I.e. A billing report for 12/1/13 to 12/5/13 wouldn't return the same results as a Processed Report for same date range)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>My Query - </strong><em>this is where it gets tricky.</em>&nbsp; I don't want to have three separate queries, instead set a conditional criteria for each of these date fields.</p>
<ul>
<li>My query has all three date fields</li><li>In the Criteria, I want it to only filter on date range IF that particular option was selected.</li><li>For example, if Form List box has "Processed Date" selected, I want the Criteria for "Trade Date" to return all records.</li><li>The IF statement was easy enough, but my problem is that because I'm doing a date range, SQL statements &amp; Operators don't seem to work together.</li><li>If I use only one of the dates for the True &amp; False expression, it works. But when I try to use BETWEEN or&nbsp; "&gt;=", I don't get any results.</li></ul>
<p>Anyone know a trick for embedding a date range criteria into an IF statement for Query Criteria? Is there a way of passing this from the form itself?</p>
<p>(I.e Microsoft JET uses ".."&nbsp; as in&nbsp; 12/2/2013..12/4/2013, but Access doesn't like this either).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>You can actually do it all in one query, with no IF and no VBA. It's a bit tricky and you need to realize that a query's criterion is an expression in Boolean algebra - if the expression evaluates to TRUE the record is retrieved, and if it evaluates to FALSE
 it isn't. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So a Where condition that should work would be:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WHERE </p>
<p>([Forms]![YourForm]![LIstbox] = "Processed Date" </p>
<p>AND [Processed Date] BETWEEN [Forms]![YourForm]![txtStart] AND [Forms]![YourForm]![txtEnd])</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>([Forms]![YourForm]![LIstbox] = "Trade Date" </p>
<p>AND [Trade Date] BETWEEN [Forms]![YourForm]![txtStart] AND [Forms]![YourForm]![txtEnd])</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>([Forms]![YourForm]![LIstbox] = "Billing Date" </p>
<p>AND [Billing Date] BETWEEN [Forms]![YourForm]![txtStart] AND [Forms]![YourForm]![txtEnd])</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the listbox contains "Processed Date" then only the first criterion will even be evaluated; the second and third parentheses will be FALSE whatever the date value might be.</p>

                    <p>I am creating an organizational chart and I am having trouble adjusting the lines between the boxes. I am trying to stick another position directly below the "A-Crew Shifter" position but it will only stick it off to the side (see below). I need several
 directly below in a straight line down. I can select the lines but cannot move them.</p>

            <p>I hadn't tried this before, so I tried to replicate your chart, with mixed success (I clearly have a bit to learn). Assuming your chart is in a drawing canvas, there are arrows on the left side. Click to open the box that says
<strong>Type your text here</strong>. In the outline, just keep adding boxes at the same level by pressing
<strong>Enter</strong>. You can use <strong>Tab</strong> and <strong>Backspace</strong> to change levels.</p>

<blockquote>Is there a way to enter a bookmark or quickmark in an Excel spreadsheet so that when you reopen the file it will return you to the last cell you were working?&nbsp; So that if you're editing data in a huge spreadsheet and you're 1/3 of the way through
 it, you don't have to scroll to try to find where you left off.&nbsp; Thanks!</blockquote>
<p><br />
Hi,</p>
<p>Excel does that by default. If you are editing a line or cell, save the workbook and close when your finished and when you re-open, the selected cell will be the same and the worksheet will be scrolled to the correct position.</p>

<p>I see that rmac3 is working with you to try to repair your system, but my typical approach is, as in the case of investigating an airplane crash, to learn as much as possible of the conditions that existed prior to the crash.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, prior to upgrading to build 16199, did you have any 3rd party security program installed, and if so, did you leave it installed, but only deactivated when you began the upgrade?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I pose this question because many of them are designed to automatically reactivate during a restart of the computer, such as during installation of the new build.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In that case, the 3rd party security program might grab and quarantine files that it doesn't recognize, but perhaps still not actually abort the install, so that the build appears to install successfully, but then it might crash or misbehave after login.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Manufacturers of 3rd party security programs often claim that their program is compatible with Windows 10, but they aren't saying that it is compatible with preview builds, which contain files that were not present in the publicly released versions with
 which their program was tested.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the above seems to fit your situation, I would suggest downloading the correct iteration of the ISO files from the Microsoft site at https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewadvanced and doing a clean install (which means
 deleting both the current OS partition and the system reserved partition, and making a new partition to install the build into, allowing the OS installer to make a new system reserved partition).</p>
<p>
</p><p>After cleanly installing build 16193, you can upgrade to the latest build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you then choose to install a 3rd party security program, it is advisable to uninstall it, using the uninstall tool provided on its website, before beginning each new build upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, you might want to consider using one of the free for personal use disk image type backup programs to make an image of your OS partition after each build is successfully installed. It only takes a few minutes to make such an image (to be stored
 on a different hard drive or SSD), and when desired or needed, such as in your present circumstance, or that of a drive failure, you can restore your previous OS and installed programs in 10 minutes or less, using the related rescue bootable medium, not any
 malfunctioning OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope some of this helps.</p>

            I am not sure this will help with your problem but just for general knowledge; to get into a safe boot click on the windows icon and open programs. Scroll down to Windows Admin Tools and then to System Configuration when that opens click on Boot and that
 will give you several options for booting.&nbsp;

<p>Ok, I'm still here ... but please let me explain that I'm trying to finish my 80th year, so I sometimes need to take a break to get some rest ... and, when I was a kid in school, most of us thought typing was for girls, so I passed up my opportunity to get
 that skill, regrettably. Further, I sometimes am criticized for being blunt, so please excuse me if I seem that way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, first off ... you failed to get a correct understanding of what I meant to convey earlier about 3rd party security programs, in your case, AVAST. The situation you're in right now can almost certainly be attributed to your trying to upgrade with the
 one that you have installed. I explained that "disabling" them normally <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
only lasts until the computer restarts during the install</span> ... they usually reactivate and interfere with the rest of the install, so that the result is a mess, with issues large and/or small.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, if you <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">really</span> feel that you must use a 3rd party security program, you need to plan to
 new files and processes that it will not have experienced when being tested on the publicly released versions, and so it will most likely fight them, crippling the build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If one isn't willing to take the precaution I described above, he should either not install a 3rd party security program at all, or just use the publicly released versions that the 3rd party security programs have been supposedly tested on, and forget about
 the preview builds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To boot successfully to an ISO file on a flash drive, it must be made bootable, which can be done using a tool called Rufus. This has been explained several times in posts in this forum, but a good explanation is also available at this site:&nbsp; https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-burn-an-iso-file-to-a-usb-drive-2619270</p>
<p>
</p><p>I usually burn mine on a DVD, but the USB drive works just as well, so if your bios is set allow booting to the USB drive, that's the way to go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you get to the install page that shows your drives/partitions, be sure to delete, not just format, your current OS partition, make a new partition for the installation, and allow the installer to make a new system reserved partition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>From there on, there should be no problem. You can set your options for getting new builds to the fast ring, and before long, you should be back in business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I urge you to begin using one of the free programs to make an image of the OS partition after build is installed and, in this new, clean install, after you have installed whatever programs you choose. One that works well without much help is Backupper ...
 you can google to find it. Just remember to make the rescue media for it, and to save the image on a separate drive, so it won't be lost in case your OS drive fails.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you had such a backup image of your previous build, it would only take a few minutes to restore to that build and all your programs.&nbsp;

<p>I don't see any response to my last reply to you, so presume that you haven't tried what I recommended.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to get your computer going again, a clean install will do so for you. To do that, you need to prepare your USB drive so that you can boot to it and follow my instructions to install build 16193,
<p>
</p><p>The website for which I gave you the link explains how to prepare your USB drive to do that.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should begin by having the downloaded ISO on the computer which you will use to do the preparation of the USB drive by using the Rufus tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">do not</span> simply copy the Rufus tool onto the USB drive in addition to the ISO.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you run the Rufus tool to prepare the USB drive, it will <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
remove whatever is currently on the USB drive</span>, and process the ISO file from the computer, putting it on the USB drive and making it bootable in the process.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You then insert the USB drive in the troubled computer, and boot to it. When it boots, select "install now", not "repair your computer".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it gets to the page showing the drives/partitions on your computer, <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
delete</span>, not format, the C partition, as well as the system reserved partition. Then, using the offered choices, make a new partition to install the build into ... the installer will then prompt for approval to make a new system reserved partition ...
 just click ok, and then, proceed with the installation. &nbsp; </p>

<h3> gardion1  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to prevent carriage returns in a protected 2007 Word document&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have created a Word document for my work.&nbsp; It needs to be distributed and some fields filled out and returned.&nbsp; I have protected the doc only allowing access to enter info into these fields.&nbsp; Everything is fine but it will allow you to hit "enter" and
 place a carriage return.&nbsp; Now why would I want to allow a carriage return on a protected Word document?&nbsp; This is just about the most frustrating issue I've ever experienced with Word!!&nbsp; If there is a way to prevent carriage returns on a protected Word 2007
 document I would love to know how to accomplish it.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

    <title>Suddenly, Word 2007 is in Compatibility Mode - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ultimaratioregum  say:</h3>
<h2>            Suddenly, Word 2007 is in Compatibility Mode</h2>
                    <p>I have been using Office 2007 Word for years with no compatibility problem with any Word documents, no matter how old they were. &nbsp;Suddenly, and by "suddenly" I mean this behavior
<em>never existed before this morning,</em> all documents except newly created ones open in compatibility mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The&nbsp;<em>only&nbsp;</em>thing I have done differently than normal was this morning I ran a document compare between a Word 2003 document and a Word 2007 document. &nbsp;Now, and seemingly
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">only</span></em>&nbsp;since then,&nbsp;all&nbsp;my old documents are opened in compatibility mode. &nbsp;Instead of graphics, table of contents, page numbers, etc, &nbsp;tags are displayed and formatting is off. &nbsp; This was never the case
 prior to this morning. &nbsp;It's like running that compare woke some evil Word demon up. &nbsp;If I give up and convert a document the formatting is off, and tags instead of things like page numbers still show until I print. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what changed? &nbsp;I did not touch Word options or make any Word configuration changes. &nbsp;The only thing I did differently was for the first time I can remember I used the compare feature and noticed seemingly all of the sudden I have this compatibility 'feature.'
 I have used this same installation of Word 2007 on my personal machine for approximately 6 years, and my last upgrade was a year ago to Windows 8. &nbsp;And I have automatic updates disabled to prevent new surprise features.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have worked through the reams of internet posts on this topic and have subsequently checked that the file save option is set to docx (which it was), I have inserted the Dword "CompatMode=0" into the registry (there was not one prior), and I have renamed
 the normal.dot to another name. &nbsp;No difference. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate any help, but what I don't need is an explanation of how Word compatibility mode works. &nbsp;I would love to know
<strong>why</strong> it all of the sudden came on, and <strong>how</strong> do I get back to not having it mess up all my older files? &nbsp; I cannot accept the stock answer I often see that 'this is just how Word 2007 works' because it didn't for me for years
 until this morning. &nbsp;Any help would be appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Sorry, that was a slip of the fingers and lack of proofreading -- the shortcut for field codes is Alt+<strong>F9</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Developer tab and Design Mode button have nothing to do with field codes. They display a different kind of tag, around different elements in the document (XML, content controls, and ActiveX controls). I mentioned them only as an alternative in case the
 field code setting didn't solve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Compatibility Mode issue is a little difficult to explain.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the older files you referred to are in Word 97-2003 (*.doc) format, then Compatibility Mode is expected.

    <title>Importing vcf into Outlook Web App - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Importing vcf into Outlook Web App</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Will the Outlook Web App ever support importing .vcf contact files? Looking back over the forums it seems that this issue has been raised consistently for the last few years and yet it still hasn't been addressed. This seems ludicrous to me, and seemingly
 some others as well. It seems like a really obvious feature and I find it rather ironic that I have to use my personal Gmail account to import contacts into Office 365. If anyone is wondering why there is a new generation of businesses that simply isn't using
 Microsoft Office, this is an example of why.</p>
<p>Thanks, Andrew</p>

<p>Hi Andrew,</p>
<p>No, Outlook Web App doesn’t support importing .VCF contact files. We can import contact in OWA using the .CSV files.</p>
<p>As a workaround, you can first convert .VCF files to .CSV file by referring to the steps mentioned in:</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-outlook/converting-from-vcf-to-csv/62bb1fa2-4e94-4185-a944-c163f477528b">answers.microsoft.com/.../62bb1fa2-4e94-4185-a944-c163f477528b</a></p>
<p>Then import the .CSV file to OWA by referring to:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Import-contacts-into-Outlook-Web-App-096d266e-c950-49de-8340-ce40363cb1f5?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.office.com/.../Import-contacts-into-Outlook-Web-App-096d266e-c950-49de-8340-ce40363cb1f5</a></p>
<p>Also, if you have the Office 365 mailbox configured in the Outlook desktop client, you can import the .VCF file into your mailbox in there directly.</p>
<p>If you encounter any issues when performing the steps above, please feel free to post back and we will provide further assistance about the issue.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Mouran</p>

<p>the second link you provide redirects to another page, "Import contacts to Outlook for Windows". Ss part of our Institute uses Linux desktops only, both instructions do not apply.</p>
<p>We would like to use the OWA only and not have to rely on local clients.</p>
<p>Is there any other way of importing vcf contacts to OWA ? </p>

    <title>Detect when template opened as NEW. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> docedbrown  say:</h3>
<h2>            Detect when template opened as NEW.</h2>
                    I know that when a template xltm file is opened as <span style="font-weight: bold">
New</span>, Excel will change the name to template1 and because I have macros defined the file format to
<b>xlOpenXMLWorkbookMacroEnabled</b>. I would like to have some VBA macros to do some things when the file is first opened as New template. I know that the Workbook_Open or Auto_open macros run on open, but I can't figure out how to detect if this is the template
 New Open.<br />
<br />
I thought of one of the following would enable me to do this:<br />
<br />
1) Is there a built in way to detect when a template *.xltm file is first opened as New?<br />
2) I thought of putting something in a cell in a worksheet and then having the Auto_open or Workbook_Open code change it if the fileformat is not a template. But this seemed like a kludge.<br />
<br />
Any other options?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
John<br />

    <title>Outlook Inbox Rules are messed up&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kminne  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook Inbox Rules are messed up&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Just discovered that all emails from my hubby have now inexplicably&nbsp;been put into my "Recipes" folder.&nbsp; I know I obviously did not set this up this way so I went into settings and looked at my inbox rules.&nbsp; I easily have over 100 rules and I have not checked
 them all, but I was able to quickly identify a couple more rules that are clearly not going to a folder I would have specified.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>My normal&nbsp;process&nbsp;has been&nbsp;to hover over the sender, pick "For this Sender"&nbsp; then pick "Move all", or something similar.&nbsp; I then would choose the option to automatically move all emails from this sender directly into one of a dozen other folders that I use
 to sort non-urgent mailing list stuff.&nbsp; Then I'd select the box to also move all future emails.&nbsp; A few weeks ago I know I encountered some errors when setting up a few new rules, and now I am wondering if this is the result.&nbsp;To the best of my memory it hung
 for awhile and then told me it couldn't complete the process a few times over a couple of days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did something change recently, or was this just a one time glitch?&nbsp; I REALLY can't face the thought of having to go through and fix all of my rules!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note:&nbsp; This issue appears to be completely separate from the asinine changes made last year when the options regarding rules were reduced&nbsp; (ex:&nbsp; can no longer pick option to delete after 3, 10, or 30 days).</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Several reasons can be the cause of this issue. It is possible that this is a one time glitch or caused by a configuration error. To isolate the cause of this problem, kindly open the current rules that you have set up and verify if
<strong>Stop processing more rules</strong> is checked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes, you might set up several rules that could apply to a single message. You can use the option
<strong>Stop processing more rules</strong> on the first rule so that the other rules won't be applied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We also recommend that you <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Inbox-rules-in-Outlook-edea3d17-00c9-434b-b9b7-26ee8d9f5622" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
delete and re-create one of the rules</a> and check if it will work on new emails. When re-creating rules, try to use static email addresses instead of names.</p>
