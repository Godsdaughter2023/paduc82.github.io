<h2>            Tools to create a Linix distro on Windows</h2>
                    I want to create my own Linux distribution of Ubuntu on my windows machine. I have been looking online for a program like this but have had no success. P.S. I couldn't find the right categories for this post so I put the closest I could. I don't want an
 app of the Microsoft Store.

    <title>Error code 0x8000000a when I try to delete a picture and System - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Error code 0x8000000a when I try to delete a picture and System Restore isn&#39;t working</h2>
                    I'm using Windows 7. I get this code when trying to open or delete one picture; all the other pictures behave normally. I've tried a Restore to a date 4 weeks back, but the Restore failed; if I try for an earlier date I get a warning that older Restores
 may be unreliable (could this be connected to the recent malware attack?). The loss of one picture doesn't bother me, but the inability to Restore does -and there seems no point in doing a Backup until I can get rid of the error.

            Hi Margaret... I agree; the worrying aspect is that your system restore failed. I'll refer this for relocation where you will get more appropriate assistance. - Cheers (hope you can sort this out!) - Ric.

<p>If you had a malware attack I would consider all restore points suspicious or compromised.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would make sure your system was stable, as free from malware as you can (MSE, Malwarebytes, SUPERSpyware, HitmanPro, Adwcleaner, etc. - all free versions), take a deep breath, delete all but your last restore point, restart, make a new restore point and
 see if you can restore to the new restore point you just created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that new restore point fails, then troubleshoot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The day you need System Restore to work is not the day to find out it doesn't work.</p>

<p>Thanks for your advice. I did a complete scan with F-Secure, then a Backup. (This took all day, since I have a tremendous lot of pictures, music and videos.) The next day I did a System Restore, which this time was successful. So your advice has done the
 trick.</p>
<p>However, the one rogue picture still refuses to open or delete. Its properties show 0 bytes size; if I try to open it, I get the error code, same as before, and when I try to delete it I get the message that the picture is no longer located in that address,
 and asking me to verify the location (but no indication how to do that).</p>
<p>If you can reassure me that this is not going to cause any further problems, then &nbsp;I'm happy to ignore it, though perhaps I should copy all my pictures, music, videos and documents to an external hard drive, without using the computer's Backup program?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm most grateful for your help.</p>

<p>Hi again Margaret... I'm sure <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/5b51cb03-aa78-44a4-950e-21fdb07d9686" title="ElderN">
<p><em>perhaps I should copy all my pictures, music, videos and documents to an external hard drive, without using the computer's Backup program?&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>That's a Yes... always have at least one direct copy of your personal files on an external drive (preferably two or three on different drives for anything really priceless!) I also always remind people to get their favourite photos printed for good measure
 just in case that super solar flare comes along and wipes out all our technology (which reminds me I haven't taken that part of my own advice yet!!) Best, Ric.</p>

<p>That's good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure about your error 0x8000000a .&nbsp; Never seen it, can't recreate it but I'm not a big picture keeper arounder.&nbsp; Seems to be pretty specific to pictures though - some kind of corruption</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the exension of the afflicted file (.jpg, png, .bmp) and what is the program you are using when you attempt to delete it (Paint, Photo Viewer, something else...).</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can perform a Google search on the error and see some results but I would not download any free "fixer" kinds of programs you read about - stick with Windows things built in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One advice is to open the file with MS Paint and resave it again and then see if it will delete using Windows Explorer (not some photo editing software but I would find it pretty annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maye somebody else will have some ideas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes - it is short sighted to have all the things that are important to you on the same physical hard drive/volume as all your other stuff.&nbsp; You can pick up a high capacity external USB drive for your backups for $50-$75 USD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Never been fond of Windows Backup as Microsoft is not in the backup and restore business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can pick up free versions of software from companies that are in the backup and restore business:</p>
<p>
</p><p>More copy/paste from ElderN:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you want a truly refreshing image backup experience consider at least the free version of Macrium Reflect:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.macrium.com/reflectfree.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.macrium.com/reflectfree.aspx</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Think about what you are going to do someday if your hard drives crashes or your system will not boot and you have to rely on the Microsoft backup/restore program and the help you might get from these Microsoft engaged alleged "experts" (not the same as
 the community volunteers who are the real experts).&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Then imagine the process of recovering your files or your entire system using software and tools from a company that actually specializes in backup/restore or using the tools that come from Microsoft.&nbsp; Which company do you think knows more about how things
 like backup/restore and system recovery should work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Imagine the support you will get from a company that actually specializes in backup/recovery software and that is all they do all day long.&nbsp; You've already seen the kind of support you get from Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course you will get more features in the paid of Macrium version but even the free version is superior to anything Microsoft has to offer (backup/restore is not their business).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Install and test drive the free version.&nbsp; If you don't like it, uninstall it.</p>
<p>

            Thanks again, Ric. Just copying my documents, pictures, music and videos has used up more than half of a 3 Tb external drive, so I'll need to draw breath and fork out for another drive before doing it again - or else do a long-overdue pruning to get rid
 of rubbish &nbsp;(only you're never sure, some stuff I thought was rubbish has turned out to be needed, and vice versa). But you are absolutely right about not depending on just one copy. All the best. Margaret

<p>Thanks again, ElderN. The rogue picture is a .jpg. I've tried (and failed) to delete it in Explorer, and also tried (and failed) to open in Serif PhotoPlusX7, where I've done all my photo processing for years.</p>
<p>I've looked at Google results for the error code, but am wary of downloading programs that claim to cure it by tinkering with the registry: I suspect I could end up with more serious problems than one picture that won't delete.</p>
<p>In the copy that I've just done to my external HD, that picture is not there, so perhaps that's got rid of it. if ever I need to re-load everything.</p>
<p>Your recommendations about other organisations that specialise in backup/restore are welcome, and I'm away now to have a look at Macrium. Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One useful thing <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">for music</span> if you haven't considered it is Google Music Player... you can upload up to 50K tracks free and they can be freely re-downloaded. It's a sort of roundabout back-up because where possible
 Google matches your music to its own music database (it sometimes gets it wrong but that's fairly rare) - where it cannot match something your own file will be uploaded, so it's particularly good for backing up anything rare or non-commercial.</p>
<p>That might be a way of pruning some content without the risk of losing it altogether. An added advantage is you can access it anywhere from portable devices.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8 Upgrade Assistant Download Issue</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yesterday night I installed the Windows 8 Upgrade Assistant, I purchased the license, and download had started.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I had to leave office and thought of resuming it from home, but it didn't work out. I, then, installed it on a different computer, thinking that using&nbsp;the information I had first used,&nbsp;the upgrade assistant would be smart enough to detect that I
 had already used it and I have a valid license, but, apparently, it hasn't.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, I have to purchase a license again, whenever I run the Upgrade assistant. Is there a workaround regarding this ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>This is what you should have done:</p>
<p>Double click the Install Now icon on the desktop.</p>
<span>
<p>When the "Install Windows 8" message appears, select "Install by creating media" to create a bootable USB flash drive or an .iso (a disk image) file.
</p>
<p>Step 3: Wait for the Assistant to download the Windows 8 Pro installation package and create the bootable media or .iso file. The flash drive must be have 3GB or more of free space available.
</p>
<p>Step 4: Burn the .iso file, if that's the path you chose, to a blank DVD. </p>
<p>Step 5: Use that USB drive or DVD to boot the PC.</p>
<p>Step 6: When you get to the screen in Setup that asks, "Which type of installation do you want?' choose "Custom."
</p>
<p>Step 7: Select a disk partition for the OS in the next screen. At this point, you can create a new partition if there's enough space available, or reformat the drive.
</p>
<p>Step 8: Continue with the installation of Windows 8 Pro.</p>

Had the "Install now" or "Download Windows" worked, I wouldn't have opened this thread.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyhow, thanks. I purchased another license, I thought it'd be best buying a second one for the price offered.</p>

    <title>Hard Drive Problem&#63; &#47; XBox Continually Restarts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> oldschoolzinger  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hard Drive Problem&#63; &#47; XBox Continually Restarts</h2>
                    
<p>Apologies if I missed another thread with my same circumstance. I did a search that yielded no helpful results.</p>

<p>I have had my XBox 360 4GB Slim for almost 11 months now, and have been having problems with it restarting itself for the past month or so. After buying this console, I then bought a Microsoft-brand 250GB hard drive. I inserted it without problem, and hadn't
 removed it even once until four or five days ago.</p>

<p>The problems really began the same day Mass Effect 3 was released. I tried installing it to my hard drive and around 77%, the XBox shut off and then would restart, getting so far as the XBox Live Home screen, and then it would restart, stuck in an endless
 loop. I was baffled for a couple days, and then realized I had a partial game installation (77% of Mass Effect 3) that was corrupted in my hard drive. So I removed the game from the tray, went to my memory settings, and deleted the corrupt file. My XBox stopped
 restarting itself with the corrupt file removed, but since then I have not been able to install any games to my hard drive since then. It always restarts and gets stuck in a loop while installing. The same thing also happens sometimes when I try to download
 new downloadable content, or re-download downloadable content that I originally bought when I had my previous two XBoxes.</p>

<p>So whatever, I just won't install games to my hard drive anymore, no big deal, right? Except starting about five days ago, my XBox will seemingly restart at random. Or if I have been playing one game and switch to another, it will restart when I try to start
 the next game and then get stuck in another loop. I really wasn't sure what to do, so I went through every single thing showing on my hard drive, to see if there was some corrupted something-or-other that was messing things up. But I found nothing.</p>

<p>So I decided to just try something, and I removed the hard drive while the system was stuck in one of the restarting loops. It auto-restarted again, and it went straight to the XBox Live Home screen, no problem. I turned it off and reinserted the hard drive,
 turned it back on, stuck in a loop. I removed it, restart, XBL Home screen. I then reinserted the hard drive while it was on the Home screen, and it restarted, and then actually worked, and went to the Home screen again.</p>

<p>That is how I have been playing for almost the past week. If it restarts, I remove and then reinsert the hard drive, and it works until I shut the system off. Then whenever I start it back up, I have to remove and reinsert it. And then just now I was playing
 a game and as soon as I hit the first checkpoint at the very beginning, it restarts and loops. I removed and reinserted it, and the exact same thing happened. I know it's not the game though, because I have played it through before.</p>

<p>So now I'm really at a loss. I have had absolutely zero problems with red lights on either my console or the power pack. The light on the power pack is green when the XBox is on, and amber/orange when I have the console off. The only odd thing I've seen
 is when I power off the console while it's stuck in a loop, the center on/off indicator light will flash once 5-10 seconds after I have turned it off, almost like what happens when you have an active download going even after you shut the system off.</p>

<p>I know from previous research I have done regarding problems I have had with downloadable content that I had bought using one of my previous XBoxes that when I buy something, a license is issued both to my account and to the XBox on which I used to purchase
 it. Since I have amassed four or five hundred licences over the years, I have never gotten around to transferring all of them to my new XBox, so I thought it was worth mentioning in case all of the problems I am having are the result of software errors by
 using downloadable content on my new XBox purchased on my older, now defunct XBoxes. However, that being said, I also have the same problems with my hard drive/console restarting when I play games I never played on a previous XBox.</p>

<p>The only other thing worth mentioning is that I also have Kinect, and when I started having serious issues with the restarting I unplugged it from the USB port on my XBox. It's just a thought, but I didn't know if maybe having the update I downloaded for
 the Kinect in my hard drive but not having the Kinect plugged it might be causing the problems.</p>

<p>Aside from that, I think I have listed all of the things I can think of. All of the hardware I am and have been using is what came with my 360/Kinect. The HDMI cable I use shouldn't be the issue either, as I have switched it out with two other ones I also
 have, and issue persists. My TV is even newer than the XBox, so I don't think there is any problem there either. The console sits on a shelf by itself with plenty of room around it, my apartment it kept quite cool, and I can hear/feel the fan(s) going inside
 the XBox, so I don't think it's an overheating problem either.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance, and sorry for the long post. I wanted to be thorough.</p>

<p>You pretty much answered your own question. If you have a thumb drive what i want you to do is take out your hard drive insert your thumb drive and turn the Xbox on. Then install Mass Effect 3 on the Thumb Drive. If there is no problem. Then you have a faulty
 hard drive and if it is still under warranty send it in for repair. If not you need to get a new hard drive. In the mean time just use your Thumb Drive as your main Hard Drive until you get a new HDD. I pretty much can guarantee this is your problem. But you
 have to check it with a thumb drive to be sure. Also I appreciate your thoroughness but you might want to keep the posts a little shorter because people will not take the time to read a post that big and that is why you have received no replies. Please keep
 us updated. Good Luck</p>

The first one Couldn't speak out of it then the ear **** started to fall off (saw ALOT of people online with this problem). The second one was the same as the first only it didn't fall apart. I called Gamestop and the man was nice enough tobreplace the headset even tho it was past the 1 month period. The 3rd one is another common problem ALOT of people have, it's doing what it does to my friend the same thing but the different ear. The volume in the left ear is louder and the right went down so now it goes to a unbearable sound and throws me off in my games and I can't stand it I plug

    <title>Microsoft Wedge Mouse Gestures Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> f0ccus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Wedge Mouse Gestures Update</h2>
                    <p>I'm in desparate need of a new mouse to use with my Asus N61-vg. The trackpad is driving me up the wall without the correct drivers, even after trying every driver I could find that would install. Im looking at the wedge mouse which was released fairly recently
 but Microsoft left out the gestures?!!?<u> Is this mouse going to get a firmware update, or some type of update for the computer to enable gesutres</u>? If not, im looking at the Logitech T-620 which has all gestures enabled from the get-go</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any insight greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            Yes, I agree I the Microsoft Wedge Touch mouse should support gestures asap or at least more touch based functions. It is supposed to be designed for Windows 8 touch screen PC's and other Microsoft mice have been upgraded for gesture support, but what
 about my $70 wedge mouse?<br />
Common Microsoft! <br />

            I am considering returning the stupid Wedge Touch mouse. No multi-touch, no gesture support and no middle button. Since this is a touch mouse, Microsoft can basically provide every possible imaginable functions but no.... it just a dull mouse.... well
 except for the small size.<br />

            I ended up skipping the Wedge mouse and ended up picking up the Logitech T620... I have not been disappointed. Gestures are smooth and the mouse has some nice weight to it when both batteries are installed (1AA battery works as well for a lighter mouse).
 Only downside is that it isn't Bluetooth and the included micro adapter is only compatible with other Logitech products, so it takes up 1/3 usb ports on my laptop with another usb port taken by the Microsoft arc keyboard adapter.

            <p>I agree that the Wedge mouse should support gestures.&nbsp; I've been using the Touch mouse at home, and I've repurposed the two-finger-right gesture to pull up the open applications side-bar in Windows 8.&nbsp; So with the two figure gestures, I can pull up the left
 bar and the right bar in Windows 8.&nbsp; This makes using Windows 8 on a desktop ***SO*** much easier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without these capabilities, the Wedge mouse is a step backwards.&nbsp; Microsoft needs to address this as soon as possible!</p>

<p>Hi Greg.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for that. I had set up the devices according to those instructions but no joy. I've tried unlinking, uninstalling, reinstalling and relinking my phone &amp; the apps too but no results. I did have Edge Deflector installed, so I'm wondering if that might
 have something to do with it possibly?</p>

            In that case, you can try disabling Edge Deflector and see if it resolves the issue.

            If you had an app installed to deflect from Edge then that seems a prime suspect.  
<br />
<br />Make sure there's no uninstall tool needed to get it all out after uninstall  
<br />
<br />I will walk you through the fixes for Edge to try progressively until it's fixed: 
<br />
<br />Back up your Favorites first in Edge Settings &gt; Import from another Browser &gt; Export to a File.  If it won't open you can reach Favorites to back them up to an HTML file using the tiny app Manage Edge Favorites here:  <a href="http://www.emmet-gray.com/Articles/EdgeManage.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.emmet-gray.com/Articles/EdgeManage.html</a>
<br />
<br />You can reset Edge in Settings&gt;Apps&gt;Apps and Feature, scroll down to Microsoft Edge, highlight it, choose Advanced Options, then Repair, or if that fails, Reset.  
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help then try re-registering the app following Option Two here:  <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re-register-windows-8-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re...</a>
<br />
<br />If necessary you can reinstall it from this link:  <a href="http://www.intowindows.com/how-to-reinstall-microsoft-edge-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intowindows.com/how-to-reinstall-mic...</a>
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help then check the System Files: 
<br /><a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow-to-repair-windows-system-files-2626161" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow...</a>
<br />
<br />I would have several other browsers available to choose from on the Task Bar since Edge is a work in progress and unreliable.  I use Firefox, Edge and Chrome in that order of preference.  You can import Favorites from each other easily in Settings.  
<br />
<br />Edge is being rebuilt right now on the Chrome chassis and will be reissued soon:
<br /><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/faq-edge-chromium" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowscentral.com/faq-edge-chromium</a>
<br />You can test the new Edge and interact with developers with your feedback here:  <a href="https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/en-us/?form=MD18G4&amp;OCID=MD18G4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/en-us/?for...</a>
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  If you will wait to rate my post until we're finished I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi, and thanks for that. I got as far as re-registering Edge, but the commands didn't work both in the command prompt and Powershell...</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ce524edd-9fda-4704-8fbf-3cf8b878800c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ce524edd-9fda-4704-8fbf-3cf8b878800c?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I skipped forward and ran sfc /scannow, which didn't return any errors. Interestingly when I try continue on PC the hourglass appears by the mouse pointer for a few seconds, so something is happening.<br />
</p>
<p>Also Edge Dev Chromium is proving to be very stable for me so far, I've had no real issues with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers.</p>

            Did you copy and paste the exact re-register command into the Command Prompt from Shawn's tutorial?   
<br />
<br /> Try reinstalling Edge next.

            <p>Hi Ankit,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps this will help understand WMI in general: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa394582(v=vs.85).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa394582(v=vs.85).aspx</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In terms of how it can impact troubleshooting, this more specific article may help:
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee692772.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee692772.aspx</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You rebuilt the WMI repository and it now works - I don't see any further impact at this point from the POV of WP.&nbsp; Unless it occurs often, I don't see any impact with WMI either.&nbsp; We sometimes need to do something similar with failures involving Windows
 Update or related products.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The above articles should cover the reasoning or lead you to places where it is covered&nbsp;- or you can try the TechNet and/or MSDN Forums as such information is beyond the scope of the average user of Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

            Hi,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />The crash dump blames multiple device drivers namely Intel WiFi driver and ELAN Touchpad driver.
<br />
<br />
<br />Let us check the Memory.
<br />I suggest you to  Run memory test for at least 8 passes, prefarably Overnight.

<br />
<br />When the test completes post back the Image(You can use your phone's camera).

    <title>Surface Book 2 Blue Screen of Death&#58; Continuous Restart - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> quazihaque  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Book 2 Blue Screen of Death&#58; Continuous Restart</h2>
                    <p>This morning my Surface book 2 suddenly showed the blue screen of death with the following message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Stop Code: driver_irql_not_less_orequal</p>
<p>What failed: nvlddmkm.sys</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has been doing continuous restarts and showing BSOD every time. Only time I could get it to work is when I did hard shutdown by pressing and holding the power button and then detaching the tablet after shutdown.&nbsp;Without the&nbsp;base, there is&nbsp;no BFOD.&nbsp;In
 the update history, I found some updates installed today which may be the cause of this. But I have no idea. Right now, detaching the tablet isn't working either. It just boots the surface book until BSOD appears and reboots it all ore again.&nbsp;The troubleshooting
 screen appears after couple of reboots, but other then wiping the pc, I don't know what else to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a hardware issue? Before this issue started, sometimes the NVIDIA&nbsp;card didn't show up. After detaching and reattaching the tablet, the issue would be resolved. I figured it to be a software issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated. I don't know what to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            I went into Safe Mode and disabled the NVIDIA&nbsp;card from Device Manager. Then the BSOD stopped. But now&nbsp;it seems to be hardware issue&nbsp;as after it boots up, it is switching between tablet and desktop mode continuously. It looks like the connectivity&nbsp;between
 tablet and base is faulty.&nbsp;

<p>Assuming you are talking about a physical Windows 8.1 DVD try ripping the DVD into an ISO file on the host and load that as a virtual DVD instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>VM access to the host's USB can be problematic. Ripping the DVD does two things, verifies the DVD can be read and eliminates USB&nbsp;from the issue.</p>

            Looks like this system is a part of a corporate environment and activated using a KMS server. You need to contact the IT administrator of the Company to fix this.
<br />If this is not a part of a domain or a company, most probably you were sold an illegal version of Windows.

            &lt;snip&gt;I bought new one Asus laptop, so how is this illegal?  &lt;/snip&gt;
<br />
<br />KMS licenses are for use by the company that bought the license, not for resale to the general public (like you).  If the computer you bought has a KMS type license on it, this is an inappropriate use of the license, "illegal".  It is like buying a "knock-off" or "bootleg" copy of any other product (purses or perfume or high fashion) when you thought you were buying the real thing online or in a real store (not when you buy a "Gucci" watch from a street vendor for $25).   The person who made the "copy" and sold it to you is the one who broke the law, but you are stuck with the consequences. In this specific case, the consequence is that your license will expire and you will be forced to pay (again) for a legitimate license. 
<br />
<br />That being said, buying a name brand computer, ie Assus, from a legitimate source it seems unlikely that you have KMS license. 
<br />
<br />I have been seeing a lot of people reporting the same problem. It seems like a "feature" (aka "bug") in Windows.

<h2>            Xbox Gold &#38; Game pass sharing</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I have recently bought a family xbox and I am trying to share Gold and Game pass with my daughter's xbox. What is the best way to set it up?</p>
<p>Xbox 1 has 3 profiles (Wife's, daughter and mine), gold and Game pass.</p>
<p>Xbox 2 has 1 profile (daughter).</p>
<p>I was hoping setting all profiles as home on xbox 1 my daughter would still get use of Gold and Game pass on Xbox 2. But this hasn't happened . Can someone point me in the right direction please.</p>
<p>Many thanks.<br />

            It all works on the downstairs xbox when you switch between profiles. But when my daughter goes on her Xbox in her room she does not have access to gold or game pass anymore. How do I share it to a second xbox?

<p>Hello Uncorkedfish,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for keeping us updated. The account that is sharing Xbox Live Gold and Xbox Game Pass can share the subscriptions to only one Xbox One at a time. Each account can switch their home console only five times per year. The article we provided contains
 more details about the<a href="https://support.xbox.com/games/game-setup/my-home-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> home console feature</a>. The accounts that do not own the subscriptions must all be on the console that has the home console feature enabled.
 We hope this helps.</p>

<p>Note: Once the second console is set as home (your daughters console), only the profile with Live on the first console will be able to play online and play digital purchases or game pass games. The second console can play thsese games online and offline.</p>
<p>

<p>Which profile do you consider your primary profile?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an example, I'll describe how I have it set up in my house with two profiles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On our main Xbox, I have it set as my wife's home Xbox.&nbsp; I'm able to play any games we've purchased as long as I'm online on that console.&nbsp; My wife generally doesn't play there so I'm not sure how that works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On our second Xbox, I have it set as my primary console.&nbsp; This lets my wife play on that console any games that we've purchased digitally.&nbsp; She's also given access to Xbox Gold and Game Pass.</p>

<p>Let me see if I can add to what the others have said and explain it best that I can In this example I will assume your profile is the one with the gold, gamepass subscriptions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>1. No matter what console your profile is signed into you will always be able to use your subscriptions and play ALL digital games that your profile owns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. You can set ONE console at a time as your profiles home console and ALL other profiles on that console will then be able to use your subscriptions and play your digitally bought games.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. You can switch which console you have set as your home console FIVE times a year.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ill use my setup as an example for the next part.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 2 consoles an xbox one S and an Original xbox one I have all the games and Subscriptions on my account&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the S in my living room and the OG one in my bedroom</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the S set as my home xbox and all other profiles on the console can play all my digital games and use my subscriptions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If my wife wants to play any of the games or use the subscription on the OG One in the bedroom she still can but she would need to be signed into my profile at the same time that she is signed into hers. The thing with this is If I were to go the One S in
 the living room and sign in while my wife has my profile signed in in the bedroom it will sign my profile out and kick her off any game or online multiplayer because you can only be signed in on one console at a time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So in your situation you can download you profile to the console that currently just has your daughters profile on it and if she wants to play your games and use your subscription she would need to be signed into your profile at the same time if you keep
 the console with all of the other profiles on it as your home console.</p>

<p>So in this situation, for all 3 of you to have access to Gold and Game pass, with you and your wife sharing Xbox 1 and your daughter having Xbox 2, there a couple of ways you can do this.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. you will need to redeem/purchase the Gold and Game pass subscrptions on/through your daughters profile. Then set Xbox 1 as your daughters home Xbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Continue redeeming/Purchasing Gold and Game pass on which ever account you have been (I will assume yours) then set Xbox 2 as your home Xbox so that your daughter gets to use Gold and Game pass. You will also be able to use Gold and Game pass, the only
 thing to note is that if your wife (on Xbox 1) wants to use Gold and/or Game pass she will need to have your account signed in while she is using Gold and Game pass.</p>

<p>Game Pass itself does not share. The games downloaded from Game Pass do. So the person who owns Game Pass would have to download the games first.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also it's best to create a new thread instead of bumping an old one.&nbsp;</p>

            The drivers do not fully work as they do not provide force feedback, it recognises your steering wheel as a normal controller.

<br />
Worst case scenario, try using a search engine to see if any creative individuals out there found a workaround to the force feedback issue.<br />

I'm running Windows XP SP3 with (2) 256MB RAM sticks on an old eMachines T5026 desk top.&nbsp; I added (2) 1.0 GB RAM sticks to the two open slots and&nbsp;computer wouldn't start.&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried with (1) 1G stick and with (2) 1G sticks and it still won't start.&nbsp; I've tried
 mixing and matching 256's with 1G&nbsp;in every combimation but it won't start.&nbsp; Will only start with one or two 256 sticks.&nbsp; Best Buy only had PC3200 DDR RAM but the spec above states to use PC2700.&nbsp;&nbsp;Geek Squad says PC3200 is OK&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;PC2700.&nbsp; Is this the
 problem or was I supposed to do something besides just insert new RAM?&nbsp; &nbsp;Suggestions welcome.&nbsp; Thanks.

<h2>            1803&#58; takes a little longer to load the welcome screen</h2>
                    <p>In 1803 when starting my device or restarting it, the log in screen takes a tiny bit longer to load then normal. I ran a clean boot and found out that the issue is not there in clean boot. Did check the services one by one in msconfig but didn't solve the
 problem, unless the steps were done wrong. But the Answer Desk agents as well as the level 2 tech couldn't fix the issue. Anyone have a fix for it? I need Microsoft's help on this issue. This happened only in 1803. I suspect it could be a bug.</p>

            Hey PaulPChou,
<br />
<br />I've experienced this at times myself, this could be an issue with the current 1803 build. How long specifically does it take for the log in screen would show up? For me it would take a solid 5-10 seconds before the screen pops up for me.
<br />
<br />Let me know.

            Hi Paul.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Please read Step 4 in the Performance Checklist:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />The advice to disable Startups to test for the culprit and then re-enable them is nonsense.  Almost none of those need to Start with Windows but are freeloaders on resources.  I would turn all of them off except your sync and any scanner that needs to be on standby.  The rest can wait to start when you need them.  And the antivirus should only be Defender for best performance and adequate protection.  Those alone will solve most slow boots.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Paul,
<br />
<br />I haven't experienced it much since the last few reboots (just my luck), probably not much for me to write in the Feedback Hub. If you provide a link to feedback you would make, I would be more than happy to upvote it if it means greater exposure.
<br />
<br />Keep me posted.

            Try resetting your BIOS defaults:

<br />
<br />If that does not work and you have a desktop computer...
<br />
<br />Power down 
<br />Unplug it
<br />Open the system unit
<br />
<br />Remove the CMOS CR-2032 chip
<br />Plug it in, start the machine, wait 10 seconds
<br />
<br />Power down, unplug it, reinstall the CMOS CR-2032 chip
<br />Plug it in again, power up
<br />
<br />It could suggest you need to update your chipset drivers and BIOS. 
<br />I recommend you update the most critical ones:  BIOS, Chipset, Display Driver, Network adapters. 
<br />
<br />Learn to update those:

<br />
<br />What is the exact make and model?
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.

            I am outside now. But talking to a MS agent, he found out that I am using Pentium, which is old school, does not run well with Win. 10. He suggested me to talk to Acer and ask them why the processor is Pentium. Ask them to change it to iCore or replace
 a new device.

            Well, the agent gave you bad information. A computer from September 2017 can't be outdated needing any upgrading. Please ignore the bad advice and attempt the suggestions in my previous reply.

<br />What is the exact make and model?

            I'm referring to the live video being collected.&nbsp; Yes, the movie can be saved on the hard drive and then copied.&nbsp; In the situation of collecting live video in an athletic&nbsp;competition setting, saving to a flash is more desirable so that review of the performance
 can begin ASAP.

            <p>I'm still puzzled about exactly where in the process you are trying to save video to the flash drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you import video from a camcorder, camera, etc. you can specify where the file will be saved.&nbsp; Generally you want it on non-removable storage for the easiest editing and faster, consistent retrieval but I don't see any reason you couldn't have the video
 on a flash drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you are editing your project in Movie Maker, it will look to whatever location you specify.&nbsp; It can read video from a USB drive though, if you don't have the USB always in the drive, the next time you open the project it will be unable to preview the
 movie.&nbsp; It always needs to have direct access to the original source video.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the point where you are saving your final movie, you can save to various locations such as your hard disk, a USB disk, upload to YouTube, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please explain more about the exact steps you are trying.&nbsp; Be specific about which drive letter corresponds to the USB drive, whether it is source video or edited video you are trying&nbsp;to save, what error you get etc.</p>

                    <p>No one of software can't detect my phone. But I found this article:</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome and thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. </span>
</p>
<p><span>We regret the inconvenience caused to you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Initially, I suggest you to perform Soft reset, as it is the same thing as pulling your battery (on devices where that is possible). This method will not remove anything at all from your phone and is completely safe to attempt in any problem
 situation.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you are still facing the same issue, then perform hard reset which will bring your phone back to factory settings, the same state as when the device was first turned on. All apps, messages, media, personal settings, etc. will be removed from the
 phone.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the following article on How to perform soft and hard reset your Windows Phone.
