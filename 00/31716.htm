<h2>            Windows 7 - no text showing on drop down menus</h2>
                    <p>Within the past 3 weeks, I have lost text on the drop down menus. &nbsp;This occurs anywhere that a Windows drop down menu is use, as well as the drop down on Internet Explorer. &nbsp;Text on the tab on IE has enlarged and nothing I do reduces the size. &nbsp;In addition,
 I have Open Office installed and that program has been affected by whatever occurred. &nbsp;When I have a spreadsheet open, the options on the top tool bar (or task bar) to edit, format, etc. do not show as text. &nbsp;Instead there is a large back slash ( &nbsp;/ &nbsp;) &nbsp;and
 when I click on that, the options text appears but in large font size and at an angle in the same direction as the back slash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched and made every change I can imagine, and then some, with no luck in getting either of these corrected. &nbsp;I uninstalled the Open Office program and then downloaded and installed the newest version. &nbsp;The problem is still there. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel like something has been accidentally changed, but am my wits end as to where to go to fix it, especially since I have not text showing on the Windows drop down menus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me out?</p>
<p>

            <p><span>Hello Nanny, </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community Forum.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the description, I understand that you are getting these error message in the event viewer. I will certainly help you with this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>This issue can be caused due to third-party application conflict or system file corruption or corrupted user account.
<span>Let’s try to identify the actual cause and troubleshoot accordingly.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">However, before we proceed I would require some more information to assist you better.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Do you remember making any changes to the system prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to try the following methods:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 1: </span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Step 1:</span> </strong>
<strong>Boot the computer in safe mode and check if the issue persists. </strong>
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let’s boot the computer in Safe Mode and check if issue reappears. Safe mode is a diagnostic mode that starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started. The words&nbsp;<strong>Safe Mode</strong>&nbsp;appear
 in the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode you’re using.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Step 2</span></strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">:</span>
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If issue does not appear in safe mode, there could be possibility of some background programs conflicting with the smooth running of the computer. To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start computer by using a minimal set of
 drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "<strong>clean boot</strong>". A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><em>Note:</em></strong><em> After troubleshooting, refer to this section ‘<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>’.</em></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If the issue still persists, then try method 2.</span></span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 boots to bugged lock screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> saladful  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 boots to bugged lock screen</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've scoured the net without any success, so I figured I might as well go to the source for advice:</p>
<p>
</p><p>First off, I am using Windows 10 Pro N 64 Bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the anniversary update, I have the recurring problem that, despite having autologin activated so that it instantly boots to the desktop of my account, which worked fine before the update, my computer always boots to a lock screen. A bugged lock screen
 I can't get out of.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have, as per usual, the symbols for network, ease of access and shut down/reboot in the lower right corner of the screen and can interact with them normally, but nothing else. No button combination, no mouse movement, nothing works, I'm completely locked
 into that screen, and my only option is to reboot the system, whereupon it boots to my account. This problem occurs every time I turn my computer on, meaning I effectively always have to boot it twice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said, this problem only popped up after the anniversary update and has been annoying me to no end ever since.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried disabling the lock screen through various ways (custom task, registry changes, etc.), with no success. I've tried creating a new user and deleting the old one, with no success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I couldn't find a solution to my problem, but have found other people with the same issue, so apparently I'm not even a unique case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, any ideas? The only solution left I can think of would be a complete reinstall of the system, which I honestly really don't want to do.</p>
<p />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>We would suggest you to try the following methods and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>To diagnose whether this issue occurs in<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>“Safe Mode”</strong>, let’s reboot the computer in safe mode and check if the issue appears there as well. Click this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> to boot the system in safe mode.</span></span><br />
</p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>We would suggest you to<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>perform a<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>“Startup Repair”</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>using Windows 10 bootable DVD or USB drive and check if that helps. Initiating repair from CD/DVD may have different results
 than earlier since the source of boot is different now. So, we would suggest to perform the repair again and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If you don’t have the bootable DVD or USB drive, please refer to the steps in the article given below to create one and then follow the steps given below.</span></span></p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Create installation media for Windows 10</a>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>Once you have made the bootable USB or DVD drive, please follow the steps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p><span>Insert the&nbsp;<strong><span>installation DVD or USB</span></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>and boot Windows 10 from it.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>In the&nbsp;<strong><span>‘Windows setup’</span></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>page, select the<strong>&nbsp;‘<strong><span>language to install’</span></strong></strong>, ‘<strong><span>Time and currency format’ and the ‘keyboard or input method’ and click on ‘next’.</span></strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Click on&nbsp;<strong><span>‘Repair your computer’</span></strong>&nbsp;and select&nbsp;<strong><span>‘Troubleshoot’.</span></strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Click on&nbsp;<strong><span>‘Advanced options’ and select ‘Automatic Repair’</span></strong>&nbsp;and select the operating system.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>You might also require to change the boot priority in BIOS in order to allow the computer to boot from CD/DVD.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Important</span></strong><span>: While scanning the hard drive if any bad sectors are found, the scanner tries to repair that sector, any data available on that might be lost.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot
 guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. Do get back to us should you need further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<h2>            Updating Windows10</h2>
                    <p>My Acer Aspire SW3-013 is X86-based and has Windows 10 Home version 10.0.14393 build 14393 installed.&nbsp; The problem is that it "refuses" to install the actual update.&nbsp; When this happens then&nbsp;it show a message "ask the PC supplier if it is possible to upgrade
 the system BIOS"</p>
<p>The installed BIOS seem to be INSYDE Corp. V1.02, 2015-03-09.</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to Acer support information it is possible to update to BIOS 2.05 but there is a warning that if the update fails for any reason PC may end up&nbsp;as "useless".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question:&nbsp;&nbsp; which are the detailed&nbsp;correct steps to take for&nbsp;updating the PC BIOS?&nbsp;&nbsp; Something special to avoid?&nbsp; &nbsp;Is the BIOS update procedure described in some manual?</p>

    <title>Rotation of laptop disables trackpad and keyboard even with tablet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> culmanblack  say:</h3>
<h2>            Rotation of laptop disables trackpad and keyboard even with tablet mode turned off</h2>
                    <p>Ok so, I have an HP spectre x360 with windows 10 on it. It is a 2 in 1 laptop that has touchscreen capabilities. Normally if I rotate my computer or flip the screen it will automatically switch to tablet mode, which is fine. But, for example, if I want to
 watch a show in bed and lay on my side I like to put my computer on its side as well without going into tablet mode so I can still use the trackpad and keyboard. So I change the setting to not switch the computer to tablet mode and I also have autorotation
 set to off, so the screen will stay it its normal configuration. When I turn the computer to the side the screen stays the same (which is what I want) and it does not switch to tablet mode (which is also what I want), BUT windows disables both my trackpad
 and my keyboard while the computer is sideways (90 degrees) like it thinks I'm in tablet mode when I'm really not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Essentially, I want my computer to act like a normal laptop without a bunch of auto-rotates and tablet modes for the time that I am in bed and then be able to switch back so that I can lay on my side with my computer at a 90 degree angle and nothing changes.
 And so far, everything seems to work other than windows disabling my trackpad and keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also a little clarification, if tablet mode is set to turn on when I rotate the computer, if I turn tablet mode OFF while the computer is still in its rotated position the keyboard and trackpad stay disabled. They will not become enabled until the laptop
 is in an upright position again.</p>

            <p>I have the same annoyance with the same laptop, a Spectre 13 x360. I have found a workaround that I can live with, although it is far from ideal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When in normal laptop mode (device orientation&nbsp;should be as a normal laptop), I go into&nbsp;the Device Manager and I disable the orientation sensors. On my unit this is under System devices the "Intel(R) Integrated Sensor Solution". In practice this now locks&nbsp;the
 unit&nbsp;in laptop mode. When I want its normal behavior back, I enable the device again in Device Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A word of caution: I'm sure HP did not mean for this device to be disabled and enabled all the time, so&nbsp;I'm not sure this is a good idea, it just works for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For whomever is interested in the cause:<br />
This is not a Windows problem, the problem is unique to this HP. The sensors in the HP can sense orientation of the laptop as well as the angle on the hinges of the screen. These sensors together drive 2 things: the switch to tablet mode, and the disabling
 of keyboard and touchpad. These 2 things are driven separately and independently, which is the problem: if you overrule tablet mode because you want to stay in laptop mode, you are still left with a rotated screen and a disabled keyboard/touchpad... It would
 have been much more useful&nbsp;to me if the sensors would drive the switch to tablet mode (which I can as a user agree to or not) and then the switch to tablet mode triggers the disabling of keyboard and touchpad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was almost a deal breaker for me, I had almost returned the laptop before I found this workaround.<br />
Hope this is useful for someone else.</p>

    <title>laptop won&#39;t complete upgrade to Win10, error 8000700 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> upwoods2  say:</h3>
<h2>            laptop won&#39;t complete upgrade to Win10, error 8000700</h2>
                    <p>The error points to an admin/permissions error, also subinacl, but I've gone through all the tips and nothing's changed. &nbsp;I talked w/MS' upgrade support and he remotely did some things I'd done before (SFC for example) but still no joy. &nbsp;This laptop was
 upgraded from Win7 to 8.1.<br />
</p>
<p>I've tried using the Get Win 10 link, downloaded the install to USB, and tried the Media Creation tool to install. &nbsp;Same failure point with all three.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions? &nbsp;Thanks!</p>

            <p>Andre, I followed your instructions, there was just the briefest flash of a DOS box and then back to the desktop.<br />
</p>
<p>After the reboot I ran the upgrade assistant and it said it was checking for updates, but continuously restarted about every 11 seconds. &nbsp;It was impossible to kill with the task manager as another instance popped up.</p>
<p>

            I'll add that after chatting w/MS tech support and his remoting into my pc and running a few things (incl SFC /scannow) he gave me a link to a special version of the W10 install to download that should override the problems. &nbsp;Haven't been able to run it
 yet but should do so in the next day or two.

            <p>Thanks for the various suggestions, but something was majorly goofed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After several online sessions w/Microsoft I was given a link to a (supposedly) special ISO file, which I downloaded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Worked FINE!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Had a problem with another computer that was stuck during the upgrade and that ISO file solved the problem there as well.<br />
<br />
SO if you're having problems, go to MS' ISO file page and download what you need.</p>

    <title>Xbox 360 Adapter Unknown USB Device - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jaxic  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox 360 Adapter Unknown USB Device</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently purchased an Xbox 360 controller adapter for use on my windows 10 PC. Right from the start I had to google multiple methods to stop the adapter from being recognized as a USB instead of an 'other' device. This was so i could manually install
 the Xbox 360 peripherals driver. When this all works the adapter is functional and i can play all games perfectly. However, ever since then every time i plug in the adapter (no matter what USB) it is shown as an Unknown USB Device (Device Descriptor Request
 Failed). I have tried so many methods and it seems to be a complete lottery as to whether it will work or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is going on!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>

            Looking at the information I have please follow these steps to see if it solves the issue:
<br />
<br />With the adapter plugged:
<br />1- Right click the windows icon on the task bar and click device manager.
<br />2- Look for the device that should appear as unknown like you said.
<br />3- Right click the device and click properties. Go to the driver tab.
<br />4- Click update driver, then click "browse my computer for driver software".
<br />5- Click the option "Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer"
<br />6- Go to the bottom of the list you should see xbox 360...click on it.
<br />7- Click the xbox 360 Wireless Receiver for Windows.
<br />8- After installation is done test by turning on the receiver, and finish by turning the xbox controller on.
<br />
<br />Hope that solves your issue.

<p>This works well when i plug in the adapter and it comes up as other devices in the device manager however now whenever i plug it in it comes up under Universal Serial Bus Controllers which means that when i follow your instructions xbox 360 is not there.
 The only one option which does nothing when clicked on.</p>

            Sorry for the misinformation. Go to device manager, locate the device; you said it appears on the universal serial bus controller. Right click it and select update driver software. 
<br />
<br />The driver is the program that talks between the hardware and the operating system.

            That driver is the most recent to date, and should help it fix the problems: when updating the driver. First download the driver and then through device manager when you click the universal serial bus and click update you can look for the file in your computer which you downloaded previously.

            Hi ElfLyle,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Let's first rule out whether the keyboard hardware is an issue or not. Can you use Keyboard tester and press keys to see if the keys are working correctly or not? If keys work as intended, then problem is not the hardware of Keyboard.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://keyboardtester.co/keyboard-tester.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://keyboardtester.co/keyboard-tester.html</a>
<br />
<br />If no hardware issue - Please try these options one by one and check after each option. 
<br />
<br />1. Till your problem is resolved and you need to do urgent and limited typing, use Onscreen Keyboard - Type OSK in Windows Start Search Box (Cortana) &gt; Click On-Screen Keyboard
<br />
<br />2. Run Keyboard Troubleshooter
<br />Type Troubleshoot in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Scroll down and click Keyboard &gt; Run the troubleshooter &gt; Follow onscreen directions
<br />
<br />3. Uninstall &amp; reinstall Keyboard Driver
<br />Windows Key+X (Or right click on Start) &gt; Click Device Manager &gt; Expand Keyboards &gt; Right click on Standard PS/2 Keyboard &gt; Uninstall &gt; Reboot the computer to reinstall 
<br />
<br />4: Turn off filter keys in Ease of Access
<br />Type ease in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Ease of Access &gt; Click Make the Keyboard easier to use &gt; Ensure Turn on filter Keys is not checked

            Hi ElfLyle 
<br />
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App 
<br />
<br />Go to Update &amp; Security - Troubleshoot 
<br />
<br />Run the Keyboard troubleshooter 
<br />
<br />
<br />If that does not resolve this for you 
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager 
<br />
<br />Expand the Keyboards section 
<br />
<br />Right click your keyboard and choose 'Uninstall' 
<br />
<br />Then restart your PC
<br />
<br />
<br />If the keyboard is still not working, try to source an external keyboard for a couple of minutes and see if that works when connected to your laptop . . .

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>1.What is the make and model of the computer?</p>
<p>2.Which security software is installed on the computer?</p>
<p>3.Did you make any changes to the computer recently?</p>
<p>4.What is the exact and complete error message you get?</p>
<p>5.Do you have service pack 3 update installed?</p>
<p>6.What were the steps tried by the ATT technician?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b> Disable the security software temporarily.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you should not disable your antivirus software. If you do have
 to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network during the time your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b> Follow the steps:</p>
<p><b>Step 1:</b> Boot the computer in safe mode with networking and check if the issue persists.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Step 2:</b> If the issue does not persists in safe mode with networking, perform a Clean Boot
<span>&nbsp;</span>to see if there is any software conflict as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> After performing the troubleshooting steps in clean boot, follow
<b>Steps to configure Windows to use a Normal startup state</b> section from the link to return the computer to
<b>Normal startup mode</b>.</p>
<p>After you used the clean boot to resolve the problem, you can follow these steps to configure Windows XP to start normally.</p>
<p>a) Click <b>Start</b>,
<b>run</b>.</p>
<p>b) Type <b>msconfig</b>, and then click OK.</p>
<p>c) The System Configuration Utility dialog box is displayed.</p>
<p>d) Click the <b>
General tab</b>, click <b>Normal Startup</b> - load all device drivers and services, and then click OK.</p>
<p>e) When you are prompted, click Restart to restart the computer.</p>

<h2>            &#39;the default gateway is not available&#39;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi everyone, great forum, I can see this question has been discusse alot and I have tried all the options provided but I am still denied access to the Internet on my relatively new Acer Aspire 5742 laptop.&nbsp;I am no pc tech and find it all very difficult and
 would love to be able to correct the problem myself as I cant afford to take it to a repairer. &nbsp;We have had no problem with access on our PC and the laptop worked fine originally and has now all of a sudden it says the laptop is connected to the internet but
 no access.&nbsp; I have tried as outlined in the forum - disabling 'Bonjour', troubleshooting, disabling and renabling the network adapters (which are Broadcom 802.11n Network Adapter and Broadcom Netlink (TM) Gigabit Ethernet and both working properly), automatic
 startup for dhcp &amp; wired auto config.</p>
<p>The wireless network connection - unidentified network</p>
<p>The local area connection - network cable unplugged&nbsp; ?????????!!!</p>
<p>Does anyone have any suggestions as Im sure it is something simple but Im just too dumb with computers :))</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Try the steps listed below:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1</span></strong><span>: Manually assign
 the default gateway and the IP address and check if it works fine. Before assigning the IP address and the Default gateway manually, make<br />
a note of the IP address on the computer. To do this open Command prompt and type<strong>ipconfig
</strong>and press enter. This will display the IP address, make a note of it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;To assign the IP address and default gateway manually, follow the steps below:<br />
a. In system tray, right click network icon. Choose Open Network and Sharing Center.<br />
b. Right click on Local Area Connection and click on Properties. c. Double click Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) and assign the IP address manually.<br />
Example: Old Ip address is 192.168.0.1<br />
Change the IP address to 192.168.0.50<br />
d. Let the Subnet mask and default gateway be the same.<br />
Subnet mask = 255.255.255.0<br />
Default gateway, usually would be 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1<br />
e. Click on Apply and Ok and restart the computer and verify if it helps to fix the issue.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span> If disabling and
 re-enabling Network adapter did not fix the issue, then I would suggest you to completely uninstall and reinstall network adapters.</span></p>

<h2>            Xbox Live- Free Online Games</h2>
                    Are you really that money hungry to be the only platform out there that makes there players pay for free online games? PlayStation lets their players play free online games, so does Nintendo, mobile, and etc. It is really fustrating because what if you
 bought something in the free online game and then you lost your gold membership right after you bought it and you cant buy gold because you have no more money. In my opinion, this puts all other platforms above you because they are not that M O N E Y H U N
 G R Y. We were able to play some online mmo games before without gold but no we cant anymore. Can you guys please support me so this gets Microsofts attention?

<p>This is how its always been on xbox and i don't see that ever changing in the future.</p>

</p><p>Xbox gold memberships can also be purchased far cheaper if you shop around through local/online stores rather than buying directly through your console.<br />

            I'm sorry but the live gold didn't have many variations. Since he was born. Just because fortnite or apex in other platforms won't pay it. So let's talk about it since the other two companies are charging a bang of money for games that don't give them
 the slightest. Compared to Xbox that gives it to you, just because you want something for free. A multitude of people work here. Do they have to live?

            You can not put all other platforms just by not charging to play online in free games, Microsoft offers the best services for Xbox, such as EA Access and Game Pass, where you can test EA games before they are released, taking discounts on those games,
 and even play them as a complete game when you enter the catalog, in Game Pass you play Microsoft games at launch, no other company does this, other than that it has many other games from other companies in Game Pass, without counting of Live Gold that offers
 the best stability when compared to other consoles, outside the support, service and purchasing policies of Microsoft that is much better than other companies, will not be charged to play online in free games that will make the company be bad or not, will
 be what it offers and how it offers.

            Actually, Microsoft's system is the most fair. It's fair to players, since everyone contributes to the services. It's fair to developers, since publishers can release a game using the business model of their choosing (either full-featured at retail price,
 or "free" with microtransactions) and still be on a level playing field.<br />
<br />
Since it is free, let us know how your Internet provider reacts when you ask for free access to play your "free" game. Hope it goes well!

            You have to pay to play online on Playstation as well. One game is the exception and that was up to the game devs. People work hard to provide a service. maintaining multiplayer features is a lot of work. Those people deserve to be paid no?&nbsp;

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Need Split window view for Electron as well. But here are some important issues I have, some of these are from an accessibility perspective - screen reader issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Home and end keys don't work in conversations list and messages list. I reported this on this forum and in feedback hub way back in 8.25 and it remains an issue. This is both in 8.33 now and in the uwp 14 version. Worse, the jump to last message button
 when pressed with the space bar or enter key doesn't actually do what it says. The keyboard focus in the list of messages remains exactly where it was.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>2. Need to make it so the delete button deletes conversations. It takes a lot of time to leave and delete conversations right now mostly because of my below reported problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>3. When you hit the context menu key while in the conversations list and pick leave group, the group jumps to the top of the conversations list. In Skype 7.40, it stayed where it was and focus remained on it, so hitting context key a second time and selecting
 hide was a snap, or just pressing delete on it for that matter. Context key, then l to leave, then delete was all it took. This is made simpler by yet another ability that 7.40 has that is missing, see below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>4. Need to make it possible to stop getting the delete/leave/hide confirmations. In 7.40, there was a check box for these prompts to have them stop appearing and just do it. In 8.33, there is no checkbox and one has to tab to the delete / leave / confirmation
 buttons on these dialogues and hit space. What's worse, when you leave a group, keyboard focus doesn't return to the conversations list after you hit the button to confirm your action. You have to shift+tab once to land back in the conversations list, and
 then your focus is no longer on that group, because that group has gone to the top of the list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So far, this is all common sense stuff that works well in 7.40 that would be extremely nice not to lose. We're trying to get conversation management not to be such a pain in the neck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Get the "automatically adjust microphone settings" checkbox in 8.33 to actually work. I have disabled this feature (it is enabled by default). With it disabled, I go to my system's microphone gain slider and put focus in it and just leave it sitting there
 while I talk. As I talk or other sounds around me present themselves, the slider jumps all over the place. With Skype 7.40 if I set it not to adjust the mic level, the system level is not moved. 7.40 does however still gain up and down a little somehow using
 an internal gain, it just has a limit as to how much it can do. In this way, you can set your system level pretty low so that 7.40 is unable to get really loud. The goal here for the common use case is to get it to let you set it if you know what you're doing
 so that it won't gain up for background noise, as this kind of thing is rude when in a group if you for instance walk away and have a discussion with someone else for a couple minutes. You really don't want it to gain up and get really loud, which is exactly
 what it does right now.</p>
<p>Put simply, there's a bug where disabling microphone adjustment doesn't actually do so, please fix. I reported that back in 8.25 and&nbsp; it remains here in 8.33. More frustratingly, I reported here and in feedback hub and via accessibility contact. I did everything
 I know how. I want to help ensure people aren't losing too much. Many of us don't care about all the new stuff, we just want what used to work to continue to work as well as it did, and we have a hard time not being rude about it because we're being forced
 to lose valuable aspects of the program that some of us have sunk money into over the years for subscriptions and the like.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The refreshing thing is, I think it can happen, just it hasn't been bothered with so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. add more keyboard shortcuts. This isn't present in 7.40 either so I can't claim 8.33 will be regressing to lack this, but given the way the interface adds extra buttons depending on which chat is in focus or whether message suggestions are enabled now
 that turn up in the tab order between the message list and the edit box, we really need a way to jump keyboard focus into the messages list, and preferably another one to jump focus into the input edit box to type a chat or, perhaps if we start typing while
 not in the input edit box if one is open, focus jumps to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All this said, I do want to say that it's obvious some effort has gone into making things work reasonably well. The escreen reader messages are a nice touch for instance, but we very much need to fix actual non accessibility specific regressions like the
 microphone adjustment I mentioned, and to get keyboard focus issues sorted. Assume that I'm not messing with my screen reader's virtual cursor when encountering issues here. That won't be affecting my experience because I have been leaving it off so I access
 the skype interface directly rather than relying on a specialized view which presents its own challenges.</p>

            Did the update correct the inability in Skype 8 to see and call your contacts directly out of Skype?&nbsp; That functionality was in 7 and I have NOT yet upgraded to 8 due to the fact that the original 8 release removed this functionality.&nbsp; Since I have over
 4k contacts in Outlook and use them for conference calls on Skype, etc. not having my outlook contacts in Skype and no easy way to xfer / sync outlook contacts to Skype address book has prevented me from updating before I know this functionality was reapplied
 to V8.&nbsp; I run Outlook&nbsp; thru Office 365 (so the latest version of Outlook) on Windows 10.&nbsp; Several threads of complaints back in Aug 2018 when V8 was pushed on Skype users but nothing addressing it since in the Forum that I could find...&nbsp; Tnx.

    <title>Restore Normal Startup in Msconfig - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> grandpa jim  say:</h3>
<h2>            Restore Normal Startup in Msconfig</h2>
                    <p>A Microsoft tech disabled a service (Comcast Backup and Share). I reenabled it from the Services module and it shows it as running. But it does not appear in the Notification area, unless and until I open it from the Start menu. I have not been able to get
 it to load automatically as it used to. When I start the program from the Start menu, the icon appears in the Notification Area. Before, that icon appeared there every time the computer was started.</p>
<p>Here's the baffling part. In Msconfig, Selective Startup is checked. I uncheck it, but each time I go back to Msconfig it is checked.<br />
Under the Startup tab, the item Secure Backup and Share is unchecked and shows that it was disabled on 9/27 at 8AM. That is when it was disabled. There is no option to reenable it. I check the box next to it and then close MSconfig. I've closed with and without
 clicking Apply. Under the Selective Startup tab, Load System Services is checked, but the box Load Startup items is "filled in." I have also tried checking that box and then Apply. Whatever I do, when I reboot, the settings are the same. I'm at a loss as to
 how to get that service to start on boot and to appear in the Notification area as it used to before the MS technician changed it. Or to&nbsp;get Normal Startup to stay.</p>
<p>Addendum: After hours of playing with Msconfig, and going back and forth between my desktop and my laptop, I finally managed to clear the offending "disabled" service and get Msconfig to return to Normal Startup. Wow!</p>

            <p>&nbsp;The duplicate entries in msconfig are nothing to worry about; uninstalling fails to remove the old entry, but that's normal.&nbsp; I'm not 100% certain about the PIDs, but I doubt if that's a problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;One other thing you might try would be to use System Restore to go back to before all your troubles started.&nbsp; Of course you'd need to reinstall anything you'd installed between now and the date you restored back to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Personally I much prefer to back up to an external hard drive.&nbsp; You can buy a 1 TB one these days for $50 or a 2 TB one for $80.&nbsp; Then I use a commercial program to do a full system backup.&nbsp; This gives me the ability to restore individual files or my whole
 system in about 20 minutes.&nbsp; </p>

    <title>How to turn on and lock FN key - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aliawwad  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to turn on and lock FN key</h2>
                    <p>Hello;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Surface Book 2 15-in, and I am trying to lock the FN Key (and keep it turned on) at least until next restart. I want this because the event when&nbsp; the key turned on, its light goes off if the keyboard in not being used for some seconds. so this makes
 confusion since when I want to press f5 for example but the fn key light is off I come to think it is completely off and not just the light. I use the function keys way more than using sound/screen keys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried press and hold for 15 seconds (even 30 seconds), tried to hold the key+caps as some other posts suggested but apparently it only works on surface pro devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the device has all the latest updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi Ali,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best way to turn on the keyboard backlight, without pressing a key, is to quickly touch the touchpad, the keyboard backlight will resume and you will be able to tell if the Fn LED is lit or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding your second concern of not wanting to press the FN key in order to use the F1-F12 keys, unfortunately, it is not how it was designed.&nbsp; Even with the first Surface Book, you would need to press the FN key in order to use the F1-F12 key functions.</p>

<p>Thank you for the information you've provided. </p>

</p><p>One possible cause of the C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\cmd.exe error is you've installed a third-party software. This software may cause system performance issues as well. To resolve these, please check

<h2>            Lost product key, installed new hard drive, how do I move forward</h2>
                    I recently had to replace a hard drive on a laptop of mine. It had Windows 7 Home Premium installed on it. I did not have a recover disk, I was hoping to simply install Windows 7 again on it, but sadly the sticker on the bottom of computer is quite worn
 and much of the product key is unreadable. Does anyone have any thoughts or suggestions for potentially getting through this installation? I'm hoping it's not just a complete wash.

            <p>Your best option is to request recovery media from the manufacturer of your computer and use that to reinstall Windows 7 Home Premium. This will exempt the need to enter a product key.</p>

                    The weather gadget on my computer will not allow me to set my home location so that I can get to my local weather, no matter what steps I have done that I have researched online or what my computer tells me to do, it still will not allow me to use current
 location or to find any locations either. What do I do? I just want my local weather.

<p>The Windows 7 operating system is nearly a decade old, and the server that powers the Weather gadget has been shutdown.&nbsp; To continue getting such services, you need to update to Windows 8 or 10 (your choice).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, your only option is to use another program to do the same job, such as RainMeter Desktop Gadgets or just bookmarking your favorite weather website.</p>
