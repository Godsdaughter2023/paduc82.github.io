<h2>            How to reinstate sympatico email or transfer it to the outlook domain</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We left Bell Sympatico 2 months ago but continue to use our email account through the live server. However recently the account was closed by automated spam filters. We did not produce any spam activity and did not share our password with anybody.
</p>
<p>The support team tried to reinstate it, but did not succeed. After explaining the situation, that sympatico may be the reason, the support team advised us to make inquiry in this forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, is that possible to reinstate the sympatico email or transfer it to outlook domain? It would be good to keep our name.</p>
<p>There is no address with our name in outlook domain. (We sent the test email and got an error that there is no such address).</p>
<p>Or the best thing we can do is creating the new address?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot for your help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Wanikiya &amp; Dyami,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We left Bell Sympatico from Oct 23, 2014. Now we have Rogers.</p>
<p>But the email *** Email address is removed for privacy *** was hosted in MS domain from 2001.</p>
<p>Now&nbsp; we configured the outlook express through</p>
<p>pop3.live.com and smtp.live.com instead of sympatico and it worked perfectly for 2 months.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When our account *** Email address is removed for privacy *** was closed on Dec 22, 2014 we filled online form (Microsoft support) with request to recover the account and received response from</p>
<p>Microsoft Customer Support <span>(*** Email address is removed for privacy ***)</span></p>
<p><span>that account was reinstated, but it was not.</span>We contacted this address (Microsoft support) and they advised to ask in your forum.</p>
<div><span>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>We'll be fine even if not reinstate *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. We have all data saved in the outlook express.
</p>
<p>We just want to save our name we@***. We read that all hotmail addresses converted to our outlook addresses automatically. Is that possible to convert *** Email address is removed for privacy *** to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. There is no address *** Email address is removed for privacy ***
</p>
<p>(We sent test message to <span>
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** and it was returned like failed address)</span></p>
<p><span>but the system does not allow to create it.</span></p>
<p>

            Hi Don, thanks for the reply. I am trying out the Technical preview. I think I may have the wrong site for these problems. I just found a place to turn off a filter and now the keyboard seems to be working. I posted from a Linux computer earlier today,
 because &nbsp;I could not type with this one. I removed the updates and this PC still could not type normal. Real slow and had to hold the key down to type the letter. I read where someone said something about a keyboard filter. I found that and turned the filter
 what ever that is off. I have the latest build on here right now. Hopefully the keyboard will work and I can use the feed back for this new OS. Thanks, and should have told you more so you could have helped. Sorry about that, Larry

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to add a category like the one which is already defined as "sensitive information types" in classification option in office 365. If there is , How is it done and how can someone add the contents (like the ones which are in sensitive information
 types) &nbsp;which will then be used when setting up DLP policies</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can &nbsp;I create classification group with options like security level, information classification etc</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help on these will be much appreciated. I have checked all options available in office 365 e5 version but couldn't find any which shows how to add the mentioned above</p>

<p>Hi ibrahimkajeri,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From my experience, you can define your own DLP templates and information types and import the custom DLP policy template to Office 365. For the detailed steps, please refer to the following two articles:</p>
<p><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj674310(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj674310(v=exchg.150).aspx</a></p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding “classification group”, please let me know why you want to create it. And what is “security level”, security group?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Gary &nbsp;</p>

    <title>Date formatting, moving excel file from Windows to Mac - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Date formatting, moving excel file from Windows to Mac</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I hope someone may help with my issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I often switch between a Windows computer (Win 7 Pro, with MS Office 365 ProPlus) at work and Mac at home (Mac OS Sierra 10.12.4, with MS Office 2016 Home for Mac, Excel version 15.32).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have problems with dates not showing correctly after using the Text formula for formatting dates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First I will paste pictures of the windows excel screen and windows regional settings:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Figure1: Windows Excel Text Format Example:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6eee54a4-954b-406c-beb4-2b48928748ad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6eee54a4-954b-406c-beb4-2b48928748ad" /></a></p>

<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2511b7a6-2242-4e78-be34-2d34f9a20388" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2511b7a6-2242-4e78-be34-2d34f9a20388" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Next I post the same Excel calculations and regional settings for Mac OS:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Figure3: Mac Excel Text Format Example, same formulas as Figure1 but used on a Mac:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/851bf9fc-cd10-4e0c-be1c-7de42f58b7ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/851bf9fc-cd10-4e0c-be1c-7de42f58b7ca" /></a></p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Figure 1 and 3 are supposed to come out identical, but do not. Both the Windows and the Mac computers have English Installations with Norwegian local settings for formatting. Thus the names for formulas in Excel are English, but semicolon is used as separators
 in the formulas. Also, the windows PC uses the "å" short form for formatting of year (å=år stand for year in English).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Line 5 in Figure 1 and 3 shows an identical date value, but after formatting with the Text formula in line 6, the output on the Mac computer is wrong and suddenly outputs the word "Sunday" instead of "2017". Why does this happen?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For illustration, I have also created two additional alternatives in Figure 1 and 3, showing that text formatting with "yyyy" for year does not work on either computers, and lastly that the unknown parameter "eeee" will show correct year output on both computers...
 I do not know what the "eeee" value stands for, but wonder if I am forced to use this value (undocumented in Excel help as far as I can see) as this works for both computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could anyone please help to identify why the formula "=TEXT(B5; "mmm. åååå")" does not work when moving an excel file from windows PC to Mac OS computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate any insights :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Knut</p>

<p>Thanks Knut - I looked at your spreadsheet and I think a good workaround would be to stop using the TEXT function to format the values. &nbsp;Instead, I think you can just calculate the actual date values and use Number Formatting to get the desired format regardless
 of whether you open on Mac or Windows and regardless of the computer's Location/Region setting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would take more detailed investigation, but I suspect that the problem here is just incompatibility between MacOS and Windows with regard to the date format codes for Norway regions. In the attached screen shots from Windows and Mac, you can see that
 the format code for year differs between MacOS and Windows. The format code is within the double-quotes in the TEXT function, which means it's not stored as one of Excel's internal format codes. &nbsp;So I believe Excel needs to ask MacOS, "what is the code used
 to indicate the year (in the current region)?" &nbsp;MacOS responds with ïïïï, and Excel checks to see if part of your format code matches. &nbsp;Since Excel finds&nbsp;åååå rather than ïïïï in the format argument of the TEXT function, it treats it as text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead of using the TEXT function, if you calculate the date, and then use Number Format to set the date format, Excel should always be able to show the proper format regardless of OS and regardless of Region. &nbsp;So if you create the workbook in Norway and
 share it with someone in an English locale, it will still show the desired format, even if the characters used in that region are different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To summarize, I recommend only using the TEXT function in cases where you need to concatenate some other text to the date. For example, if you want to say "Today is " &amp; TEXT(NOW(), "dddd")), you would need to use the TEXT function. If the cell will only
 contain the date, then I would rely on cell number formatting to get the desired format.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">After a lot of tests I found that when we print a document with notes,&nbsp;PowerPoint&nbsp;uses all the machine memory, and at the moment the free memory usage reach the 96-97%, the app stops printing. Tried with a 64Bit machine and 8GB
 of memory and the behavior is the same. It prints more pages but when the memory usage is around the 97% it stops.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Giving error message, We found a problem with printer setup and couldn’t print</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">This only happens when printing the PPT with notes., without notes it prints fine</span><br />
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If we print the full pages (more charged in images) the memory usage stays stable.</span></p>

<h2>            Office 365 Distribution Groups and External Yahoo Emails</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been evaluating 365 for work and one of the things we need is to be able to set up distribution groups that include external email addressees that is restricted to just those email address. This is all working apart from issues with Yahoo email addresses.
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I send a message from a test yahoo account I get the following for the Yahoo account:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock"><span><strong>Your message wasn't delivered because the recipient's mailbox is quarantined.</strong></span></p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
</p><p class="contentCodeblock"><span>And this for a test hotmail account</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>(BAY004-MC6F1) Unfortunately, messages from (104.47.0.108) on behalf of (yahoo.com) could not be delivered due to domain owner policy restrictions.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The messages are delivered to all of the other tests from the email accounts set up in the group just the Yahoo account seems to be a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been looking all morning for a way to resolve the issue and thought I'd ask the question here. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

                    <p>word 365 for mac working in a table --regardless of what I do I cannot underline one cell while the other cells I can underline--I work with financial tables in word-Seems like I am always having problems with table formatting--especially underlines for
 cells -- I know how to underline as you can see from the image included--but sometimes no matter what I do the underline for the cell will not work---also wondering if maybe the purchased word is better than word 365--and difference? Used to work great when
 I was using the PC version!! and even the older 2007 version,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this table the 537 should also be underlined but no matter what I do--it will not show--any ideas????</p>

            Hi,
<br />
<br />Distinguish between Borders (a cell attribute) and underlining, a font attribute.
<br />
<br />In some ways, Word 2019/365 on the Mac is still trying to catch up to Word 2007 on the PC.
<br />
<br />Looking at your screenshot, what happens when you apply a bottom border to the cell containing 537, or a top border to the cell below?
<br />
<br />If you want, save a sample workbook with the problem on OneDrive or Dropbox and paste a link here. Remove any confidential or sensitive information first. I or someone else can take a look at it.
<br />
<br />This forum is a user-to-user support forum. I am a fellow user.

            First try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)

<br />Note - Please repair only if you have product key with you as sometimes it asks for the product key again after the repair.

<p>I found my answer. Content Filter not belong to Protection Tab in ECP.</p>
<p>I should create new transport rule for content filter.</p>
<p>-If the message... include these words in the body/subject &nbsp;:"abc" or"etc.."</p>
<p>-Do the following ...delete these message</p>

<h2>            Can you have multiple levels of protection on a worksheet&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>While I understand how to create a worksheet where so cells are locked and other are not, I am wondering if you can have two different levels of protection on the same worksheet.</p>
<p>I have a file where multiple people will need to input their data into their own specific sheet.&nbsp; Within that sheet there are lines with subtotals.&nbsp; I currently have them set to lock with the worksheet protection on.&nbsp; This allows them to enter data but not
 adjust the subotals lines. I want to add another level of security/password so the people inputting the data can only access their sheet.&nbsp; If I set individual passwords doe each sheet, when they unlock their own sheet, they also unlock the protection on the
 subtotals.</p>
<p>Basically I have cost center 1,2,3,4,5 where I want 1 to have access to only 1, 2to only 2and so on.&nbsp; I just do not want to drop the protection on the subtotals line.</p>
<p>I probaby have confused eveyone, but I thought I would try.</p>

<p>First - a new motherboard is not always = to a new computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have changed 3 motherboards and they never lost Digital Entitlement.&nbsp; These were direct replacement boards and not upgrades from the original board.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you came over directly from Vista, then that is a different issue and this will never activate.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you came from Vista to W7 or W8.1 and then to W10, then a new board might drop activation if the new board was significantly different from the original
 board.</p>

            <p>Mel is not protesting but explaining that there are times that the replacement of an identical motherboard, ie an exact factory replacement, can carry the digital entitlement to it as the Microsoft server does not see any difference in the hardware.</p>
<p>For me this seems a logical thing as if the original motherboard was flawed the factory should replace it.</p>

<p>Not sure if your response is to me or the original poster.&nbsp; However, read my response.&nbsp; A new motherboard does not always equate to a new computer.&nbsp; I have changed 3 motherboards and did not lose Digital Entitlement.&nbsp; The same or equilivant board will pass.&nbsp;
 I even replaced a W8 MB with a W7 matching MB which made me change the disk format and this still passed.</p>

            All of my emails have been cleared too from my inbox Focus AND Other.&nbsp; These are my work emails and I need them and have not touched my settings!&nbsp; I have the Outlook app downloaded and it is my primary email on my phone and PC.&nbsp; I am sick and tired of
 Microsoft doing auto updates WITHOUT MY PERMISSION and just wiping out my emails.&nbsp; This is my livelihood on this work PC and email account!&nbsp; I SHOULD BE THE ONE IN CONTROL OF MY OWN ACCOUNTS NOT MICROSOFT.&nbsp; &nbsp; I NEED MY EMAILS BACK!&nbsp; My PC is so slow with last
 update and I lost day of work trying to get everything back to way I wanted it.&nbsp; Seriously thinking maybe time to go to MAC!&nbsp; Please respond to previous person's entry and let us know how to get our emails back.&nbsp; Thank you.

<p>Thank you for that information. Just to confirm, which version of Outlook are you using? If you're using Outlook 2010, is it
<span>connected to an Office 365 mailbox that has an online archive? Also, have you try recovering your email messages by using Recover Deleted Items?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Meanwhile, we suggest that you try repairing your Office app. This will help us correct the problems with your Office application. Here's the

            <span><span>This has happened to me too on Feb 23rd. Microsoft have given me no explanation and no resolution. I've used Office 2011 for Mac for years without problem so can't believe this has happened. Like others
 messaging on this subject, I changed no settings, I just opened Outlook in the same way that I always do.&nbsp; I've lost thousands of emails and all my personal folders. I don't know what to do to resolve this, but I will never rely on Outlook again. I will use
 Apple mail from now on, which is recoverable should anything happen. Outraged that no support is offered.&nbsp;</span></span>

<p>It seems that you're using Outlook web. Have you tried accessing your account using different browser? If yes and the same issue persists, let's try to reproduce the issue by creating a new user account. If the issue does not happen on the new profile, there
 could be some broken system components on your old profile. </p>

    <title>&#34;Delete Comment&#34; button on Review tab of Ribbon disappears, - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> j_881  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Delete Comment&#34; button on Review tab of Ribbon disappears, moves other buttons</h2>
                    <p>Is there a way to "lock" a command to its tab on the Ribbon?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the Review tab, there are usually at least a couple "grayed out" commands that presumably are not available for the given document/text/situation/etc. - that's great.&nbsp; Unfortunately, when the "Delete Comment" command is not applicable, it doesn't go gray,
 it disappears entirely, shifting all other buttons to the left.&nbsp; Why this is a problem is when I'm reviewing changes using the buttons in the Changes grouping (Accept/Reject/Previous/Next), as I click through and move between commented text and not, the buttons
 move, so I end up clicking on Reject sometimes when I want Next (big problem!) and dead space other times (smaller, but still annoying problem)...&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that this is a new(ish) phenomenon - I don't recall it happening up until recently - was there an update that might have caused it?&nbsp; Any suggestions for keeping the "Delete Comment" button in place (if grayed out) when not applicable?&nbsp; I've checked
 out the instructions for customizing the Ribbon and various comment boards, etc., and don't see anything that sounds like what I'm seeing here.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Short of writing your own Review tab, which is possible, we are stuck with it, until someone at Microsoft realizes that a lot of people do things using muscle memory rather than looking. They do not expect things to move from where they were when last seen.
 You are not the first to complain here about it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I expect that with the new Compact Ribbon it will get worse before it gets better. This started with the menu commands in earlier versions that only appeared in a timely manner if you used them.</p>

            <p>Hello Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sorry to know that you’re having trouble setting the Office theme in Word to ‘Dark gray’, which is gets reverted to White theme.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see you’re finding difficult with the new Office 2013 interface. Once you begin practicing it, you will feel it is user friendly.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the Office theme issue, repair Office 2013 installation then try to set the theme and check how it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to the article mentioned below on how to repair Office 2013:</p>

            <p>I tried the repair, and it seemed to work at first, however the problem comes back.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In looking further, I noticed that it has an error in the upper right corner of the window (! yellow triangle), where it is asking me to sign-in.&nbsp; I have no idea what this wants me to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on "sign-in" it takes me to a generic sign-in page with my name in it.&nbsp; The only field is already populated, and clicking ok seems to do nothing.</p>
<p>

            <p>this is an old thread but I thought I would post a reply in case others are searching as I was for the issue. The problem is around accounts. Office 2013 tries to connect to your Microsoft account. If you have your own domain login, somehow it occasionally
 connects partially to it and&nbsp;it will show up in the corner with a message similar to the one above (cant get to the acct).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is that when Office thinks it is connected to the cloud info, it tries to save the Office configuration to the cloud and not locally. Since it can't, it doesn't save the config at all - hence you keep getting the white theme.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you tell Office to log out of your domain account (bizarre) it still works just fine and will save the theme locally and keep it.</p>
<p>

<h2>            New Mogul - No ActiveSync</h2>
                    <span>Wow! Reading some of these threads it sure seems that ActiveSync is not a very stable way to communicate with your device! So, let me add my voice to those for whom ActiveSync - isn't!<br />
                    <span>Wow! Reading some of these threads it sure seems that ActiveSync is not a very stable way to communicate with your device! So, let me add my voice to those for whom ActiveSync - isn't!<br />
<br />
Brand new HTC Mogul bought 24 hours ago. Under Device Settings I have:<br />
ROM Version: 3.56.651.0<br />
ROM Date: 6/18/08<br />
<br />
Under Identity<br />
Model No.: TITA100<br />
Platform: Pocket PC<br />
<br />
I loaded ActiveSync 4.5 from the CD, plugged the USB cable into a port on the computer and the other end into the device. Nothing. Then up pops a message that the USB DeviceNot Recognized.<br />
<br />
I have tried looking into ActiveSync it tells me I have no partnerships. On the Connection Settings Screen, I click Connect and after 30 seconds or so the Get Connect Pop Up Dialog appears. Clicking next shows only the USB port is available. Click next I get
 a very fast creen flicker and then I am back to the same dialog.<br />
<br />
I have tried Settings-&gt; USB to PB and deselected the Enable Advanced network functionality. No difference. I have setting it. No difference. I have tried a soft reset. No difference.<br />
<br />
Folks, what the heck am I doing wrong. It really shouldn't be this hard!<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help you can offer!<br />
<br />
Doug<br />

 What it can be? </div>

            yep, probably u r right - I've just found that they had made a block for the... mmm... let say "check sum" (1 USD at the very beginning to be sure that card is valid). So, it means that everything is ok with the card and it is not my problem now.<br />

Nevertheless, thank you for the answer!

    <title>Sent to mail recipient in windows is not working with Outlook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> charlzz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sent to mail recipient in windows is not working with Outlook</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
I have a windows 7 64 bit computer with Outlook 2007 installed as a part of Office small business 2007. When i right click on a picture and click on sent to--&gt; Mail recipient, nothing happens. I was hoping Outlook windows to open with the picture as an attachment.
 I tried the same with a text document file on my desktop.<br />
The weird thing is it works when i keep my Outlook open. When Outlook is closed and if i try to perform the above task it will create a process called Outlook.exe in the task manager. But nothing happens. I have removed the add ins from OUtlook thinking that
 they may conflict. Removed the add in keys from the registry as well.<br />
I made sure that Outlook i my default e-mail client from the default programs and from Outlook.<br />
It works fine in my Windows XP desktop. Is it a glitch in the Windows 7 ?

<p>I presume you are refering to the little tape icon in the Phone tile. Try another sim and see if it disappears but reappears when you insert your own sim again. Is do I suggest getting a replacement sim from your operator.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This most definately is an operator issue as the icon would normaly go away once you have listend to any voicemail messages. Normally it should go away if you switch to flight mode and back as this would reset the connection and registration of the SIM.</p>

<h2>            Stop annoying messages on known safe Hyperlinks</h2>
                    I have created some hyperlinks in access 2013 to MP3 files on my external hard drive. I want to stop the annoying message that tells me that some files may contain viruses on these links. I know they are safe. I have tried to change the security settings
 by adding the drive to the trusted list, cleared the check mark that starts with "Check Microsoft Office documents. . . " and I have created a DWORD in the registry (&nbsp;&nbsp;\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\15.0\Common\Security DWORD=DisableHyperlinkWarning
 value =1. I still get the warning pop up. Is there an answer to this??

                    <p>I recently decided to try 2013 here at work - big mistake. It took over my computer and no matter how I tried to unistall and thhen install either 2007 or 2010 I could not get them to work.&nbsp;2007 and 2010 would say&nbsp;Outlook can't find the profile and if I
 delete or try to create a new profile the error message says that Outlook either cannot find the information store or cannot open the profile. So&nbsp;I have been forced to stay with Outlook 2013 because
<br />
i have to be able to get to my&nbsp;work email but 2013&nbsp;constantly crashes or hangs. It does not like to display contacts or fully load the contents of the Spam trap.
<br />
If Ii accidently mouse over the email address of a message it freezes. I have had to use coontrol Alt Delete about a hundred times in the last week to restart Outlook. Help! I hate 2013 and want to get rid of it!</p>

            <i>"The first thing you have to know is that you can only have ONE version of Outlook on your computer</i>".
<br />
There is only ONE version.<br />
<br />
<i>"The next thing is that you should always test first. Never try a new software appliation on a production machine."<br />
</i>&nbsp;First of all what is this supposed to mean? We are a small non-profit - The only computers we have are the ones we have.
<br />
Your saying we can't trust Microsoft to get it right? And how do we test the product without removing the other versions since we can only have ONE version on the machine at a time. How about if Microsoft had offered some screen shots or previews - the colorless
 bland flat sparse barren look is SO unappealing and incredibly hard on the eyes in an office environment that I never would have tried it to begin with. I have upgraded this office many times in the past to newer operating systems and office suites. Never
 have i had a new version be such a disappointment AND hold my computer hostage besides.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
<p><i>"Go to your Control Panel. Uninstall Office - every version of it. Restart. Install the version you want to use.
</i></p>
<p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p><i>Create your profile to connect to Exchange with.</i>"</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Done that - it's part of the problem. You clearly are assuming that I don't know what I am doing. I have uninstalled and reinstalled. All the other office programs, Word Excel Access etc handle it just fine - but Outlook 2007 or 2010 will not work. Obviously
 2013 has changed something very far down in the works that even after uninstalling, using a restore point, deleting and creating new profiles the older versions simply will not function. they "cannot see the store" or "cannot find a profile" or "cannot open
 the profile" and this is even when I am in the midst of trying to create a new profile.</p>
<p>I would resign myself to being stuck with 2013 if it only WORKED PROPERLY and didn't constantly hang.
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks anyway.<br />

            <p>Are you actually connecting to an Exchange server? An "information store" usually refers to an Exchange server connection.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or do you actually have a POP3 account like with an internet service provider, or an IMAP account (example: Gmail), or use Hotmail with the Hotmail connector?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have set up an Exchange account and didn't mean to, you'd need to delete and recreate your mail account but use the settings for your particular type of account.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What type of mail account do you have? </p>

            Understood Kathleen - thank you for trying to help.<br />
<br />
I should have included that additional info&nbsp; - we are using a pop3 for email and use Alt N Technologies Outlook connector.<br />
<br />
I have even uninstalled and reinstalled the connector. <br />
<br />
My preference would be to just get rid of 2013 and go back to 2007 if I could. I can't shake the feeling that the problem here is that 2013 changed something very basic and intrinsic in the system which does not get changed back with the uninstall.
<br />
<br />
Also our network is a local server and the email accounts are handled and stored on the server with Alt N's Mailer Daemon program. Server is Microsoft Server Standard 2008R2.<br />
We really have no use for the cloud or the social networking connections that seem to be a big part of 2013.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Here are the problems (aside from appearance) that I am having with Outlook 2013.<br />
1. If my cursor points to an email address in a message I have received, a&nbsp; box pops up with a completely unrelated name in it. Outlook then freezes/stops responding.<br />
2. I have to check the spam trap in the public folder - It only loads about 1/2 the messages that are in there and then Outlook freezes/stops responding.<br />
3. If I click on my Contacts Folder Outlook Freezes/stops responding<br />
<br />
I will try a complete uninstall and re-install again.<br />

            <p>UPDATE: After trying everything in the way of reinstalling, creating new profiles etc I could not get any older versions of Outlook to work and continued to have the&nbsp;Freezing up&nbsp;problems in 2013.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The error message I would get in Outlook 2007 said&nbsp;"&nbsp;Unable to open your default e-mail folders. The information store could not be opened." I tried all solutions offered under a search on that error message and nothing worked. I did not have an excahnge
 account set up - was setting up the email account - as I have hundreds of times - under "other" and using the Outlook Connector. Office 2013 definately altered something within the file system and/or registry that made it impossible to uninstall&nbsp;Outlook and
 go back to an older version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only solution was to do a clean install of my windows 7 pro operating system and start from scratch. Now that&nbsp;I have done that and installed Office 2007 it is working fine. Now i have&nbsp;to spend the rest of the afternoon re-installing my other programs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe this is something you are sure to hear more about as 2013 becomes more widely available.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Just to highlight one thing - the Alt N Outlook Connector is the unspoken elephant in the room which from its website does not list O'2013 as being supported (it may be but it's not listed on their site).</p>

&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don't know if the connector was at the root of the problem (directly or indirectly) but it is something to keep in mind especially if it wasn't uninstalled prior to moving to O'2013. Have gone back and forth between O'2010 and O'2013&nbsp;on the same systems
 with no significant issues but did also take the precaution of not using the same profile for both.</p>

            <p>Connector certainly may have been the cause of the bugginess in 2013 - makes me wonder why someone didn't test that during the Beta phase.&nbsp; However&nbsp;that doesn't fully explain why I could not do a complete uninstall of everything and then get the older versions
 of Outlook to work.&nbsp;Whatever email client you are using doesn't seem to be affected by whatever core change 2013 is making.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was no successful solution for getting the older versions of Outlook to work again. This was true even after completely uninstalling EVERYTHING, including the connector, and creating completely new login profiles on the operating system -&nbsp;along with
 new mail profiles. This suggests that 2013 changed something in the system registry. Still seems odd to me that the Connector email&nbsp;did work in 2013 (although buggy) but then would no longer work in 2007 or 2010 at all - even though it previously had.</p>
<p>The only solution for my situation was to completely reinstall my operating system.</p>

            <p>Carol,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have to agree with you - Outlook 2013 is completely craptacular.&nbsp; Once it has been installed in a system, the only way to uninstall and get previous versions to work, is on a clean windows install.&nbsp; I have attempted uninstalls with CCleaner to ensure registry
 is clean to no avail.&nbsp; My test Virtual workstations are useless too, but at least I can go back to snapshot and be back to before the install.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest staying far away from Office 2013 until at least Service Pack 1.&nbsp; May work better on Windows 8, but for Windows 7, it is pretty much un-useable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this point the only time I would recommend Office 2013, is to someone I don't like very much...</p>

            <p>Just for the record for anyone reading this.......</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When moving backwards from O'2013 to an earlier version, suggestion is to create a new profile using the &lt;Mail&gt; applet OR use a profile that was not used by O'2013. Have gone through the process multiple times with no issues encountered (not to be construed
 as a&nbsp;statement of preference for or against&nbsp;O'2013 over earlier versions - just activities resulting for testing purposes).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Outlook profiles persist between installs and programs such as CCLeaner do nothing when it comes to Outlook profiles.&nbsp;Registry cleaners of any kind will similarly not remove existing Outlook profiles. A common misconception among many related to resolving
 Outlook profile related issues is to uninstall/re-install Outlook which is a complete and total waste of time and effort since that will never resolve a potential&nbsp;underlying profile related problem,&nbsp;whatever that may be (hence the misguided perception that
 only a "clean install of windows" is the solution since&nbsp;a clean install will result in earlier Outlook profiles no longer existing).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In short, if anyone wants to use Outlook as if it (it = any Outlook version) has never been installed on the computer before is to create a new profile and make it the new default.</p>

            Just for the record, anyone who uses CCleaner or other registry cleaner would normally have already performed all the other basic trouble-shooting techniques such disabling 3rd party add-ons, wiping the profiles, ensuring OST's and other cached files are
 removed and cleared from the recycle bin.<br />
<br />
The next step here is to take identical systems and perform registry change comparisons to see where the system is failing.<br />

With the GPO setting: User Configuration &gt; ADMX &gt; Microsoft Outlook 2016 &gt; Outlook Options &gt; Preferences &gt; Calender Options &gt; Calender week numbers (enabled) i have the possibility to swith week numbers on.

</p><p>Nope, not Yet.</p>
<p>Couldn't use RSOP, so i used "gpresult /h GPReport.html" in CMD mode </p>
<p>And couldn't find anything which pointed at "greying out" in the report.... So not one step further.
</p>

</p><p>MS step in please....</p>

<h2>            Outlook folders linking to explorer</h2>
                    <p>Just wondering if you can create a folder in outlook that is then duplicated or located in explorer folders?</p>
<p>I have a team that is needing to read and add emails on a project and I would like to have one group email folder for each project that then links to windows explorer directory so we cant read the email from the server without outlook? Would a public folder
 share the emails in explorer for filing?</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

            Dear user,
<br />There is no option to create a public folder for incoming emails. If all the team should have access to the incoming folder and you are using Windows 10, they can set up this account in Windows Mail app <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/set-up-email-in-the-mail-app-for-windows-10-7ff79e8b-439b-4b47-8ff9-3f9a33166c60" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/set-up...</a>. But doing that will mean that everyone will be able to send emails and read all other meals. So I am not sure if this is the best option.
<br />You can create another account for this project only and share this account with the group and add it as connected account to your Microsoft Account <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/add-your-other-email-accounts-to-outlook-com-c5224df4-5885-4e79-91ba-523aa743f0ba" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/add-yo...</a>. This will allow you to see everything that is happening there and to control the information that team is receiving.
<br />Hope this answers your question.
<br />Have a nice day!

<p>hi, i got the phone two weeks ago and everything was working fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>recently every now and then the touchscreen decides to stop working. (the keypad continues to work)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i did the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- removed SD card (2gb) and used the phone without it to check if the problem occurs again.</p>
<p>- soft reset of settings</p>
<p>- checked for software updates, no updates found (5.65)</p>
<p>- even without new updates i used nokia update manager to re-install the current firmware</p>
<p>- changed sim card</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>none of the above helped.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the other thing i noticed is that this issue doesn't have a specific pattern. this 'disabling' of the touchscreen occured when:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- answering the phone while being locked.&nbsp; (i couldn't unlock afterwards)</p>
<p>- receiving messages while viewing inbox</p>
<p>- receiving message while calling</p>
<p>- after leaving the phone for a long period of time.</p>
<p>- right after using bluetooth transfer</p>
<p>and more that i cant really remember right now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i dont know if we should assume that it's not some specific application or style of use that causes this problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>could this be a hardware problem? how could it be a hardware problem if at any other time the screen functions perfectly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>my gut feeling says that it's the touchscreen ''service'' (software) that fails.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THIS PROBLEM SEEMS TO BE COMMON ON THIS PHONE. CAN SOMEONE FROM OFFICIAL NOKIA SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THIS?</p>

<p>Hi. Finally I've sent my C3-01 to a Care Point, and they have changed my touchscreen free (after 50 days, but...).<br />
I hope you'll do the same, cause here there are no news. Be lucky.</p>
