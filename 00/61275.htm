            Winword is capable of opening several file formats. Check if you're able to open the text file (.txt extension?) using the File - Open command in Microsoft Word.

<h2>            Calling Microsoft Support &#61; Microsoft Audit</h2>
                    <p>Fellow Captures of the Microsoft&nbsp;Machine,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, I just&nbsp;confirmed the other day why I consider my&nbsp;opinion of&nbsp;Microsoft to be&nbsp;of a love/hate nature. When&nbsp;Microsoft had&nbsp;new product, such as Windows 10, I hesitate to get on the band wagon. As a matter of fact, I avoid the wagon at all costs. They got
 me with "Windows ME" and I have avoided updated and new Microsoft products ever since. I hate that!&nbsp;Our company has stuck with Windows 7 because it works. Our personal know how to run it and our IT department knows how to fix it. It communicates well with
 our server environment and life is good. I love that!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other day, I was forced to call Microsoft to get a license key for a Windows 8.1&nbsp;downgrade&nbsp;to Windows 7. The gal helping me was very personable and helpful. However, she was unsure how to handle my specific request by herself. She kept putting me on
 hold to check with someone else. Obviously, the someone else was taking notes and was nice enough to PUT OUR COMPANY UP FOR AN AUDIT, THE NEXT DAY! That's right, the next business day, I received an email that our company was being audited. Well, anyone that's
 been here knows they don't call it an audit. They have a kinder and gentler way of putting it, "A security and compliance review" I believe it said. But, if it quacks and walks on webbed feet, it's probably a duck, right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Beware of asking Microsoft for help, or call in as a personal user. Do not tell them it's a business or you could be facing the dark hole I am about to crawl into. I hear the audits are fairly straight forward and we shouldn't have any trouble? But I didn't
 need this, especially right before Christmas. I asked for an extension, but they are slower to respond to that than they were to fill out the audit request.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh Whoa is Me....wish me luck.</p>
<p>Jeff</p>

<h2>            Xbox one is stupid</h2>
                    
<p>I want to start by saying that i have been playing xbox since the release of Halo 2 back in 2004 (haven't had xbox live the whole time), but its 2015 now and xbox went from one of the greatest companies in the world to making a failure of a console that
 they seem to not fix till several months after the problem is found. I have spent thousands on xbox one just hoping it will get better but i am disappointed every single day. i have gone through 3 controllers by the time of this post but i haven't broken them
 because of a game, i have broken them because of this faulty console that i continue to play everyday. Hopefully if xbox reads this message it might get through their thick skulls that the xbox one is broken and Phil spencer isn't doing anything about it.</p>

<p>Perhaps you could give a hint on the issues you are having so that someone can give some feedback that may help you. There are some that are having multiple issues, but others everything is fine. So there are solutions.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Pro &#40;Free upgrade&#41; Deactivated Itself - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davidroyal77  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Pro &#40;Free upgrade&#41; Deactivated Itself</h2>
                    <p>So I jump on the Windows 10 bandwagon as begged and harassed by Microsoft for months. "Get your free upgrade before it's too late!"</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I get my free upgrade and go from 7 to 10. Fast forward a year and I decide to rebuild my PC. Knowing I don't have a 10 license key, I research how to transfer the license. I find that I can associate my windows account with my licenses. I successfully
 do this and continue with my PC build. I Install an ISO copy of windows as instructed by Microsoft and easily activated my version of Windows 10. Let me say that again. I REGISTERED MY COPY OF WINDOWS 10!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fast forward 3 weeks. I receive the message that my copy of windows needs to be activated (again). I go through the motions and it fails. I call customer support and they say they can't help me. I was told that I have to get the Windows 7 license key and
 call them back. Well guess what! I don't have that s h i t anymore! I sure as h e l l can't find it! You would then think that perhaps they can look at my account and see that I have registered my Windows 10 license. Well h e l l no! That would be too easy!
 SO here I am, without a 7 version to fall back on and a DEACTIVATED copy of Windows 10. And because my PC is a true home built, I don't have an OEM key in the BIOS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not paying $200 to register this damn thing! You owe me my damn license back!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am &nbsp;p i s s e d &nbsp;off to no end! God damn you Microsoft!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>My version of 7 was bought of the shelf. I later upgraded to 10 for free. I think your assessment is incorrect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found this in another post.&nbsp;https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/windows-10-de-activated-itself-after-i-switched-my/b07fc159-8383-4eca-b34a-bf95e42242ed&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did the previous qualifying license come with the older motherboard? If it did, then the Windows 10 license would invalidated. If its a full retail license that was bought separately, try phone activation:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Press&nbsp;<strong>Windows key + X</strong>&nbsp;then click<strong>Run</strong>, then type:&nbsp;<strong>slui.exe 4</strong></p>
<p>2. Next press the 'ENTER' key</p>
<p>3. Select your 'Country' from the list.</p>
<p>4. Choose the 'Phone Activation' option.</p>
<p>5. Stay on the phone (do not select/press any options) and wait for a person to help you with activation.</p>
<p>6. Explain your problem clearly to the support person.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>When I upgrade a preinstalled (OEM) or retail&nbsp;version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 license to Windows 10, does that license remain OEM or become a retail license?</strong></p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM or retail version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 to the free Windows 10 upgrade this summer, the license is consumed into it. Because the free upgrade is derived from the base qualifying license, Windows 10 will carry that
 licensing too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you upgrade from a retail version, it carries the rights of a retail version.</p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM version, it carries the rights of a OEM version.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Full version (Retail):</strong></p>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Upgrade version (Retail):</strong></p>
<span>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive, but cheaper than full version</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>OEM :</strong></p>
<span>
<p>OEM versions of Windows are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What happens if I change my motherboard?</strong></p>
<p>As it pertains to&nbsp;the&nbsp;<strong>OEM license&nbsp;</strong>this will invalidate the Windows 10 upgrade license because it will no longer have a previous base qualifying license which is required for the free upgrade. You will then have to purchase
 a full retail Windows 10 license.&nbsp;<strong>If the base qualifying license (Windows 7 or Windows 8.1)&nbsp;was a full retail version, then yes, you can transfer it.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>From the Windows 10&nbsp;end user license agreement:</em></p>
<span>
<p><strong>b. Stand-alone software.</strong>&nbsp;If you acquired the software as stand-alone software (and also if you upgraded from software you acquired as stand-alone software), you may transfer the software to another device that belongs to
 you. You may also transfer the software to a device owned by someone else if (i) you are the first licensed user of the software and (ii) the new user agrees to the terms of this agreement. You may use the backup copy we allow you to make or the media that
 the software came on to transfer the software. Every time you transfer the software to a new device, you must remove the software from the prior device. You may not transfer the software to share licenses between devices.</p>

            <p>After calling and being accidentally dropped by 6 CS reps, I finally got one on the line long enough to complete the activation. I don't know what happened to my validation to begin with, but it apparently required the tech to remote into my machine in order
 to re-validate it. I did not have to show proof that I had a valid copy of 7. Three of the CS reps demanded that I show them my Product ID from within my BIOS. Well, that didn't work, but I installed an app call Produkey&nbsp;http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/product_cd_key_viewer.html
 and it found my Product ID and Product Key. It did not find my License ID though.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, the CS rep was able to cleanup something locally and reactivate it. What a pain in the butt that was. I was however, able to get my license ID during the process. That will likely save me a bunch of time if this happens again. Strangely, my 2016
 Office was also deactivated. I tried to get that re-activated and it got the same crap. Luckily for me, I have the license key for that. I put that in there and it went through. What a pain it is to have to prove my credentials randomly like that. Microsoft
 should have emailed me a license ID when I switched to Window 10. They spent more than I did in CS support today because they were shortsighted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm back in business after 6 hours of phone tag and googling all day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I saved all my documents (screenshots of the license #'s during the process).&nbsp;</p>

If you are using Internet Explorer, then you may try increasing or decreasing the zoom level. Check if the issue persists.<br />
1.Open Internet Explorer by clicking the Start button , and then clicking Internet Explorer.
<br />
2.On the bottom right of the Internet Explorer screen, click the arrow next to the Change Zoom Level button .<br />
3.To go to a predefined zoom level, click the percentage of enlargement or reduction you want.<br />
- or -<br />
To specify a custom level, click Custom. In the Percentage zoom box, type a zoom value, and then click OK.</p>

            I know computers pretty well, and I tried different kinds of zooming, and everything will increase but the video frame. Any online games or videos (except for youtube) have the small frame.

    <title>All Folder and file permissions changed in Windows 10 - I&#39;m - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> loren o.  say:</h3>
<h2>            All Folder and file permissions changed in Windows 10 - I&#39;m Screwed</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to Win10 from Win7 and all of the folder and file attributes changed; I cannot copy or delete my own files. &nbsp;I have tried everything to get around it but all has failed. &nbsp;Spent hours last night inside C Prompt with an expert and could not copy
 and paste to a different drive. &nbsp; In all cases, it is telling us that I do not have Admin Rights to modify or copy the folders and files. &nbsp; We are trying to save data on the original hard drive which crashed as a result of the same issue when we were trying
 to clone it (it was not allowing the clone software to perform correctly. &nbsp; I have lost (hopefully temporarily) a ton of mail, legal documents, huge graphic files which had a lot of time into them. &nbsp;From what I'm seeing, this problem is troubling the Windows
 10 community. &nbsp;I'd like to find out what Microsoft is doing to cure this problem; its nothing I did and now 350gb of files and data are locked up. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any information will be helpful. &nbsp;Thanks!</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>PROBLEM SOLVED. <em>&nbsp;I installed a hard drive which was a clone of my drive back in 2015. &nbsp;Using that hard drive and the XP OS which was on it, I ran the EaseUS data recovery on the messed up drive which was housed in a external drive housing. &nbsp;Once the
 files were pulled up in the EaseUS directory I recovered them and saved them in a shared file folder on the older cloned drive. &nbsp;After the files were recovered and saved, I found that &nbsp;they now were transferred to the older drive with content. &nbsp;I was able
 to recover 320gb of data in this fashion. Between recoveries, I test to check that the files had content and could be opened. &nbsp; I believe this approach worked because the files and folders I was restoring and transferring had the same security details as the
 cloned disk. &nbsp;</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>In my prior attempts to recover and transfer the files to the new Win10 system, &nbsp;only the file names and tree would transfer with NO data (this was even when the EaseUS deep scan directory was showing a file was 3mb in size, when we restored it to the
 external drive, the files would actually be empty. &nbsp;We were also unable to open files which were still good on the messed up drive - this was all due to security issues. &nbsp; These issues even occurred on my system after I made the Windows 7 to Win10 online free
 upgrade.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Now, I have a new drive which is set up with the full fresh install of Win10 (not upgrade), I've transferred all of my recovered files to the new drive along with Outlook mail files and everything is working really, really good. &nbsp;I have no problems opening
 files. &nbsp;</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>I would like to say thank you to the Microsoft Community for reaching out to assist me in trying to resolve this problem. &nbsp;</em></p>
<p>

===========================================<br />
<br />
<strong>Consider this an absolute must - manually updating your drivers.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : Run DriverView - set<br />
VIEW to&nbsp;Hide Microsoft drivers - update those&nbsp;without&nbsp;Dump in their names.&nbsp;(Also <br />
update the BIOS&nbsp;and chipset drivers at the System/Motherboard Maker's site.)<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are <br />
the most current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down <br />
the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab -
<br />
write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything <br />
as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT <br />
this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard<br />
if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers
<br />
you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback)<br />
and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get <br />
their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System <br />
Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot -
<br />
check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR <br />
SCANNER - check manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using <br />
the methods above is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker <br />
and Device makers are found)<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations<br />
in Windows Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install <br />
drivers which will usually be older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new <br />
driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then go look for new ones manually if
<br />
you wish.<br />

    <title>Multiple Flight Simulator X Activations - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> markbuddemeyer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multiple Flight Simulator X Activations</h2>
                    I'm having problems activating Flight Simulator X in a computer lab that I manage.
<div>The lab has 21 computers and they all have a retail copy of Flight Simulator X.</div>
<div>After a fresh install of the OS and Flight Simulator X, none of the computers will activate with the CD keys printed in the box.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Initially I got the&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/960481" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">“An error occurred while attempting to activate the product”</a>&nbsp;message on
 all the machines I tried.</div>
<div>I went through the steps outlined in kb960481 (<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/960481/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/960481/en-us</a>) and I stopped getting the error.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now on the computers that I have installed Flight Simulator Service Pack 1 and 2 on, I receive a message saying that the key I'm entering is invalid.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>We didn't have any problems with this exact same setup the last two years. &nbsp;But suddenly, none of them want to activate using the CD keys in the box.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>And while I'm on the topic of CD Keys, is there any way to get 1 volume key good for all 20+ computers. &nbsp;As much as I love the job security, I'd rather not touch each computer individually if I can help it.</div>

    <title>Windows 10 apps cannot open after deleting an user account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robert109  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 apps cannot open after deleting an user account</h2>
                    <p>I had two user accounts on my PC,&nbsp;yesterday I&nbsp;deleted one. After that I found something wrong with the Windows 10 apps like Outlook mail, Calendar, Calculator&nbsp;and People. I could not open these apps just after the deletion of a user account. Then I tried
 to google for the solution and the codes for PowerShell not worked for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I tried to do a restore which could bring the deleted account back, then after the restore these apps worked again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to delete the account and keep all the Windows 10 apps working. Is there any solution for this? Thanks.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 File History - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fransharderwijk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 File History</h2>
                    <p>Hi high-techs,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question: would it be possible - and if so; how - can I set File History to back-up files on my data drive D: instead or the regular personal account folders.
</p>
<p>No problem if I have to edit the registry or something else.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is NOT possible, please tell so I can stop looking for a solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for help.</p>

<p>
</p><p>File History only backs up copies of files that are in the Documents, Music, Pictures, Videos, and Desktop folders and the
<span>OneDrive</span> files available offline on your PC. If you have files or folders elsewhere that you want backed up, you can add them to one of these folders.

            <p>Hi Krishnan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your answer although it is a disappointment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reason:</p>
<p>- ever since Windows 3.1 I use my own folder structure</p>
<p>- I have many files with links</p>
<p>- so no way to move them</p>
<p>
</p><p>A pity because File History looked nice.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I'm not fully sure yet but ... Funny! Why didn't I find this before?&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>Perhaps those user folders are only the usual defaults.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you start using File History to back up your files, you’ll need to set up a drive to which you will save files. Microsoft recommends you use an external drive or network location to help protect your files against a crash or other PC problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>File History only saves copies of files in your libraries, contacts, favorites and on your desktop. If you have folders elsewhere you want backed up, you can add them to one of your existing libraries or create a new library.</p>
<p>To set up File History:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the File History control panel applet. </li><li>Connect an external drive, refresh the page, and then tap or click “Turn on.”</li></ul>
<p>You can also set up a drive in AutoPlay by connecting the drive to your PC, tapping or clicking the notification that appears, then tapping or clicking “Configure this drive for backup.” That’s it. From that moment, every hour, File History will check your
 libraries, desktop, favorites and contacts for any changes. If it finds changed files, it will automatically copy them to the File History drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for getting back with a reply.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I would like to inform you that in previous versions of Windows, you could use Backup and Restore to back up your files or create and use a system image backup or repair disc. Windows&nbsp;10 gives you choices about how you can recover your PC and
 back up your personal files.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>You can use File History to back up the files on your PC in the Documents, Music, Pictures, Videos, and Desktop folders and the One Drive files available offline on your PC. Over time, File History builds a history of your files. You'll first
 need to set up a File History drive and turn File History on. If your original files are lost, damaged, or deleted, you can restore them. You can also browse and restore different versions of your files,

            <p>I totally agree! Last night I played PS VR for the first time and I can say it was absolutely the best thing I've seen on a console. I specifically bought the xbox one x for the future release of VR on the world's most powerful console. It seems Microsoft really don't care about xbox users and are only bothered about PC users which is absolutely not on. The lack of VR support for the One X has really put me off Microsoft and I'm genuinely going to bin the xbox and get a playstation purely for VR. Bad move in my eyes from Xbox, a complete missed opportunity and I imagine I after all I've seen online it seems I'm not the only one to think that. Pull your finger out Microsoft and listen to the people that spent a fortune on your consoles!!!!!!!!!!!&nbsp;</p>

<p>The PSVR is a great piece of kit I agree. However sales are the driving force behind any business and as things stand I suspect that an Xbox VR just wouldn't generate enough revenue for Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sony took something of a gamble with the PSVR and whilst it has what I'd call a modest user base of around 2 million units sold that hardly a huge amount. VR is still in it's infancy, many of the PSVR titles are sketchy to say the least although playing
 Resident Evil 7 in VR is something to behold. There are lots of good titles and lots of really poor ones too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Taking into account the issue of motion sickness then VR isn't for everyone and going back to my previous statement there just isn't enough money in VR right now for Microsoft to take a leap into VR on Xbox I believe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a personal level I'd rather do without VR on Xbox than for it to become a reality and then go the way of Kinect with little to no support and end up with another piece of hardware sitting around pretty much useless.</p>

 seen KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED, and when I ran Driver Verifier it only said "DRIVER VERIFIER DETECTED VIOLATION" instead of saying what the problematic driver was.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Network Attached Storage in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ruggerspec  say:</h3>
<h2>            Network Attached Storage in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have WD external hard drive connected to my router via a USB cable that I am using as network attached storage.&nbsp; I upgraded my windows 7 machine to the windows 10 and now the drive no longer shows up in file explorer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the drive is operating fine
 because I can access it from other computers that are not running windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking at other posts it seems like other people are having the same problems.&nbsp; The only answer I see on these pages directs people to TechNet forums.&nbsp;&nbsp;The only solution I found in TechNet directed me a a knowledge base article for updating SMB to a previous
 version, However the article was only applicable to older versions of windows server OS.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides this is a home use / application and I don't think we should be directed to&nbsp;a page meant for IT pro's.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems like something is wrong... why can the solution be posted right here?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community, we appreciate your interest in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the inconvenience you are facing in accessing Network Storage Drive after upgrading to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try few of the below troubleshooting steps and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Step 1: </span></strong><span>Disable anti-virus software and Windows Firewall.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>NOTE</span></strong><span>:&nbsp;Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install
 other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Follow the below steps to turn off Windows Firewall:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>Press <strong>Windows + X</strong>, click on <strong>Control Panel</strong>, select
<strong>Category</strong> and then select <strong>Large or Small icons</strong>.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Click on <strong>Windows Firewall</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></li><li><span><span>Click <strong>Turn Windows Firewall on or off</strong>. &nbsp;If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Click <strong>Turn off Windows Firewall </strong>(not recommended) under each network location that you want to stop trying to protect, and then click
<strong>OK</strong>.</span></span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists,</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>I suggest you to reconfigure the NAS drive and check if it help.</p>
<p>Refer to the below thread replied by <span><strong>Smithhead 9 </strong>replied on
<strong>M</strong><strong>ay 7, 2015</strong></span> </p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_files/accessing-nas-not-working-in-windows-10-technical/2e7dd6fb-5dd9-49f1-a46f-915a174432b9"><strong>Accessing NAS not working in Windows 10 Technical Preview</strong>

    <title>Handling space issues on 32gb windows 10 mini pc - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Handling space issues on 32gb windows 10 mini pc</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I purchased a win10 mini pc with 32gb and activated it yesterday.</p>
<p>after the activation I had ~15gb free space. Few minutes after I activated the OS, I enabled the windows update.</p>
<p>Today, after installing the updates, I see that I have only 3gb of free space.</p>
<p>I'll clarify - Nothing is installed on the PC besides the windows 10 (no private files or applications at all).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This PC has a micro SD card slot, and I'm willing to use a 64gb SD card. I will install new applications on the SD card, however, I do not know how to free up space from the C drive, which currently includes the OS only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do? Is there a way to move some of the files of the OS to D drive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Did you check for rootkits which can survive a format and re-install.<br />
<br />
If you did a clean install then it virtually has to be hardware though there is a very tiny chance it is BIOS, chipset drivers, or other low loading drivers (like video).<br />

            Hi there, thanks for your question.
<br />
<br />Firstly, I would see if the troubleshooter fixes the issue. Click Start and type "troubleshoot" then select the first result. Scroll down and choose Printer. This may fix the issue.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help, please try reinstalling the printer drivers on your Lenovo computer. 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/selfservice/hp-officejet-5740-e-all-in-one-printer-series/6617253/model/6617254" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/selfservic...</a>
<br />
<br />After the installation, try printing to the printer using the app you'd like to print from, making sure that the OfficeJet 5740 shows Ready or Online status.
<br />
<br />Please let me know if you need further support! Thanks!

            So this should be an easy fix,  first make sure when you plug it up you hear a sound to let you know something is connected.  After that you have to check the drivers, some user have noted that after the most recent update  printers have stopped working.  So you can go to printer and devices and delete the printer.  Windows will reinstall it with the appropriate drivers and if it doesnt you can download them manually and install them. <br /><br />Hope this helps you,<br />Yomi Thomas

            Hi. 
<br />My name is Miles.
<br />
<br />I recommend you do the following: 
<br />
<br />Check that the printer is installed and in the "Ready" state: To do this, follow these steps: 
<br />
<br />• Start button&gt; Control Panel&gt; Printers. 
<br />• Disconnect the printer from the power button and turn it on again. 
<br />• Print the document again. 
<br />
<br />If the problem continues and you cannot print, uninstall the printer, restart the computer and reinstall. Through the following steps:
<br />
<br />•	Insert HP Officejet 5740 CD or search for devices in Windows, and then click Devices and Printers in the list of results.
<br />•	Click on Add a printer.
<br />•	Click on Add a local printer.
