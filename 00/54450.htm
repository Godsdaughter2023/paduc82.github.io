    <title>Skype with Multiple monitors - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Skype with Multiple monitors</h2>
                    <p class="contentHeader2">Multiple monitor presentations could be enhanced if Skype could share more than one screen at a time.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Current State</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>At my place of business, it is very likely that we will have three large monitors in the conference room to display three PowerPoint presentations that are synced together.
</li><li>Participants in the conference room will see seamless HD or UHD images stretched across the screens.
</li><li>However, Skype participants will only see one screen: the screen selected by the presenter.
</li><li>This is not ideal. </li></ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Does a&nbsp;Work Around Exist? </strong>
</span></p>
<ul>
<li>The existing work around require the presenter have three computers (one for each monitor) and then open a Skype connection on each computer</li><li>Remote Skype users open each of the connections and display them on their multi-monitor rigs.
</li><li>This work around causes the presentations to be out of sync as the presenter fumbles with 3 mice/keyboard combinations.
</li></ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Question</span></strong></p>
<p>When will Skype allow more than one monitor to be selected for display to remote users?</p>

<h3> dre g writer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bonfire not available.</h2>
                    
<p>Sometimes, I throw my summon sign down, when I'm a human.<br />
<br />
I sit there and wait to be summoned. Sometimes, I will be watching a video or something, writing a paper or something like that.<br />
<br />
And from time to time, my character would stand up, and the bonfire is no longer accessible.............The game haven't notified me of any invasions nor being summoned, and I dont see any paths ways being blocked by fog like the usually are when im being invaded
 or summoned, no enemies around.......so..........what's the deal???&nbsp;</p>

<p>Naw, it happens at many bon fires. I was at the bon fire in the lost izalith when all of a sudden, my character got up and the bon fire was un accessable. But i think it maybe was a gravelord sending enemies into my game. But I always restarted the game
 when that happened since i thought it was something wrong with the game, so I don't if that was the case or not since I didn't stick around to see if it was a gravelord invader, next time I will stick around and see whats going on.</p>

<p>It's more than likely due to someone trying to invade you. Whether it's a phantom of vengeance, an invader, or something else. While being invaded, your bonfire is inaccessible and you can't lay down a summon sign. While waiting to be summoned at the Painted
 World, my sign would disappear and it told me I was getting invaded a bit after. It's fun putting on the fog ring and just waiting once I get the notice.</p>

<p>Really? I thought that if you had your summon sign down you couldn't be invaded. (They did this to prevent someone from trying to invade a person that is being summoned and other such networking issues)</p>

<p>that is DEF not the case, you can get invaded while your sign is down. I've had my summon sign down on many times and waited at a bon fire and got invaded. Yesterday, I saw a guy to summon, but it kept failing when I tried to summon em, so I decided to invade,
 and I invaded the exact guy who I tried to summon.</p>

<p>Dre is right. Having a sign down doesn't keep you away from invasions. It will keep you from seeing other summon signs, though, if you're human.</p>

            <p>Kumar, </p>
<p>Thanks for your help. I did find a similar problem after I posted. Vijay replied on the 7th July 2013. He suggested testing&nbsp;the computer in safe mode then perform a clean boot to troubleshoot the problem.</p>
<p>I tested in&nbsp;safe boot mode then returned to normal sign in and magically it seems to have solved the problem.</p>
<p>If the problem&nbsp;returns I will try your solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can't think of any changes made to the computer except for a Windows update last weekend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your support</p>

<h3> revenge of auto  say:</h3>
<h2>            UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS</h2>
                    
<p>hello, i was playing xbox one day as usual, and i was suddenly signed out with a pop up that said something like "someone else signed into this account from another location" immediatley after i tried signing in myself and it said i was banned until 12/31/9999.
 i havent done anything in my many years of gaming to deserve to be banned for life such as hacking, modding, cheating, system tampering, etc...i was on the phone with xbox customer support and they said yes, you were most likely banned. so what the nice lady
 did was de-activate my account and cancel my gold subscription to xbox live. she then "escalated the situation" meaning she moved it near the top of xbox's list of chores (im guessing) because me being hacked like this i guess is a big thing. so can someone
 tell me who&nbsp; hacked me, when ill get my account back with a <strong>[Mod Edit]</strong> of stuff on it! and if i WASN'T hacked and i unknowingly did do something to deserve being banned for life, what that was??? the gamertag is: M4UTO. thanks and peace.</p>

                    sometimes when i start my computer, it doesn't detect any sound. Troubleshooter says "hardware changes might not have been detected". sometimes the problem is solved by restarting the computer. when i check my device manager there is no audio device shown.
 i had also installed my windows(7) again but after sometime it happens again. &nbsp;my motherboard is Intel dg31pr processor Intel e7200. What should i do?

    <title>Which is preferable&#58; system image or a backup&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Which is preferable&#58; system image or a backup&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've read the article <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/17127/windows-back-up-restore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>. As you can see, it provides two different sections under "Backup" and "System Image".</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is: which is preferable? As far as I could understand, one can
<strong>restore individual files</strong> from a backup. Can the same be done from a system image? I would rather look at the possibility of restoring individual files to the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover, if I create a backup (not System Image), will C: drive be backed up, like installer files? The bootloader may not be copied.</p>

<p>This is standard practice for my clients:</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should NOT backup your programs. Keep the disks that have the software you bought along with the “product keys” or activation keys. There are also a number of programs that are free and downloaded from the Internet that do not need to be backed up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 7 and Vista, you will find a folder named <em><strong>Users (C:Users)</strong></em>.&nbsp; In that folder you will find each user that is set up on the computer.&nbsp; In the user folder you will find Folders for documents, music, pictures and videos, and
 others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Copy your data on to an external hard drive.&nbsp; Without a doubt a USB connected external storage drive is the best way.&nbsp; It’s best to back up on a routine basis, for example monthly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do NOT recommend those pre-packaged external drives.&nbsp; Very few of them are capable of sufficient cooling or shock cushioning.&nbsp; Buy an excellent external drive housing for around $40.&nbsp; Then buy an internal hard drive and install it in the housing.&nbsp; It is
 so simple it will amaze you.</p>
<p>I strongly recommend the large heavy drives.&nbsp; They are the 3.5″ ones and are about 20 times the size of the 2.5″ ones.&nbsp; They are also far more durable and will likely last far longer than your current computer and more.&nbsp; The most important thing is that
 it will be reliable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do <strong>not</strong> recommend backup programs&nbsp;— even the one built into Windows.&nbsp; These programs were originally designed to save backup space.&nbsp;They&nbsp;usually produce files that are only usable by the program that created them and the space they save
 is not expensive.&nbsp;&nbsp;The second benefit they have is to pre-program what is backed up, and in Windows 7, that is no longer a problem because it is all in your User folder, with minor exceptions such as Quick Books and Windows Live Mail</p>
<p>
</p><p>Making copies of all data files will allow you to replace a single damaged or lost file.</p>
<p>Today, very high capacity external hard drives are available very cheaply.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Although it is technically possible to backup to a memory stick (AKA thumb drive), it is a bad practice.&nbsp;
</span>Memory sticks are not that reliable, they are good for smaller files being moved.&nbsp; The memory technology inside has a limited capability of writes.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I strongly recommend an external USB connect hard drive.&nbsp; They can be bought for $40 to $150 with vastly more space — like 500 to 2000Gb.&nbsp; They are dramatically faster — like 20 times.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I do <strong>not</strong> recommend so-called “cloud” backups.&nbsp; When you do this, you are storing a copy of your data in someone else’s computer that may some day be hacked or just shut down.&nbsp; It is of little value since you can buy your own capacity cheaply.&nbsp;
 Then you know where it is.</p>
<p><span><span>In many years of doing this work, I have lost count of the number of clients whose backups did not restore because of problems with the way the backup
 software stored the data.&nbsp; Some of these systems backup what was changed.&nbsp; The result of that is that you have many individual files that must be logically reassembled to do a restore from this backup.&nbsp; If just one of these files is faulty, the entire restore
 is impossible.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Backup software had its birth when space was very expensive and the software “compressed” the data to take less space.&nbsp; Today, that is certainly not an issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I recommend a simple process of drag and drop.&nbsp; Connect the external drive.&nbsp; Make a folder on it with your name and today’s date.&nbsp; Open that folder as a window, not full screen.&nbsp; Slide that window to one side.&nbsp; Open&nbsp;your
 C: drive in another window side-by-side.&nbsp; Find the folders/files you want to backup and simply drag and drop to the backup.&nbsp; Hint:&nbsp;
<strong>Use the RIGHT button to do the dragging </strong>(opposite if you mouse is set up for a left-hander).&nbsp; That way, when you drop it, it will ASK you if you want to copy, move or cancel.&nbsp; Of course, this method takes away the automatic scheduling convenience.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 But, I have never seen this kind of backup fail anyone.</span></p>
<p>Another hint, this is a Windows-wide feature – you can choose a number of folders at one time.&nbsp; If your list is contiguous, select the fist in the group, hold down the Shift key, select the last in the group.&nbsp; If your list is non-contiguous, select the first,
 hold down the Ctrl key, select each and every other folder.&nbsp; Then you can drag and drop a whole group at a time.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Backing up your favorites in Internet Explorer</strong>: Open Internet Explorer. Click File, Import and Export, Next. Choose Export Favorites. Click Next then Next. Browse to the same Backup folder. Give the file that you are about to export a name
 like: XXXX’s favorites xx-xx-xx. Click Save, Next Finish, OK</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, if you have data in files and folders in places in other folders, you will need to do the same thing with these. You will also need to repeat this process for each user on your computer.&nbsp;<em>Do not&nbsp;backup software or applications.</em></p>

            Try the following...
<br />
<br />To repair your Windows Hello.
<br />Open File Explorer and browse to this location:
<br />
<br />C:\Windows\ServiceProfiles\LocalService\AppData\Local\Microsoft\NGC
<br />Delete everything within that folder
<br />
<br />Make sure to do this as Administrator logged in.
<br />Also, just keep clicking Continue if you get the message "You don't currently have permissions for this folder"
<br />
<br />If you can't get past that screen then right click the NGC folder and go to properties and click the Security tab.
<br />Click Advanced.
<br />Click Change beside Owner and type in Administrators and click OK.
<br />
<br />Now try emptying the NGC folder again, once done close all the windows.
<br />
<br />Go to Settings-&gt; Accounts-&gt;Sign-in Options
<br />Click Add a PIN again and set your PIN
<br />Try again.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work try creating a new account profile.

 so I might ask a few question if something is super specific and I haven never heard of it. My specs are:</p>
<p>ASRock Micro ATX DDR3 1066 Motherboards 970M PRO3</p>
<p>GTX 970 4GB GDDR5</p>

<p>16GB RAM</p>
<p>Windows 10 64-Bit, x64-Based Processor</p>

</p><p>So from the top, last August my motherboard crashed which was an MSI 760GMA-P34 and I had to get a new one so I went with the ASRock that is in there now. Also, the friend that helped me build my PC wanted to borrow my GTX 970 until in 980 came in so he
 could use his Oculus so for about a month I had a GTX 770 which is about when the problems started happening. Since then I have gotten a BSOD just about every other day and have finally had enough with and want to fix it. Some examples of the BSODs I have
 gotten including today would be:</p>
<p>CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED (today for the first time)</p>
<p>MEMORY_MANAGEMENT (20% of the time)</p>
<p>SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION (60% of the time)</p>
<p>IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL (20% of the time)</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what I understand, the common thing here is that they all involve driver memory corruption I think. I also have WhoCrashed which I have heard can be unreliable but according to WhoCrashed, it says that the module is ntoskrnl.exe almost everytime it
 crashes. On another note, I built this PC for PC Gaming and I tried to play GTA V but I was only getting around 30-40 FPS and would BSOD about every 30-60 minutes. I have a link here for the most recent BSOD minidump file:</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Again, I don't know anything really and have never had to do this but when I open it in like Wordpad, it doesn't look like words or English so I don't know how to read it. I found that you can open it using WinDBg (x64) but I don't know how to read that
 still. Also, today my computer started to not recognize the fact that my ethernet cable was plugged in so I had to switch over to my wireless adapter. My friend that I built the PC with said that this might just be a motherboard issue and I should put back
 in the new MSI that they shipped me but I figured that it might be the driver. Also from WhoCrashed, it is saying that the driver that is causing the problem is Realtek WLAN USB NDIS Driver 28199 but again, I have heard that this is unreliable so I wasn't
 sure. I tried to find this driver and update it but the best update was already installed so I uninstalled, restarted my computer so it would reinstall itself. But my PC still won't recognize that an ethernet cable is plugged in so I don't know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, thank you for any help. I will try my best to answer any questions possible.</p>

    <title>Oblivion Games on Demand. Disc is Unreadable&#63;&#33; Seriously - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Oblivion Games on Demand. Disc is Unreadable&#63;&#33; Seriously MS....</h2>
                    
<p>Ok I'm really sick of this. This should not be an issue. If I download a game STRAIGHT from YOUR marketplace to my HDD with no disc being involved, it should not say it cannot read the disc. Of course it can't read the disc, THERE IS NO DISC! I have wasted
 a good 10 hours on my dashboard, deleting, reinstalling, patching, deleting again, downloading a useless file that is the same size(why you would tell me to do this, I have no clue...), then yet again, reinstalling Oblivion. OVER AND OVER. And yet everytime
 I try and leave the Imperial Sewers on a new character, the "disc" is unreadable. This is just completely idiotic. IT SHOULDN'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM. THERE IS NO DISC! Say its because its corrupt all you want, your system of Games on Demand is obviously flawed.
 Is there ANY chance of you fixing this so I can actually play a game I bought?</p>

<p>Okay, this sounds like a memory issue, and not an issue with the download itself. First off, can you try clearing the cache on your console
<em>after deleting the game</em>, and then try it again? You can do so by following these steps:
<br />
<br />
<strong>Delete the content</strong><br />
System Settings &gt; Memory &gt; [select storage device] &gt; Games &gt; [select game] &gt; [select content] &gt; Delete<br />
<br />
If the content is not in the above location, try looking in the Games folder for “Unknown Game”. Delete this and continue with the steps.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Clear system cache</strong><br />
System Settings &gt; Memory &gt; Highlight HDD, Press (Y) &gt; Clear System Cache &gt; Yes<br />
<br />
<strong>Restart the system</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Redownload from purchase history</strong><br />
Account Management &gt; Download History &gt; [select content] &gt; Download Again <br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, I'd be interested to try 1) formatting the HDD (in which case you'll want to back your save files up onto a USB device), or 2) trying the download with a different HDD (if a friend has one you&nbsp;can borrow) or a different console.<br />
<br />
Please let me know how it goes!</p>

<p>Hey mate, what was the issue with the disc-version of the game? And you said the Marketplace version worked fine for 24 hours? What happened when it stopped working properly?
<br />
<br />
My suggestion at this point would be to try a USB device configured for use with Xbox 360. Try downloading the game to that USB device, to see if it allows you to play the game without issue.</p>

<p>I'm having the exact same problem with Oblivion. I downloaded it straight to my hard drive and it says that the disc is unreadable. Funny thing is, I had the same problem with Skyrim, The only difference was that I had the disc with Skyrim, which was flawless
 and unscratched. Both games give me the "disc unreadable" screen. On Skyrim when I try to load a game and Oblivion simply never even gets past the opening credits.
</p>
<p>I tried installing Skyrim and re-downloading Oblivion, clearing my cache... It must be my xbox, since my other friend can run the disc easily. &nbsp;I have a 360 slim.</p>

<p>Hey Roc, to be sure, is this the Games on Demand version? I only ask because of that line you included about paying to download it. If so, does the same issue occur for different profiles on the console? You may want to create a free account to find out.

<p>Mister F, It's definitely the games on demand version. I downloaded it 4 times, even called Capcom like support asked me. I will try playing it with a different account, but I already tried the license transfer thing and it hasn't worked either. I will let

<h2>            Windows 10 won&#39;t play ANY audio</h2>
                    I downloaded Windows 10 to my laptop last night. Today my computer won't play any audio whatsoever. The speakers are all turned up and seem to be fine but any audio at all--notifications, music, videos--won't play at all. It was working fine before I upgraded
 to Windows 10.

            I'm having the same problem.... I can't play ANY videos at all (YouTube, news, etc...).... This is very aggravating... My programs were working fine before I upgraded to Windows 10.... When I tried to go back to Windows 7 (It told me that I could within
 a month), it wouldn't let me. It said that they made changes to my program that erased some of my information, and now I have to keep Windows 10. UGH!!!

<p>I ran a test on the speakers to make sure it wasn't my laptop.</p>
<p>after that I opened an mp4 audio file and it started to play.</p>
<p>I went to youtube and it worked fine again.</p>

            <p>I did share my solution. I went back to Windows 7. Nothing fancy, I just let it do its thing and recover back to Win 7. I hear about these so called audio drivers, and that may make sense, but I am not a PC guru and don't have a clue how to check them, much
 less install them. </p>
<p>So as far as I am concerned, Windows 10 is toast, unless I happen to find a guru or instructions on how to take care of drivers or what ever.</p>

            I should not have to search for drivers on a simple upgrade. Win 10 is useless if the audio is dead!&nbsp; Why would MS make such a bone headed move as to release an OS that kills the users audio and doesn't given any guidance. This is the same LAME support
 WIn 8 had.&nbsp; Losers!

            I hope so too. It doesn't look like anyone with this question is being helped.<br />
if this&nbsp;continues I am going to push until I can get&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;to respond&nbsp;because this a problem&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;seems to be ignoring and their laziness to address this problem is ripping people off and actually stealing their money.

Could this be because you are posting an xbox question in a Windows Security forum? I would try an xbox forum.

            I'll give it a try! however it isn't an&nbsp;Xbox&nbsp;question. I don't even own an&nbsp;Xbox.
<div>I can't agree to the Terms of Use because my windows ID <u>account</u> is still considered as a child's account.<br />
<br />
It is still considered a child's account because 6 years ago while signing up for&nbsp;Xbox&nbsp;live it was required to have a&nbsp;child's&nbsp;account linked to a parents account<br />
<br />
Once linked to a parent account the "child account" will always need permission from the parent account no matter what age you are.<br />
<br />
my problem as well as many others, is that we&nbsp;haven't&nbsp;been forced to use the "parent account" information in 6 plus years. So naturally with time, people change emails and forget old ones.<br />
<br />
Since it has been so long since most people have used the parent account, myself and many others were clueless about what to do when, in order to agree to the new terms of use, it required the parent account information.<br />
<br />
So after doing research, I found out there is really no way to recover a parent account if you don't know the e-mail/username of the account<br />
<br />
Google, yahoo,&nbsp;Facebook, nearly every other website has a way to recover an account you forgot the username to. So i&nbsp;believe even if it an&nbsp;inconvenience they should have some means of recovering the "parent account" so I, and many others can&nbsp;continue&nbsp;using&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;products.
 (If we can't agree to Terms of Use, we cant perform a large portion of important functions). I personally can no longer update download or use windows apps on my phone. Other people can't play&nbsp;Xbox&nbsp;live. So you understand why it is a big deal.<br />
<br />
So this isn't really an Xbox question, it is strictly to do with account recovery, or changing the status of an account (either one would provide a solution), and this forum is named "Security,&nbsp;Privacy, and
<u>Accounts</u>" so I thought this would be the right fit to my question.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Do you think there is a forum better suited for my question? because I am new to the Support Community.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the reply, and sorry for the long&nbsp;message, it did't seem like you fully understood my problem.</div>

Correct, I don't. What I do know is that this forum deals with questions that relate to Windows security. Your question appears to relate Microsoft phones about which I know nothing at all and about which I have never read anything in this forum - hence my
 suggestion that you might be in the wrong place.

            yo everyone, i had the same problem. my account, although im 18, was tied to my parent account, and i couldnt access this parent account since my brother, who created the "parent account" couldnt remember any of the details like security question and what
 not. but yesterday i called the&nbsp;(800) 4MY-XBOX and they transferred me to the support line i guess. and they took down my information, like my own gamertag and email, the parental email that i couldnt access, and my console id. and they sent it to their "investigation
 team" so they could determine whether to send me a reset password link. and today, i got the reset password link, and all is well. i actually got this problem fixed and would suggest that you guys call the number again. also, i would suggest that others who
 called&nbsp;(800) 4MY-XBOX weeks ago, should call them again, because they recently improved on their ability to help customers who had this problem.

<p>Mira te recomiendo que borres el archivo (Save) que está en tu disco duro y que vuelvas a jugar el juego. Para probar si puedes guardar el juego y cargarlo donde te quedaste.</p>
<p>Si borrando el archivo original, te sigue marcando el mismo problema, entonces tal vez sea un problema directamente con el juego.</p>
<p>Espero y se arregle tu problema, cualquier otra duda avisas...</p>

    <title>parental permission - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> microsoftmisery  say:</h3>
<h2>            parental permission</h2>
                    I spent a whole day with 2 different employees on a chat line. Why? Because when signing into skype they asked for dob for the first time; I was furious at the intrusion and put the nearest one to hand, i.e. 1st January 2018 and the next window said 'parental
 permission required...' etc and would not let me get into my skype. So it took two of them to finally fix it; all well and good and in fact, better, because when I clicked on the skype icon at the bottom of the task bar, I went straight into my contacts window.
 Yippee, until today, that is, when the sign in window came up again and I duly put in the skype name and password, and the parental permission window came up yet again! So I then signed in with an email address and a new password and got to the skype window.
 But now all my contacts have disappeared. Any advice? Why are Microsoft so intrusive and so incompetent?

                    <p>Toshiba Satellite A85 Celeron with XP Home edition. Windows will not start. I get Toshiba logo screen then it changes to black screen with cursor&nbsp; upper left corner. I have the recovery disk. Is there any way to save the HD without re-formatting and losing
 all the data?</p>

<p>Thanks;</p>

            If you run the Toshiba recovery application, you <span style="font-weight: bold">
will</span> lose all of your data.&nbsp; As the warning says, that application will restore the computer to the state it was in when it was first delivered from the factory.<br />
<br />
Without further diagnostic information, it is difficult to determine what is going on.&nbsp; Tapping the F8 key (<span style="font-weight: bold">not</span> holding it down) starting immediately after the power-on sequence should bring you to the Advanced Boot Options
 menu.&nbsp; Try it again, and repeatedly tap the key rather than pressing and holding it.<br />
<br />
The Toshiba Recovery CD you have probably does not permit a "repair install."&nbsp; Contact Toshiba to see if they will supply you with an appropriate CD.<br />
<br />
Given the fact that you can get someplace useful when you boot with the Toshiba Recovery DVD, my guess is that the computer is OK but that the hard drive has either failed -- or much more likely -- the boot information has become corrupted so that it will not
 boot.&nbsp; If you have access to a computer that has a CD-writer, download and create a non-Windows bootable CD.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
There are a number of bootable CDs available that include various recovery and diagnostic tools.&nbsp; You'll have to do some research to learn how to use the tools.<br />

If you feel overwhelmed by the tools and just want to recover the data and then use the Toshiba Recovery DVD, make yourself a
<a href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Knoppix CD</a> and use that to coy your data, preferably over a network connection.<br />
<br />
If all of this sounds like too much for you -- and there's no shame in admitting that -- take the laptop to a good local computer repair shop (not a BigBoxStoreUSA or GeekSquad type of place) and ask them to check it out and
