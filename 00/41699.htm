<h2>            Time and date don&#39;t hold</h2>
                    Every time I shut down my Asus netbook, the time and date revert back to a date in Jan, 2002.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can't go to any website unless I manually update the date and time because I get a security alert that the</div>
<div>website's certificate is not valid since the computer thinks it is 2002.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>No matter how many times I have changed it, it still shows 2002 the next time I start the computer.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you for your help.</div>
<div><br />

            Sounds like the CMOS battery on the motherboard has worn out and is not holding a charge.&nbsp; The CMOS battery lets your system retain it's settings when it is powered off.&nbsp; When they lose their charge or won't hold a charge, you will notice the symptoms
 you describe.&nbsp; These batteries usually last a few years and then need to be replaced.&nbsp; If your system is still under warranty, it may be covered.<br />
<br />
On some systems, replacing the CMOS battery is easy, but doing some Google searches on things like:<br />
<br />
<i>Asus netbook replace cmos battery</i><br />
<br />
Results in links that show it might be more complicated on your Asus (depending on the unspecified model).<br />
<br />
Here is a YouTube video (in the Catalan language) where the guy actually replaces the battery:<br />

http://www.jfwhome.com/2012/11/27/how-to-replace-the-eeepc-1005ha-cmos-backup-battery/</a><br />
<br />
You might look at some other Google results too.<br />
<br />
That looks like fun to me, but if that looks too complicated for you, you might need to take your system to a reputable repair shop (ask your friends if you are not sure) or find yourself a friendly geek to help you.<br />
<br />
If you go to a shoppe, be sure that you test your system for functionality before leaving the shoppe to be sure that you are satisfied things are working normally and all your data on the system is intact, you can get on and browse the Internet, shutdown and
 restart successfully, etc.<br />

            Thank you so much for your quick and very complete reply. My apologies for not getting back to you but there was illness in the family.
<div><br />
<div>It may look like fun to you but it is too much of a challenge for me. It looks like the 2nd site you sent me almost calls for taking the whole thing apart. I'm quite good at that, but not so good at putting things back with all the pieces.! I'll certainly
 take your advice and check a few other sites. Perhaps my eee pc is different from the one he's working on.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I've been resetting each time I've started it. I may just keep it like that until it dies since it has Windows XP which will lose Microsoft support this coming year. I don't think it's worth tracking down a copy of Windows 7 and I don't think it makes
 sense to load it with Windows 8.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you again.</div>

            I can relate since growing up, my mother would never buy me anything...&nbsp; no bicycle, no watch, nothing mechanical or electrical.&nbsp; I asked why not and she says "Because you'll just take it apart to see how it works and then you won't be able to get it back
 together".&nbsp; She was right.<br />
<br />
Just because MS is discontinuing support for XP doesn't mean that on April 8, 2014 suddenly every XP system in the world is going to cease to function.&nbsp; There are millions of systems in the world still running XP and will need to keep running XP.&nbsp; They just
 won't get any more security updates, non-security hotfixes, free or paid assisted support options or online technical content updates.&nbsp; These forums should still be around though since people will still need help with XP problems.<br />
<br />
I still have customers running Windows 95/98 and that has been "dead" for over a decade but people still like it and need help with it sometimes because they are used to it.<br />
<br />
And you don't have an XP problem anyway - you have a a hardware problem.&nbsp; You will still have the same problem with Windows 7/8.<br />
<br />
Your Eee may not even support Windows 7/8 (you can check it to see) but I can relate to your thoughts about not trying to fix what you have and don't know what a shop would charge to do the work - I think I would be reluctant to pay more that $32.48 USD but
 it may not be worth it to you.<br />

<h2>            Windows Store isn&#39;t working properly.</h2>
                    When I open my Windows Store, it runs okay, but when I try to install and app it doesn't respond at all. In fact I am not even able to sign in to my account as there is no response from the system after clicking the tabs in windows market.

    <title>windows 10 shortcuts in shared folder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> boyd anderson  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 10 shortcuts in shared folder</h2>
                    <p>why does it make a difference if a shortcut is created on the windows 7 and placed in the sharefolder on the windows 10 rather than created by the windows 10 computer?</p>
<p>In other words, I have created and shared a folder on the windows 10 computer, then placed shortcuts in the folder to files that are on the windows 10 machine. Another computer on the network running windows 7 should be able to access this folder and the
 files that the shortcuts point to. It can not. However, it can access the drive from selecting the computer and drive from the network, and then if the shortcuts are created with the window 7 machine and placed in the sharedfolder which is on the windows 10
 machine then clicking on the shortcuts from the windows 7 machine will open the file. This is confusing. Why won't the shortcuts created on the windows 10 machine work with the windows 7 machine?</p>

    <title>Cannot sign in properly after automatic update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lutz-nz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot sign in properly after automatic update</h2>
                    <p>While doing some work last Saturday I encountered a 'blue-screen' with Windows 8 and the computer had to be restarted. On restart it updated the computer with the latest (automatic update is enabled) MS updates. My log-in screen suddenly appeared blue instead
 of being in the colour I chose. Log-in still worked fine, but a moment after the usual 'Welcome' notice it suddenly said 'Configuring Windows' instead. When booting completed finally I had a blue 'Start Screen' with 3(!) icons on it: Desktop, IE, and Store.
 None of my installed programs appeared. When proceeding to the desk top I received an additional message that I cannot access my files as I'm a 'Guest'. Installed programs I used before and tried to start again responded all with the 'first time use' screen
 and wanted to be re-setup.</p>
<p>Trying to do a 'System Restore' and returning it to an earlier date started the process but did not complete and quit with error.</p>
<p>I need some serious help please. Has anybody got any ideas what might have caused this or how to fix it? Thanks heaps for any info!</p>

1. What is the exact and complete error message you get when you try to Sign-in?<br />
2. Are you logged in to the Microsoft account of Guest account?<br />

I would suggest you to boot the computer into safe mode. </span><span>Safe mode starts Windows with a minimal set of drivers and services. If a problem doesn't reappear when you start
 in safe mode, you can eliminate the default settings and basic device drivers and services as possible causes. I would suggest you to boot the computer in safe mode and check if the issue persists. Refer this link to boot the computer in safe mode:<br />

If the issue is fixed in safe mode, then I would suggest you to perform clean boot.

</p><p>Back to the problem:</p>
<p>Restoring the computer to an earlier date still doesn't work, and trying to undo a restoration attempt tried earlier doesn't work either.</p>
<p>This comes all with several different and in parts very long error messages which I have taken photos of and would be happy to send you if you contact me by email.</p>
<p>Some of these problems might relate to the fact that after booting finishes it says I'm 'Signed in with a temporary profile all changes you make will be undone next time you log in' etc., meaning I cannot even start to 'restore' my computer myself as I'm
 not recognized as the 'owner'. That alone leaves me already with a massive problem! My original log in name doesn't even appear anymore. Even though the password is still the same.</p>
<p>When I log in it says the usual 'Welcome', but moments later that welcome changes to 'Configuring Windows' which is resetting everything again and all attempted changes are gone.</p>
<p>Now is there any possibility that certain headers are missing or corrupt after the 'blue screen' and the on reboot MS update I encountered which started all of this?</p>
<p>I had a good number of blue screens before, and this is as well not the first time that there was an update on reboot. Just never with this result.</p>
<p>If so, is there any way of restoring this? As mentioned a few times, system restore never finishes and quits with several different error codes, depending on the restore point picked.</p>
<p>The most common ones are: (0x800703f1), (0x80070570) and (0x80070571). Always with the same message: 'System restore did not complete successfully...'etc. I used system restore once before. It completed well then.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is 'Sync Windows' the same function as in 'Google Chrome' which is possibly now the only unaffected program as it restores itself after log-in. Will 'Sync Windows' prevent things like this?</p>
<p>System restore obviously doesn't.</p>
<p>This is seriously horrible, especially at this time for me. I need the computer urgently back for work.</p>
<p>Any other ideas or help you can offer please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much, Best Wishes,</p>
<p>Lutz...(:</p>

            <p>Hello Vijay!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, a million thanks for your help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I'm sorry to report that again, the result of the scan is somewhat negative and my log-in problem still exists.</p>
<p>Here is what happened. Btw. I took another screenshot of the final result window.</p>
<p>I executed the SFC scan several times.</p>
<p>On the first 2 attempts the scan stopped at 50% and froze the system. I had to manually reset the computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On scan 3, this time this was the only function on the computer running it finally completed, but had the following message:</p>
<p>"Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them. Details are included in the CBS.log...etc... Note that logging is currently not supported in offline servicing scenarios"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not really sure what the last bit means, this computer is obviously permanently online.</p>
<p>Trouble after that completed scan was that I was only able to do 2 functions (like go to the Start Menu and then back to the Desktop before the system froze again.</p>
<p>Difference this time was that the mouse cursor was still working, but I couldn't engage anything. Clicking had no response.</p>
<p>So again, another manual reset. With the same log-in problem &gt;&gt;&gt; Welcome...then...Configuring Windows Aaaaargh...</p>
<p>So, scan 4, just in case...</p>
<p>Same result as scan 3, but this time I re-started the computer straight after the scan finished to try another fresh boot... this time the system froze during the 'shutting down' period.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is SO frustrating! I cannot log properly into my own computer. It is obviously malware if the scan is right and I'm speechless how this got past Windows Defender and ASC (iObit Advanced System Care / Purchased Pro Version) I'm running in addition to
 exactly NOT have these kind of things happening..</p>
<p>Have you got any more ideas what I could possibly do to at least fix my log-in problem so I can start re-building? As you know, I lose every alteration on restart. So even answering back to you means having to sync Chrome back etc.</p>
<p>If there is nothing else I can do I might temporary divert back to Win 7 and install this on another drive until the developer version of Win 9 is out at the end of the month as I will then install that on top of the existing non-working Win 8 version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And again, many, many thanks for your help!</p>
<p>Have a great day, With Best Wishes,</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Vijay!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started off with the developer version of Windows 8, pointing out a few big flaws within that OS. I gave an American technician from MS access to my PC to show him directly a few of those 'holes' Win 8 came with.</p>
<p>After that I had the 1st public test release. Then I bought the release version online in the US directly. That was the easiest way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I have to tell you that I'm surely NOT refreshing my system to 0! You have got NO idea how many weeks of fine-tuning of certain programs we are talking about here! I'm working several jobs simultaneously. From film and TV production to solar development
 and invention. Losing all those programs in a 'refresh' move is just not an option!&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I mean is, who will guarantee that once all is set back up after weeks of fiddling, the exact same thing won't happen again? ...and again... and again... huh!</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said in the last letter, the Win 9 developer version is planned to be released at the end of this month, followed by the first public release version just before Xmas etc.</p>
<p>I will wait for this to happen and then try to install Win 9 over the failing version of Win 8, which then hopefully fixes my problem.</p>
<p>For the moment I'm going to divert back to Win 7 which I will install as 2nd OS on another drive. At least that one WONT lock me out of my own system.</p>
<p>But to be honest, I think it is pretty poor (mildly said) by MS to be unable to fix my log in problem! There really SHOULD be a way! I bought this OP from Microsoft, THEY know I'm the owner, but everybody seems not to really bother too much about a situation
 where the rightful owner is locked out of his own OP in some tricky way which wouldn't even be possible would I not have to log into Win 8! That's exactly why for the moment I divert back to Win 7. At least THAT installation I am able to restore myself if
 ever anything happens again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But again, MS created this problem by starting the log in screen scenario. So PLEASE have a fix if something like this goes wrong! It happened OUT OF THE BLUE (into the blue) while I was working! Not by any funny program or whatever I haven't used several
 times before without all this! Just at LEAST SYNC the login process with the according IP.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If a new process is created, just make sure it REALLY IS secure, or if not, provide a solution how to fix this. Or REMOVE the process! Don't let people just hanging... NOT GOOD!</p>
<p>It's a bit much to say 'Oh sorry, you might have a few weeks of re-installing and fine tuning in front of you...'</p>
<p>This was obviously caused by some malware, a trojan or the like that Windows Defender didn't detect. MS promised protection! The SFC scan said that wasn't the case. There IS malware it cannot even remove. So Windows Defender failed!</p>
<p>Why am I feeling all let down and left alone here all of a sudden?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I surely know this is not YOUR mistake Vijay, but I would like you to pass this on. Maybe somebody, somewhere in the MS programming area HAS a solution as I don't think I'm the only one ever having this problem. If I would be working for MS I surely would
 try to create a routine re-establishing the original user name and password etc.</p>
<p>Once I'm all up and running with the essentials at least in Win 7, I will personally try to figure the log-in problem by my own means. I guess there is nothing left to break anyway! Except anybody has a solution as said earlier.</p>
<p>I don't think I mentioned that my first computer was a Sinclar ZX in 1974 and I haven't been without computer since. We started developing BBS systems with self made acoustic couplers (which later became modems) in the early 80's...</p>
<p>So I really MEANT it that I wanna figure this Win 8 problem out by myself if no one else bothers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But please DO let me know when you pass this on if ANYBODY knows ANYTHING about this, before I get the 'tool box' out in a few days myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much Vijay! You surely did your best! Sadly, none of the standard routines MS had in place had any effect. But that is surely not YOUR fault!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So thank you many times again for trying to fix this, have a great day and please DO let me know if anyone finds a solution or further steps to solve this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the Best!</p>

    <title>WIndows 10 icons disappear after sleep mode. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cardkleener  say:</h3>
<h2>            WIndows 10 icons disappear after sleep mode.</h2>
                    <p>I have been using Window's 10 for a while now. Last two days after I wake it from sleep mode the desktop icons are gone. I am unable to click on the shortcut icons also. When I do try to open google chrome it wont open. I have a magic jack phone and it won't
 operate either. When I hover mouse over icon on start menu it gives a preview that the window is open but it is still not on desktop (window is not visible on desktop) The menu icons on the bottom right also disappear so I cannot click anything there. Nothing
 happens when I right click on desktop.</p>
<p>My only option is to click power button and restart pc.</p>
<p>This is not an easy fix. Yes I have right clicked desktop and clicked "view desktop icon". Yes it is off tablet mode. I am unable to even put it to tablet mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have searched several forums and nothing seems to correct this issue so I at a loss.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Audio Glitch - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kendra_7  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Audio Glitch</h2>
                    <p>Have been experience all sorts of issues with my laptop. I fixed a video glitch then experienced an issue with my battery that has yet been solved. I've tried everything Windows wise so I guess I will try buying a new battery. But in all of this I reset
 my laptop (with keeping files) to see if that would solve the issue. It didn't. But now I have this audio issue. Which seems like something that would occur with a virus (although I doubt it could happen right after removing all non-Microsoft programs). When
 headphones are not plugged in the audio is scratchy and static-like. This happens then goes away and repeats. It stops when I disable then enable Speaker/Headphone in Sound. But it changes and goes back to awful quality shortly after. I've tried troubleshooting
 and different fixes, nothing has changed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is appreciated, thanks.</p>

            I've have done Hardware and Devices troubleshooting and playing audio/audio playback troubleshooting. Neither have fixed it. Prior to this issue I reset my laptop so everything was at default. Before the reset I updated my AMD radeon graphics driver.&nbsp;

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />I'm Diego Rios, an Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers. 
<br />
<br />If the battery didn't change, you can try to contact the manufacture in case you still got warranty on the equipment. 
<br />
<br />Also, check if the adapter is good condition, take out the battery from the device and turn on the computer, check the cables are plug in correctly. 
<br />
<br />Let me know if you recently updated your Windows? , also, check if it;s the original charger. 
<br />
<br />Also, you can try to turn on the notification with the procedures below: 
<br />
<br />Press the Cortana button on the taskbar to open that app. 
<br />Enter ‘Control Panel’ in Cortana’s search box. 
<br />Select to open the Control Panel,. 
<br />Click Power Options to open the tab. 
<br />Click Change plan settings &gt; Change advanced power settings.. 
<br />Double-click Battery to expand its settings. 
<br />Click the + beside Low battery notification to expand the options. 
<br />If the On battery and Plugged in options are off, select On from their drop-down menus. 
<br />Press the Apply button to confirm the changes. 
<br />Click OK to close the window. 
<br />
<br />Then, Configure the Low Battery Level: 
<br />Open the Power Options window again (which includes the battery notification settings). 
<br />Click Battery &gt; Low battery level 
<br />Select On battery and enter ’20’ in its text box. 
<br />Enter ’20’ in the Plugged in text box. 
<br />Press the Apply and OK buttons. 
<br />
<br />Please let me know if this helped and works. 
<br />
<br />Best Regards, 
<br />
<br />Diego R.

<p><strong>I recently did a re-install of Windows Vista Home Premium, being Australian, I set my locale as Australia, although I live in Malaysia (which is also where I bought Vista). I tried to activate it and it came up with the message:

<p><strong>I then changed my locale to Malaysia, restarted my computer and then re-entered the product key. The same error message came up.</strong></p>

    <title>Lenovo Y570 no drivers for Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lisandrovoyager  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lenovo Y570 no drivers for Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>When I finally upgraded my Lenovo from Windows 7 to Windows 10 in July 2016, the process if I recall correctly confirmed its compatibility. I've since endured intermittent screen freezing per "not responding" messages, and no videocam working. Moreover for
 11 days now I've developed a queue of failed upgrade installation attempts for version 1607 x64 KB4019472. After a lengthy session with Microsoft's customer support, their agent informed me that Windows 10 hasn't yet been tested for use on this Lenovo model
 and that it is best to uninstall it and revert to the prior Windows 7. It is true that model Y570 IS NOT SUPPORTED BY WINDOWS 10 AND THERE ARE NO DRIVERS; so after 10 months of enduring irritating snags, I'll revert to Windows 7. UPON DOWNLOADING WINDOWS 10
 the Microsoft compatibility step is WRONG and MISLEADING. Has anyone found a solution to run Windows 10 smoothly on the Lenovo Y570?</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Mobile - app whitelisting blocks core OS functions - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eric_baines  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Mobile - app whitelisting blocks core OS functions</h2>
                    <p>I have a Lumia 640, which I have upgraded from 8.1 to the latest Fast release of Windows 10 Mobile. These are corporate devices, so we apply central whitelisting of apps, using SCCM &amp; Intune. We had this configured well with 8.1, but we are experiencing
 some problems with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There is a long list of 'standard' apps that get blocked in the move from 8.1 to 10, so we already knew we had to update the whitelist to allow universal apps like Word, Excel, PowerPoint etc. There are some apps that seems to be part of the provided OS,
 that surprised us as being blocked (eg Mail, calendar, People, calculator, photos etc), but we have found them and added them to the list too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>However, there are some items that are right at the core of the OS, for which there seems to be no app, that get blocked. These include the overall 'Settings' option, VPN (within settings), Store, Messaging (SMS text). Also as we can't get into the Settings
 option, we can't refresh the Workplace settings, so can't update or even remove the whitelist - so we think we may have to factory reset and go back to the beginning :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me out in understanding how we might be able to use whitelisting, but still be able to access core Mobile OS functions like Settings, Store, Messaging etc?</p>

            <p>Many thanks for the reply. However, I'm afraid that won't help. The phone is being managed by the corporate environment and whitelisting is being applied. If I hard reset the phone, the whitelist will be removed and taken back to Windows 8.1 phone. However,
 when I go to Windows 10 mobile and reconnect it will be&nbsp;re-added.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We actually resolved most of the problem. In upgrading to Windows 10 mobile, many of the applications have been upgraded to universal apps. Finding these apps on the new app store means we can add them to the white list and they are allowed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, there remains one killer problem. The whitelist blocks access to the Settings function and all the functions beneath it (eg VPN etc). The settings function is not an app that appears on the App store, so we are unable to whitelist it, so it stays
 blocked. This effectively makes the phone unusable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas how to fix this would be very gratefully received.</p>

            <p>I have updated to the latest version of Windows 10 Mobile (<span style="color: rgba(84, 84, 84, 1)">10586) which is rumoured to be the RTM version.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(84, 84, 84, 1)">When you apply whitelisting, it still blocks access to the settings screen and all the settings beneath it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(84, 84, 84, 1)">This effectively means whitelisting cannot be used. In a corporate setup, this is a disaster, and means Windows 10 Mobile cannot be used by any corporation that wants to manage the applications on their devices.</span></p>

<p>Sorry - what with Christmas etc, this is the first time I've come back (not sure where my notification of a reply went...?).</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are still having this problem - have you had any luck at all?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We've tried it both on a 640 on the fast ring and also on a 950. They have both had all the necessary updates and each time they get an update, we try it again. So far, no luck - the settings menu and settings apps are blocked, and as don't know the name/url
 of the app, we can't unblock them by adding them to the whitelist. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This means we cannot implement whitelisting on Windows 10 Mobile devices, which means corporately we cannot upgrade to Windows 10 Mobile from Windows 8.1. It is awful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is any help available from anyone, I'd be extremely grateful!</p>

<p>
</p><p>As Windows 10 = Windows 10 (I know it is not that simple), I did wonder if the app name on a full Windows 10 PC might help. The Settings app there seems to be -
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows.ImmersiveControlPanel_cw5n1h2txyewy!microsoft.windows.immersivecontrolpanel</p>
<p>
</p><p>However that doesn't seem to have helped us on Mobile&nbsp;:(</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is incredible that something so basic has stopped us dead in our tracks to a corporate upgrade from Windows 8.1 Phone to Windows 10 Mobile!</p>

            <p>I'm having similar issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are using AirWatch to manage the devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I push the whitelist to the phone almost all of the apps are blocked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used the list of W10M app IDs <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt592643%28v=vs.85%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>&nbsp;to add apps such as Settings and Word to the whitelist but after the whitelist is pushed and applied to the phone the apps on the whitelist are still disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have around 40 WP8.1 devices and we don't want to roll-out any more until the W10M issues are fixed as there are going to be problems with users updating the OS. We want to wait until W10M is released for the Lumia 640 and then roll out the devices -
 up to 3000 of them!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Slightly off-topic but the other issue we have is that personal credentials certificates don't push to the device. This stops Certificate Based Authentication for Exchange ActiveSync working and also our VPN. In WP8.1 the certificate was delivered to the
 AirWatch Agent app for a manual install but in W10M it should automatically install. We have had to set up password authentication for the moment which means when the user changes their AD password they need to update it in two places on the phone which is
 crazy!<br />

</p><p>We have this issue too. Using Intune/SCCM to whitelist on Windows Phone 8.1, and it's working fine. Not so simple on Windows 10 Mobile.</p>

</p><p>I've got around many of the issues with Windows 10 Mobile by whitelisting publishers, Microsoft Corporation and Microsoft Mobile do the trick in the main. However, although the Store is published by Microsoft Corporation, when it's loaded it shows a message

<p>Looks like I have had some progress. I whitelisted all of the apps found at the above link. I used the Product ID and not the AUMID but they need to be
<strong>lower case</strong>. AirWatch have updated their console to convert any IDs entered in upper case to lower case and this has fixed the issue I was having.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue I am left with is that after whitelisting the Store app everything works fine but I can't sign in. I need to sign into the Store app first before applying the whitelist. I guess it's not a huge problem as most users will sign in during the phone's
 setup wizard before any MDM profiles apply to the device but it's still an annoyance.</p>

<p>But some of the updates, for example "glance Screen", "Microsoft-Telephone" and other&nbsp;, wich seems to be an OS function can not be updated. Also word, Excel, PowerPoint, wich are all on the whitelist, can not be updated.</p>
<p>all apps have the same Error Code <span>0x80073cf9!</span></p>

            Hi Bill, you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />You should just clean install Windows 10 rather than upgrading from Windows 7. This will have 2 benefits, if you have to reset again, it will reset to Windows 10, not 7 and your system will be more responsive and reliable . . . 
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media       
        </p>

            Good day ! I am an independent adviser here to help you!
<br />
<br />In most cases, you will have a situation like this and Windows 10 will be completely gone after you reformat. 
<br />
<br />In some cases, you will also be able to just install windows 10 again, connect  to the internet, and it will automatically retain the activation. 
<br />
<br />Go to Settings &gt; update &amp; Security &gt; Activation. Does this say that the activation is tied to your email account? If not, what does it say?

<p>First note that you can't reformat a computer. You reformat a disk drive,<br />
</p>
<p>Second, after reformatting a drive, there is *nothing* on the drive--no version of Windows and nothing else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I think you don't mean reformat, you mean do a clean installation of Windows (which begins by reformatting the drive).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please understand that I don't make those points to give you a hard time. Calling things by their correct names is always important, but especially when asking questions. If you use an incorrect term, you run the risk of being misunderstood and getting incorrect
 answers to your questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case, I think I understood you, but again, please learn the correct terms so you don't get misunderstood in the future.</p>

<h2>            Windows8.1 not updating. Got 149 updates and nothing works</h2>
                    windows 8.1 searches for updates, tells me I have 149 updates then says ' downloading' for about 4 days till I give up. I have run troubleshooting and it finds and fixes issues then I end up back to the same ' downloading. its driving me crazy. I have
 wiped the laptop and installed everything again but it still does the same. Any help would be appreciated.

<h2>            Windows XP does not recognize my passwords</h2>
                    
<p>I have windows XP home installed on my PC.&nbsp; Recently windows froze&nbsp;so I rebooted the pc and after the regular windows image I get an error message about the lsass.exe file ... sorry I don't have the exact message but it did have (000005) in the text.&nbsp;
<br />
-tried&nbsp;safe mode and get the same message before I can log in.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
-tried&nbsp;recovery mode, when asked to enter the admin password, windows does not recognize it<br />
-tried&nbsp;"net user" at&nbsp;command prompt to change&nbsp;password, windows doesn't recognize this command either<br />
-installed windows on another hard drive (D:), created a new user ID,&nbsp;was not asked to create a password,&nbsp;when I boot into this -version of windows I am forced to enter a password but none of my old passwords for this new user or the admin user, or&nbsp;blank, seem
 to work<br />
-i don't have an option to pick a help question<br />
Is there something I can do to get into windows?&nbsp; <br />
I need to get to some personal files before I format and reinstall - last resort</p>

            <p>I posted the Question below, but I have found the solution to my problem.</p>
<p>I previously used 'control userpasswords2' from start - RUN and then&nbsp;unchecked the box that says:</p>
<p>"Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer."</p>
<p>I thought this would stop User Account from asking for a password.</p>
<p>THIS&nbsp;ACTUALLY&nbsp;CAUSED MY PROBLEM.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>It&nbsp;might work for XP Pro, but it does&nbsp;not work in&nbsp;XP Home Edition. In Home Edition it still asks you for a password or it might give you this message on startup.</p>
<p>"Unable to logon because of an account restriction"&nbsp; </p>
<p>After finally getting back into my account. ( I lucked in after some reboots).&nbsp; I also got a lot of error messages in the error log (use Start-Help &amp; Support-Tool)&nbsp;that said this:</p>
<p>"The entry in the hash map cannot be updated. Context: Application, SystemIndex Catalog Details: A device attached to the system is not functioning. (0x8007001f) "</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have no idea what&nbsp;this means.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway,</p>
<p>I had to go back and rechecked the box from Start - Run&nbsp; - "control userpassword2"&nbsp; to have users enter a user name and password.&nbsp; After that,&nbsp; I went back to Start- Settings- Control Panel&nbsp;and then User Accounts.&nbsp;I clicked on each user account under Account
 to Change and&nbsp;deleted the user&nbsp;password.&nbsp; I now don't have to enter a password every time I log on, or if I switch USER Account.
</p>
<p>I hope&nbsp;you find this&nbsp;helpful and don't have to waste a day on this problem.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>------------------</p>
<p>I also&nbsp;have windows XP home installed on my PC with 2 user accounts. I use to be able to click on either user account and access my programs. Then, about 4-6 months ago, I was asked for a password. This must have happened after a MS update because I have
 not changed anything on my PC for years.&nbsp; I could not get it to accept 'nothing' as a password, so I created one and it worked.</p>
<p>After a recent MS update (last week), every time&nbsp;I want to&nbsp;access a User Account, I am asked for&nbsp;the password. If it times out to the Welcom screen or I want to switch user accounts, it asks for my password, but then it says&nbsp;Sorry.. Have you forgot your
 password?&nbsp; I have to reboot every time I want to access my accounts or access the second user account.</p>
<p>First, why is this happening when it never happened before? </p>
<p>Second, how do I fix it? </p>
<p>I would like to log in to a User Account without a password (Original setup)</p>
<p>Or, I would like to log in and stay logged in with a password. </p>
<p>I DO NOT want to reboot my PC every time I want to use my computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance. </p>

    <title>Found a Slime on Peaceful Mode - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wildattorney  say:</h3>
<h2>            Found a Slime on Peaceful Mode</h2>
                    I was playing Minecraft on easy mode in my slime farm and decided to save and exit. I loaded the game in Peaceful mode and when it finished loading, there was a slime approaching me. Because I was on Peaceful mode, his attacks did no damage. So from this
 experience it is apparent that there are at least some circumstances where you can encounter a Slime on Peaceful mode.

<p>I was in my friends world before the update and we had a slime spawn in on peaceful. It was a normal slime that broke into 4 smaller ones and then they each dropped a slime ball. Probably just a bug.</p>

<p>I've done some intensive testing in the Minecraft labs and discovered the following. &nbsp;If you have a spider, creeper, zombie or skeleton on your screen in anything other than Peaceful Mode (obviously) and, while those creatures are on your screen you save
 and exit, and if you then reload the game in Peaceful Mode, those MOBs will not be there when you load up the game. &nbsp;I think this makes sense to everyone. &nbsp;HOWEVER, if you have a slime on your screen in anything other than Peaceful Mode and, while the slime
 is on your screen, you save and exit, and if you then reload the game in Peaceful Mode, the slime (and any other slimes that had spawned near you before you saved) will still be there. &nbsp;Interesting, eh? &nbsp;Also, upon further testing, I have determine that, despite
 it now being Peaceful Mode, the slime can hurt and potentially kill you, but you do have the advantage in Peaceful Mode of moving away from the slime for a few seconds and gain some automated healing.</p>

<p>It may be because the only slime that can hurt you is the largest one. The others are probably still consider passive which then allows them to be there. The largest one being there is probably a bug.</p>

<p>I don't think size matters, because if it did, we would all be encountering those smaller slimes when digging on Peaceful Mode (even without a save/reload). &nbsp;And yet that doesn't seem to happen. &nbsp;In my tests, the size of the slime has no discernable impact
 on its ability to survive when the game is reloaded in Peaceful Mode. &nbsp;In fact, the large majority of slimes I've tested this on were the largest variety. &nbsp;We know that slimes are coded much differently from all other hostile mobs (i.e., they can only appear
 at certain depths and only in certain chunks of the map, they are not impacted by light in the room, and they split apart into smaller creatures when hit). &nbsp;I suspect that this coding difference has simply resulted in a bug whereby they survive in Peaceful
 Mode upon reload.</p>

<p>Slimes have a line in the coding that allows them to spawn (not the biggest though), but when on peaceful the game skips over that line.</p>

<p>The large and medium size ones can hurt you. The small ones might not hurt you but they can annoy you to death, especially in smp, when they glitch through the floor and push you around.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 USB Com Port Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ces_jjf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 USB Com Port Issue</h2>
                    <p>I'm working with a device that connects to the PC via USB and can be manipulated using a terminal software that communicates using the USB COM port. This works great in Windows 10, every time. I connect the device, it assigns the USB COM port, then I connect
 to it with the terminal software using the USB COM port number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I plug the same device (which I know works) into a Windows 7 machine, it never assigns a port number to the USB COM port. It shows in device manager as a COM port with no port number, and there is no tab for Port Settings in the properties. I've tried
 going to the Driver tab and updating the driver through Windows Update, but it just times out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've searched all over forums and found nothing helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What could be causing this?</p>

            I program an Arduino microprocessor through a USB Com port. It only works if I first install the com port driver in the form of an .inf file. Maybe you must do this installation on your Win7 machine before the port will work.

<p>Ya those laptops, I only replace drives and memory. They are hard to get apart. And most of them, you need special little tools or little tools to tear them apart. They also usually are snapped together in areas, so getting them apart is a ......... especially
 without special or proper tools.</p>
<p>Try a thin strong pocket knife to get between case panels and pop them apart. </p>
<p>But I warn you, you could break sections of it, especially thin areas like the DVD area and areas with the ports. And then you might leave a few scars on the case where you pried it apart.</p>
<p>
