<h2>            I have a dell laptop. how do i configure its touchpad&#39;s properties&#63;</h2>
                    I recently removed the touchpad icon from my notification area. How do I bring it back? I want to open the touchpad properties through it.

            Hello Prayanshu,<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You can simply restart your computer. If that doesn't work, click <strong>Start (orb)&gt;</strong> select
<strong>Control panel&gt;</strong> select <strong>Hardware And Sound&gt;</strong> select
<strong>Mouse&gt;</strong> your mouse and touchpad software window will open (example:
<strong>Dell</strong> <strong>Synaptics</strong> is mine) select <strong>Touchpad Tab</strong> were you can turn it back on or reset to default as well as adjustments to your devices. If these step don't work you may want to visit&nbsp;<strong>Dell's</strong> website
 to download your touchpad driver and reinstall it. Let us know either way if this helps you. Make it a great day!<br />
<br />

<h2>            How do you remove a &#39;ghost&#39; hard drive or the link to it&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Every so often I get a 'File History' notification that I have not backed up my files to a external h/drive?</p>
<p>Till I do so, the files will go on the internal hard drive?</p>
<p>When I check it, I find that File History is linked to a lettered external hard drive that is 'disconnected'?</p>
<p>It is a lettered external hard drive I no longer own, has not existed for some time, PC says it does: a 'ghost'?</p>
<p>Also when I select another external drive which does exist, to store the files, it can not find the drive?</p>

<p>My PC is running Windows 10, it does not have a 'Search' bar, so I went to, used Control Panel: Search?</p>
<p>Entered 'Troubleshooting' came up with 'Troubleshooting History' but not 'View All'?</p>
<p>Went to Hardware &amp; Devices, lettered external 'ghost' hard drive was not listed amoung the external devices?</p>

            <p>First of all , in windows there can't be 2 drives with same letters. So files will not go to internal hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not a ghost, if you want to remove, go to disk management and remove it from there and it is safe to do as you no longer own it.<br />
<br />
If you use the another external drive , you must use same alphabet for the that drive which can accomplished in disk management [changing disk alphabets].</p>

            <p>I followed your advice, went to 'Control Panel' View By changed size of 'Icons', went to 'Hardware and Devices'?</p>
<p>Two external drives I have USB&nbsp;attached to my Windows 10 PC showed on this page, along with others: printer etc.</p>
<p>One was a 'Mass Storage Device' CD/DVD the other drive is&nbsp;a expansion/storage,
</p>
<p>Neither are the 'lettered' drive I am being told by File History&nbsp;is 'disconnected'?</p>
<p>The File History error message maybe due to residual data, from a previous USB attached external drive?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use the USB attached&nbsp;external expansion /storage drive to store PC&nbsp;folders manually: copy &amp; paste</p>

<p>All screenshots are from Win10 1607 i.e. the Anniversary Update. Remember to set your view to Large or Small Icons and not Category, and you'll see the Troubleshooting option for sure.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Also, this old Control Panel is different from the new Win10 Settings app, in case you're confused. Just search for "control panel" via the Start Menu search box and you'll get there.</p>

<h2>            Comment to Microsoft on the Windows 10 1511 update</h2>
                    <p>Holy smokes, Microsoft! This innocuous-sounding Windows 10 Update 1511 is a whole new installation, right from square 1. Just like the very first time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Risky business. It appears that all of the drivers got reinstalled, for example. Including the download time, which was hours long in my case (relatively slow broadband link), this update may have taken longer than the original one. Because in the original
 one, at least Microsoft tried to pre-download that gymongous update file (2.7 GB, if I remember correctly).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I updated two PCs to the 1511 version, and aside from the long time it took, thankfully all went well. I'm just posting this to inform people that this update is more of a total replacement of Windows 10. I did not see this mentioned in Microsoft/community.</p>

            <p>I just updated to windows 10 ver. 1155, it caused 2 problems on my laptop. The 1st. problem was with my AMD display driver witch they fixed, the 2nd, My icon for my dvd rw is gone from under this pc, they want me too pay them to fix it, evan thoe its a win
 10 ver. 1511 that caused the problem, they wanted me to create 3rd sign in, when I allready know what will happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I ended the chat with microsoft answer desk. they should of left the win 10 alone, i dident have any problems with the previous version, now that they forced me to update to windows 10 version 1511, problem 2 wont be fixed. They should of let the previous
 version stand alone, and never put ver. 1511 out</p>

<h2>            Windows Live Mail 2011 with Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>I am running Windows Live Mail 2011 with Windows 7 for a Hotmail account, plus three others with Tiscali addresses. &nbsp;Microsoft have just announced they will no longer support Windows Live Essentials 2011.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can manage without the Hotmail account, but will my other three accounts continue to work on Windows Live Mail 2011?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to upgrade to Windows Live Mail 2012 and download the Microsoft latest update for this version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a laptop and tablet running Windows 10, but the built in Mail option is dire and virtually unusable.</p>

            <p>Thank you, for this very important information.&nbsp; Very few of my clients use Microsoft Outlook online, or any of its related email systems.&nbsp; So, I was unaware of this.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope there will not be a problem for the others who do not use Microsoft mail itself, like you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your case, I would recommend you upgrade to WLM 2012.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows/essentials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows/essentials</a> </p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said before, WLM 2011 and 2012 are not visibly different, but if you use groups, you will lose that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you first download Windows Live Essentials 2012.&nbsp; Restart.&nbsp; Uninstall Windows Live Essentials 2011.&nbsp; Restart.&nbsp; Install Windows Live Essentials 2012.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your WLM 2011 is working correctly, you will not suffer any loss of data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Live Essentials is actually a whole package.&nbsp; You likely only need WLM (which is part of it).&nbsp; You can select which pieces are installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft announces dropping support all the time.&nbsp; It seldom results in any lack of ability to operate&nbsp;for most people.&nbsp; Microsoft does this in order to reduce its staff.</p>

                    The look of my task bar was changed by a friend and I can't get it back to normal. The START&nbsp; button in the lower corner is sqaure now instead of round. When I have multiple websites opened and I point to the INTERNET EXPLRER icon on the task bar, the
 names of the websites appear instead of the picture of the website. Does anyone know how to fix this???

    <title>Removing an old Adobe Reader folder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davidk03  say:</h3>
<h2>            Removing an old Adobe Reader folder</h2>
                    Upgrading from XP to Win7, I knew I'd have to re-install the old programs I still wanted.&nbsp; One of them is Adobe Reader.&nbsp; Based on past "burnt fingers" when I re-install an application I install it to a new folder, to avoid any installation or operating
 conflicts between any old files and the new ones,&nbsp; and afterwards delete the old folder.&nbsp; Did that for Adobe Reader.&nbsp; Win7 allowed me to changer the old folders name (to adobe reader_old) and the new install went OK to the new folder.&nbsp; There are no registry
 links to the _old folder, since those were destroyed in the upgrade, and replacing them in win 7 is part of the install process. &nbsp; But later when I tried to delete the old folder, the system refused to allow it.&nbsp; I have a jpg screen image of the error message,
 but basically it was saying it required admin privilege to remove. Confusing, since I was logged in as admin.<br />
<br />
Things I have tried that did not work:<br />
- deleting the read-only marker on the _old folder<br />
- changing the user security privileges (full control allowed) and then deleting the _old folder<br />
- running explorer as administrator, then deleting the _old folder<br />
<br />
It seems that Adobe software - like Norton - takes the view that once installed, getting rid of it is next to impossible.&nbsp; Pretty poor PR image too.&nbsp; Nevertheless, is there any method you can suggest that will allow me to delete this old folder?<br />

            <p>An upgrade to win7 from winxp is via a clean install, none of your old folders would have been retained, unless you have a windowsold folder. (Unlike early win version upgrades)</p>
<p>Thus you simply install Adobe Reader under win7 and any other programs you need to install, you have no need to create specific folders or mess around with permissions.</p>
<p>(your old method would have failed/caused problems any way since the registry would have not been correctly updated)</p>

            For some years I've made a practice of partitioning my HDD by function (applications, data etc) and minmizing the non-OS contents of the C; drive.&nbsp; The advantages of this are basically that applications and data are preserved when the C drive corrupts,
 which is the usual case, and it has to be recovered from backups of managable size.&nbsp; When the upgrade was completed, I had a new active partition and OS, with all the old logical drives and their contents with no registry links between them.<br />
<br />
In this case an entirely new OS partition and the install of preferred applications from old disks was both advised and expected.&nbsp; Adobe is one such.&nbsp; As I explained in my original post, Ive found that installing over old folders may work, but more often than
 not in my experience there are small left overs that cause problems.&nbsp; Better to start - in building a new active partition with new registry entries for the new installed programs - with new application folders as well.&nbsp; And the new part of that worked fine.&nbsp;
 Removal of the old folders has also worked - for every application but adobe reader.<br />
<br />
The problem has occurred with the attempted deletion of an adobe folder on a recognised logical drive, and also one which with a changed name&nbsp; has no registry connections.&nbsp; Nothing I've done works - as outlined.&nbsp; And I'm asking for help to allow me to get rid
 of a junk folder that clearly doesn't want to go.<br />

            <p>You still dont understand. The upgrade to win7 is via a clean install, any of the winxp old folders will not be relevent to the win7 installation, even if they are on a seperate partition.</p>
<p>The practice of partitioning a drive to utilise a seperate partion for applications/programs is flawed.</p>
<p>If your win partition has a problem that neccessitates a win reinstall the programs will still have to be reinstalled, even if they are on a seperate partition. And that doesnt take into account the disk performance in having programs on a seperate partition.</p>
<p>Its also the case that even when programs are custom installed to a seperate partition files are still written to the win partition during their installation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do yourself a favour, clean reinstall win7 and in doing so delete all partitions and utilise the max space for the win installation.</p>
<p>Allthough you can use a seperate data partition, but if doing so you will need to relocate the win7 libraries</p>

            It was a clean new Win 7 install.&nbsp; There's nothing left of XP, what's on the other logical drives - all on 2 separate physical drives - is applications programs (like word, firefox and video studio) and related data.&nbsp; Doing it this way with several physical
 drives makes the machine actually faster, since the OS is on one HDD and all the programs and data are other drives, thus making the required access to get and store data much faster because one drive doesn't have its heads shuffling all the time. Reconnecting
 the programs to to the OS is what the application re- install is all about.<br />
<br />
Putting it differently, this folder delete problem would occur regardless of the drive organisation in place, whether it happens now or next year.&nbsp; I'd like to focus on that if we could.&nbsp; Delete on an adobe folder just isn't working, but it does/has on other
 'inherited' folders on the same logical drive.&nbsp; Admin privileges, and assigning full security control short term doesn't change that error result for the adobe folder.<br />
<br />
What will enable such a delete?&nbsp; or are you really saying you don't know why and can't help?<br />

            <p>To repeat, get rid of your programs partition (delete it in disk management), its of no use to you, and the folders have no bearing on your win7 installation and will not result in any performance increase.</p>
<p>Your previous method of creating a folder to install any new program version, then manually deleting the old folder would have resulted in registry issues. And if you persist in this method under win7 you will be creating further problems for yourself</p>
<p>Then install your programs under win7 (BTW what size is your win partition?)</p>
<p>Win7 is radically different to earlier win versions, what worked in the earlier versions will cause problems under win7</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On a side note, my main systems run 24/7 and have done since win2k days, the only time I ve had any win problem was when a drive failed. The current win7 installation has been running for 2 years without issue</p>

            Sigh.&nbsp; You said I wasn't understanding, but - with respect - you are not listening.<br />
<br />
There's more than one legit way to kill a cat, especially in computers,&nbsp; and I've tried not to obscure things with a lot of background detail.&nbsp; So, covering several items:<br />
<br />
Win7 upgrade.<br />
The upgrade to Win7 was painful.&nbsp; Especially so since the tool MS provided to convert Fat32 partitions to NTFS&nbsp; worked on every partition BUT C: - it flatly refused to work on my C drive. No reason or error code given. And since Win7 upgrade would not work
 on a non-NTFS partition, I had a catch 22 situation. &nbsp; With your colleagues assistance I got the Win7 upgrade disk to boot and worked thru an install process.&nbsp; It worked, but its going to mean a lot of follow on effort that has no bearing on the issue raised:
 for example, the way it established the active partition changed all the drive letters, which means I'll have to go thru all the applications (eg Word and where it finds the default document files etc) and modify the location where they will find their data..&nbsp;
<br />
System performance with multiple HDD<br />
I spent years in computer design and manufacturing firms.&nbsp; The design of the OS has no influence on the operating times of Hard drives.&nbsp; With the OS on one HDD and the programs and data they use on 2 others, the system performance is optimised (considerably
 compared to everything being on one HDD and single massive C drive) because a large amount of seek delay is eliminated.&nbsp; I've also had occasions when a physical failure or corruption of C meant a restore was essential.&nbsp; And because of the drive and disk organisation,&nbsp;
 that did not mean re-installing any applications or losing data.&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold"> I don't intend to change this either, since it has proven value, and I do not consider - and clearly so far have not been able to get you to consider - that it
 really has no bearing on the issue.</span><br />
<br />
Considering the folder deletion issue I raised:<br />
1.&nbsp; the "inherited" program drive is recognised by Win7.&nbsp; No issues with that at all.&nbsp; As soon as the OS loaded, there it was.<br />
2.&nbsp; That program drive has a number of folders for software items on it:&nbsp; one folder for each individual application.&nbsp; Some of them I will keep/re-install, and others - because of the features of Win7 - I will now delete.<br />
3.&nbsp; Every folder on the program drive initially had no connections to the Win7 OS.&nbsp; It was only as the applications are re-installed that any registry and other links are established.&nbsp; I have outlined the procedure I use and why:&nbsp; having the system die under
 me because an uninstall was not complete or the new application failed to fully overwrite its predecessor isn't a thrilling experience.&nbsp; I will simply note that programmers are more likely to break coding rules than follow them fully, particularly across different
 companies and over time,<span style="font-weight: bold"> and the process I use has proven value in avoiding that situation.</span><br />
4.&nbsp; Using Win7 I have been able to delete old unwanted program folders on the program drive without a problem - except for the Adobe folder.<br />
5.&nbsp; The Adobe folder is the only one requiring some form of admin permission to delete.&nbsp; Unfortunately I can't send you the screen image of that since there's no facility to attach a file here.<br />
6.&nbsp; No amount of admin access under the new OS - unmark folder&nbsp; as read-only, run explorer as admin, changing the degree of security to full control over applications etc - has permitted explorer to delete the folder.<br />
7.&nbsp; It seems obvious - to me - that the adobe installation marked the folder in such a way that the OS will respond as it has.&nbsp; It's MS' operating system, therefore its been my hope that MS would know how to delete it.&nbsp; The question is, what is that procedure?&nbsp;
 (the approach you've recommended so far is blast it all and start again, which really isn't acceptable, for reasons outlined, and it looks crude).&nbsp; If there isn't a way, I'll have to live with 80mb of unusable disk.&nbsp; Let me note that in this case it seems
 Adobe is able to game the OS so their software always stays there.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your assistance.<br />

            <p>I dont wish to be either rude or condescending but your concept of using a seperate partition for applications, when using win7 is flawed and will result in no end of problems in the future, not withstanding the adobe issue. I have never had a problem with
 upgrading a program/version. IMO you are causing uneccessary problems for yourself, which you are currently seeing.</p>
<p>I cannot understand why you had any problems with the win7 upgrade, since the upgrade will have destroyed C, I can only assume that you attempted a none upgrade install</p>
<p>To repeat, destroy your app partition, and install apps under the win7 partition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You still dont mention what size your win7 partition is, personally I would view anything less than 100gb as problomatic for the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can if you need upload a file or image to a file sharing site, eg skydrive, then provide the link to that file back here.</p>
<p>Your mention of win drive corruption is something I dont recognise, as stated all systems here run 24/7 the only time there has been any corruption was when a drive failed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can take it as you will, but IMO your fiddleing is causing more problems than a plain ordinary installation, and I hesitate to say but you appear to be locked into the win9* era.</p>
<p>But no matter we are never going to agree and your problems will be ongoing</p>
<p>Bye Bye&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Problem using wired headphones with Surface Pro&#63; Remove your protective case&#33;</h2>
                    Hello, Microsoft Community! I was having a problem getting my set of wired headphones to work with my Surface Pro. I knew I had used them before, and that I had trouble then, but discovered a simple solution. Unfortunately, it has been so long since I
 used them, I had forgotten the "trick". Today, I explored the Community for an answer, but found only a very old thread which did not solve the problem and which was locked. So I tried several things that didn't work. Then it finally dawned on me. The first
 step is to ensure that the headphone jack is fully inserted in the laptop. Duh. My laptop wears a heavy-duty protective cover. I removed the cover from the tablet portion of my laptop and reinserted the headphone jack. Success! As simple as that, I was watching
 and listening to Season 3 of "Stranger Things" in glorious, noise-canceling stereo while brick masons pounded on my exterior bedroom wall, replacing the brick! I hope this helps someone else with a similar issue. Sometimes, it re

<h2>            Copying takes more space than required</h2>
                    Hi everyone!<br />
<br />
I've been trying to move some files and folders (50 GB), to a drive that has (70 GB) free space, but after moving about about (30 GB) it gave me no free space error, and the drive icon showed that the drive is full and has 0,00 free space, it wasn't until I
 restarted the PC that the space came back, when I tried to continue moving what was lift, the same thing happened again and I had to restart again, after that I started experimenting and the same thing keeps happening on all drives, not on external drive though
 ?!?!?!<br />
<br />
Can someone please how to solve this annoying problem ?!<br />
<br />
Take care everyone ...&nbsp;

<p>Hi John, thanks for replaying</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a 1TB HDD split into 3 drives, the problem seem to be only on D and E drives, not on C the system drive, I just did what you advised me to do and the result on all drives was "no error found", did a restart and then tried again but the same thing
 happened again, I should also mention that my D and E drives are compressed but they've been like this sense forever "more than a year and half since I got this laptop" and I've never encountered such thing until recently after I updated to win 10 from win
 8.1, hope I gave you enough info, if more is needed I'm more than happy to provide.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the effort to help me, I really appreciate it.<br />
<br />
P.S: here is my laptop specification:</p>

<p>It also depends on the type of files you are trying to copy and the source drive format.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Files can be reported as to the byte size but 1 byte will use up an entire sector. If you have lots of small files in the source it can swallow up considerable more space in sectors than the amount needed for the files themselves. Specific filing systems
 can be more efficient then the NTFS used on most hard disks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many years ago I could not fit Windows NT onto a disk slightly larger than the CD it was coming from, at the times it consisted of hundreds of small files and would run out of space before copy was complete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Compressing the destination will stop that particular problem as would zipping the files into an archive.</p>

            Hi David.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />For some reason there are no changes provided for Font or type size in WIndows 10 Mail.  
<br />
<br />If you want to express your opinion on this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback. They will not even see it here. This is a tech forums staffed mostly by volunteers trying to help others with your problems. 
<br />
<br />You can post back here the Feedback Share link and I'll vote it up with my MVP badge FWIW.  
<br />
<br />There is also a registry edit on the web here you could try if you want to be experimental, but I would make sure System Restore is turned on first and set a Restore point so you can roll it back if needed:  <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-change-the-default-font-for-composing-emails-in-Windows-10-Mail-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-change-the-defau...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<br />
<br />For printers Rather than spending too much more time fiddling I'd simply Clean Reinstall the printer which always works, lasts longer and actually saves time:
<br />
<br />1) Power up the printer, if wired unplug it's USB cable from PC.  
<br />
<br />2) Go to Settings&gt;Apps&gt;Apps and Features to find and Uninstall the printer software.    
<br />
<br /> 3) Next copy and paste in Start search box:  printui /s /t2     (Note that there is one space before each forward slash).
<br />
<br /> 4) Right click result to Run as Administrator.   
<br />
<br />5) Open the Print Server properties, Remove the printer’s drivers for this printer and for any other printers you don't use presently.  If you get a message about access denied or the printer being in use and you cannot find the driver or any installed program that would account for this, you may restart the computer in a diagnostic startup and then use the printui  command to remove the driver package(s): <a href="https://www.isunshare.com/windows-10/enable-diagnostic-startup-in-windows-10.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.isunshare.com/windows-10/enable-dia...</a>
<br />You must restart back to normal mode before you will be able to install the printer again.  
<br />
<br />6) Now type Control Panel in Start Search, open CP, choose Icon View.  In Control Panel open Devices and Printers, right click the printer to delete the Printer and any scanner or fax of the same name.  Restart PC.    
<br />
<br />7) Go to the printer model’s Support Downloads webpage to download and install the latest full software package.  Now is also the time to check for any  newer printer firmware to install which matters a lot. 
<br />
<br />Older software may need to be installed in Compatibility Mode to run correctly:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-software-windows-10-compatibility-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-softwa...</a>
<br />
<br />8) Extract Printer software, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  Follow the setup screens closely as you install the software.  For USB it should prompt when to plug in the printer.    
<br />
<br />If you have further problems reply back with results of each step.

<h3> edkapalka  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 10 critical update problems</h2>
                    <p>Is Microsoft going to fix the problems they caused with their "critical update" with more updates? If so, then when can I expect it to be available? I have a 7 month old HP desktop with a Intel i7-5820 3.30 GHz with 16 GB RAM running windows 10. I loved
 this machine until 03/14/16 when It was "updated" and now I have start button issues, I can't get to my apps, the machine is so slow that my old laptop running Vista is faster!!!
</p>
<p>If I have to take this to a repair shop to get it fixed, then I will be seeking reimbursement of all expenses from Microsoft to make me whole again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is Microsoft's plan?</p>

            <p><span>Hi Ed,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand the inconvenience caused to you.
</span><span>We will help you to resolve the issue.</span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In order to help you better, could you please confirm a couple of things:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>What happens exactly when you try to open the apps?</li><li>Are you getting nay error message?</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I suggest you to follow the steps below and check if it helps.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: </strong>Windows has a built-in troubleshooter to check and fix issues with system. I would suggest you to run this troubleshooter to check if the issue is with your System Maintenance.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press Windows key +X, select Control panel.</span></li><li>Change the view by option on the top right to Large icons.</li><li>Click on troubleshooting and click on the view all option on the left panel.</li><li><span>Run the System Maintenance troubleshooter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2: Run the app troubleshooter.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to download and run the app troubleshooter from the following link and check.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong><span> Perform
<strong><span>System File Checker</span></strong> (sfc) scan.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>System File Checker</span></strong><span> is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions
 in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To perform SFC Scan, refer to the below link:</span></p>

</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Steps mentioned for Windows 8/8.1, will work fine with Windows 10.</span></p>

<div>
<div>Before the "critical update" I could left click on the start button and it would bring up an alphabetical listing of all the apps installed on the computer, to where I could select what I wanted, click on it and it would open and run the app...that&nbsp;no
 longer works...I cannot get to my apps.&nbsp;There used to be several "tiles" on the left side of the screen that would be like shortcuts&nbsp;for... weather...photos...computer...word...e-mail...and several others which I used all the time...that is not there anymore.&nbsp;I
 can get to&nbsp;my documents folder from the task bar. When I open a saved excel or word doc, the window will open but it will say "not responding" I will wait about a minute or so and then the doc. will open. Since the "critical update" my machine is so slow it
 reminds me of the old DOS. days. </div>
<div>I ran the troubleshooter...the answer...troubleshooting couldn't identify the problem.</div>
<div>I ran from the command prompt:&nbsp;sfc/scannow...the answer...windows resource protection did not find any integrity violations.</div>
<div>I have run troubleshooter several times with no results, &nbsp;I have run scan disc and&nbsp;defragment...every time it says it's OK. I have run windows update trouble shooting and it always fixes something.</div>
<div>I am not a computer nerd nor do I want to be...I left the DOS days years ago and have not looked back. I purchased this machine to replace an old XP machine which I never had a problem with. This machine is used for home, work and play...it is still under
 warranty from HP and I do except it to work as advertised, it was purchased with windows 10 already installed and after a few weeks getting used to it, I loved it. I no longer love it.</div>
<div>I would like to know what Microsoft is going to do to resolve this problem and make me whole again and...I am not going to be their field tech to&nbsp;"try this or try this or try this...this is wasting my time and I am done with it. This machine was running
 fine until the "critical update"...as far as I am concerned, Microsoft broke it, now they have to fix it. I live in Oviedo Florida...tell me where to take it so it can be fixed at no charge.

            The "critical update" was installed on either 3/13 or 3/14...the restore points only go back to 03/17. I cannot get to an earlier date then 3/13 or I would have tried it.

            <p>OK, so here is what I had to do (because Microsoft could not or would not come up with an answer)....before I take the machine to the computer shop to give them a chance to fix it I decided to do one last thing...reinstall the O.S.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This past Thursday evening,&nbsp;I reinstalled windows 10. I cleaned everything off of the machine that I could so I could save it to a thumb drive, then I did it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today it's Saturday morning and I can say that so far, everything is back to "normal" for me and the machine is fast again!!!! I wonder how long this will last? Until the next "update"? This is what I had to do to get me back up and running again...no big
 shout out to Microsoft...I don't know if it will fix anyone else's problems...good luck&nbsp;with this as it looks like you are on your own at this point.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows Host Process using excessive data - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sir-ratt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Host Process using excessive data</h2>
                    <p>Brand new Asus G75 laptop with Windows 8 Pro.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've noticed that for the past few days since I purchased this laptop, I'm using excessive data on my Verizon Wireless&nbsp;account - to the tune of 2.6 GB the first day.&nbsp; I determined this by checking Internet Data Usage in my Cradlepoint MBR-1400.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On following days, I'm not using as much, but I'm still concerned that Windows Host Process is using 55% or more of the internet data for a 24 hour period.&nbsp; I determined this from McAfee Traffic Monitor - Traffic Use.</p>
<p>For the past 24 hours:</p>
<p>Host Processes for Windows Services - 56%</p>
<p>Eye-Fi Helper - 22%</p>
<p>System Process - 11%</p>
<p>Device Association Framework Provider Host - 2%</p>
<p>Other Programs - 9%</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assuming my browsing using Internet Explorer account for the "Other Programs", Windows is using over 70% of my data allowance.&nbsp; These percentages are outrageous!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So my questions are:</p>
<p>Can I turn this excess use off?</p>
<p>Is there any way to block the ports for these services either in Windows Firewall or McAfee Total Protection?</p>
<p>If I do block the ports, what are the consequences?&nbsp; I understand I can't block some of the common ports like 80 or 443, but what about others?</p>

            <p>Think I'd get rid of McAfee and stick with windows defender.</p>
<p>Then look at the task manager&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; App History&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; let it sit for a few minutes to populate its counts.</p>
<p>You might find that Disabling some of the Apps saves quite a&nbsp;large chunk&nbsp;of your daily network use.</p>

            <p>Thanks.&nbsp; I'm not used to the new task manager and some of it's features like App History.&nbsp; Useful information there, but is there any way to pull the same kind of data for system overhead?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>App History says less than 20 MB for current user account over the past three days.&nbsp; Verizon and my router say there's been a lot more than that coming from this computer.</p>

            <p><span>Hi</span><span>,</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>How did you try to reinstall Windows Media Player?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What exactly are you referring to "Will not allow "?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What "troubleshooting tips” have you tried so far?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Does the issue occur with any file that you play using Windows Media Player or with other application as well?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do you face any audio issues outside Windows Media Player?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Which version of Windows Media Player are you using?</span></p>
<p><span>Windows Media Player is a component within Windows Vista. In other words, Windows Media Player 11
 comes integrated with the Windows Vista Operating System and hence there is no download available to re-install it. It’s not only Windows Media Player; any system components which are integrated within the operating system are not available for downloads.</span></p>
<p><span>If the music or the audio breaks up when you play it in Windows Media Player, there might be a problem
 with the audio driver installed on your computer. Typically, this type of problem only occurs toward the end of songs.</span></p>
<p><span>In some cases, you can work around the problem by disabling optional speaker effects that are collectively
 known as enhancements. If disabling speaker effects solves the problem, you might need to update your audio driver.</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest that you follow the steps in the below article to fix this issue:</span></p>
<p><b><span>‘How do I stop my music from skipping or breaking up when I play it?’</span></b></p>

<h2>            Unable to create a recovery disk on my new laptop - Windows 10</h2>
                    <p class="contentHeader2">I have just purchased a new Dell Inspiron 5558 laptop with Windows 10 installed on it and after setting it up ready to use I tried to create a Recovery drive by clicking "Create USB Recovery Drive".&nbsp; I tried this several times and
 got the same error message each time: <em>"We can't create the Recovery Drive &amp; A problem occurred when creating the Recovery Drive".</em>&nbsp; The three USB devices I tried worked fine with my old laptop and I was able to copy some files from the Dell drive to
 each of them so the USB soclets &amp; the portable USB devices are working ok.<span><span><br />
</span></span></p>
<p class="contentHeader2">Is there an issue with Windows 10 that is causing this problem or is the problem with Dell?</p>

<p>
</p><p>(I had recently changed my Microsoft's account password)</p>
<p>
</p><p>MY SOLUTION was:</p>
<p>in the "Account Settings", there was a link for "validate this computer" (or something like that).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to enter my password again, got the text on the phone with the code, etc.</p>
<p>

</p><p>Hello OVERIDE97,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You can earn Xbox Live Rewards Credit in two ways:&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>
<p>1. By finishing the offers located on the&nbsp;MyMissions&nbsp;page at&nbsp;<a href="https://rewards.xbox.com/mymissions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://rewards.xbox.com/mymissions/</a>&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>-or-&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;For non-offer purchases, you can earn Credits by earning a one star&nbsp;MyVIP&nbsp;level through purchasing at least $300 USD or regional equivalent of eligible content. After you receive your first star you will begin to earn a percentage of your eligible purchases back as payback Rewards Credit. Pre-orders,&nbsp;in-game consumables, and subscriptions are not eligible for&nbsp;MyVIP.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>
<p>In&nbsp;September 2014&nbsp;we changed to the MyVIP policy.&nbsp;As a result, payback based off Gamerscore (MyAchievements) was discontinued.&nbsp;Also, as of July 2014, we do not award Credits for Xbox Live Gold renewals.&nbsp;MyVIP&nbsp;has a recalibration every year. At the end of the year, we place you in your&nbsp;MyVIP&nbsp;rank for the new year based off your eligible spending from the previous year, and set your progress to the default state. This happened in September 2015 and December 2016.&nbsp;You can check your current MyVIP level/progress at (<a href="https://rewards.xbox.com/myrewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://rewards.xbox.com/myrewards/</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>We see multiple payback events for your eligible purchases. Keep in mind that as mentioned, pre-orders are not eligible for MyVIP.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Regarding Games on Demand, only purchases made during the offer period are eligible for the offer. Since only your pre-orders of Dead Rising 4 and Call of Duty were within the offer period, you only received two punches, and therefore did not complete the offer.</p>
<p><br />

 Which I think it's the reason.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f066146c-c55f-4a46-b068-ae506eb581e4" /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/adbed960-a92a-477b-9db0-736fb381d8fd" />&nbsp;any
 thoughts?</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply, no reminder work at all.</p>
<p>* About my settings they're below.</p>
<p>* I ran the sfc it's all ok.</p>
<p>Is my thought about the red message in the first pic. (previous post) the real problem? because it's preventing me&nbsp;from (ON, OFF) the app. notifications.</p>
<p>Thanks again!</p>

<br />
===================================</p>
<p>That could be drivers&nbsp;although antivirus/antispyware/security programs and other hardware
<br />
are also probable causes. Updating the major drivers and BIOS&nbsp;would be the best plan of
<br />
attack. If needed also try uninstalling your antivirus/security as a test.<br />
<br />
<br />

<p><strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.<br />
<br />
</strong>This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (BIOS and major drivers with memory
<br />
testing methods below.)<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.
<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,
<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model
<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate
<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -
<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party
<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device
<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for
<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after
<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually
<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers
<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as
<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check <br />
manually by model. <br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above is preferred
<br />
to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html</span></a><br />
<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows
<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be
<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then
<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

</p><p>I am having this same issue with my HP Pavilion Notebook. Windows will not install the latest update for me. I bought this laptop two months ago and am worried that something will make it crash if I proceed to update. I had a laptop that wasn't two years

<p>BethyK, I would look at HP's discussion boards or use online search for answers to some of&nbsp;those concerns. What that message appears to be saying is that the BIOS (internal control program that starts you computer PRIOR to Windows, loading all the necessary
 commands to start the computer) is not compatible with the latest version of Windows 10. Updating the BIOS version incorrectly can cause errors that require service to the computer by a person that knows how to fix it...not a job for the novice. If your computer
 is still under warranty with HP please seek that assistance from them, however, if the model was not released with Windows 10 there may be no guarantee it can work with future versions, regardless of what has worked in the past.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which version of Windows was installed originally (that you changed to 10)?</p>
<p>How did you get through the BSOD problem?</p>
<p>Did you end up performing a 'clean installation' (getting rid of the old data and starting from a newly formatted disk)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most importantly, what is the model number of your laptop and can you date the machine from the codes listed on the machine or in the BIOS?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the last 10 years or so the BIOS type has changed to what is called UEFI. If you do not have this it could be possible that is what the warning is about.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These things are very important to know.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I am worried about the inappropriate wording in the dialog you posted, "uninstall and continue" ought to be "update the BIOS and continue".</p>
<p>
</p><p>
I suggest you go to your computer maker's support website for your computer model and download their latest BIOS version [which they might describe as being the "computer firmware"&nbsp;rather than&nbsp;"BIOS" but that is not a problem].&nbsp;
</p><ul>
<li>All BIOS updates come from the relevant computer maker &amp; Windows update merely acts as a convenient distribution channel for it.&nbsp;
</li><li>It is never wrong to get BIOS updates directly from the computer maker as long as you make sure that you get the BIOS update for the correct computer model.</li><li>The computer maker&nbsp;will provide installation instructions without which you should not proceed because the BIOS is a vital component upon which the entire computer depends.&nbsp; The instructions will, hopefully, just say download it then run it but they might
 be a bit more involved &amp; include explanations of what the installation will actually do.</li><li>If these instructions describe one part of the procedure as being "uninstalling" BIOS then that's fine but I think it is more likely that the whole procedure will simply be described as "updating" the BIOS.</li><li>I am not trying to say that MS are not competent enough to run the BIOS update but the text given by the warning leaves a lot to be desired [BIOS is never uninstalled, it is only ever overwritten with a new version] so it hardly inspires confidence.</li><li>BIOS updates are not unusual.&nbsp; My latest computer is six months old and I have had two BIOS updates.&nbsp;
<em>Part of the significant improvement in Windows security [protection against hackers &amp; malware] is a result of the significantly increased integration between OS software &amp; computer hardware.</em></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Once&nbsp;you have completed the BIOS update you can run the Windows update again &amp; it should proceed without any worrying warnings.&nbsp;

            I'm having this same issue and it does say "uninstall" not "update".&nbsp; Very concerning indeed.&nbsp; It even has "manually uninstall" beside it - but it's greyed out.

<div>Hi,</div>
<div><br />
Which game are you playing?</div>
<div><br />
Let’s try these steps:</div>
<div><br />
a.&nbsp;Run the game.<br />
b.&nbsp;If you automatically sign into a profile then create profile button will not be shown. So we have to log out of the profile to see a different set of buttons.<br />
c.&nbsp;Now we can see the profile buttons, &amp; you need to click the highlighted button “<strong>Create New Profile</strong>”.<br />
d.&nbsp;In the dialog box, scroll down to the bottom paragraph.<br />
e.&nbsp;At the bottom paragraph there is a hyperlink for creating a local profile. Clicking the link will<strong> create a local profile</strong>.<br />
f.&nbsp;Name the profile &amp; click the <strong>Done</strong> button.<br />
g.&nbsp;If you want to customize the profile, then you can do it here. If you want to do that later, you can. Click the highlighted button “<strong>Done</strong>”.</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>You may also try contacting windows live team.</div>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Basically, when you start the game on your PC, it'll ask you sign in or create a Windows Live account so you can contact your friends, save games, etc. for that game. However, some either don't have access to the internet or don't want an online account,
 so the game allows you create an offline account so you can play the game, but you won't have access to the features Windows Live provides.<br />
