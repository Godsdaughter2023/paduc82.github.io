            <p><span>Hello Berry,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand you need assistance regarding Microsoft Visio compatibility with Windows 10. I will certainly help you with this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Windows 10 is designed to be compatible with the vast majority of Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 devices, so your device is most likely compatible.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For details on your specific device and apps, you can use the <strong>Get Windows 10 app</strong> to do a compatibility check.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Get Windows 10 is an app that’s designed to make the upgrade process easy. It checks to make sure your device is compatible, and it reserves your free upgrade; it also has information to help you learn about the features in Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For devices running Windows 7 SP1 or Windows 8.1 Update with Windows Update enabled, the app shows up automatically as a Windows icon in your system tray at the bottom right-hand side of your screen.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Click the <strong>menu</strong> in the upper left of the app, and select “<strong>Check your PC” or “Your PC is good to go</strong>.” This displays any compatibility issues we find and recommends a resolution; while we don’t have info on every app
 or device in existence, it provides a comprehensive list of all known potential compatibility issues.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Some Windows 10 features will require advanced hardware and not all features and services are available on every device, nor in every market. For instance, Cortana is not available in all markets.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For information, please refer to the below Microsoft articles:</span></p>

    <title>using wireless keyboard 5000 with KVM switch - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joea53  say:</h3>
<h2>            using wireless keyboard 5000 with KVM switch</h2>
                    I have an IODATA KVM switch which has a USB port for the keyboard and a USB port for the mouse<br />
<br />
With the Comfort Keyboard 5000, I received a keyboard, mouse and one USB dongle. No matter which of the 2 USB ports on the KVM I plug this dongle into, I cannot get either to work. As a reference point, the wireless set both work fine with the one dongle pugged
 into a computer USB directly - both my XP machine and my Windows 7 Machine. At the same time I plug my USB keyboard and USB mouse into the KVM ports and both work fine.<br />
<br />
I just cannot find a way to plug the dongle into the KVM switch to get EITHER wirelesss device working through the KVM.<br />
<br />
How do I get this set to work with a KVM switch.<br />
<br />
I saw one answer that referenced a ConnectPRO UR-14+ but that runs alot more than the keyboard itself. Is it guaranteed to work the Comfort 5000 pair through it?<br />
<br />
Is it that the IODATA KVM GCS832U will never work with this keyboard/mouse combination?<br />

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OK - I have to eat some humble pie here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have been a bit too impatient. It takes a moment or 2 for the transmitter to be recognized and the drivers load up when the transmitter is plugged into the KVM switch - and then,<strong><u> only if I insert it into the mouse port</u></strong>. Eventually,
 I get the "new hardware found..." messages and both the keyboard and mouse work. If I switch the transmitter to the keyboard port on the KVM, nothing works,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scroll Lock key does not switch machines...</p>
<p>I don't know enough about the&nbsp; new keyboard functions, but everything I try&nbsp; seems to work
<strong><em>except </em></strong>that when I press the "Scroll Lock" key, the "Scroll Lock ON" or&nbsp;",,, OFF" message echos to the screen but the KVM switch does not interpret this to switch machines so now I am in a different problem mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the Transmitter plugged into the Mouse&nbsp; port of&nbsp;the KVM, and my old USB keyboard plugged into the KBD port of the KVM, I can at least use that Scroll Lock key to switch machines and both the Keyboard and Mouse on the 5000 set work on both machines.</p>
<p>SO where do I go from here? I have reduced the problem to interpretation of the Scroll Lock key through the KVM switch. In between both products.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&nbsp;will need to&nbsp;ask IOGEAR some questions. I will report back here with what I find. In the meatime, do you have any idea of what might be&nbsp;different with the with Scroll Lock key. Is there a setting I can apply to the keyboard setup that might change my luck?</p>

<p>I have a workaround setup for now using my GCS632U and a spare USB keyboard. After researching IOGEAR site, it looks like this is an emulation situation.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IN the GCS632U ports, I have the&nbsp; 5000's transmitter in MOUSE port and a separate keyboard in the&nbsp;KBD USB port. With this setup, the Wireless 5000 works with both computers (W7 and XP). I keep the spare keyboard off to the side and use that keyboard's Scroll
 Lock button to switch computers. Klugy but it gets me operating unti and IF I can come up with a solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are there other KVM switches that have been tested with the Wireless Comfort Desktop 5000?</p>

            <p>Hello Joea53,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will need to search through your favorite search engine for a KVM that supports wireless devices – the majority of them do not.</p>

            <p>OK I called IOGEAR... the only real problem I am running into with the GCS632U is that the wireless keyboard and mouse must have the transmitter plugged into the MOUSE prot of the KVM to work. EVERYTHING works when this is done EXCEPT the Scoll Lock to switch
 monitors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently, I have a USB keyboard plugged into the KBD side of the KVM switch And I keep that handy to use ITS Scroll Lock to do the switch. The wireless keyboard and mouse on the 5000 works great!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SO the problem boils down to recognizing the Scroll Lock for switching,</p>
<p>&nbsp;but they have a $24 solution to the situation. They have a 2 port KVM with a manual remote swithc button and this setup WILL work with the wireless. All I need to do iskeep the rmote swith nearby and use that button to switch instead of the keyboard Scroll
 Lock button. Not a real bad solution actually... so it CAN be done... and for a very small investment...</p>

            You're right about the GCS632U.&nbsp; The class of the KVM switch is so called "emulation" type KVM switch - which means the console mouse port can only plug in mouse only and console keyboard port only can plug in keyboard only.&nbsp;&nbsp; This kind of KVM switches
 do not support combo devices -such as the MS wireless 5000 which have only one wireless receiver for both keyboard and mouse connection.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
If you want to completely solve the issue of your case - using wired keyboard for only using the hotkey - which defeat the purpose of using KVM switch, then you should look for "DDM (Dynamic Device Mapping" type of KVM switches.
<br />
<br />
DDM KVM switch is a total new class of KVM switches which do not using "emulation" but<br />
true device mapping core&nbsp; that means does not matter of what type keyboard or mouse (wired, wireless, single or combo)&nbsp; you plug in the any of DDM console ports, it will map the devices to each connected channels.&nbsp;&nbsp; Please google "DDM KVM switch" and you will
 find more detail in that.&nbsp;&nbsp; The DDM KVM class switch is the only KVM switches fully support wireless keyboard mouse combo (such as Microsoft's Remote Desktop lines and Logitech's Unify Receiver Lines).
<br />
<br />
I'm not to push you to replace your KVM switch but want to know the core technologies behind different classes of KVM switch.

    <title>Windows 10 Hijacked GUI&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Hijacked GUI&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My friend's PC is having an interesting problem. When it boots up, a user interface that I've never seen before appears (see image below). The standard Windows Desktop is hidden behind this screen. Sometimes you can see the Desktop, but only for a split
 second before this screen takes over again. This screen appears in normal boot and safe boot. I've looked at (and uninstalled all unnecessary) programs, to no avail. I don't see anything unusual in Task Manager. This PC was operating normally a few months
 ago, but my friend doesn't know what he did to put it into this mode. Any help would be well received.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dave</p>

            I notice that tablet mode is ON- which is making you feel it is a strange GUI. Just click the Icon to the right of time(Action center) and set tablet mode to off.

<h2>            Native boot windows 7 ultimate on VHDX - boot configuration is corrupt</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been searching around for this but there's seems to be no answer and so I hope Microsoft tech support can help me answer this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a PC which I want to dual boot windows 7 Ultimate and windows 8.1 Professional, both on vhdx.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First I installed windows 7 ultimate onto a VHD and it is able to boot natively.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then install windows 8.1 professional onto a VHDX and now it can dual boot both win7 and win8.1 natively (vhd and vhdx respectively) with win8 boot menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I boot into win7 and installed kb980218 (to support 4096 disk), and converted the image from vhd to vhdx and set the physicalsize to 4096.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next the boot entry has been amended and point to this new win7 vhdx.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However when I try to boot into this new win7 vhdx, it doesn't boot up and instead goes into recovery mode, the error is "boot configuration is corrupt" when trying to repair it. FYI, booting into win8 vhdx still works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is given the system partition boot environment is windows 8.1 as in this case (requirement of native boot), can you natively boot windows 7 in vhdx????? If so how to make this work? (there should be no difference to the guest OS whether its'
 a vhd or vhdx and so given the boot environment is windows 8, my guess is it should work)</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if not, can windows 7 install in vhdx and run inside a virtual machine (e.g., with Host OS as windows 8)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>John</p>

<p>What were the results of trying this on another machine?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it still did not work then it may be wise to contact the manufacturer and check with them on the Hardware/Software reqs for the device and to see if there are any diagnostics for it.</p>

            Hi Pojler, 
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Then, double click it and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .       
        </p>

<p>I also tried both approaches. From Upgrade Assistant as well as from the ISO (via Windows 10 in-place upgrade).</p>
<p>
</p><p>this error occurred during both installations. During the restart phase, the installation rolled back.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/upgrade/setupdiag" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
SetupDiag.exe</a><span> (from Microsoft) and got the following information from "SetupDiagResults.log"</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Error: SetupDiag reports DISM add package failure.<br />
DISM Error: 0x800f081f<br />
Package = Add [1] package C:\$WINDOWS.~BT\DUImageSandbox\Microsoft-OneCore-DeveloperMode-Desktop-Package~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~.cab<br />
Add Package Error: 0x800F081F</p>
<p>
</p><p>With that information and a hint and guidance from this
 that "Developer Mode" might be causing the update failure. <span>I therefore disabled the Developer mode in Settings and removed the Windows developer mode package from the Apps &amp; Features settings, and after this the upgrade worked. (I have after
 the upgrade enabled developer mode again and this works perfectly)</span></p>

<h2>            Any way to repair corrupted cluster after Windows 10 upgrade&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I upgraded Windows 7 to 10 a few days ago &nbsp;and lost all of my documents and photos (more than 200 GB data). For some data I had back up but for others I didn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran Stelllar Phoenix Windows Recovery and recovered about 2/3 of them. But it appears that some clusters are badly damaged and the software can't recover them. If anybody knows a way to repair those clusters or knows about software which might be able
 to recover data from those damaged clusters, please let me know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For documents, I will be able to remake them but I won't be able to retake the same photos so ... I don't have a high hope but ... Will appreciate it!!!!!!</p>

<h2>            Decryption problems in mass effect trilogy</h2>
                    I recently bought the mass effect trilogy,when I try to use manual decrypt even on easy it automatically fails me like I'm not hitting the right button my skill is plenty high enough and I'm hitting the right button as soon as it lights up so I know it's
 not a speed issue. Anyone else having this problem?

<p>If you take any damage from anyone or if you look even the slightest in another direction you will fail the manual decryption. If this doesn't help then it won't matter anyway because you'll start getting so much loot you can convert it to omni gel.</p>

                    I log on to skype with a user name and not with my email account. Skype has recently upgraded and now it is asking for a verification code once I log in. It says it will send the verification code to my email account, but no email arrives. How can I resolve
 this? Thanks.

<p>Thanks, Azzurra.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read the information in the link you've sent above and the email account to which the code is meant to be sent does finish in @hotmail.com, so I followed the advice on the link and logged into my email account in a new window in privacy mode and then re-installed
 Skype and signed in to Skype with the usual username and the message about sending the verification code to my email account came again, but I pressed Next and no email arrives in my email account in the privacy mode window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what else to do. What kind of security is this that prevents the owner of the account from using the account?</p>

No one seems to read my messages I replied using a pop up box I got <strong>NOTHING</strong> back.&nbsp; I was explaining that I did not wish to proceed with adding Windows 10, I also said I am an 82 year old lady. I have a good grip of using a laptop and our iPads
 but as I went through the different things to change I was getting very confused. I asked to go back to my old windows 10 which I found okay to use. When I saw upgrade I thought it was going to be like adding an app but O dear me it was nothing like that.&nbsp;
 Could I please ask if someone would explain in laymen's terms how I remove the parts of the window10 that have possibly downloaded now, and then tell me how to get back to the old windows 10.&nbsp; I would be so grateful.&nbsp; this message will be sent by the<strong>
 BLUE REPLY. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; I have spent from Friday trying to download the programme and have got nowhere except frustrated. &nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.

    <title>Task Scheduler &#123;Local&#125; error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> saturn711  say:</h3>
<h2>            Task Scheduler &#123;Local&#125; error</h2>
                    Using Windows 7 Home Premier Edition. When I open Task Scheduler, in the both the "Task Status" and the "Active Tasks" sections, I get the error "Reading Data Failed". When I click on "refresh", I get the error "The selected task {0} no longer exists.
 To see the current tasks, click Refresh."<br />
<br />
When I click on "Task Scheduler Library", everything shows up. Is there a solution to this?<br />
Any help or info would be greatly appreciated!<br />
Thanks

            <p><strong>Is Windows 10 really free and do I have to pay for it after the first year has passed?</strong></p>
<p>Windows 10 will be free for the first year to all Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and Phone 8.1 users. This means, as long you upgrade within the first 12 months (July 29th 2015 to July 29th 2016), you will not have to pay for Windows 10 at all.
</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Wow, thats cool, but does that mean, I will have to pay for Windows 10 after the first year?</strong></p>
<p>No. Its a promotion to get as many users to upgrade their existing Windows 7 PCs and Windows 8.1 devices to Windows 10.
<strong>Once you upgrade within the first year for free, its yours forever at no additional cost.</strong>&nbsp;As Microsoft Program Manager for Windows&nbsp;Terry Myerson&nbsp;described it:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span><em>This is more than a one-time upgrade: once a Windows device is upgraded to Windows 10, we will continue to keep it current for the supported lifetime of the device

</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(42, 0, 170, 1)">I heard Microsoft representatives mention they are moving to a servicing model for Windows 10, does that mean Windows 10 is going to require a subscription?</span></strong></p>
<p>No, Windows 10 remains a perpetual license, which means, you can upgrade to Windows 10 and use it forever without it expiring or going into any reduced functional mode.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Are you saying there will be no more versions of Windows after Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft is moving Windows to a servicing model with Windows 10. The days of major revisions or what are called big bang releases are no more. As Microsoft Program Manager for Windows&nbsp;Terry Myerson&nbsp;described it:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><em><span>This is more than a one-time upgrade: once a Windows device is upgraded to Windows 10, we will continue to keep it current for the supported lifetime of the device
</span><span>–</span><span> at no additional charge. With Windows 10, the experience will evolve and get even better over time. We’ll deliver new features when they’re ready, not waiting for the next major release. We think of Windows as a Service
</span><span>–</span><span> in fact, one could reasonably think of Windows in the next couple of years as one of the largest Internet services on the planet.</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span>And just like any Internet service, the idea of asking "What version are you on?" will cease to make sense
</span><span>–</span><span> which is great news for our Windows developers. </span>

</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Why is Windows 10 free, is there some catch?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>No, its not a catch. We are computing in different times. Windows 10 is free so app developers can standardize on one platform and reduce the fragmented market of different versions and editions of Windows that have been an issue in the past. When everybody
 is on the same platform, it means better quality apps, a healthier ecosystem and more advances in hardware and software innovation.

<p>Same problem only mine started before I got Destiny. It happened right after the Xbox update where they no-longer allowed me to use my card for month to month renewal. Then came an update and after that I have been having problems ever since. I had done
 everything that they have told me to and still having the same problem. They told me that it must be my internet. Well then explain to me this I have a gamers speed for my internet. I have never had a problem connecting, my phone and laptop connect just fine
 and my internet speed is at 125 more then enough for Xbox live. It's like they don't even care anymore. This company has gone down hill ever since Bill Gates sold it off.</p>

<p>please be aware that this is an thread which is more then 1 year old, so the actual issue in this thread is different then yours, it just shows the same errorcode.</p>
<p>I your case please clear the cache of the console via the steps here: <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-360/system/clear-system-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../clear-system-cache</a> and then power the console down and start it up again.</p>
<p>After that please start the game, this will likely initiate an update for the game, but after that all should work again.</p>

            <p>Hi, Steven.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community, I understand your concern and we will try to assist you the best way we can.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per your&nbsp;query, I understand that you are unable&nbsp;to connect your extended monitors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest that you perform the methods below and check if you can configure the external displays singularly.</p>
<ul>

<h2>            How do I install Office 2010 onto my Surface Pro 2</h2>
                    I just purchased an Surface Pro 2 and I want to install Office 2010 Home and Business onto it. &nbsp;I already downloaded it onto the Surface Pro 2 via my key, but when I try to run the file it asks me which program I want to run it with (i.e. Internet Explorer,
 notepad, media player) and none of them seem to work.

            <p>Then, you are probably missing .NET 3.5.&nbsp; Several other people have had that problem and the installer is 'supposed' to call it up and even ask you if you download and install it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>First, we need to verify that .NET is actually in the system.&nbsp; Manually run Control Panel and go to Programs and click on "Uninstall programs".&nbsp; You are not going to uninstall anything, we just need to look at the program list and go through the list and
 see if .NET 3.0 and/or .NET 3.5 is installed.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If it is not there, go here and download it: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=21" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=21</a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You will need it for other programs as well.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Framework .NET was supposed to have been installed during the initial set of Windows Updates but may have been left out because it is a time consuming process.&nbsp; It takes forever.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Once the runtime environment for .NET is installed, double-click on that Office installer again and see if it will execute.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Also, before trying to install Office 2010, did you uninstall the trial version of Office 2013 from the tablet?&nbsp; You should have if you didn't but is not too late to do so now.&nbsp; That can interfere even though Microsoft says that it won't.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Welcome to the world of digital downloads.&nbsp; You would have been better off with the disk version (it has the .NET installer in it if needed).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>P.S.: if all of the above fails, it is possible that the installer file is corrupted and needs to be re-downloaded.&nbsp; If that also fails, contact Microsoft Technical Support and ask them "what the H#*( is going on?".</p>

<br />
I would suggest you to try the following steps.<br />
a. </span><span style="color: rgba(89, 97, 102, 1)">Plug your microphone into the computer.<br />
b. Open Skype and sign into the network.<br />
c. Go to "Tools" then "Options." This brings up the options screen.<br />
d. Click on the "Audio Settings" tab on the left side of the screen.<br />
e. Select your microphone using the microphone setting on the top of the screen. Talk into the microphone. If you see a green bar flashing as you speak, the microphone is configured correctly.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. Let us know if you have any other issues with Windows in future.</span>

<h2>            apps and programs deleted after last update</h2>
                    <p>Update problem December 17 and 18, 2018</p>
<p>I have been trying to have Microsoft solve my problem since Dec. 17, 2018.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>On Dec. 17, I was having a problem with Chrome. This happened before and I fixed it this way. I opened Chrome, clicked on the three dots in the upper right corner, then Settings. Advance, Reset and Clean up, Restore
 settings to their original defaults and then Reset Settings. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>After I closed Chrome, I noticed a new Mail icon on the task bar and changes to
<span>the</span> start menu. Was Microsoft updating at the same time without my knowledge because the next morning Microsoft finished installing a complete update, but Microsoft Office and all Office apps were deleted<span>
<span>the</span> start menu. Was Microsoft updating at the same time without my knowledge because the next morning Microsoft finished installing a complete update, but Microsoft Office and all Office apps were deleted<span>
</span>and all other downloaded programs. <span>It was like a reset of Windows instead of Chrome.
</span>I did not do a reset to Windows, I only did the <span>re</span>rest to Chrome.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I read that Microsoft was updating Office without any explanation. I looked on another computer and there were such updates, but not yet on this one. I cannot understand why Microsoft deleted Office and all of
 the Office apps and all other programs as if a reset was done to Windows. The complete update should make changes, but not delete programs from a computer.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>On Dec. 18 I tried the Answer Desk to no avail to reinstall Office since it was deleted completely, I had no product key and was told that nothing could be done except pay for Office AGAIN.</p>
<p>I do not have the product key. In Costa Rica, all computers sold are in Spanish, I purchased this one years ago. The technician has to change everything to English. The only numbers I could find now are: 00331-10000-00001-AA664.
 I don’t know if this is the product key. Also I have W269N-WFGWX-YVC9B-4J6C9-T83GX.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span>When I chatted
</span><span>on the 18th</span><span> on Answer Desk, I felt that Microsoft was not interested in helping me
</span><span>to reinstate </span><span>the</span><span> product key
</span><span>or replace it</span><span>, instead
</span><span>she</span><span> suggested buying Office 365.</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span>Microsoft writes</span><span> that updates are supposed to make the
</span><span>experience</span><span> better, instead it deleted my programs and can only offer to get more money from me.
</span><span>I can’t afford to keep buying something when Microsoft makes an error and deletes what
</span><span>it</span><span> shouldn’t.
</span><span>I am asking again for Microsoft to give me another product key and reinstate Office in my computer.
</span><span>Microsoft should update, not delete and make a client pay again.</span></p>

            Hi Sam
<br />
<br />I find that strange indeed that just resetting Chrome would reset your computer. 
<br />
<br />You should be able to reinstall Office 365 without a product key though. 
<br />
<br />Step 1 - Sign in to download Office
<br />
<br />Go to <a href="http://www.office.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.office.com</a> and if you're not already signed in, select Sign in.
<br />
<br />
<br />Sign in with the account you associated with this version of Office. This account can be a Microsoft account, or work or school account.
<br />
<br />Forgot your account details? See I forgot the account I use with Office.
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/i-forgot-the-account-i-use-with-office-eba0b4a2-c0ae-472c-99f6-bc63ee2425a8?wt.mc_id=scl_installoffice_home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/i-forg...</a>
<br />
<br />On the Office home page, do the following depending on your version of Office.
<br />
<br />If you signed in with a Microsoft account, from the Office home page select Install Office &gt; Install. (Office 365 subscribers should select Install again).
<br />
<br />This begins the download of Office. Follow the prompts on your screen to complete the install.
<br />
<br />Reinstall your apps from the store:
<br />
<br />	Click the ellipsis in the top right corner of the screen (...)
<br />	Click My Library
<br />	Scroll through the list then click the app if its listed there, then click the download button.
<br />
<br />	If doesn't help, let us know and we can explore more options. 
<br />
<br />
<br />As for desktop apps downloaded from the Internet or disc.

<p>Thank you for your suggestions.&nbsp; I was able to reinstall everything except for Microsoft Office.&nbsp; I was using Office 2013, not Office 365. All of Office 2013 was deleted, therefore I have no way of reinstalling it.&nbsp; The only suggestion I received from Answer
 Desk was to try Office 365 for 30 days.&nbsp; But I object to paying for Office again when I've been using 2013 for many years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I go to My Office all of Office is deleted except OneNote, OneDrive and Skype. No Outlook, no Word, no Excel, no Power Point.&nbsp; I've been trying to get Microsoft to reinstall 2013 because of this update.</p>

            Hi Sam
<br />
<br />Thanks for that clarification.
<br />
<br />If you have your Office 2013 product key, you should be able to reinstall Office 2013 from the following page.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/office" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />Scroll down, enter your Office 2013 product key
<br />Click Verify
<br />It should generate a link to download Office 2013

<p>My problem is that in Costa Rica, all computers are sold in Spanish. So the technician had to change it to English. I don't know if it's a completely new operating system in English or how it's done.&nbsp; I have had this computer for many years and the only
 numbers that I could find are the ones mentioned in my first request.&nbsp; I tried this product code but it doesn't to work, so I don't know what they are.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nothing works for Office since everything has been deleted.&nbsp; I am starting to give up with Microsoft in this case and go to a third party like LibreOffice or Thunderbird. That will save me from paying for Office again.&nbsp; It is disappointing because I did
 not do anything to delete the apps., but they were deleted with the update from Microsoft and now their is no solution from Microsoft except to pay again.</p>

<p>A winupdate cannot and does not remove programs, a windows reset might.</p>
<p>If you run windows update, you can review the settings and see what was updated.</p>
<p>Depends what version of Office as to whether a key is required to download/install. Office 2007 or Office 2010 requires the Key, Office 2013 Home &amp; Student "may" require a key</p>
<p>Its the users responsibility to keep a record of any Keys or receipts.</p>
<p>You dont post a key on a public site, and thats not a office key</p>

            Prior to Office 2016, product keys were not not language specific, so, they page should have generated a link to download Office regardless.

<p>I appreciate your help, but we may be going around in circles now.&nbsp; I purchased the computer back in 2013. In 2015 I had a major problem so HP worked on it and I don't know if changes were made to the version of Office 2013.&nbsp; I have to admit, I did not know
 that there were different versions of Office 2013, I assumed the only change was with the year as 2010, 2016.&nbsp; But ever since Windows 10 appeared, there was never a problem with each update.&nbsp; I can only assume when I reset Chrome that somehow Windows picked
 it up and did a reset. Both happened at the same time. But of course as Polcouk clearly pointed out, it was my responsibility to keep a record of the product key. At this time I am made to feel like an idiot. I drive a car, but someone always takes care of
 it.&nbsp; Same as my computer, someone was always there to take care of it. I was never given a product key, I always assumed that it would be in my computer and that it disappeared when Office disappeared.</p>
<p>When Windows needed to be activated, it was always there; I thought the same for Office.</p>

            Hi Sam,
<br />
<br />Based on the information provided, you have Office 2013 Pro Plus which is a volume license product. This is normally not provided through retail channels since its a corporation organization distribution of the suite. 
<br />
<br />I am looking for resources to download it, but so far I have been unsuccessful. Did somebody install this copy for you? If so, you will need to ask them provide the installation media.

<p>Might try redownloading the <a href="http://aka.ms/DownloadW10ISO" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Media Creation Tool</a> so you are sure you have the current version and use the option to download the iso for use on another computer. &nbsp; You can double click the .iso and run the Setup.exe in its root to do a refresh upgrade.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or you can use the little <a href="https://rufus.akeo.ie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Rufus program</a> to install the iso onto a usb drive for fresh installs &amp; double duty as a bootable repair disc by using its repair environment.</p>

<h3> chadscott  say:</h3>
<h2>            Freezing on Configuring Update for Windows 10 100&#37; Complete</h2>
                    <p>I have an ASUS Desktop with a Core i7 3770, 16GB Ram, an Nvidia GTX 970, and a 250 GB Intel SSD and a 2 TB HDD. &nbsp;Windows 8.1 is loaded on the SSD. I am trying to update to Windows 10 with the free upgrade icon in the bottom left corner since it say my update
 is ready. &nbsp;I goes through the whole update where I get stuck on the blue screen that says:</p>
<p>Configuring update for Windows 10 </p>
<p>100% Complete</p>
<p>Do not turn off your computer</p>
<p>
</p><p>The circle thing freezes in place and the mouse freezes in place and can't be moved even though it says 100% complete. &nbsp;Is this normal? &nbsp;How long should I wait for this? &nbsp;I have waited 30 mins without it doing anything then I restarted. &nbsp;It booted back into
 Windows 8.1 but three times in a row it has stuck at 100%. &nbsp;I have unplugged all USB connections other than the mouse and keyboard but it still freezes up. Please help.</p>

<p>Your question is not so clear. Are you asking how do you backup your personal files (photos, music and settings) before upgrading to Windows 7?</p>
<p>1. Run Windows Upgrade Advisor (windows.microsoft.com/upgradeadvisor) to see if there are any known issues that might affect the installation and whether you should install the 32 or 64 bit version of Windows 7.<br />
<br />
2. Save your files and settings on an external hard drive using Windows Easy Transfer (windows.microsoft.com/windows-easy-transfer). If you don't have an external hard drive you won't be able to use Windows Easy Transfer. Alternatively, you can copy files you
 want to keep on a USB flash drive, CDs, or DVDs.<br />
<br />
3. You'll need to manually reinstall your programs, such as Microsoft Office, after you install Windows 7. Gather the installation discs for your programs and any associated product/license keys. You might be able to download some programs from the Internet.
 For example, Windows Live Messenger can be installed from download.live.com/messenger.<br />
<br />
4. <strong><em>Inset the Windows 7 DVD into your PC. When asked "Which type of installation do you want? click "Upgrade", If you are running Windows XP, you will have to select the Custom Option and do a clean install.
</em></strong></p>
<p>5. After Windows 7 is installed, use Windows Easy Transfer to restore your files and settings.<br />
<br />
If you're not comfortable installing Windows 7 yourself, check with a local retail store or PC services company to see if they offer upgrade services.</p>
