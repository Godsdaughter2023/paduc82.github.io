<h2>            Image becomes distorted when cropped within a shape</h2>
                    Hi everyone,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have an autoshape that I've filled with an image using fill effects. The shape itself is a square with rounded edges.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The problem is that when the image is inserted in the shape, it becomes distorted. I've tried it with the&nbsp;"Rotate fill effect with shape" option checked and unchecked but this doesn't seem to make a difference.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Also, apparently there's supposed to be some options such as "crop to fill", located on the crop button on the format picture tab but this button is greyed out for some reason.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The exact process I went through is as follows:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>I drew the rounded rectangle shape</li><li>I right-clicked on it and chose "format autoshape"</li><li>I chose "Fill", then "Fill effects"</li><li>I clicked the Picture tab and chose "select picture"</li><li>I browsed for the image and then clicked OK</li><li>The image comes in distorted</li><li>I double click on the shape/image so that the format picture tab is showing</li><li>It's there that I was hoping to gain access to the crop to fill option on the crop button but as mentioned the button is greyed out.</li></ol>
</div>
<div>I wondered if someone could tell me if there's a workaround for this?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks again for any assistance.</div>
                </div>

            That would happen if your document is in .doc format. If this is the case, do a
<i>Save As</i>&nbsp;into "Word document (.docx)."

<div>"Crop to fill" will fit a picture within the available space and let you crop the excedent.</div>

<h2>            Automatic Repair Loop - &#47;&#47; Cant reinstall &#47; have multiple instances of windows</h2>
                    <p>I can't boot from a USB properly, it shows the Windows logo, but it remains with the loading circle endlessly.</p>
<p>If I remove the bootable USB and reboot it remains in constant "automatic repair".</p>
<p>
</p><p>What other solution do I have?</p>
<p>My Windows is Build 10074 64bit, using bootable USB with build 100130 32bit, can this be the culprit? I'm using it ONLY to repair.</p>

            <p>Hi Jerry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for being a part of Windows 10 Insider Program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform you that unfortunately, you cannot use a 32-bit ISO of Windows Operating System to fix issues of a 64-bit Windows Operating system.</p>
<p>As you have mentioned that you wish to repair Windows, then I suggest you to perform a
<strong>System Restore</strong> and check if it helps. </p>
<p><strong>System Restore</strong> helps you restore your computer's system files to an earlier point in time. It's a way to undo system changes to your computer without affecting your personal files, such as e‑mail, documents, or photos.</p>
<p>Follow the steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press and hold <strong>Shift</strong> key and click on <strong>Restart</strong> from login screen.</li><li>Click on <strong>Troubleshoot</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Advanced Options</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>System Restore</strong> and follow the on screen instructions.</li></ol>
<p><strong><span>Disclaimer</span></strong><span> :</span>Though
 it is said that System Restore does not affect your personal information such as email, documents, photos, videos, etc., but there is highly possible that some of your personal files are deleted while system restoring.
</p>
<p>During System Restore, there may be errors and such errors may cause damage to the files that are present in the system. And, computer shutdown during restoring process may also lead to file loss. Sometimes when System Restore is failed, it may lead to loss
 of important files as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps. Please reply with the updated status and for further assistance.<br />
We’ll be glad to help.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the prompt reply! (:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't access my Windows, therefor I can't "restart pressing shift"</p>
<p>But I'll try using the 64bit ISO as a bootable USB in this case. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully that was the case. Thanks in advance (:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do wish Windows 10 had an easy access to <strong>Safe Mode </strong>as did Win7, for those with no other computer nearby to make a bootable USB or if they didn't have any Restore Media.</p>

            <p>I have the same problem using the latest 64-bit Windows 10 install image on a bootable USB made with Rufus. I get the Windows logo for a minute or two, then it returns to the never ending automatic repair loop. This has been happening ever since the last
 OTA update. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I can boot a 64-bit Ubuntu image, but I've tried everything I can to try to recover this laptop using a Windows image. About the only other option I can think of is to format the hard drive using Ubuntu, then try installing Windows 10 again. Or maybe I should
 just leave Ubuntu on it - never had something like this happen on a Linux machine!</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, it is inconceivable that there is no way to boot into safe mode without going through the start menu. The reason you need the safe mode boot is because you can't get the computer to boot otherwise!!! Most idiotic engineering decision I've seen from
 Microsoft in the 32 years I've been using your products.</p>

            <p>Hi Jerry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We apologize for not being able to address your concern in a timely manner. I appreciate that you have briefed the issue more. I suggest you to try Automatic Repair. You may download build 10130 ISO and burn it to a disk or USB stick so that you can use
 it for re-installation purpose. If you don't have many programs installed, a clean install might be a good choice.
<br />
See the link below: <br />
<strong><span>Windows 10 build 10130 ISO Files now available</span></strong>:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_install/windows-10-build-10130-iso-files-now-available/0e475232-091b-4e68-a0f5-a3657941b114">

<p>
</p><p>Once you have the installation media, follow the steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start your computer from the installation media. Insert&nbsp;the disk or USB stick and restart your computer. If you see a message asking you to “Press any key to boot from DVD,” do so. If you don’t see the message, you might need to change the boot order in
 your computer's&nbsp;BIOS settings so that it first starts from the disk or USB. When you see the 'Install Windows' page, tap or click 'Repair your computer' link to&nbsp;start the Windows Recovery Environment.</li><li>In the Windows Recovery Environment, on the Choose an option screen, click 'Troubleshoot'.</li><li>Click, Advanced Options and then click on 'Automatic Repair'.</li><li>After this complete the repair and see if you are able to boot in to your computer.</li></ol>
<p>I would also like to inform you that you may enable F8 key to go to Safe mode from boot menu. For enabling F8 key, follow the below mentioned steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>You may follow the above steps 1 and 2 and then choose “<strong>Command Prompt</strong>”.</li><li>Type the command <strong>bcdedit /set {default} bootmenupolicy legacy </strong>
and hit Enter. You may see the message “The operation completed successfully”.</li><li>Restart the computer and you may press F8 key to enter into <strong>Safe Mode</strong> or other Advanced Boot options.</li></ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> For disabling the key, you may follow the same steps but need to type
<strong>bcdedit /set {default} bootmenupolicy standard </strong>in the command prompt and restart the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps. Let us know for further assistance and we’ll be glad to help.</p>

            Of course I tried SHIFT-F8 before I even went through the hassle of creating a bootable USB - it's disabled by default on Windows 10 (and apparently 8.1 as well). And, since I can never get the laptop to boot to the recovery options, I can't switch the
 flag from the command prompt to allow the keyboard shortcut while booting Windows...because IT WON'T BOOT! (Which was the whole point of this thread to begin with...there are few good options if your computer gets stuck in the Automatic Recovery loop, because
 it seems not uncommon for it to fail to boot from bootable media in that case, too.)

            Navneet, none of your suggestions worked, because I couldn't get even bootable installation media to boot. It would try...I would get the Windows logo and I could see that the USB was being accessed, but about 3 minutes later it would reboot and be back
 in the Automatic Repair loop again. I finally ended up reformatting the disk with an Ubuntu USB and installing Ubuntu. I may try seeing up a primary partition and reinstalling Windows 10 this week - but I'm not sure I want to put myself through all of that
 again. I've done a lot of beta testing over the years. This has been the worst as far as the number of crashes that I've ever seen.&nbsp;

                    <p>
</p><p>So, I know this happens sometimes but I want to be safe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I was away, my email received two emails like this:<br />

</span></p>
<p>Now to me this usually looks like Microsoft, but the address of the email worried me, it had a display name of&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>So, were these email scare emails that were fake, trying to scare me that someone had accessed my account, or are these legitimately from Microsoft?

    <title>Can&#39;t Write In Another Language - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chris nicola  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t Write In Another Language</h2>
                    <p>I have installed the Greek language and keyboard in Windows but when I select the language in the taskbar (EL) I can only write in English in any application whether word, live mail or a text document. What am I doing wrong?
</p>
<p>I am using Windows 7 Ultimate English version. Also Office 2010. Region set to United Kingdom. I have the following languages installed:<br />
</p>
<p>English USA - keyboard IBM Greek Latin 319/USA/USA International <br />
English (UK) - keyboard IBM Greek Latin 319 /UK keyboard <br />
Greek - keyboard IBM Greek Latin 319. <br />
<br />
I suspect when I change the language from the taskbar something is happing to prevent it starting.<br />
</p>
<p>Your advice would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Kind Regards<br />
<br />

            I tried IBM Greek Latin 319 here, and AFAICS it's a keyboard designed to input Latin rather than Greek characters.
<div><br />
<div>Maybe if you tried Greek 319 (or one of the other ones that produces Greek characters) you would see the behaviour you need.</div>

    <title>How to change autocorrect in OneNote on Mac&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> clairesandland  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to change autocorrect in OneNote on Mac&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>So I recently bought a MacBook Air, trying out Mac for the first time (I have always used Windows previously). There is just this one thing that bothers me a lot, that I don't know how to fix on my Macbook which was the easiest thing on my windows computer
 (I'm beginning to think, that it is not even possible on Macs...)</p>
<p>So it's just this: In OneNote (2016) I would like to change the autocorrect, so that whenever I write "--&gt;", it corrects it to an arrow pointing in that direction (Apparently I can't put&nbsp;the arrow in here). This is no problem in Word, however. And it was
 possible to change on my Windows computer, so can it really be true, that I cannot change this on my MacBook? It really bothers me, even though it is such a small thing, because I use that arrow all the time in my school work, and now I have spend so much
 time trying to fix it. So if anyone has got an idea or a solution, please help :)</p>
<p>Claire</p>

    <title>Input Not Supported While Installing Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Input Not Supported While Installing Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been trying installing Windows 10 Technical Preview on my PC but as I start the setup, the Windows Logo appears with a loading icon and then the screen goes blank and says "Input not Supported". I tried another monitor, it said "Out of Frequency"
 on the same stage. Tried installing Windows through the same media on my laptop and it went well. For you information, the model of the monitor is HP S1932. Another thing that might be causing the issue is that my PC has a DIV port while my monitor has a VGA
 port so I am using DVI to VGA convertor. Any help will be appreciated. Thanks.</p>

            Thanks for replying. If the hardware is not supported then how come is it working fine after installing the windows? It said input not supported throughout the setup, I left it for a while and after the setup completed, the display reappeared. And the
 link you mentioned above doesn't say anywhere about the specification of the monitor required for Windows 10 Technical Preview.

<p>Being Microsoft, seeing the percentage of Windows 10 Mobile market share, seeing the popularity of the game, I would not tell phone users, go ask Niantic yourself. I would ask Niantic on users behalf, collect a highly skilled team of Microsoft phone developers,
 pay Niantic loads of money for an ability to send developers over to Niantic, and develop the game for them, just to HAVE the title on Windows Store. Otherwise, it's an appalling reaction.</p>

</p><p>I am facing a very weird&nbsp;issue in the <span>Visio&nbsp;</span>installed on my machine as it crashes every&nbsp;time when saving (anything even an empty page) as a web page.</p>
<p>I tried every&nbsp;possible solution, but it did not work. So I appreciate&nbsp;if somebody could help me on this.</p>

<p><span>Hi Aam,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are using Visio 2016, please first navigate to Control Panel&gt;Programs&gt;right-click the Office 2016 applications’ icon&gt;Repair and then
 restart the computer to see and let us know the result.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Meanwhile, to move forward, I’d like you to confirm and provide the following.</span></p>
<p><span>1. When did the issue happen? What did you do before the issue happen?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Record a video showing the issue and provide the video link in
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Check if the issue happens in a specific file.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Upload a full screenshot of the page showing the version information of the Visio 2016 application you are using. You can access the page
 via File&gt;Account.</span></p>

<p>Hi Cliff,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your reply.</p>
<p>Kindly note my <strong><em>replies </em></strong>below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you are using Visio 2016, please first navigate to Control Panel&gt;Programs&gt;right-click the Office 2016 applications’ icon&gt;Repair and then restart the computer to see and let us know the result.</span></p>
<p><span><em><strong>Yes, I am using Microsoft Visio Professional 2016, and already I did what you mentioned but it still does not work.</strong></em></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Meanwhile, to move forward, I’d like you to confirm and provide the following.</span></p>
<p><span>1. When did the issue happen? What did you do before the issue happen?</span></p>
<p><span><em><strong>I don't know exactly when it happened, but it seems since I got this laptop.</strong></em></span></p>
<p><span><em><strong>Actually, I did nothing before the issue happens, Visio is working normally but once saving any diagram as a web page it will stop working and restart.</strong></em></span></p>
<p><span>2. Record a video showing the issue and provide the video link in&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox</a>.</span></p>
<p><span><em><strong>Sorry if I can't do it as I do not have a recording software on my laptop and I&nbsp;don't have admin access as well, but the issue is very simple: the Visio will stop working if I choose File&gt;Save as&gt;web page&gt;save ...</strong></em></span></p>
<p><span>3. Check if the issue happens in a specific file.</span></p>
<p><span><em><strong>It happens for all types of files, even for an empty diagram. But if it's worth mentioning, I can save a web page from other&nbsp;office product (i.e. Word)</strong></em></span></p>
<p><span>4. Upload a full screenshot of the page showing the version information of the Visio 2016 application you are using. You can access the page via File&gt;Account.</span></p>
<p><span><em><strong>Version:</strong></em></span></p>
<p><span><em><strong>Microsoft Visio 2016 MSO (16.0.4639.1000) 32-bit</strong></em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I hope I answered your questions clearly, and I am looking forward to hearing back from you.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thank you in advance Cliff.</strong></p>

<h2>            birthday calendar issues</h2>
                    my birthday calendar takes some of the information from my contacts others it does not. &nbsp;it spreads some over 2 days, some it does not. &nbsp;I have multiple copies of some and others are fine. &nbsp;I took the time to enter everyone in outlook.com thinking that
 I would be ok, I was wrong, now I have multiples, and some are not new entries. I cannot make any corrections, because it is all read only. &nbsp;So If I delete the birthday calendar in outlook.com will I have to create a contact for everyone that I want to have
 a reminder for? and is there someplace to input anniversaries as well?

            <p>Outlook.com gets the birthdate from your contacts and creates the birthday event automatically. If the dates are spread over two days, it usually means the contact &nbsp;was created in a different time zone (or more correctly, the calendar was created then you
 changed the time zone).&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have also experienced some of these problems, and I've been trying to figure out how to make it all work and sync properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My&nbsp;solution at this time 04/07/2014 :</p>
<ol>
<li>Do not add a calendar using New &gt; "Birthday Calendar"&nbsp;at Outlook.com.</li><li>
<p>Rather create your own Calendar and put your Birthdays&nbsp;/ Anniversaries in it as recurring events.</p>
</li><li>
<p>I created a calendar for B'days / Anniv and a separate one for Appointments. I&nbsp;did allow the&nbsp;US Holidays Calendar to add automatically.</p>
</li><li>
<p>I manually color coded my Outlook.com Calendars with my Outlook 2013 Desktop versions that are synced.</p>
</li><li>
<p>So far rock solid!</p>
</li><li>
<p>I also uninstalled the Mail, Calendar, People and Messaging&nbsp;apps on the start screen (they all are part of a group, so uninstall one and they all go). I had syncing issues with this set of programs. Mostly with duplicates in People, and Calendar not even
 showing some of my stuff or delaying any changes made elsewhere way too long. Not sure what the problem is with them. I like the idea of them, but&nbsp;wished they worked better.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>As a disclosure, I am running Windows 8.0 with Outlook 2013 - perhaps this was all fixed in Windows&nbsp;8.1,
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A side note: I was able to essentially drag and drop my recurring Birthday events from one calendar to the other in Outlook 2013 Desktop with overlay turned off (so the calendars are separated). It saved me from typing anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Outlook.com select New &gt; Calendar, then name it what you want e.g. Bdays.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>DO NOT&nbsp;TRY&nbsp;to select New &gt; Birthday Calendar this is&nbsp;the "automated" version and not fun.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            <p>I live in Australia and when I set-up OUTLOOK.COM (with calendar / contacts / etc) I had this problem with a lot of birthdays being split over two days. I went and checked and found that my ONEDRIVE account had me with a UK timezone and my computer had me
 with an Australian timezone. I changed the ONEDRIVE to match the Australian timezone. The problem has largely gone away except around daylight savings time. From a few days ago&nbsp;(27th Mar 2015)&nbsp;until the middle of this week (1st Apr)&nbsp;all birthdays are split
 across two days. Daylight savings ends 5th Apr 2015. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I recorded all the details for one of these contacts and deleted them from the birthday calendar and from within Outlook on my PC. I waited for everything to synchronise and make sure the contact was gone. I've added the contact back in again and their birthday
 is still spilt across two days (1:00am to 1:00am).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a bug or is there something else I could be doing to fix this problem. Before change ONEDRIVE from UK to AUS timezone, the problem was more widespread throughout my calendar. Now it's just around Daylight savings time.</p>

<p>It sounds to me as if something is using UK daylight savings change dates (UK changed on 29th March) or perhaps even US ones. (two weeks earlier I think). &nbsp;Not sure where the root of the problem is though.</p>

            I've looked further ahead and from Sat 3rd Oct 2015 through to Tue 27th Oct 2015 the same thing is happening. All the birthdays are from 1:00am to 1:00am.

            <p>Our (AUS) daylight savings ends on 5th Apr (Sunday) at 3:00am. The OUTLOOK.COM birthday on 27th Mar goes from 12:00 midnight through to 1:00am 28th Mar. All birthdays from 28th Mar through to 2nd Apr go from 1:00am to 1:00am. The birthday on 3rd Apr (Friday)
 goes from 1:00am to midnight. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The birthdays in CALENDAR.LIVE are all from midnight to midnight. It's only when they get pulled into OUTLOOK on my PC that the time distortions happen.</p>

            Yes, this is appears to be a&nbsp;bug.&nbsp; I live in the Eastern US Time Zone (UTC -05:00), and have the same problem with daylight saving time birthdays on March 24, March 30, and April 1.&nbsp; Microsoft Office.com and Office 2013 Support engineers and specialists
 have been working on my issue since September 2014 to no avail.

            <p>Same combination. My calendar on the OFFICE ONLINE site&nbsp;(AUS time zone where all birthdays go from midnight to midnight and&nbsp;all look ok) and OFFICE 2013 on my PC (AUS time zone where all birthdays that are synchronised from the BIRTHDAY calendar in OFFICE
 ONLINE are skewed due to daylight savings for a period of about a week).</p>

                    <p>I have a contact group with about 80 contacts. I would like to make them into 2 groups of 40 without re-entering them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;1. How can I copy and paste 40 into a new contact group?</p>

            You have two options: 
<br />
<br />Copy and paste the group in place (Select the group, Ctrl+C,V) to make a second one, then edit the name and delete contacts from the old and new.  This is would be my choice for this scenario. 
<br />
<br />Open the group, click forward and copy the names and address from the text file, paste into the Members field of a new group. This method disconnects the members from their contact, which may or may not be a problem for you.  This method is detailed here: <a href="https://www.slipstick.com/outlook/contacts/how-to-forward-a-distribution-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.slipstick.com/outlook/contacts/how-...</a>

            <p>Hi Avinandan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just a few questions to get a clear picture of the issue.</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>What happens while you try to access windows store or feedback app?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Are you getting any error code or error message? If yes, what is the complete error message?
</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Are you using a Microsoft account or local account?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let us&nbsp;follow these methods and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: </span></strong><span>Check if the date, time and time zone are set according to your time and time zone.</span></p>

<p><span>b. Type “Date and Time” in the charms bar search.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Click <strong>Change date and time</strong> button (To change the time zone click on time zone tab).</span></p>
<p><span>d. Click Apply and Ok to save the date and time.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: </span></strong><span>Clear the store cache and check.</span></p>
<p><span>a. Press "Windows key + R".</span></p>
<p><span>b. Type <strong>wsreset.exe</strong> and click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3: </span></strong><span>Disable the proxy server and check</span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>a. Open<strong> Internet Explorer </strong><strong><br />
</strong>b. Click <strong>Tools</strong> and then click <strong>Internet Options.</strong><strong><br />
</strong>c. Then click the <strong>Connections</strong> tab.<br />
d. Then click the <strong>LAN Settings </strong>button.<br />
e. Then Uncheck the option which reads” <strong>Use a proxy server for your LAN”</strong><strong><br />
</strong>f. Click <strong>apply</strong> and then <strong>ok.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this helps. Get back to us if the issue persists.</span></p>

<h2>            Contact in skype windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been trying to add contact in my list for days. I discuss with them, they accepted me but do not appear in my contact list. I checked the questions already asked and I always see the same answer in which people link to the following Skype "help" page:</p>

How do I find and add contacts in Skype?
<p style="color: rgba(43, 43, 48, 1)">
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Go to&nbsp;<span>Contacts</span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>
Select the add contact icon or click directly in the search text box and type the name, Skype name or email of the person you want to add. Click&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2faz705183.vo.msecnd.net%2fonlinesupportmedia%2fonlinesupport%2fmedia%2fskype%2fscreenshots%2ffa3281%2ffa3281_8.png" />&nbsp;Search
 Skype.</p>
</li><li>
<p>
Select your friend from the search results and click&nbsp;<span>Add to Contacts</span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>
Type a quick note to introduce yourself and then click&nbsp;<span>Send</span>.</p>
</li></ol>
<p style="color: rgba(43, 43, 48, 1)">
<br />
The person is added to your contact list, but will appear offline until they accept your request. After they’ve accepted your request, you can see when they’re online and make free voice and video calls with them.</p>
<p>I am sorry, but thess buttons do not exist on Skype windows 10 (or if they do, I trult need someone to show them to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Someaone can help me, I would feel very grateful.</p>
<p>I just regret that the new version is so inferior to the previous one in which everything was simple.</p>

<p>Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Adding a contact in Skype for Windows 10 works differently. In this version, there's no longer a button to add a contact, you simply need to<em> send a message</em> to a person you want to add. Then along with the message you sent,&nbsp;a contact request will
 be delivered to the person as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this answers your query.</p>

            <p>You probably need more RAM than you can install in a 32 bit version of windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Your system is holding on to Standby memory and not releasing it to
<strong>Free</strong> memory. You can force release by restarting your computer but often this is not very convenient. Another way to force the release of Standby memory is available using RAM Map (freeware from Microsoft):<br />
</span><span><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-gb/sysinternals/ff700229.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-gb/sysinternals/ff700229.aspx</span></span></a></span><span>
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Download and install, and create a shortcut on your Desktop to RAMMap and / or pin to your Taskbar. When you sense the system is becoming unresponsive use Ctrl+Shift+Esc
 to access Task Manager. Click the Performance tab and the <strong>Resource Monitor</strong> button. Click the Memory tab and check whether Free is near to Zero or is Zero. If it is, open RAMMap, click Empty on the Menu bar and Empty Standby list. This action
 instantly restores Free memory.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2004aebe-d6aa-473f-8e5a-af604095c325" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2004aebe-d6aa-473f-8e5a-af604095c325" /></a></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The procedure using RAMMap is an effective workaround but the true solution lies in discovering the source of the problem. Knowing the source you may be able to resolve the
 problem by contacting the provider of the software and / or updating the software.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The solution lies in identifying the software that is accessing numerous files, either to check for malware or to index to facilitate Windows Search. If you discover which
 files are being unnecessarily accessed you can exclude them from routine scans. The first image below illustrates the problem. The second image identifies the folders/ files. In the example Microsoft Security Essentials has been scanning my G drive, which
 I have since excluded from future scans.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Investigating what makes up the Standby figure may not be easy. How I found out what was the cause on this computer was achieved by following the procedure detailed below.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Open RAMMap when your Standby figure is too high and click the File Summary tab. Click the
<strong>Standby</strong> column header to sort the figures as in the image below to determine the
<strong>really large</strong> files held in Standby, see the image below. If you click the
<strong>Path</strong> header you can sort and see what partitions are being accessed. It is important to remember that these files have been accessed since the computer was booted. You then ask yourself what programme might have accessed the file and did it
 really need to? Programmes having scheduled scans are good potential candidates.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In my case I found a very large download of Windows 7 that I had used for a Repair Install I had not removed after use. I also found a large number of files on a non-system
 partition relating to back up copies created by Windows BackUp. I decided to see if these were being regularly scanned by Microsoft Security Essentials and excluded them from scans. You should also check whether you are Indexing more than you need as this
 will increase the impact of running Windows Search.</span></span></p>

            <p>This is the Windows 7 community and there is another community for Office/Excel and that is here:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Choose the correct version to get to the right community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I have Excel questions/problems/issue I ask out there since that is where the Office/Excel experts hang out and they are usually very helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For a 32-bit system you are limited to 4GB RAM and I read that Excel will probably not ever use more than 2GB RAM so if you want more oomph you can consider a 64-bit system and more RAM.</p>
<p><br />
Those Excel geeks will know all the answers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Be sure to include your Excel version, Windows version, installed RAM and if you know the type of CPU and number of cores it has (if you know) since there could be some adjustments in Excel to make it run more efficiently (2007 and up).</p>

<p>If your data file is an Excel worksheet that includes percentages, currency values, or postal codes, you can preserve the numeric formatting of the data by using Dynamic Data Exchange to connect to the Excel worksheet from Word. For example, you can make
 sure a five-digit postal code of 07865 from your data file is not displayed as the number 7865 (without the leading zero).</p>
<p>Before you connect to the worksheet, do the following in Word:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the <b>Microsoft Office Button</b> <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fofficeimg.vo.msecnd.net%2fen-us%2ffiles%2f922%2f308%2fZA010077102.gif" />, and then click

<b>Mailings</b> tab, click <b>Select Recipients</b>, and then click
<b>Use Existing List</b>. </li><li>Locate the Excel worksheet in the <b>Select Data Source</b> dialog box, and double-click it.
</li><li>In the <b>Confirm Data Source</b> dialog box, click <b>
MS Excel Worksheets via DDE (*.xls)</b>, and then click <b>OK</b>.</li></ol>

            <p>Hi MarWell,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The proper solution to this problem, if the proposed simple solutions don't work (and it would be uncommon/incorrect for MSE to install properly without those options and features), then the best bet is to start from scratch and do it properly from the beginning.&nbsp;
 Here's how.&nbsp; It may seem long, but hopefully most won't be needed (just there in case of trouble so you have everything you need to get it all done or duplicating what you already know or suggesting settings that are optional.&nbsp; Some might even think it's faster
 to do it than to read this - LOL!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Start with the following compliments of Dr. Strangelove:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that you have removed all other real-time antimalware products that were ever installed on your PC, including free/trial products that were installed when the PC was purchased (Norton, McAfee, TM, AVG, OneCare, Malwarebytes (paid), etc).
 Then, use the cleanup tools here: </span></strong><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>List of anti-malware program cleanup/uninstall tools</span></b></a>.
 You MUST use the cleanup/removal tools to get rid of these programs properly as the normal uninstall process leaves remnants behind that cause problems with any other AV product you install later including MSE<span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>This means not only current ones but any EVER (including free trials you may never have used) or done years ago and possibly forgotten. See the following compliments of Dave__M:
<strong><span>If you aren't sure of what may still be on your system as remnants, which could be interfering with the MSE install, try a scan of your system with this security application detection and removal specialist:
</span></strong></span><a href="http://www.appremover.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>http://www.appremover.com/</span></strong></a><strong><span>.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>NOTE: If you have installed Adobe FLASH, and you already had the Google toolbar, you were presented with the option to install “McAfee Security Scanner”, which is selected by default. If you were caught by this, and unknowingly/accidentally
 installed McAfee, uninstall it and use the McAfee cleanup tool in the list above. Other programs "package" deals like this as well with this or other products and if you've recently done a clean install (a restore to factory conditions) you may have also re-installed
 trial software that you long since forgot was there.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that your PC clock is correctly set. If not, correct it. If it is wrong, you may also want to either synchronize with a different internet time server or replace your CMOS battery (which keeps the clock running when you turn off the
 PC and like any battery can eventually run down).</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that you are up-to-date with SERVICE PACKS and updates (including .NET and IE). Yes, it can take some time to do this.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Then, restart your PC.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, try the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try a clean boot (Vista and W7) <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>. If the problem goes away then it's just a matter of tracking down the culprit causing the problem. Follow the procedures in the article. Once found, delete, remove, deactivate, or uninstall it. Once done be sure to
 reset your system back to normal status as explained in the procedures. If the problem occurs in clean mode then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work. If using XP, see
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353</a> and
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/316434" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/316434</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, uninstall and re-install MSE. To uninstall MSE, proceed as follows:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4</a> or

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To re-install, check out this article and follow ALL the procedures: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/check-list-for-installing-microsoft-security/bf757e6a-e320-4a67-92bc-767e6acb26c4">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do or ever did have any other AV program installed on your computer (even if you didn't use it), you need to make sure they are all uninstalled and fully removed before you install. To fully remove them, check out this listing of removal tools<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91</b></a>
 or the listing in that article at the bottom under troubleshooting steps (why this link isn't at the top near things to do first where it discusses removing all the prior and current AV programs is beyond me) or, if not on the lists, go to the website of the
 AV software and get and use the removal tool for that product.<span>&nbsp; </span>You cannot just uninstall these programs – you MUST also use the removal tool – even if the uninstall was years ago but you didn’t use a removal tool at the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To install, go to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx</a> and click on more languages and versions and then choose your language and the appropriate version for your operating system. When you download, save it to the desktop (rather than running
 it). When finished, right click on the installation icon and click run as Administrator (even if you’re logged in as an administrator) as I’ve found this sometimes helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then you need to configure your settings, set a scheduled scan, enable real-time protection, update MSE, and then run a quick scan (or a full scan if you have time).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also recommend the following setup for MSE (though the decision is yours - I've just found this helpful and the most effective and best way to set it up and is how I have mine configured):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure that ALL threat levels are sent to Quarantine where you can then decide whether or not to allow them or leave them there, or remove them. It is the safest solution for having the most options for dealing with the situation. Quarantine is as safe
 as removed, but in some cases you may want to remove them to be more certain - and with this one I would remove it (when the time comes). To do this, open MSE, click on the Settings Tab, and for each of the threat levels, set the action to be Quarantine and
 save.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the History tab and click on allowed and unless you specifically placed something in allowed, remove everything else from the allowed category. Only put things there that you ABSOLUTELY know are not problems (are "false positives") and triple-check
 before you do it as doing this could allow a real threat to bypass security and infect you and it won't be detected or rather won't be reported or acted upon by MSE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on Real-time protection and check all the boxes and save.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on SpyNet and click on Advanced and save. This is not at all dangerous to you and no information sent will be used by Microsoft to identify you even if some minor identification information is sent in terms of defining the
 infection, but it can sometimes help with new threats by initiating an immediate update to deal with the problem if it is in the SpyNet database (and it helps Microsoft update definitions to provide you and everyone else better protection).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on Advanced and check the box for save Quarantine items and change it from one month to three months so you have more time to decide if you want to restore something.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't help, then there's a good chance you may be infected by malware. Please proceed as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, try the following programs if you haven't as they may help. I recommend you download, install, update, and run full scans with Malwarebytes:<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a> and SuperAntiSpyware:<a href="http://superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://superantispyware.com/</span></a>
 and then run a full ESET online scan: <a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner</a>. This may or may not remove the infections, but will probably not repair any damage caused by them. Even if they or your current AV software seem to work or indicate you aren't infected or the problem goes away, you
 shouldn't completely trust them and need to continue with the recommendations that follow (so it's up to you if you want to try them first or just skip over all of this and get the expert help you really need as described below).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Properly and completely removing such infections can be complex and often require manual removal procedures (which may or may not be entirely effective either). Even if they work, I'd suggest the following anyway, so we may as well start there (you can ignore
 the above removal methods if you want as this is really the way to go, but it won't hurt to try them).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If malware was found and removed, then you need to again uninstall and re-install MSE as it will never work properly if installed on an infected system (which we didn’t know at the time).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully, one of these solutions (or a step in one of these answers) will resolve the problem. If not, then open a support case describing the problem starting at:<a href="https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/</b></a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
