<h2>            Populate due date in userform textbox</h2>
                    <p>Does anyone know how to poulate a textbox on a userform based off calculations from another textbox and combobox? Basically when the date 7/1/2012 is entered into lets say TB1 and the user selects from CB1 12 months, how can it populate TB2 with the following
 due date&nbsp;7/1/2013? Basically adding the total number of months to the origional date to create a due date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>Use the change event of the control that is used in the calculation such as the change event for CB1.&nbsp;&nbsp;then you can&nbsp;
</p>
<p>do something like this</p>
<p>Dim dt as Date</p>
<p>dt = cdate(TB1.Value)</p>
<p>dt = dateSerial(year(dt), Month(dt) + cb1.value, day(dt))</p>
<p>TB2.value = Format(dt, "m/d/yyyy")</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>you can add checks to make sure the TB1 is a date and not empty and that CB1 is returning a number.&nbsp;&nbsp; If CB1 could have a number of days and so forth, then you will have to use a case statement to determine what you need to do but what I showed you should
 get you started. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assuming TB1 contains a string that is recognisable as a date you can use this</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Private Sub CB1_Change()<br />
TB2.Text = DateAdd("m", Left(CB1.Value, InStr(CB1.Value, " ") - 1), CDate(TB1.Text))<br />
End Sub</p>

<p>What makes you think you are owed&nbsp;a Product Key?</p>
<p>Simply buying a computer does not grant you a license. You have to pay for it. When vendors say the PC "comes with" Office, they mean one of two things. Either you have been "given" a copy of Office Starter, the crippleware/adware version. Or you have a
 60 "free" trial that you have to pay to buy a Product Key to keep using it.</p>
<p>If you bought a retail plastic CD box version, the Product key is on a yellow label, on the back side of the slide inside the box.</p>
<p>If you paid for a Product Key Card, it is on a credit card size piece of paper</p>
<p>If you bought a license and download online, the product key will be in the confirmation email along with the download link. If you lose the email, you can contact the vendor as they should have a record of your purchase.</p>
<p>If you paid for&nbsp;a copy installed by the vendor, an OEM copy, they will have provided you with the product key some way. Possibly on a sticker attached to the computer case. BUT, the sticker will identify that it is for Office. This is currently the least
 likely scenario.</p>

<p>1)&nbsp; Bluetooth to another cellphone after pairing the devices.&nbsp; message comes up saying: could not create a file transfer connection with the device.</p>
<p>2)&nbsp; My laptob runs windows 7 home edition.&nbsp; when I try to sync the phone with the computer, I get a message saying:&nbsp; device not recognised, generic driver?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>3)&nbsp; The wi fi connection will not stay connected?&nbsp; message comes up saying:&nbsp; unable to connect to the GPRS service in your local network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone help me with this phone or have I wasted money buying a windows phone?</p>

            Hello. These should all be doable.&nbsp;
<div>1. What cellphone are you trying to connect to? The cellphone must have the correct Bluetooth services in order for it to connect. For example, if you are connecting to a Windows Phone 7.x device, it won't connect because it only has the headset profile.&nbsp;</div>
<div>2. I noticed you had another thread opened regarding this. Were you able to install WMDC and switch the USB to PC setting in the phone? Did you soft reset the phone afterwards?</div>
<div>3. That error message you indicated is saying that the data plan is starting up but maybe you don't have a data plan so it doesn't connect? Or you are out of range? If you don't have a data plan, see if you can have your provider put a block on it. There
 is also this small utility that can block it:</div>

            Hello. Looks like that is a Samsung android phone. Are they both in discoverable mode? Can you transfer a file from the Samsung to the HD2? I've got a WM 6.1 device and an android Gingerbread device. I'll see if I can do it.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>No, a simple connection should work on Win 7 64-bit. Try disabling any firewall/AV. &nbsp;If you are syncing Outlook, you can't use Outlook/Office 2010 64-bit. On your PC connection problem, open device manager on your PC. Plug in your phone. You will see some
 activity in network adapters and/or mobile devices. If you see something load, right click and delete off the driver(s). Unplug the phone and reboot the PC. Before you plug in the phone, please go to Start&gt;settings&gt;connections&gt;USB to PC and tell me what your
 options are so we can make sure that is set up right.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also, this kind of sounds like your microUSB port on the phone may be damaged or the cable. I assume you purchased it used. Please inspect the port and cable.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Certain programs spawn the data connection, which will interfere with your WIFI connection.&nbsp;</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I purchased the phone brand new from amazon.&nbsp; The microUSB port seems to be fine, no visible damage.&nbsp; Last nite I kinda toggled with it and same results:&nbsp; I'd see the activity in&nbsp; device manager,&nbsp;I right clicked but there weren't&nbsp;any drivers to delete&nbsp;and
 it says generic device, but WMDC still did not read the phone.&nbsp; I did the Start&gt;settings&gt;connections&gt;USB to PC and unchecked the option that says faster... but it still doesn't work.&nbsp; I only want to upload some pictures from the phone to PC.&nbsp; I have no desire
 to sync Outlook/Office 2010.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Hello. I'm not a real fan of Bluetooth, except for headsets, keyboard, and mouse. I tried with my WM to my android and vice versa. My WM just thought I wanted to tether so it only gave me modem services, not OBEX OPP. Then I tried my android to my android
 tablet and it failed, too. I'm still researching that cuz it should be so simple. My WM is about 2006 vintage so I can see how BT versions may not be backward compatible. Your HD2 should do it, though. Maybe I can find an app. There is an android app called
 Bluetooth File Transfer in the Play Store you might try on the Samsung. Look in the BT section of the Samsung and see the devices. If it is paired and not connected to the HD2, it won't work. The BT icon at the top must be blue to be connected. This is a link
 to an HD2 forum and actual users may be able to help you more:

<div><a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/forumdisplay.php?f=532" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forum.xda-developers.com/forumdisplay.php?f=532</a></div>
<div>The HD2 is still a popular phone and look around the forum for its capabilities.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Where did it say generic device? That is what you should delete. It should load HTC USB Sync and Windows Mobile Remote Adapter when recognized correctly. Again, try to disable your firewall/AV. The "faster..." should be unchecked. You don't have an "Activesync"
 option, do you?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>If all you want to do is transfer your pics to your PC, you can do that via WIFI. Do you have file sharing turned on for any folder on your PC? You can access that folder via your WIFI network by going to File Manager on the phone and typing the address
 //computername/fileshare. You can cut and paste the pictures into the folder.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>As a last resort, you can copy the pics to your storage card and use a card reader on the PC.&nbsp;</div>

            <blockquote>2)Yes i was able to install WMDC, I switch the USB to PC setting on the phone and it still doesnt recognise the phone, all it says is :&nbsp; device unrecognizable, or generic rndis, or it wont read at all, sometimes it does read,
 the phone will say:&nbsp; please authorize your phone to connect, but then it won't connect.&nbsp; I did the soft reset, hard reset, everything.</blockquote>
<br />
By "switch the USB to PC setting on the phone" are you referring to changing the setting on the phone to disable the "advanced network functionality" option (on the phone, tap Start &gt; Settings &gt; Connections &gt; USB TO PC &gt; remove checkmark in the box next to
 "Advanced Network Functionality."<br />
<br />
Can you confirm that you are plugging the USB cable directly into a USB port on the back of the computer (don't use a USB hub or a USB port on the front of the computer, if possible).<br />

            <p>Item 3, I'm confused - you say WiFi won't stay connected, but then say it shows a GPRS error?</p>
<p>This may come up if it cannot use the WiFi, and decides to revert to cellular instead, and fails to connect that way.</p>
<p>You either need to configure your GPRS connection (with assistance from your network) if you want to use cellular data, or if you want to stick with Wifi, switch off cellular data (delete all GPRS connections) and monitor the signal strength of the WiFi
 Connection.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft account not up to date, error 85010014, lumia 735</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I've seen some discussions related to my problem, however most of them are quite old, and my main concern is that maybe the server's name has changed?</p>
<p>I tried all the steps provided, with hard resetting the phone, and then,&nbsp;once I try&nbsp;to sync my Contacts back, it doesn't allow me to choose Microsoft account, still showing it as not up to date.</p>
<p>Also, I have no idea how to load my text messages back... :(</p>
<p>The server I have is dub406-m.hotmail.com, I tried changing it to any I could find in the discussions,&nbsp;no luck&nbsp;:/</p>
<p>I am fed up!</p>
<p>Also wondering if this can be related to the fact that I have Win 10 on my PC (Microsoft account works there with no problem!) and on&nbsp;the phone there is Win 8.1.</p>
<p>Any ideas what else can be done here will be appreciated...</p>

            <p>Hello hanif22,</p>
<p>I installed your font that you like and I am having the same problem.</p>
<p>The problem has to do with the font being a Opentype font which PowerPoint does not use.
</p>
<p>Windows and the Office application use Truetype fonts. </p>
<p>For more information on this see the following thread.</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-word/opentype-font-embedding/8d5fa46e-60e0-4f89-a7ea-1ff85a2d2208">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-word/opentype-font-embedding/8d5fa46e-60e0-4f89-a7ea-1ff85a2d2208</a></p>
<p>Like I said I installed the font you liked and I was able to create text in Word and then copy and paste the text as a picture into PowerPoint.
</p>
<p>It is a bit tedious but it works. </p>
<p>I would save all your text in a Word document if you plan to rewrite anything in the future and keep both documents together.</p>
<p>You might want to see if you can share this with the vendor to include some truetype code so that applications can use the font.</p>
<p>There are many applications that rely on truetype besides Microsoft Office applications.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Tammy.M</p>

            Open Type fonts (PS) won't embed in PowerPoint presentation but if the font is present usually they will work OK. eg The Adobe fonts in office are all OT(PS)<br />

This one doesn't though and seems to be replaced by Arial.<br />

            <p>I don't know if this one is a postscript font&nbsp;but it could be since postscript is driven by a printer driver.</p>
<p>It appears there is enough truetype like information for Word to render the font.</p>
<p>Powerpoint is video driver intensive (screen presentation)&nbsp;and Word is printer driver intensive (wordprocessing)&nbsp;and that may be where the difference lies.</p>
<p>I hope you are understanding what I am referring to...</p>
<p>Also, I noticed that the font selection box in the two applications&nbsp;displays the font differently.</p>

<br />
It does have a PostScript Outline<br />
<br />
Font Name: Code Bold<br />
Version: Version 1.0<br />
Open Type Layout, Postscript Outlines<br />
<br />
In itself this shouldn't stop it working in PowerPoint Adobe Arabic has the same layout and it works OK.<br />
<br />
Not sure what the difference is but it definitely doesn't work in PowerPoint<br />

            <p>Hi John and hanif22,</p>
<p>It has to do with the coding in font to get it to work properly with the driver the software is using.</p>
<p>For example, if you were to remove all printer drivers on your system you would find your font selection limited because the information available to render the fonts is&nbsp;provided only by the video driver&nbsp;(which is limited)&nbsp;because the printer driver (which
 is vast)&nbsp;is not present to make rendering happen. What you would get is only&nbsp;fonts that can be rendered based on the video&nbsp;driver&nbsp;which is very&nbsp;limited.</p>
<p>The programs&nbsp;<strong>PowerPoint</strong> and <strong>Word</strong>&nbsp;do not directly control how the font looks. The look of the font is provided by the font file and the driver/s it is interfacing with.</p>
<p>Opentype fonts can work with <strong>printers</strong> and/or with <strong>video</strong> drivers but they need to have&nbsp;the code embedded to work with the driver. It works in
<strong>Word</strong> most likely because the information is there to render the font using the
<strong>printer driver</strong> hence <strong>Word is printer driver driven</strong> (wordprocessor used to produce
<strong>printed</strong> documents).</p>
<p><strong>PowerPoint</strong> is very very <strong>video driver driven</strong>. It is a
<strong>presentation software</strong> designed to look great in a video presentation.
<strong>PowerPoint</strong> does <strong>not</strong>&nbsp;use&nbsp;very&nbsp;much&nbsp;printer driver information,&nbsp;a majority of the font rendering&nbsp;will come from the
<strong>video driver </strong>with some printer driver smattered in to finish the job.</p>
<p>My guess is the specific font (<strong>Code Pro</strong>) appears to have the code to work with a
<strong>printer driver</strong> but not with a <strong>video driver</strong>. I have downloaded other fonts from the site and they work so the problem is the font
<strong>Code Pro</strong>. One of the fonts I downloaded was<strong> Intro</strong> which looks very much like
<strong>Code Pro</strong>. <strong>Intro</strong> is a much heavier font but the <strong>
San Serif</strong> like design is there and looks great in <strong>PowerPoint</strong>.</p>
<p>The problem is there is nothing we can do to PowerPoint to force this to work.
</p>
<p>I am sorry, I would love nothing more than to be able to tell you to click on this and do that to make it work but it just does not exist.</p>
<p>I did some research on the font in question and found that the font is based off of
<strong>Avant Gard</strong> and <strong>Futura</strong>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately<strong>, Futura</strong> was included in <strong>Office 2007</strong> but is not included in
<strong>Office 2010</strong>. </p>
<p>However, there is a font that is part of that same <strong>San Serif </strong>
family called <strong>Kalinga</strong> that is included in <strong>Office 2010</strong> and&nbsp;is very very&nbsp;close in appearance.
</p>
<p>Using the <strong>Kalinga</strong>&nbsp;font you can change the character spacing making it&nbsp;condensed&nbsp;and make the font bold and it looks just&nbsp;like<strong> Code Pro</strong> with some very&nbsp;slight variations on the J and Q letters. All the rest of the letters&nbsp;look
 exactly the same.</p>
<p>Again, I am sorry that I don't have a better answer. </p>
<p>Posting again will not necessarily provide you with more information.</p>
<p>Tammy.M</p>

<p>I don't have the same question. I just have facts. Microsoft has given up. Nobody wants to work for them. No real modern developer wants to tie themselves to a sinking ship that will ever so slowly go under eventually. &nbsp;Ignoring the Mac platform in an era
 where Apple is growing fast was its first mistake. If you've ever tried using MS Office applications on a Mac you'll see why Google docs and sheets is growing like crazy. We double our fees to $360/hour for all work related to design and layout in Microsoft
 products.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the irony. Microsoft users very rarely have understanding of the software beyond the very basic tasks of bolding, italicizing underlining, setting a size and indenting. Most can't put in page numbers, put a different header on the cover page or add
 rules above and below an independent text box that holds a single word like "CONFIDENTIAL."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most don't even know you can add an "independent text box" outside the normal document flow. &nbsp;In short, the entire suite of Office Applications is used by a group of people who know practically nothing about the program. In 30 years I've met perhaps 3 people
 who could set up a document that looked like it was professionally designed. &nbsp;Yes, I said three people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The supplied fonts and templates use cliche art, aged fonts (in old formats-new OTF fonts are not supported) and unattractive spacing. &nbsp;By locking everyone into the base set of fonts (and they lock you in) they homogenize brands into an ugly amateur mass
 that says, "we don't care about design, presentation or perception -- we just do the basics just like everyone else. It says "we're average.""</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every single time I've trained someone on how to add a rule above and below a paragraph, they say something like "are you kidding me?" &nbsp;We'll I'm not. &nbsp;And then the killer irony is this: &nbsp;Owners of companies who rely on Microsoft accept this amateur set
 of tools and are conditioned to never leave or even try an alternative. The PR line goes like this and you've all heard it before: &nbsp;"everyone else uses Word or Powerpoint or Excel so we have to." &nbsp;NO YOU DON'T! &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you really want docs to look good, tell your employees to put their crayons away, turn away from the clipart of that frog or fireman... and use anything else. Anything!</p>

<h2>            Add guest users to office365 group</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to automate creating and adding and guest users to an Office365 group&nbsp;&nbsp;through powershell.</p>
<p>For now I can create groups.</p>
<p>Code:</p>
<p>$groupName = 'Name1'</p>
<p>New-UnifiedGroup -DisplayName $groupName&nbsp;-Alias $groupName&nbsp;-AccessType "Private" -AlwaysSubscribeMembersToCalendarEvents -AutoSubscribeNewMembers -PrimarySmtpAddress $groupName&nbsp;+ *** Email address is removed for privacy *** -RequireSenderAuthenticationEnabled $false -SubscriptionEnabled
 -Confirm:$false</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can also create guest users:</p>
<p>Code:</p>
<p>New-MailContact -Name “Fname Lname” -ExternalEmailAddress *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>
</p><p>But how can I add the guest users (mailcontact) to the office365 group?&nbsp;Which command do I have to use?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>

<p><span>Hi&nbsp;</span><span>Chris_BAN，</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your feedback. As far as I know, if you add an external user to Office 365 group as a guest, it will display as Guest mail user in
<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/ecp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Exchange admin center</a>&gt; recipients &gt; contacts rather than mail contact.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cccd01d3-6843-4ea5-acd1-144787b6d404?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cccd01d3-6843-4ea5-acd1-144787b6d404?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And based on your demand, I have done many researches and tests, and I found it is not feasible to add mail contact to Office 365 Group via PowerShell, on the contrary, we can use PowerShell to add user mailbox,
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/exchange/users-and-groups/new-mailuser?view=exchange-ps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
mail user</a> and guest mail user to it. For your reference:&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/exchange/users-and-groups/Add-UnifiedGroupLinks?view=exchange-ps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/exchange/users-and-groups/Add-UnifiedGroupLinks?view=exchange-ps</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I fairly understand this is inconvenient for you to do business, if you can accept, I recommend you can add the external email address to mail user and add them to Office 365 group later, if you still want to add mail contact to Office 365 group, I recommend
 you can post your feedback in <a href="https://office365.uservoice.com/forums/264636-general" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office 365 uservoice</a>, which is a forum to collect customers' feedback, many features are updated based on your suggestions, your voice is helpful for better using experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your understanding and efforts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Betty</p>

<h2>            Legal Documents&#58; Integrating Numbered Headings and Styles</h2>
                    <p>This may sound complicated, but I'm pretty sure it's possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to prepare documents that have auto-numbered section headings, with different levels, and then body text for the paragraphs. For example.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I. &nbsp; &nbsp; MAIN HEADING</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A. &nbsp; First Sub-Heading.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is the text paragraph.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;B. &nbsp; &nbsp;Second Sub-Heading</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is the next paragraph.</p>
<p>
</p><p>II. &nbsp;SECOND MAIN HEADING</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A. &nbsp;First Sub-Heading.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can kind of figure out how to modify a number style that I want. &nbsp;But when I hit enter after entering the heading text, I want to get the body text style (not the next number). &nbsp;And then, when I finish with the body text for that section, I want to easily
 be able to get back to the next heading level.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone point me in the right direction? &nbsp;I bought a copy of Word 2013 Bible just to figure this out, but I don't see it addressed at all.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>This is a very common numbering scheme. In your document, in the paragraph that you want to be the first main heading, click the
<strong>Multilevel List </strong>button in the <strong>Paragraph</strong> group on the
<strong>Home</strong> tab. Select the pane that shows I. Heading 1, A. Heading 2, 1. Heading 3. This will apply the Heading 1 style, with roman numbering, to the current paragraph.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very likely you will not like the formatting of Heading 1 or the placement of the number. You will attack this in two ways. To change the formatting of the paragraph (font, font size, font color, line spacing, Spacing Before/After--everything except any
 indents on the left side), right-click in the Heading 1 block in the Quick Style Gallery and choose
<strong>Modify...</strong> Make what changes you can in the <strong>Modify Style</strong> dialog, then click
<strong>Format</strong> and choose <strong>Paragraph</strong> or <strong>Font</strong> to make other changes. Do
<strong>not</strong> select <strong>Numbering</strong>, however, as you can't change multilevel list numbering from this dialog.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To modify the numbering and indents, you must again click <strong>Multilevel List</strong> and choose
<strong>Define New Multilevel List</strong>. Level 1 will be selected, and you can change the number formatting and style and position, plus tabs and indents, from this dialog (click
<strong>More&gt;&gt;</strong> to expand the dialog and see all the options). While you're there, you can also modify these characteristics for Level 2 (linked to Heading 2), Level 3 (linked to Heading 3) and so on (you'll still have to modify the font and paragraph
 formatting for each heading through the <strong>Modify Style</strong> dialog).</p>
<p>
</p><p>By default, the "Style for following paragraph" for all heading styles is Normal. This means that when you press
<strong>Enter</strong> at the end of one of your Heading 1 paragraphs, you're going to get a Normal paragraph. When you modify the heading style, you can change this. You can use Body Text, Body Text Indent, List Continue, or any other style (modified as you
 choose) as the following style, and you can have a different following style for every heading level. In an outline-type layout, it makes sense to use the List Continue series of styles, which already have progressive indents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you want a new heading paragraph, you can use the built-in keyboard shortcuts
<strong>Alt+Left Arrow</strong> to promote the level and <strong>Alt+Right Arrow</strong> to demote. In addition,&nbsp; you can use
<strong>Tab</strong> and <strong>Shift+Tab</strong> if you have checked the box for "Set left- and first-indent with tabs and backspaces" at
<strong>File | Options | Proofing | AutoCorrect Options</strong><strong> | AutoFormat As You Type</strong>.</p>

            Multi selection is possible only through the use of VBA code. Ron has provided several links and you can use any one of them.

    <title>Touchpad Scrolling Sensitivity in Microsoft Office - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Touchpad Scrolling Sensitivity in Microsoft Office</h2>
                    <p>My laptop just underwent a Windows update last night, and all day today I've noticed that my touchpad is scrolling way more quickly/abruptly than it used to, within the context of a Microsoft Word window.&nbsp; This change seems specific to Microsoft Word (Excel
 and my internet browser, e.g., are behaving the same as they always have).&nbsp; In Word documents, my touchpad-scrolling is now so quick that I'm not really able to use my touchpad for scrolling anymore - I end up overshooting maybe ten pages beyond where I want
 to be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Similarly (though perhaps unrelatedly) the scroll-sensitivity in my OneNote has been way too intense, ever since I bought my current laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use both of these applications frequently, so any help on figuring out what to do would be appreciated.&nbsp; I would like the dial down the scroll-sensitivity for just these applications, without affecting my ability to scroll at a normal pace in other contexts.&nbsp;
 Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>For reference, I'm using Windows 10 on a Lenovo Yoga laptop.&nbsp; I'm on the 2016 version of Microsoft Office.</p>

<p>Hi Zach,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It could be that a component in Word may have been corrupted or damaged after the update, or that an add-in is causing this behavior in Word, etc. For us to isolate the issue about the behavior of scrolling in Word, kindly respond to the questions below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Which update was recently installed on your device?</li><li>Have you checked if Office is updated?</li><li>Are there any add-ins installed in Word?</li><li>Does the issue persists when you use an external mouse?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>

            1607 is the preview build number with paint 3d. &nbsp; I have noted there is a unexpected closing problem when trying to manipulate objects. &nbsp;My processor is a dual core and a gigabyte motherboard 775 intel. &nbsp;Of course the older processor may be related but
 the system does run all the program and it functions until I try to move an object or manipulate it in 3d.

<h2>            IE11 Keeps Giving &#34;This page can&#8217;t be displayed&#34; Following Windows 10 mid-September 2016 Update</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p><span>System</span></p>

<p><span>------</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Windows 10 - updated mid-September 2016</span></p>

<p><span>Internet Explorer version 11.187.14393.0 (Update versions 11.0.35 KB3185319)</span></p>

<p>

</p><p><span>The Problem</span></p>

<p><span>-----------</span></p>

<p>

</p><p><span>In the middle of September 2016 my wife and myself both received Windows 10 updates on our computers. My wife has an HP laptop, and I have a desktop. Those updates were extremely
 large, and took several hours to install. (Are those updates the one referred to as the Anniversary Updates?).</span></p>

<p>

</p><p><span>Following that update, both of our computers are now experiencing exactly the same difficulties accessing websites via Internet Explorer. Whether we click on links from our
 Favourites (all the links), or type in web addresses manually, we inevitably get the error "This page can’t be displayed". For example . . .</span></p>

<p>

</p><p><span>This page can’t be displayed</span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>•<span>&nbsp; </span>Make sure that the web address http://www.artexltd.com is correct.</span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>•<span>&nbsp; </span>Look for the page with your search engine.</span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>•<span>&nbsp; </span>Refresh the page in a few minutes.</span></p>

<p>

</p><p><span>What I have found is that if I keep attempting to access the required website in new tabs, after 3 or 4 attempts it will eventually load. Often if the page has graphics/pictures
 they don't load and just display as an "X", but the graphics/pictures eventually do appear if I keep opening the website in new tabs. What I do at the moment is to use the Ctrl+K feature to open the failed website in several new tabs until eventually one opens
 successfully. Sometimes though, I have to close down Internet Explorer and open it again to make this work.</span></p>

<p>

</p><p><span>The problem also continues when trying to access webpages via links within other sites. For example, if I do a search within Google, then try to open up one of the search
 results, more often than not I will get the "This page can’t be displayed" error again.</span></p>

<p>

</p><p><span>Also, I've tried using Microsoft Edge as an alternative browser, to see if the issue is only with Internet Explorer. This time I get "</span><span>
</span><span>Hmm, we can’t reach this page" when I try to go to the http://www.artexltd.com site. It looks like the same problem occurs here in Microsoft Edge as well.</span></p>

<p>

</p><p><span>One other thing I've noticed, which may be linked to this, is with my emails. I use "Microsoft Outlook 2010" for my emails, and I've found that several of my emails no longer
 display graphics but only show an "X" where an image should be. I don't know if this is relevant or not, but I thought it worth mentioning just in case.</span></p>

<p>

</p><p><span>I Have Done Three Things To Try And Fix This Problem</span></p>

<p><span>----------------------------------------------------</span></p>

<p>

</p><p><span>1. I returned my computer to an earlier state via backups</span></p>

<p>

</p><p><span>I use "True Image 2013" to take full disc image backups roughly monthly. The last image backup I took was just after the mid-August 2016 Windows 10 update, a point in time
 where everything was working correctly. I used this image to return my computer back to that point in time, to see if the website access problems were still happening. My thinking was that would demonstrate whether it was the mid-September 2016 Windows 10
 update which had caused the problem, or not.</span></p>

<p>

</p><p><span>I found that the Internet Explorer 11 problems were no longer happening when I returned my computer back to it's mid-August position. Everything worked perfectly. When I then
 returned my computer back to it's position after the mid-September 2016 Windows 10 update, the website access issues returned. I believe this action has demonstrated that it was the latest September update which has caused this problem.</span></p>

<p>

</p><p><span>2. I Reset Internet Explorer 11</span></p>

<p>

</p><p><span>The most common piece of advice on the Microsoft help pages for this problem seemed to be that I reset the settings for Internet Explorer as described in Article ID: 17441.
 I followed those instruction, but resetting Internet Explorer has not worked to fix the issue. The "This page can’t be displayed" error remains a problem.</span></p>

<p>

</p><p><span>3. I disabled Norton 360</span></p>

<p>

</p><p><span>The one common feature between my wife's laptop and my desktop is that we both have Norton 360 installed. With that in mind, I tried disabling the Norton "Smart Firewall"

            I had many problems after installing the update, primarily getting onto websites. I would get the msg. "website not responding" and "recover webpage."&nbsp; When I did "recover webpage" my PC would freeze causing me to have to do an control-alt-delete to get
 out of the situation.&nbsp; It occurred to me later that perhaps my ad blocker could be the problem so I uninstalled ad blocker and everything has worked fine ever since.&nbsp; Although I now have to sit through watching ads it is preferable to the other problems.&nbsp;

    <title>My existing formulas no longer work&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> devan101  say:</h3>
<h2>            My existing formulas no longer work&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've built a spreadsheet in Excel 2003, complete with formulas.&nbsp; I've been using the same spreadsheet for 5 + years.&nbsp; I simply copy the page and use it on a monthly basis.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently, when I've copied the page ( I have a 'master' page which contains all the formula's and no data) and then begin populating the fields, the fields which have formulas no longer calculate.&nbsp; When I click on the field, the formula is CLEARLY visible
 and is correct!.&nbsp; (yes, my auto calculate setting is set to on, and no the fields are not formatted as text).&nbsp; The only way I can correct this problem is to re-enter all my formula's, of which there are several hundred.&nbsp; I've also tried repairing my file...all
 to no avail.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only possible explanation I have is that I have opened the file in Excel 2007 and then saved it.&nbsp; Could that have corrupted the file?&nbsp; If so, how can I fix it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have researched the subject extensively and have not been able to find any solution other than those I've mentioned above.&nbsp; Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;
</p>

            <p>Thx All for your assistance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After many resolution attempts, the problem appears to have disappeared...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Initially, the only solution that worked was completely re-entering the forumulas in the cells.&nbsp; Where I re-entered formulas, they again, began to work.&nbsp; Where I didn't they would not.&nbsp; Eventually, however, that too was not guaranteed as in some cases it
 would work and others not.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my frustration, I closed the file down after making the above noted changes after not seeing the expected results.&nbsp; When I went to re-open the file to try other solutions, I would find the formulas again working in the fields where they were re-entered
 but not in fields not yet re-entered.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Deciding to take it a step further, I decided to try restarting my computer.&nbsp; It appears that this, perhaps combined with other efforts has, at least temporarly, resolved most of the problems.&nbsp; Probably 90 - 95% of my files are now once again working properly,
 but there are still fields that need re-entering.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FYI, solutions attempted include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1)&nbsp; repairing the entire office application (no errors identified)</p>
<p>2)&nbsp; completing full indepth virus scans with multiple antivirus apps (none&nbsp;were found)&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) ensuring that the auto calc setting was turned on (it was) </p>
<p>4) ensuring the fields were not formated as text (they weren't)</p>
<p>5)&nbsp; re-creating entire files (temp solution as they too began corrupting)</p>
<p>6)&nbsp; re-entering formulas in the fields (temp solution as the fields would corrupt again after closing)</p>
<p>7) completed a chkdsk of the drive (no problems found) </p>
<p>8)&nbsp; completed all suggestions mentioned in this thread...</p>
<p>9)&nbsp; restarted my computer on several occassions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bottom line is that I don't know what caused the problem, or why the final computer restart appears to have corrected the "majority" of the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, thx all for your suggestions.</p>

            You might need to reset your headset if he has reach his maximum of paired devices, some headsets have a maximum of 7 devices that can be paired / authenticated. Then you may need to activate the device discovery on headset side since some headsets are
 just discoverable only during the pairing / authentication process and after that they remain hidden.

Thank you, I did that, and the headset only paired to 1 device that's it. Please advise if anything else I should try.

<h2>            How to play&#47;pause a video within PPT with regular wireless mouse &#63;</h2>
                    Hi
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I know there are some presenter mouse in the market with play/pause buttons, but I will not be able to get one before my next presentation.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there any trick to play/pause a video movie in PPT by using a regular wireless mouse ?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>currently I use only the left-click button.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>is it possible to customize the right-click to play/pause ?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Many thank for any quick idea !</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>p.s.</div>
<div>hover the mouse over the video - &nbsp;to display the Play/Pause bar is not an option I guess since I am holding the wireless mouse in my hand (and not on the table)&nbsp;</div>

            Hi
<div><br />
<div>I raise this issue again since I have noticed that when you assign a Play animation to a video object, ppt automatically assigns a pause animation - with trigger of the video itself.</div>
<div><br />
<div>this allows you to click on the video while playing - to pause / start as many times you need.</div>
<div><br />
<div>this is true when you use regular mouse - so you can move it a little on a surface - so that the "hyperlink hand" is displayed - which means that you can click to pause/play the video.</div>
<div><br />
<div>this is not working when you hold wireless mouse in your hand &nbsp;(and maybe also presenter mouse which I currently do not have) &nbsp;</div>
<div>the "hyperlink hand" is not shown - making it impossible for you to invoke this trigger of play/pause.</div>
<div><br />
<div>so:</div>
<div><br />
<div>is there a way - maybe vba - to force ppt to pause/play any video if a mouse click is entered during its play ?</div>
<div><br />
<div>I will open a new topic asking for recommendation of a presenter mouse with pause/play feature.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>many thanks !!!!</div>

            <p>Thank you for the information but the problem is that I am a long-time, responsible user and was always able to send or forward email to two groups of 50 and 21 email addresses, respectively. &nbsp;Last week, Outlook had a new look and since then I can't always
 send out emails. &nbsp;Today, it allowed me to forward a message to 13 other emails addresses but not to 25 email addresses. &nbsp;I am only sending or forwarding email to others about three times a day so it isn't excessive. &nbsp;Is anyone else having this problem or does
 this updated Outlook have some "bugs" in it?</p>

            <p>Thanks for responding, Tony.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I actually called Outlook. &nbsp;I explained the problem, I was then passed on to three different people who all said that a different department should help me and passed me to someone else. The final person sent me back to the web site where I originally had
 put in the request for a phone call. &nbsp;Absolutely no help at all. &nbsp;So frustrating.</p>

            I finally solved the problem on my own. &nbsp;I deleted the old lists and made new lists. &nbsp;The new lists work. &nbsp;It is time consuming if you have a lot of people on your lists but you do end up with working lists.

<br />
<br />Go to <a href="http://www.office.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.office.com</a> and if you're not already signed in, select Sign in
<br />
<br />On that page in your info, you will see your current subscription to Office 365 and the expiry date for that . . .

            Hi,
<br />
<br />I am a Microsoft Community expert here to help you. I'm sorry to hear that you're having difficulties.
<br />
<br />Check your expiration status 
<br />Go to your Services &amp; subscriptions page:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://account.microsoft.com/services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com/services/</a>
<br />
<br />If prompted, choose Sign in and enter the Microsoft account email and password associated with your Office 365 subscription.
<br />
<br />Review the details under the Services &amp; Subscriptions heading. 
<br />
<br />If you see a circle arrow, then your subscription is set up for recurring billing, unless you turn recurring billing off or cancel it beforehand. The next charge info shows you when you’ll be charged next, and for how much. 
<br />
<br />If you see Expires on [date], then your subscription will expire on that date, unless you renew. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Please let me know I'm happy to try to solve your problem.       
        </p>

<h2>            How can I uninstall outlook for mac 2011 but leave word, excel and powerpoint&#63;</h2>
                    I want to remove outlook from my mac as I never use it but in some cases, even when I selected mail as the default app, Outlook is launched by an ics attachment. I still use word and powerpoint sometimes so I would like to keep it. I was told the only
 way was to remove Office 2011 completely. is there another workaround? I just want to get rid of Outlook for good.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks for the help</div>

Hi Lujosalgo,</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
If you used Outlook, the one folder I would delete is the&nbsp;<b>Outlook 2011 Identities</b>. That folder contains all of your Outlook information and can get quite large. The steps below explain where to find it:</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
<ol>
<li>In&nbsp;the&nbsp;<b>Finder</b>, click&nbsp;<b>Go</b>, and then click&nbsp;<b>Home</b>. Open the&nbsp;<b>Documents&nbsp;</b>folder.</li><li>Open the&nbsp;<b>Microsoft User Data</b>&nbsp;folder.</li><li>Control-click or right-click the&nbsp;<b>Office 2011 identities</b>&nbsp;folder and choose&nbsp;<b>Move to Trash</b></li></ol>
<div>
<br />
<div>
Other than that, the Outlook application itself is only 50 MB. You can remove it, but it might cause complications when installing updates later down the road. I would personally recommend keeping it.</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
Hope this helps!</div>

<h2>            Outlook Service Status -normal----Not True&#33;</h2>
                    <p>After the fix yesterday 3/13/2013 I was able to access folders and I was able to send and receive messages that was until today. The Service Status page lists outlook as running normally, well if this is normal I don't want it. I am not able to receive emails
 either on this computer, another computer or my kindle fire, so I think it's safe to assume that the problem is not with my computer. I hesitate notifying everyone that I am changing to another address because of the time involved but if I don't see any improvement
 soon I will have no other alternative. Extremely disappointed in this "smooth transition" from hotmail to outlook.

<p>I want to thank you for replying to my message and for your suggestions on possible fixes for my problem but I along with many others were experiencing the same problems, it had nothing to do with any of the settings for my account, obviously the problem
 was with the outlook server which I am happy to report has been repaired and outlook is performing as it should. Again&nbsp;I want to thank you for your reply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

    <title>Downloading office Windows 10S - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jonathanthijs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Downloading office Windows 10S</h2>
                    <p>Dear Windows workers,</p>
<p>Does any of you know how I can install office on my ASUS Vivobook, running on Windows 10S? I bought a license code for the 2016 professional plus version through another store and I have some trouble now downloading the actual programs, because my laptop
 is prohibited from downloading any non-Windows store apps. Besides, simply downloading the file in the Windows store won't work for some reason, the pending bar just doesn't fill up :(</p>
<p>My gratitude in avance,</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Jonathan</p>

<p>Hi Jonathan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 S is working exclusively from the downloaded applications directly from the Microsoft Store, hence, the error message. If you want to install the Office 2016 Professional Plus, you can choose to switch out of Windows 10 S configuration to Windows
 10 Pro. <br />
<br />
A fee may apply when you choose to switch and is collected through the Microsoft Store. To switch to Pro, open
<strong>Settings</strong>, select <strong>Update and Security</strong> &gt; <strong>
Activation </strong>&gt; <strong>Upgrade your edition of Windows</strong> &gt; <strong>
Go to Store</strong>.<br />
</p>
<p>Please note that switching to Pro is one-way. If you make the switch, you won't be able to go back to Windows 10 S.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, if you want to continue downloading application from the Store, may we know if you're getting any error messages? You can run the
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4027498/windows-10-run-the-troubleshooter-for-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Apps Troubleshooter</a></strong> to fix common problems in the Windows Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope the above information helps. Keep us posted on the status of the issue and we'll be glad to assist you further.
</p>
<br />

<p>heyy, </p>
<p>Yes I understand :) If possible however I'd like to maintain Windows 10S as my running system. So then the way to go is through the store, I'll elaborate a bit more on that problem. When I first installed my laptop the office apps were almost automatically
 downloaded, and I was able to open them, but after an update I somehow had to reinstall them when I opened them to enter the key. That reinstalling never really took place, or they disappeared from the downloading list or they kept on pending forever. The
 troubleshooter says there are no problems, do you know a way I can maybe get this running again?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Jonathan</p>

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Which update did you install on your device?

                    <p>What is the best way to create a playlist?</p>

            <p>You have to let go of the fact that Zune will not use your folder structure, but uses the media's metadata to sort itself.</p>
<p>My preferred way of making playlists is right-clicking the media in Zune and choosing "add to now playing", then once I'm done, I go to the Now Playing screen and select "Save as Playlist".</p>

m3u playlists are compatible. &nbsp;
<div>genre=misc means you don't have the real genre... that doesn't help you in the long run.</div>
<div>To manually create a playlist you only have to drag and drop from collection to the playlist icon at the lower left. &nbsp;If this is cumbersome, then consider autoplaylists, which use filters that you program in. &nbsp;I gave up on manual playlists long ago, and
 instead have autoplaylists like top 100 plays, likes, likes limited to specific genre's, etc. &nbsp;Experiment and you will probably invent some clever autoplaylists that you like a lot (and they will automatically update over time as well.)</div>

</p>
<p>no, you misunderstood me.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><b>I have a folder called "Music". In it, I have folders named by a genre of music. for example: "Rock", "Indie" and so on. In each of those folders, I have a folder named "MISC" in which i put all of the songs that i acquired alone, not as a part of the
 album</b>. All the songs in that folder have the same and correct genre tagged.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><b>So what you are saying is that i could make a playlist in say foobar, and use that playlist in zune?</b></p>
</blockquote>
1) as long as the parent music folder is in your zune collection, the sub-folders will be also. &nbsp;the folder structure is irrelevant to zune, and is not used for anything. &nbsp;Zune will (and can) only use the metadata in each song. &nbsp;
<div>2) Possibly. &nbsp;You must set foobar to use the m3u playlist format (or it has to be the default that foobar already uses.) If so, zune will understand them, and play them. &nbsp;Make sure though, that you move them from where ever foobar saves them to the zune
 playlist folder.</div>

<p>Hi Ullas,<br />
<br />
I’d like to explain that it’s not feasible to bulk edit items in a list, we appreciate you understanding. Instead, we could bulk add items in the Datasheet view from the Excel to the list in
<strong>IE browser</strong>. Here are the steps: Copy a few lines from a spreadsheet in Excel &gt; navigate to the last row of the list &gt; select the whole row &gt; paste. Below are the examples:<br />

<p>
</p><p>You could give it try in<strong> IE browser </strong>to see the outcome. <br />

If you are using SharePoint online, as an alternate workaround, we can export the list into Excel file, then bulk add the items into the Excel. At last, export the Excel file to SharePoint site to create a
<strong>new</strong> list. Below are the steps:<br />
In list1, click <strong>LIST </strong>&gt;<strong> Export to Excel</strong>:<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/741798f8-7384-4a16-977d-36825c7b6465" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/741798f8-7384-4a16-977d-36825c7b6465" /></a><br />
In pop up window of Excel, click OK:<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7a995c71-c2a3-4768-ad7f-73963bd75c1b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7a995c71-c2a3-4768-ad7f-73963bd75c1b" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Bulk add files to the Excel file&nbsp; &gt; <strong>Export </strong>&gt; <strong>Export Tables to SharePoint List</strong>:<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e4e19350-e3cb-4d95-803f-3a7b9ef7336f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e4e19350-e3cb-4d95-803f-3a7b9ef7336f" /></a><br />
<br />
Enter you root SharePoint site address: https://domian.sharepoint.com, create a <strong>
new</strong> list name (which different from list1) &gt; <strong>Finish</strong>:<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9dd83cbe-405d-4308-bb7e-0dd5e51d7ea5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9dd83cbe-405d-4308-bb7e-0dd5e51d7ea5" /></a><br />
<br />
Go to SharePoint site &gt; <strong>Site Contents</strong> &gt;<strong> List 2</strong> &gt; click to open it:<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b9fa3641-d50e-448a-acb4-7c3e5c0248dd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b9fa3641-d50e-448a-acb4-7c3e5c0248dd" /></a><br />
<br />
Then the content would be updated in the new list:<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e6bfe473-a3b7-469a-8c2d-4bfef707e3aa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e6bfe473-a3b7-469a-8c2d-4bfef707e3aa" /></a><br />

<p>
</p><p>exporting excel data to sharepoint list not feasible since it creates a new list every time.</p>
