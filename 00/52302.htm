<h2>            I closed my microsoft account and now I cant access windows 8</h2>
                    Hey I recently closed my other Microsoft account but I forgot to disconnect it with my Windows 8 in my laptop and now I can't access Windows 8. Every time it asks me for that email id and password which doesn't make sense because I already deleted that
 account. When I try to enter the password for that account it says the password is incorrect. I can't even log in into that microsoft account anymore despite many threads suggesting that we get 30 days to log in after our account has been closed. Please tell
 me if there is any way I can access my laptop again. I already sent microsoft a message through the contact us forum bu they have not responded ever since. Please suggest a method. I have a lot of important data stored.

            Had Windows 7 Pro on a nVidia GTX 660 was running 3 monitors with no problem. Upgraded to Windows 10 Pro now the third monitor is not detected under display settings. I have checked the wires updated the drivers and tired to configure it manually in nVidia
 interface but no luck. The computer shows 3 monitors in hardware manager but only two are available to select. in display settings. &nbsp;

<h2>            Surface Pro won&#39;t recognise internet availability</h2>
                    <p>I have the original version of Surface Pro and am currently travelling in Europe from Australia. Today I attempted to connect to the internet and had a message in my Settings saying it was unavailable. This is incorrect as I am in a location where I know
 it is available. Also I have been using my phone as a hot spot successfully until today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I have tried to troubleshoot on the device I received a message that says "The Marvell AVASTAR Wireless Composite Device adapter is experiencing driver or hardware related problems" .</p>
<p>I am 68 and not technically minded.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What does this mean?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can it be fixed in Europe while I am travelling?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any assistance will be appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Tomb Raider Definitive Edition Save Game Failing to Load - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Tomb Raider Definitive Edition Save Game Failing to Load</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just recently got Tomb Raider Definitive edition through Xbox game pass. I realize this is an old game but wondered if anyone has come across this recently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got to about 52% through the game to Cliffside Bunker and now when I try to load the save game it just loads to black screen hear some ambient sound and can't do anything. I've tried restarting the Xbox, re-installing the game, deleting save data on the
 console to re-sync with cloud save but no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've found references to this issue but haven't found anything to fix it that works for me. This is annoying as the game has been around for a while and rise of the tomb raider which I've also played had backup saves you can revert back to, would have been
 nice if they'd added this to this game as well. Seems they realised it was an issue in the previous game to add back saves in the later tomb raider games.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very annoying. I'll probably just play shadow of the tomb raider now and then maybe come back to this if I have to restart the game again.</p>

Power cycle</a> on your console or deleting your account and then adding it again, this will sure force the game to sync again for sure.

<p>Hey there TheJodymyster!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that you're dealing with this issue trying to get Tomb Raider to load.
</p>
<p>I would say that if this keeps crashing again and again, the best way for you to start troubleshooting would be for you try the steps outlined in "<a href="https://support.xbox.com/games/troubleshooting/game-freeze-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">My
 Xbox One game won't start or freezes during gameplay</a>". </p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't resolve the deal, the next thing I would suggest trying would be a soft reset of your console which you can get done following the steps on
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to reset your console to factory defaults on Xbox One</a>. <span><span>It's a reset of your console back to factory settings but one that does not uninstall any of your games or apps and is a really good troubleshooting
 step for most issues.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p style="text-align: left; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); margin-left: 0">
<span><span>Just make sure that before you go ahead with it, that you do know all of the sign-in information for any/all of your accounts</span></span><span><span>(as</span></span><span><span>they
 will be removed) </span></span><span><span>and have easy access to your internet network</span></span><span><span>.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>Skype Integrated Calling - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dbbnmp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype Integrated Calling</h2>
                    For unknown reasons, Skype calls have started coming in as Skype Audio calls and are showing in my call log. I had previously turned Integrated Calling off. Now (ios 11.4) there is no option in Skype to do this. Additionally, Skype calls are coming in
 with sound when notifications are set to OFF and when my phone is on Do Not Disturb. &nbsp;This is forcing me to log out of Skype after using it ... causing me to miss incoming calls. What happened?! How to I fix this?&nbsp;

    <title>Installshield wizard broken &#47;corrupted, slow or nonexistent - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gordonanon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Installshield wizard broken &#47;corrupted, slow or nonexistent install.</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have problems with installing programs with installshield wizard. Every time when I try to install games from discs the installshield won't start to install the game. This happens also with software. I have also tried downloading digital .iso file of the
 own game and installing the game from that and installshield still hangs. I have also tried installing games with compatibility modes and/or while my antivirus and firewalls are disabled. Sometimes the installer will complete the install but for one game it
 takes 3-4 hours which I say is way too much. I was able to install java for my chrome but it took 3 hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried renaming installshield wizard folder and files in it but I can't find folder in Program Files, only in Program Files(x86). This has not worked. I also have tried using microsoft's fixit -utilities with no luck. For that matter, I don't understand
 how "fix it " -program will do any good anyways since I need to install it and it takes forever and still finds " no issues to be resolved ". No surprise there.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried installing games and software in safe mode and the installer was able to finish within minutes but there was errors right after installer finished and the game wasn't able to start in safe mode nor in normal boot. I also tried system restore
 but ended up with Catastrophic failure with 0x8000FFFF -error. Furthermore I have also tried downloading iKernel -update but that didn't resolve anything since the update was done in complete silence and I didn't receive any notifications that the update was
 done. I'm now suspecting that my RAM is somehow defective. I've run memtest+ with few random errors. I'm also thinking that my motherboard is broken but I still think that foremost this problem is based on software.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use windows 7 professional, 64-bit, with i5-3570k, AsRock z77 pro3, 8gb of Corsair Vengeance DDR3, Samsung 840 SSD 120gb and WD 1T Green.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to _how_ this problem starts, what causes it. Why is installshield so slow to start or doesn't start at all? What corrupts installshield wizard (iKernel) and how do I fix it, preferably without installing again windows again. I'm not that good with
 windows but I have done everything I understand that could help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Using EAC &#40;Exact Audio Copy, latest version&#41; w&#47; Windows Media Center</h2>
                    I am using a 1 terabyte Western Digital HD installed as Drive D:, to contain EAC ripped uncompressed audio from my CD collection. The Windows 7 Pro O/S is on a plug-in drive, C:\. The EAC program is installed on C: and all ripped files are saved in a folder
 "EAC Uncompressed Audio" in the root dir of D:\. The folder is subdivided into Artists, and&nbsp;further subdivided into Albums containing the individual track files. Proceeding as follows, first I rip the CD to uncompressed WAV files to the directories created
 by Artist name and Album. Then I close EAC and open Media Player. The new rip shows up as "unknown", and following "get album information from&nbsp;the web" it adds the cover art and track names. This proceedure worked fine for the first 13 albums, but each additional
 album after the thirteen&nbsp;adds track numbers to the "unknown" album, i.e.,&nbsp;ripping ten additional albums yeilds ten "track ones", ten "track twos" etc., to the "unknown" album. Apparently Media Player ca

<p>i had the same problem got it resolve from my friend. check the steps to resolve unknown issue.</p>
<p>The easiest way to add media information to a file already in your Player Library is by searching for the information in the online database. This method works best when there's information in the database, but the Player is unable to automatically match
 it to the file in your Player Library.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Click the Start button , click All Programs, and then click Windows Media Player.<br />
If the Player is currently open and you’re in Now Playing mode, click the Switch to Library button in the upper-right corner of the Player.</p>
<p>In the Player Library, right-click an item, and then click Find album info. The Player connects to the Internet and displays the Find album information dialog box.</p>
<p>To select multiple adjacent items, click the first item, hold down the Shift key, and then click the last item. To select non-adjacent items, hold down the Ctrl key as you click each item.</p>
<p>In the Find album information dialog box, match the item or items to the correct album from the list or refine your search.</p>
<p>The Player closes the dialog box and adds the information to the Player Library. After some time (which varies depending on how many changes you've made and whether the Player is performing other actions), the information is also added to the file. To force
 the Player to update the file immediately, click Organize, and then click Apply media information changes.</p>
<p><br />
copy the media folder and paste it in your different drive simple ..</p>
<p>Keep rocking!!!!</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Hurting Eyes, Showing Blue Tint Screen, Blurry Fonts, Causing Headaches</h2>
                    <p>Recently</p>
<p>
</p><p>Built a Windows 10 system with much anticipation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>System Usage</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Application Development, App Development, Photo Editing, Occasional Video Editing, regular browsing, little bit Gaming.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the Windows 10 sucks totally</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Hurting Eyes can't work more than 1 hour (was working more than 10 hours in Windows 7 systems and windows servers)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Blue Tint in Screen</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Colors are not Accurate</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Fonts are blurry, grainy</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. No Aero Theme, Flat Design so lifeless</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. 2 Control Panels</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. Bloated with Apps, Felt like i am using SAMSUNG Android (atleast they have their color and design and appeal)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Read so many post in answers.microsoft</p>
<p>
</p><p>All recommending updating drivers, changing nightlight setting, scaling fonts size 125%, 150%, Calibrate the monitor, calibrate Nvidia Control Panel, use clear type font, using Color Profile etc.,</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are useless suggestions, as you all know build a PC install windows xp, windows 7 install the drivers and you are good to go.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is always the Default settings that is the correct settings for design, photo editing, media, programming and development.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried Different Monitors, Different Graphic Cards, different video cables, even different video ports in the Graphics Card, no difference whatsoever. It is not any of the hardware or driver problem It is the WINDOWS 10 that is causing this HAVOC</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still to double check, tested the same hardware in the other WINDOWS 7 machine all looks perfect and accurate. Web applications developed in the Windows 7 machine look faded and dull and lifeless when browsing in the windows 10 machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Literally opened the my computer in windows 7 (Windows Explorer) and my computer in windows 10(Windows Explorer) machine and compared, there is a huge difference in the graphical output.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not worried about the bugs or security on both the operating system, those are different issues which are all behind the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the End, To use the PC, the OS it has to be pleasant and accurate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Already started to re install Windows 7 to use till next year.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As there will be no more Windows Editions and Windows 10 is last and if this issues persist</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have to move to different OS and languages for programming, design and development.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is good that Adobe Softwares works same in MAC and Windows, And now you can install SQL SERVER and Visual Studio in MAC too</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Dear Microsoft</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>please give us a Windows to use that does not give headaches like this.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hope you will consider this.</strong> </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>BTW, WINDOWS 7 IS AN EXCEPTIONAL PRODUCT</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>

    <title>Headset won&#39;t play audio. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> arandomboi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Headset won&#39;t play audio.</h2>
                    <p>Alright, so I&nbsp; recently got a new headset, Turtle Beach Stealth 400, and I wanted to play my games using it (as all people do) but when I booted up any game the audio came out of my laptop and nothing from the headset. So I checked if it was plugged in right,
 it was, then I checked the default audio output for the games I was playing. I switched them to the headset and the headset alone. Still didn't help. Then I tried the settings assistant and that resulted in nothing. My laptop is an Asus TUF FX504 Series laptop.
 (the 16gb RAM, 128GB SSD, 1TB drive, GTX 1050, Core i7 8750H model) Also, The audio DOES play on the headset on YouTube and videos. If that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Plz help</p>

<br />Click the Driver tab
<br />
<br />Is there an option rollback?
<br />If so, click it.
<br />
<br />Also, check to make sure the audio driver is fully updated. This is often the problem when you upgrade to a new version of Windows 10. Sometimes reinstalling the latest available driver from the manufacturers website helps.
<br />
<br />Here is the latest driver: December 2018

<br />
<br />Open Start, type: change sound card
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Select the Playback
<br />Right click your Speakers
<br />Click Set as Default Device if it isn't already
<br />
<br />Select your speakers
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Levels tab
<br />Use the slider to adjust level
<br />
<br />Other options:
<br />
<br />1. Play a youtube video with the soundcard speaker jack unplugged and let it play through the laptop's inbuilt speakers.
<br />2. While it is playing, plug in the audio jack and see if it starts playing.

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, I didn't mention this as I forgot because this problem started a month ago and I just rolled with my laptop's speakers until I realized I didn't want my expensive headset to be left aside, collecting dust. AAANYWAY, I already tried the troubleshooter,
 updated my driver and saw no rollback options as my laptop is fairly new.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, as I already stated YouTube works just fine and plugging my headset in-game does not get the sound to play in them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Also. If you didn't read my post as carefully as I would've hoped (no offense), you would've seen that I already put the games as the default audio output to the headset. It didn't help.</p>

            Hi ARandomBoi 
<br />
<br />My name is Sarah Kong and I am an independent adviser that is here to try and help you with your issue.
<br />
<br />You are totally going to hate my answer but did you check turtle beachs site.
<br />The headset you have they can not guarantee it will work with PC.  It is made for PlayStation. 
<br />However the link below is support instructions for setting up with PC.
<br />Did you do the firmware update?

<h2>            Windows Essentials 2012 not working</h2>
                    <p>I am running Windows 7 on a HP desktop.&nbsp; Until recently, I could find and use the Photo Gallery/editor in Windows Essentials 2012.&nbsp; I cannot find it now.&nbsp; I have tried to repair Windows Essentials but get the error 0x800c0006 with 2 different "sources";
 crt90-i386 and wllogin-amd64.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried uninstalling Windows Essentials 2012 and cannot do that either.&nbsp; Errors are 0x80040609 and 0x8007064c.&nbsp; I loked at old messages regarding these error codes, but could not find anything that works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had installed an unrelated program.&nbsp; I restored the computer to a point prior to the new installation and still do not have, nor can repair, nor uninstall Windows Essentials 2012.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I do to get Windows Essentials 2012 working?</p>

<h2>            How to Activate Windows 10 using a Windows Vista Key&#63;</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Hi.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; I have decided to erase everything from a laptop that was previously running the "<em>Microsoft Windows Vista Home Premium 32-Bit</em>" Operating System and to cleanly install the "<em>Microsoft Windows Home 10 32-Bit</em>" Operating System from an USB
 Stick.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; However, when I am attempting to activate the "<em>Microsoft Windows Home 10 32-Bit</em>" Operating System using the key that was set inside the "<em>Microsoft Windows Vista Home Premium 32-Bit</em>" Operating System, I am getting the following error:<br />
<br />
<em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The product key you entered didn't work. Check the product key and try again, or enter a different one.</em><br />
<br />
<em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Error Code: 0xc004f050</em><br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; There is nothing wrong with the key. It was working perfectly inside the "<em>Microsoft Windows Vista Home Premium 32-Bit</em>" Operating System.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; What can I do now?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Thank you in advance.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Best regards.</p>
<p>

<p>That definitely sounds like a faulty flashdrive. &nbsp;The only answer I could suggest would be to use a different flashdrive. &nbsp;I personally use a SanDisk flashdrive (similar to the
<a href="http://www.sandisk.com/products/gaming-cards/sandisk-xbox-360-usb-flash-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
official Xbox flashdrive</a>, but cheaper <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-5.gif" />), which I've never had any issue with.</p>

                    I started up my laptop and it automatically went into the process of updating. Upon 3 of 3's completion, my system would give me the message "Failure to configure Windows update. Reverting changes." After that, my laptop would automatically restart and
 return to the beginning of 3 of 3, where it would then result in the same message "Failure ... blah blah." This has occurred several times already for long hours and I cannot find a way around it. I've tried restarting my laptop by forcing a shut down; holding

            Hello Robbielock.<br />
<br />
There's two things it could be, either the fans in your computer, in which case they could need cleaning, or replacing.&nbsp; Or worse, it could be your hard disk failing, if its more like a grinding/clicking sound its probably the hard disk.<br />
<br />
I'd suggest opening up the side of the case and see if you can locate where the noise is coming from.&nbsp; If it is a hard disk, backup your data
<span>
immediately </span>and replace the drive.<br />
<br />
Usually its the little fan on the motherboard that tends to go to the grave early, so I'd suspect its that.&nbsp; But try and rule out the hard disk. :)

                    <p>My desktop computer that has been running windows 10 for over a year forgot my 24" monitor and no longer offers 1920x1200 resolution.</p>
<p>using 1600x1200 is just not the same.</p>
<p>How do I get it to again offer the default resolution of my monitor?</p>

<p>I had mixed success.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is an AMD adaptor, ATI Radeon 3000 Graphics.</li><li>The roll back worked fine. I again had access to 1920x1200 resolution and it was again the default resolution for my monitor. :) :)</li><li>I took your option 1, and followed its option 4 (using a reg file). That ran fine. :)</li><li>However, while looking for solutions to the original problem, I had run windows update, and the Fall update was ready to install. Oops.</li><li>So when I restarted the machine after following option 1, it also applied the Fall update to windows.</li><li>When the machine restarted, the resolution was again 1600x1200. :(</li><li>And the driver tab for the&nbsp;<span>ATI Radeon 3000 Graphics has the roll back button greyed out. :(</span></li></ul>

    <title>Adobe Flash Player Security Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnj654  say:</h3>
<h2>            Adobe Flash Player Security Issues</h2>
                    First of all, why does my Windows 10 OS show that I only have Adobe Flash Player 32 bit installed when I have a 64 bit system? Truthfully though, my real issue is why don't I have the ability to remove Adobe Flash Player from my system whatever the version?
 Are the folks there at Microsoft not paying attention the&nbsp;serious security issues of Adobe Flash Player ( 07-26-2015 )? I would think that there should be a way for us users to control what programs/versions we have installed. All previous versions of Windows
 gave us that ability.<br />

            <p>You can turn off Adobe Flash in Microsoft Edge - Click More Actions &gt; Settings &gt; Advanced Settings &gt; click the on/off toggle</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Internet Explorer &gt; Click Tools (or press Alt + X) &gt; Manage Add Ons &gt; select Shockwave Flash Object and click Disable</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its built in so you can't remove it since a lot of sites depend on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for why its 32 bit, 64 bit IE and 64 bit Windows natively supports 32 bit extensions, its compatible and accomplishes the task without breaking compatibility.</p>

            Thanks. I did disable Adobe Flash Player in my browsers using your instructions. However, this still doesn't address the issue of not being able to uninstall unwanted third-party software from Windows 10.

<h2>            Surface Book Detach Key &#40;on keyboard&#41; doesn&#39;t work &#40;i7 256GB dGPU&#41;</h2>
                    <p><span>Although I can detach the chipboard from the entire surface book by clicking the software button in the task bar, the physical</span><span>
 detach key (the key next to the F12) doesn’t work. But the interest thing is that when I am trying to detach the chipboard, the little LED light on the detach button does work (it appears red -&gt; green). However, no matter how long I press the detach button,
 neither light or the detach process work. Why is this happening? Is there anybody who has the same problem? Thanks!</span></p>

            <p>I was experiencing the exact same thing and after much searching came across the below fix, which is copied below from another thread (http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/forum/surfbook-surfdrivers/unable-to-detach-clipboard-from-keyboard/4b0c6e19-eb0f-41d7-9c5e-56cff1667e0d).
 However unlike the author of that reply, my keyboard and trackpad were functioning but pressing the hardware detach key yielded no response, not even a blink of the LED. I thought I had a defective keyboard. I followed the successful solution and it worked!
 Before I booted back into Windows though, I tried the undock key while in BIOS and it worked so I saved/exited and once in Windows the undock key worked as promised. Might be worth a try if you haven't already!</p>

Your "Successful solution" worked perfectly on my Surface Book i7/500/16 as well. &nbsp;Multiple reboots and updates failed to fix my detach key. &nbsp;Doing a Shutdown with Power+Volume-Up and keeping it depressed until seeing the Surface logo had the same results on
 mine (detach key blinked red). &nbsp;After exiting BIOS, my detach key worked again!<em><strong><br />

<h2>            USB PORT unresponsive</h2>
                    <p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Microsoft Surface RT</strong></span></p>
<p>My <strong>USB port has stopped responding to&nbsp;my USB </strong>mouse and other USB sticks - it is
<strong>completely unresponsive.</strong> Everything looks normal in The Device Manager and I have tried uninstalling and rebooting as suggested on some forums&nbsp;which has had no affect. I was trying to restore the computer but I need to make space for 5GB and
 without being able to offload stuff to my USB that is virtually impossible without wiping everything&nbsp;off my tablet PLEASE HELP!

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>I understand that the USB port stopped working&nbsp;on your computer. The issue may arise if the currently loaded USB driver has become unstable or corrupt or if your PC requires an update&nbsp;for issues that may conflict with a
