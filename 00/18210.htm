<p>Restoring service - Nov 9, 2016 11:22 AM</p>
<p>Title: Can't see sender name in Outlook </p>
<p>User Impact: Users may be unable to see the sender's name when viewing messages in Outlook (desktop).
</p>
<p>More info: This issue affects the Outlook desktop client only, Outlook on the web is not affected.
</p>
<p>Current status: The deployment of the fix is approximately 2 percent complete. We've implemented deployment configuration changes to increase the saturation and speed of the deployment going forward. Functionality will be restored for affected users as soon
 as the fix reaches their environment. </p>
<p>Scope of impact: A few customers have reported this issue, and our analysis indicates that impact is specific to a subset of users who are served through the affected infrastructure.
</p>
<p>Start time: Thursday, November 3, 2016, at 1:42 AM UTC </p>
<p>Preliminary root cause: We recently deployed an update to resolve a previous issue that affected messages that had been re-sent from the sent items folder, in which the recipient was then unable to forward the message or reply to it. This update inadvertently
 introduced a code issue that caused sender information to be omitted from messages within the Outlook client user interface.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Missing sub-folders&#47;emails on migrated mailbox - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Missing sub-folders&#47;emails on migrated mailbox</h2>
                    
<p>Hi there,</p>

<p>We setup a client of ours with an Office365 account. She had a GMail address setup in her Outlook 2013 (via IMAP). I made sure her GMail was fully synced on PC. I then exported it to a .pst file. I imported that .pst file into her
 new Office365 Exchange email in Outlook on the same PC.</p>
<p>You can see all the folders and all the messages in Outlook and in the Web App. When the client checks her iPhone or iPads none of the sub-folders or emails show up. If you create a new folder in Outlook or the Web App that folder
 will show on the devices but if you try and move messages from any of the 'missing' folders into the new folder they don't show up either.</p>

<p>Thanks for any assistance.</p>

<p>This is a standard issue with IMAP folders coming from outlook. &nbsp;You need to fix the settings on every IMAP folder. &nbsp;No other way to fix it.</p>
<p>If you can't see the emails, ensure they were fully sync'd - they should be there. &nbsp;There is no standard issue that I've seen that will stop them apart from not being fully sync'd. &nbsp;Make sure you don't just have headers - as they will import then vanish.</p>
<p>I use the VBScript here that fixes all folders post IMAP migration - </p>

    <title>Macro or Other Technique for Finding Duplicate Words - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Macro or Other Technique for Finding Duplicate Words</h2>
                    <p>I was wondering if anyone knew of a macro or of another technique for finding duplicate words (e.g., the the) in a Microsoft Word document. When one does a spell &amp; grammar check, the program is able to detect such duplicates.</p>
<p>Sometimes one does not wish to run the spell and grammar check feature because of the numerous other things that are checked during the process, if one wishes to run solely the duplicate check feature. Is such a way to run solely
 the duplicate check feature or is there a macro can that can be written to perform such an operation?</p>
<p>Any assistance in answering this question would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please verify if you have renamed your account and wishes to revert back to the old email address. If so, please be informed that you can rename back the account but
<strong><span>you need to wait for 30 days</span></strong> before this change can happen. You also
<strong><span>need to remove the alias of the original account</span></strong>
<strong><span>name</span></strong> from the alias list in new account otherwise you will get an error “Name in Use”. After reverting back to original account name, you will have to wait for 6 months before you can re-name
 the account again. Please refer to the example below to understand this better.</span></p>
<p><span>Example: </span>
</p>
<p><span>*** Email address is removed for privacy *** is renamed to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***
</span></p>
<p><span>User can rename *** Email address is removed for privacy *** to *** Email address is removed for privacy *** after 30 days of renaming and removing alias “abc” from alias list of *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.
</span></p>
<p><span>After this rename the user must wait 6 months to rename *** Email address is removed for privacy *** to *** Email address is removed for privacy *** again or to something new like *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            Hi Steve,
<br />
<br />On the first Page, click Insert -  Header - Edit Teader
<br />
<br />Then on the resulting header and footer toolbar, choose 'Different First Page'
<br />
<br />You should then be able to delete the header and footer on the other pages

            Access the Header and copy the content to the clipboard and then click on the Different First Page and use Ctrl+V to paste the content from the clipboard into the First Page Header.&nbsp; Then go to the Footer and click on Next&nbsp; and copy the content of the
 Footer and then click on Previous to get back to the First Page Footer and paste the content into that Footer.&nbsp; Then you can use Next to delete the content from the primary Footer and Header.

<h2>            Turn off Dark Skin in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>How do I turn off the Dark Theme in Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't like Cortana being black, I don't like the black taskbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I liked the white theme.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought that the dark theme would be optional.</p>
<p>
</p><p>White is more modern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Dark Theme reminds me of Windows Vista.</p>

            <p>Its funny about what people think of as "more modern" since it changes depending on who you talk to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was definitely a big cry from a lot of feedback to go to a darker theme.&nbsp; And as you can see Microsoft has been doing just that with the dark Cortana and context menus.&nbsp; The problem of course is there really isn't any settings in Windows 10 to control
 all of this so it is an all or none decision on Microsoft's part.&nbsp; At least for the bulk of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The taskbar and the Start menu are in you control (but white isn't one of the choices).</p>
<p>Settings -&gt; Personalization -&gt; Colors -&gt; turn off Automatically pick an accent color from my background, and then you can pick the color for the Start menu and taskbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the rest of it, you should use the Windows Feedback app to let Microsoft know what you think.</p>

            <p>Hello Arya</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My computer (Packard Bell Imedia 1605B ) has been a bit slow connecting to IE8 over the last few months.&nbsp; Just thought it was because it's old and also because it needed defrag, reg clean, disc cleanup, etc.&nbsp; All my security settings are as recommended,
 including 'DEP enabled&nbsp;at all times'.&nbsp; I have no problem accessing Microsoft Fix it Solution Center and use it regularly to make sure everything is running smoothly.&nbsp; So even though the Solution Center shows that 'DEP was disabled but that the problem has
 now&nbsp;been fixed',&nbsp; the next time I log on and run the check in the Solution Center, DEP has been disabled again!</p>
<p>Sorry if&nbsp;my explanation&nbsp;is as clear as mud but I just don't understand why this is happening and that it is a potential security problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><strong>re your reply -&nbsp; "A detailed description of the Data Execution Prevention (DEP) feature in Windows XP Service Pack 2, Windows XP Tablet PC Edition 2005, and Windows Server 2003</strong><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/875352" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/875352</a>&nbsp; "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I still cannot fix the problem.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I have looked at the above link and other links that that one refers to and all my settings appear to be as recommended.&nbsp; My computer has both hardware and shoftware enforced DEP.&nbsp; The boot.ini file is set to /noexecuteOptOut and under System Properties
 DEP also has the same setting and there are no exceptions listed.&nbsp; I followed the instructions in the above link&nbsp;to switch to AlwaysOn (thinking this may help) and after doing so I couldn't&nbsp;make any changes to&nbsp;the DEP&nbsp;settings on System Properties as it was
 greyed out!&nbsp; It stated that I needed to be logged on as administrator even though I already was! &nbsp;I therefore restored my computer to its previous settings.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I have also been reading through lots of the forum queries regarding DEP in IE8 and&nbsp; Windows XP to see if any of those replies could help me.&nbsp; It looks like I have&nbsp;the opposite problem to that which&nbsp;others are having, in that DEP does not&nbsp;cause IE to stop
 responding and close on my computer but that IE may be causing DEP to be disabled for some reason.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>On checking my installed programmes&nbsp;via Control Panel, I have noticed that as well as the one for "Windows IE8" which gives full support information, there is also an entry for "Internet Explorer 8 (enable DEP)" which gives no support information whatsoever.&nbsp;&nbsp;I
 am wondering if this is the root of the problem.&nbsp; I did install IE8 enhanced for Yahoo earlier this year&nbsp;but then uninstalled it as I had more confidence&nbsp;with Windows IE8 which&nbsp;I then reinstalled.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Should&nbsp;I uninstall both of the IE8 programmes listed and then reinstall Windows IE8 from the Microsoft website?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thanks</div>

            <p>Well I have looked at all the links to see what&nbsp;is suggested I should do BUT THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE PROBLEM I AM HAVING!!!&nbsp; I have even uninstalled the program called "Internet Explorer (enable DEP)" but it's still there and not made the slightest
 bit of difference.&nbsp; I run&nbsp; 'IE performance and safety' in MS Fixit Centre and it states it has fixed the problem and DEP is now enabled.&nbsp; So out of curiousity&nbsp;I decided to immediately run the fix again without restarting my computer and it was disabled again.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I don't have a problem with IE8 closing down I have a problem with DEP being disabled and nothing seems to fix it.&nbsp; I will just have to take the PC to the local IT bloke, which is probably what I should have done in the first place instead of getting stressed
 trying to fix it myself!</p>

<p>Most of the time when you see a DEP issue its usually related to Malware/Spyware on the machine. Have ran your Anti-Virus or Malware/Spyware program to make sure your system is clean?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also double check the steps below:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Click the
<b>Start </b>menu, right-click on <b>My Computer</b> and Choose <span>&nbsp;</span><b>Properties</b>
<span>&nbsp;</span>from the context menu. </span></li><li><span>On the

<p>The&nbsp;DEP properties was the first thing I checked and all was as it should be and still is.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have MS Security Essentials so assume this&nbsp;gives sufficient protection.&nbsp;It does a weekly full scan of the whole computer and does&nbsp;real time&nbsp;scanning.&nbsp;&nbsp;I also have
 Rapport which reports on keylogging and&nbsp; screen capture attempts and it states that it does not conflict with MSSE.&nbsp;&nbsp; If I install a new programme Smart Filter checks it before it is installed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The MS Fix It Solution Centre keeps stating that DEP is disabled but 'has now fixed it'.&nbsp; It makes no difference whether&nbsp;I&nbsp;restart the computer or go straight back to the Fix It Solution Centre without restarting&nbsp;and run the check again and it states DEP
 is disabled AGAIN!&nbsp; </p>
<p>I am completely baffled.</p>

<h2>            Onenote Sync problem - please help long time user</h2>
                    <p>Have used OneNote as daily note system since 2009 and have not encountered sync problem before.&nbsp; Please give me ideas to chase so I can get back on track.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use a Surface Pro 3 and a desktop PC running Windows 10, both running OneNote Desktop and save/snyc to OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use OneNote Workbook I call "Daily Notes" pretty extensively everyday, and today I noticed my PC was a day behind my Surface on my notes in that workbook.&nbsp; I went to Surface OneNote, checked File, View Sync Status and noticed there is an error message dated
 yesterday which says "We're sorry, something went wrong during sync. We'll try again later. (Error code: 0xE402005C)"&nbsp; I checked this error message on Forum and seems to be pretty generic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OneNote help says check Onedrive online version, which is same as PC (ie., one day behind Surface).&nbsp; Which means Surface is not syncing to internet for some reason.&nbsp; I did local save, as recommended, and also created a second copy of the workbook in another
 tab, as recommended.&nbsp; I have tried all the help pages ideas, but I cannot get the Surface to sync.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

            <p>Yes, only one notebook. &nbsp;The Notebook I call "work". &nbsp;I attach screenshot. &nbsp;you can see the other two sync fine, but this one does not. &nbsp;And it is my work one, very important.</p>

<p>Very frustrating!</p>
<p>The solution for me&nbsp;was to run the&nbsp;OneNote Desktop client, sign out (File &gt; Account &gt; Sign Out), and then sign back in.</p>
<p>Then the notebooks sync'd properly again.</p>
<p>Good luck with that !</p>

    <title>Data Labels on a protected sheet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> justinrl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Data Labels on a protected sheet</h2>
                    Hello All,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have what could be a very simple problem but I can not get my head around it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a Worksheet which has a data table and a Bar Chart on it, the Data Table holds some pretty comprehensive calculations therefore I have had to protect it. My issue is that with the Worksheet protected, the users are not able to move the data labels
 on the bar graph to their desired position.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>More details:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Graph type: Stacked Column's with one series of data hidden so to create a Waterfall chart ( please see image below)</div>
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a8d8d51b-d358-4351-8c48-5991ba9ccd50" /></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>As you can see depending on the colour of the column and whether it is an increasing or decreasing value the Data Labels need to be shown in a different position. Which is why I think it would be best to allow the user of the spreadsheet to move the labels
 themselves.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The Graph has been set to unlocked, and when I Protect the work sheet, I tick the box to allo users to edit objects.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help will be much appreciated. Thanks.</div>
                </div>

<p>Hi There,</p>

<p>Is it possible within exchange online in office 365 for users to change properties such as job title &amp; department for their own global address list entry only.</p>
<p>We have it so they can edit contact numbers &amp; address through <a href="https://outlook.office365.com/ecp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
outlook.office365.com/ecp</a> but there is no option here for job title etc.</p>

<p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>In Exchange Online, end users can only edit the information such as phone number and it is not feasible for them to edit the organization level properties, such as, Title, Department or Company as Vasil mentioned..</p>
<p>I you want to allow a special user to modify the Title or Department property, you can add this user to Recipient Management role. Note: users in Recipient Management role can read/modify all mailbox users in your domain, not just of himself/herself. For

<p>In general what you are asking about is known as "optimizing" your spreadsheet. There are&nbsp; very many things you can check to make your spreadsheet work better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before buying a new computer I would spend some time applying optimizing techniques to your spreadsheet.&nbsp; Very often using the right single technique can clear a "bottleneck" in the processing and speed up your worksheet by orders of magnitude.&nbsp; From hours
 to minutes or even seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader1"><strong>*******************</strong></p>
<p>The first (non) optimization technique I suggest is not generally considered one. That is switching from simple spreadsheets to "Excel Tables". Tables switch from row/column references (A1) to "structured References" (readable column names). This makes understanding
 the formulas easier to understand.&nbsp; And tables automatically handle copying formulas to new rows and provide some simple formula automation for things like total rows and "slicers" / filters.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The next (non) optimization is to load your tables / data into "PowerQuery" / "Data Manager". PowerQuery compresses the data, making the overall size of your spreadsheet file smaller, making it faster to process calculations. PowerQuery can automate importing
 new data from outside resources and "data cleaning" of that data before using it for calculations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The final (non) optimization is using PivotTables.&nbsp; PivotTables give you automated formula generation. You click and drag, and pick options from ribbons, dialogs and context menus to generate the required formulas in the background. You don't have to worry
 about learning formula syntax, let Excel worry about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The wiki in the next link is a collection of links to free online webinars that demonstrate these 3 "new" tools and links to learning resources.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span>Download the replay recordings for future reference, and download the example workbooks.&nbsp; If you are gung ho, you could add time references to the workbook back to the recorded session
 to make future cross reference easier to find specific features / instructions (I’ve been doing that).<br />
<br />
These free sessions run roughly 1 hour each followed by a short shill for their related courses (which definitely sound worth the price).</span></p>

</span><span>Like any Office tool, Excel has a lot of "hidden" features.&nbsp; I've been learning some of them. One of the really good parts of these features is the automation that is built in to them. Some of these features have been around since 2007,
 but they have been rarely talked about.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am going to provide links to free webinars, videos and articles talk about these features:</span><span><br />

</p><p><strong><span>Optimize Chart</span></strong><span><br />
Do you really need every data point ?<br />
Where is the chart being presented Screen or Report<br />
<br />
On a screen you are unlikely to use more than 800 pixels for the chart area<br />
So using any more than about 250 points is not adding values<br />
On an A4 chart in landscape lets say the chart area is 6" long and at 300dpi that is 2000 pixels<br />
Once again using more than 800-1000 points will not add any value<br />
I have seen charts with 30,000+ points and when this is explained and a work around shown people appreciate the speed up<br />
For a work around try setting up an area where you select say every x'th point using an Offset or Index Function<br />
Then plot that data<br />

</span>It really all comes down to decreasing the search range. In the video, I show you the old way of doing lookups - selecting an entire range. By creating a lookup table, or as a I call it, a "phone book table of contents," you can tell Excel where in the

No doubt excel is a powerful analytical tool but most of the people do not plan before designing there spreadsheet. One should plan the Start and End in mind, and the assumption that the spreadsheet will never be used again should kept out of mind. Perhaps
 this is might be the number one rule. Spreadsheets are about giving correct information to the user, not possible erroneous information that looks good.

I’m currently on a project to improve the performance of a particular workbook.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Part of this task involves speeding up a few of the macros in the workbook.<span>&nbsp;
</span>While I’m thinking about this stuff, I’d like to share a few simple tips for speeding up your Excel VBA code.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Some of you will know all of these and more. So feel free to comment and share any other performance tips you may have.

Referencing cells on another worksheet is nearly always slower than referencing cells on the same worksheet. This overhead is larger when referencing formulae than when referencing data

</p><p class="contentHeader1"><strong>****** New Computer Suggestions ************</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>There are 3 general considerations when buying a "more powerful" computer. The class computer chip: i3 / i5 / i7 / i9.&nbsp; The higher the number very much in general the more powerful.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Along with the "i" number are generation number like 5***, 6***, 7***, 8***. Again, in general the higher the number, the "newer" and more powerful the computer chip.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second major consideration is RAM, the Random Access Memory available to the computer. RAM is "fast" memory that the programs and data are loaded into to make them available to the "chip" for processing.&nbsp; RAM is MUCH MUCH faster than the "hard drive"
 where the program code and data is permanantly stored. These days most low end computers start at 4GB, and go up from there.&nbsp; 8GB is a common amount on mid range computers. 12-16GB is currently the adequate upper limit for most users. Any more than that without
 careful research is just a waste of money for the average user. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The 3rd major consideration is where you will "permanently" store your programs and data, the HD (Hard Drive). HDs store data on spinning magnetic disk There are 2 general attributes to consider, size and speed.&nbsp; The absolute minimum size you should buy
 in a new computer is 64GB.&nbsp; 256GB is large enough to hold your programs and lots of user data. Disk prices have gone down so much that it common to see 1TB (1000GB) disk drives. Any bigger than that is an extravagance. &nbsp; Disk speed is also important.&nbsp; There
 are 3 disk speeds, 5400 / 7200 / 15000.&nbsp; 5400 is too slow and 15000 is simply too expensive (not enough performance improvement) for a personal computer.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A new type of "hard drive" has been coming into the market. It is called a SSD. Recently the prices have come down to the point that it is possible to get a large enough SSD at a reasonable price that you don't need HD at all. As a compromise builders have
 been selling "dual drive" computers with a small SSD and a relatively large HD.&nbsp; The minimum SSD size you should consider is 128GB (256GB is better) paired with 1TB HD.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally, if I was custom ordering a computer I would pay extra to get a larger SSD and eliminate the HD altogther.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>SSD are so much faster than HDs, that simply swapping out the HD in an old computer for a (smaller) SSD makes it perform like a new, faster computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Trying to buy the "newest" components costs a LOT more. You can get very good performance at a "reasonable" price by buying 1 or 2 levels from the newest versions of each category.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I was spec'ing a new "high end" computer for myself today I would look at:</p>
<ul>
<li>an i5 or i7 chip, i9's are too expensive. </li><li>12-16GB of RAM, more is a waste</li><li>256-512GB SSD, possibly a 1TB HD if they "threw it in"</li></ul>
<p>Depending on the compromises, in general this sort of machine would cost between $800 and $2000. Spending more than that is wastefully extravagant.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Google for more specific suggestions and reviews of computers and hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Like I said, there are many tricks and techniques you can use to "optimize" your spreadsheet. Here are links to articles that give various suggestions.

<p>You can cut the specs back a bit and even save a couple of hundred bucks.&nbsp; I'm not clear if it is going to ship with 16 or 32GB of RAM. If they did bump the system RAM to 32GB for only $50 I think it would be a worth while "extravagance".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I opted for Win Pro since a 16-32GB machine could take good advantage of the Hyper-V "virtual computer" feature.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also splurge the extra $90 for a docking station to allow me to add an external 4K (40-50") monitor on my desk.&nbsp; Killer system.

<p>Application.Calculation/ScreenUpdating/EnableEvents will make Excel work less between your VBA statements, but won't make your VBA code any more efficient.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you need to lookout for is where in the VBA code are you accessing the worksheet, why, and whether it's actually needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the macro started out as macro-recorder generated code, it's likely riddled with Range.Select, Worksheet.Activate, Selection.DoSomething late-bound calls - for example if you enter "42" in cell A1, this code might get generated:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Workbooks("Book1").Activate</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Sheets("Sheet1").Activate</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Range("A1").Select</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Selection.Value = 42</p>
<p>
</p><p>In reality, if "Sheet1" exists in ThisWorkbook at compile-time, it can be statically accessed by its code name, rather than dereferenced from the Sheets collection. This code would be exactly equivalent, vastly more efficient, and more importantly it behaves
 identically regardless of whether it's written in a standard procedural module or in the code-behind of Sheet3:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Sheet1.Range("A1").Value = 42</p>
<p>
</p><p>In general, accessing a worksheet should be considered an expensive operation, and thus done as minimally as possible. Instead of iterating cells in a loop, copy the range values into a variant array, and iterate that in-memory array instead - if you heed
 Rohn007's advice and use tables instead of plain old ranges, you don't even need to work out where the "last row" is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Dim contents As Variant</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; contents = Sheet1.ListObjects("Table1").DataBodyRange.Value</p>
<p>
</p><p>Depending on what your code is doing, working with a 2D variant array like this can make the difference between VBA code that completes in days, vs VBA code that completes in mere seconds; you can write the modified/computed data into the array, and when
 you're ready you can dump the array in a single operation onto the worksheet, overwriting the entire range in a split-second.<br />
</p>
<p>Don't just throw hardware at the problem, make sure your code is efficient first.</p>

<h2>            Windows Update stuck on Preparing to Install Updates</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am on Windows Preview 14316 on the Fast Ring. The new update came out a few days ago. However, I am unable to install it. I made sure I had enough space on my system drive, and the update downloaded fine. However, when it comes to preparing to install
 updates, it goes fine, until it reaches 100 %. After which it gets stuck at 100 %. I let it run for hours to no avail (sometimes, the "settings" window closes on its own for no apparent reason although I'm not sure if it is relevant). I already tried to reset
 the Windows Updates components. When I do that, the updates download again, but the problem reoccurs at "preparing to install updates".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure what else to do and I require help.<br />
Thank you in advance.</p>

    <title>Alerts if someone else adds to a onenote on the web app - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Alerts if someone else adds to a onenote on the web app</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>we have just started using the OneNote web app within our school and I am really trying to champion this. &nbsp;It would be great if I could be sent an e-mail notification when someone made a change to one of the shared notebooks or even opened one. &nbsp;This would
 allow me to monitor use and respond quickly if needed. &nbsp;Right now I have to go through and check every page!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen some things on here about 'returning to classic view' but I cannot find that on the web app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help, it would be great to get this set up so I can show the O365 system as efficient and helpful to the rest of my team.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Martin</p>

            <p>Hi Martin,<br />
<br />
The OneNote files we create with OneNote Online in Office 365 are stored in our OneDrive for Business library. Therefore, we can set up an alert for a OneNote file in OneDrive for Business library via the following steps:
<br />
<br />
1. Go to the OneDrive for Business library with your current Work/school account.
<br />
2. If we are in OneDrive for Business new UI, we need to return classic OneDrive for Business via clicking
<strong>Turn to classic OneDrive</strong> at the lower left corner. <br />

3. Select a OneNote file in the library which is shared with other users and click FILES &gt; Alert Me &gt; set alert on this document.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/36d64f9a-0b0c-4574-ad3f-942783928cae" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/36d64f9a-0b0c-4574-ad3f-942783928cae" /></a></p>
<p><br />
4. Configure the new alert as below. <br />

    <title>Outlook Mail Merge Failure and Disappearing Contacts and Categories - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eetdouglas  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook Mail Merge Failure and Disappearing Contacts and Categories</h2>
                    
<p>Hi.&nbsp; I've been using Microsoft products since 1974 and have never encountered these problems before&nbsp;at any other place and they are effecting our whole company.&nbsp; For the 3 yrs I have used this system, we have been having problems with entering contact information
 and/or assigning a contact to a category&nbsp;- returning later to find the info altered or has disappeared.&nbsp; So, we tried to minimize the possibility of errors by assigning only 1 person administrative rights to enter info and the problems still occur.&nbsp; Also,
 if we try to run a mail merger for labels, the end result is not usable without a lot of editing - i.e.-the final product lays out at 1 1/2 spaces (even though Word is set to single sp)&nbsp;- it has to be done manually.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then&nbsp;several of the contacts have missing
 info, like a person's first name.&nbsp; Other addresses have an extra line of space even after the entire document is converted to single sp - each address has to, again, be manually adjusted.&nbsp; We also find that we can not save the output of the merge - if we do
 and reopen it, its giberish.&nbsp; I thought that maybe we could convert the output to text but sometimes the function is dead and not reliable.</p>
<p>Then there was yesterday....&nbsp; I thought we might be able to run a merge and save the output if performed on the administrator's machine.&nbsp; As soon as I clicked on "Mail Merge", a window came up that said, "Updating your preferences."&nbsp; The administrator said
 she didn't know why it was happening but had recently started to&nbsp;pop up, periodically.&nbsp; When the message disappeared, we continued the merge.&nbsp; It was performed with the errors as stated above, which we expected.&nbsp; What we did not expect was that when we returned
 to look at the Contacts list, 2 categories has completely disappeared - between the two categories were 120 contacts.&nbsp; The category I was using was in the middle of the list, nowhere near the other two.&nbsp; Then, little by little the contacts started dropping
 out of cateorgies - one category of 50+ now contains on 10 contacts.&nbsp; The last thing is that when you look at the category list, even the names of the 2 categories disappeared.&nbsp; My Office Manager was there to observe every keystroke I made and can verify that
 it was not operator error.</p>
<p>We are desperate, not to mention frustrated because over past 3 years, the information has been re-entered time and time again - its time consuming and keeps us from other duties.&nbsp; We really hope you can help.</p>
<p>To be fair, I should also tell you that our IT person does not have all of us on the same version of software.&nbsp; I have Windows 2010 w/Microsoft 7....some have Vista w/Microsoft 2007 and up until 2 months ago one of us was still on XP/Word 97 - 2003.</p>
<p>Thank you for trying!</p>

<p>What type of email account is configured? Are you using Exchange server or BCM?</p>
<p>When you configure the mail merge layout, do you preview it and adjust the spacing before updating all cells with the merge fields?</p>
<p>What format are you saving the merge output as?</p>

<p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>I'm not sure of the email account configuration - where do I find it?&nbsp; We are using an Exchange server.</p>
<p>I do preview it but I have not tried adjusting the spacing once the merge process is started - I will try that.&nbsp; But, what would make an entry for a David Brown display as (sp) Brown and the rest of the address is perfectly displayed.</p>
<p>Usually, I am not at the administrator's machine as I was yesterday.&nbsp; From my machine if I trying saving it in word and reopen the doc it is giberish.&nbsp; Once it let me do a "Convert to text" but most the the time that process is grayed out and does not function.</p>

<p>How the name is displayed depends on the fields included - look at the records the merge is using.</p>
<p>Are you inserting individual fields or using combo fields like full name and mailing address?</p>

<p>We use Full Name.&nbsp;&nbsp; Only this one contact drops the 1st name.&nbsp; BTW - I did try what you said in terms of adjustin the spacing before updating the records....a 5 line address still displays as six lines (with a blank line between the last two address lines).&nbsp;
 That happens to, at least, 20 of the contacts and they are radomnly scattered thoughout the list.&nbsp; Now the expand/collapse all categories command is not working.</p>
<p>I've got other problems too now, Excel functions have also shut down also.&nbsp; If I still have a working computer on Monday, I will continue the discussion with you then.</p>
<p>Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

Does any body have a solution for this ??????????????<br />
SOLUTION :<br />
I think its because whatsapp is downloading on phone memory....stop opening it from there...just go to nokia store where you can download or update it....but firstly,change the settings of nokia store...phone memory is being selected there for saving files...change
 it to memory card...then download whatsapp(a newer version..may be 2.1.11) from there...it will work perfectly...<br />
HOPE IT WILL WORK FOR YOU....if not please inform....

</blockquote>
<p>Right click on the taskbar, to bring up the taskbar and start menu properties, click on customise notification area, this will bring up the system settings, click on tablet mode, switch it to on, other settings read as: Keep the mode i was in previously
 and always prompt me, off for hide icons on taskbar when in tablet mode,your taskbar should already be hidden, well this worked for me, i hope it works for you 😊
</p>
<p>oops forgot to say make sure you tick box in taskbar properties for hide taskbar

                    I&nbsp;would like&nbsp;to block all pop-ups from Windows 10 because they come frequently and interrupt what I am doing and won't allow me to continue. How do I go about doing that? One advice I received offered I should go into Internet Explorer, click on I.E.,
 click on tools, click on pop-up blocker, click on pop-up blocker settings, click on blocking level, select high: block all pop-ups then close. However when I tried to open I.E., all I opened was a blank page with no details on it. What did I do wrong? George

    <title>Insider for Business Azure Account. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fxtell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Insider for Business Azure Account.</h2>
                    <p>Need some help here!</p>
<p>At the moment I run a total reset of my pc, and has once again tried to get an insider build for W10 Home on a private account.</p>
<p>Latest I discovered that my attackers made a Insider Business Account in Azure.</p>
<p>( all the sudden I had a Azure Account in US ).</p>
<p>I asked in a forum, not even sure, if it was the right forum anyways, but all I got was a reply to access the Azure Account, and ask there.</p>
<p>That part I refuse to do.</p>
<p>I did not create a Insider for Business, in the first place, someone else did, using my MSA or perhaps my MSA simply got enrolled through Azure?</p>
<p>So who can help me get rid of a rogue admin who has my account enrolled in god-knows-what.</p>
<p>Bedst Regards&nbsp;</p>

<p>First thanks for your reply!</p>
<p>Yeah would be fine, if things on a magic way could create a link to support who was not controlled by a rogue admin.</p>
<p>In case my request are a bit unclear, I need a way to bypass a rogue admin.</p>
<p>A couple of hours ago I had a insider build - who was controlled by someone else than Microsoft - all of it! - Part of it!?</p>
<p>So far I know for sure they control from where I download my software.</p>
<p>They redirect me - my MSA Store Account to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>My Google Account - Google Play - seem to be in Russia.</p>
<p>I have a couple of really good screen dumps of my desktop running a Insider Build, at a time where I had no clue of what Windows Insider was. Never signed up for Insider Builds, at the time I made the screen dump, nor did I recieved a mail saying "Welcome
 to Insider".&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far I only had the pleasure of asking question and being ignored or linked to ppl who can't do anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I need someone to act, and actually have a general look at my account, and what it has been en rolled in.</p>
<p>MS Help Disk in US can't do more than MS Help Desk in Denmark.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My attackers free wheeled across free services and demo downloads from MS for more than 8 years now, and somehow managed to enroll my device and/or my Accounts.</p>
<p>The amount of fake responses from help desk are huge. Azure and before that Enterprise suites, act as a perfect man in the middel.</p>
<p>Ofc there must be some responsibly Insiders around who would know how to detach a rogue admin who uses Azure on my machine, and all our other devices for that sake.
</p>
<p>It really feels up-the-hill having to explain the rogue admin consept, in a fora, where all of you should understand, a link to Help desk would never actually get me in contact with help desk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first couple of years the best suggestion was always : "change your password", here in the forum and under the current conditions,&nbsp;</p>
<p>all of you would know that would not help at all, nor did it 8 years ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My last contact to Help Desk in Denmark, about 3 years ago only ended up in a fake Help Desk respond.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I'm looking for someone who can help, and will act on my request.</p>
<p>In short I simply don't need more links.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I need how to get rid of a rogue admin who uses Azure and prb. other MS services on my machine.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>

            Eight years! by this time I would have deleted my accounts and start fresh, as this forum isn't monitor directly by Microsoft and is mainly just users, It's looks as your account has been hijacked, what I would do is delete everything and do a clean install&nbsp;
 using&nbsp; new accounts, I know this isn't what you want to hear but that's probably the best way, been interesting reading your other postings.&nbsp;

<p>Hi Joe!</p>
<p>Yup 8 years are a long time!</p>
<p>You assume I haven't changed account or deleted my hardrive.</p>
<p>I have,&nbsp; more than one time, in fact at this point I stopped counting.</p>
<p>So after all my attempts to wipe - re install OS, change account I hired a PRO.
</p>
<p>A&nbsp; years ago. I hired a local store, PRO Help, to delete my harddrive and reinstall my OS (W10).</p>
<p>My Desktop came back with the same issues :-).&nbsp;</p>
<p>a. set to development mode side loaded Apps.</p>
<p>b. remote control enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a series of fresh from the plant low budget&nbsp; laptops, running a MSA (new account) or not running a MSA account but a Gmail instead. Same result. It's simply a matter of time.</p>
<p>If I don't use MSA - or Google it makes no meaning owning a pc or laptop or phone, I need a mail.</p>
<p>Only running a mail client on a Desktop or Laptop simply makes things harder to detect, only by signing into an account, I can tell my account now opens in Seattle or Amsterdam - right, I was in Denmark all the time - so it was not me.</p>
<p>New MSA, nope can't be done, my account can't be changed to a new mail outlook.com - outlook.dk , it's locked until - mid 2018.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simply to figure out what sticks and what don't stick to this hack, I change my motherboard, wiped my hardrive, new account = same result.</p>
<p>Not going to list ALL my attempts, but believe me I did all I could, made every possible test I could figure out how to perform, in order to find out how the heck, it keeps happening.</p>
<p>How!? beats me!&nbsp; But the side effects of it I can list, from Microsoft Enterprise Mobility Suit - to Visual Studio down to Azure and a backup of my OS-Harddrive in a cloud somewhere. Long gone Graphic Card who tries to install again, to old monitor setups
 - where all are ok in my clean and off line installation, right until the point I hit the Internet and everything goes haywire.</p>
<p>I threw good money after several external Firewall and Anti Malware solutions over the years.</p>
<p>"They" simply disables my firewall. Enables remote desktops, creates VM. All I can do are look at the fireworks who goes off like it was new years eve, and soon it will be again :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do realize only Microsoft can do something here, but while we're at it, I like to ask something who relates to my issue.</p>
<p>Wiping my harddrive don't set " Services" back to default. Here I made a series of tests, disable a service - wipe my hardrive - look at services again = service still disabled? ( all done off line ).</p>
<p>Are there a way to force "Services" back to&nbsp; default?</p>
<p>Regards</p>

                    I am upgrading to a new computer.&nbsp; When I installed Microsoft Office XP Small Business there is an opportunity to activate the product.&nbsp; It fails to work using the on-line option and when using the phone option there are no phone numbers displayed.&nbsp; I
 have searched for phone numbers to activate the product, but haven't been successful. Thus, I am looking for the appropriate phone number to activate the product in the US.<br />

            <p>This appears to be an issue with Office XP.&nbsp; While Office XP reached end-of-life in July of 2011, Microsoft has said that they do not plan to shut down the Office XP activation servers so it should work.&nbsp; The problem with your situation, however, is that
 Office XP is not compatible with Windows Vista or Windows 7 and maybe that's the reason.&nbsp; This is, of course, speculation because this seems to be a recent turn of events (only in the last two or three months) and there are&nbsp;others here who have said they&nbsp;installed
 Office XP on WIndows 7 and it (mostly) works.&nbsp; I think if anyone knows for sure why this is happening, it's only Microsoft.</p>
<p>Microsoft used to publish the numbers of the various activation centers, but they've removed that information from their former locations on the Microsoft web site.&nbsp; There are other posts in these forums, though, that may contain the information.&nbsp; This search
 will find those posts for you: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/Search/Search?SearchTerm=contact+activation+center+phone&amp;CurrentScope.ForumName=Office&amp;CurrentScope.Filter=&amp;askingquestion=false">
