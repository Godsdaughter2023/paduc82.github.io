    <title>Edge &#38; Internet Explorer Low Power Mode - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bradleyburns  say:</h3>
<h2>            Edge &#38; Internet Explorer Low Power Mode</h2>
                    <p>Is the a simple one click feature to switch Edge or Internet Explorer into a low power mode for reading the text on a webpage?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Essentially I want the browser to stop processing all the content on the webpage until I click the button again.&nbsp; It would be equivalent copying the text and pasting it into notepad for reading and closing the browser.&nbsp; Once I finished reading, click the
 button and load the next page (or open the browser again to load the next page to copy into notepad).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I've noticed huge CPU drains going to Edge, Internet Explorer, Chrome, and Firefox when the only content that I have on screen is text from a website.&nbsp; I assume that the browser is busy rendering off screen advertisements and other multimedia content.&nbsp; I
 don't mind that when I am viewing that content, but when it's off screen there is no point in draining the battery on my tablet&nbsp;with a wasted 30+% of CPU performance.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Excel 2010 If statement problem</h2>
                    I have a master sheet with several sub sheets.&nbsp; I want the sub sheets to look on the master sheet in a specific column (column B) and if the value in a cell equals the name of the sheet, then return the entire row onto the sub sheet.&nbsp; I also want it to
 be locked so that changes can only be made to the master sheet and if changes are made, each sub sheet will update the info on them.

            I completely agree!&nbsp; This program was installed on my work computer and it is incredibly glitch prone.&nbsp; It stops working all the time, pivtot tables with outside data sources are a nightmare!&nbsp; When I called Microsoft about it, they sent me around to different
 departments for about an hour and no one was able to help me.&nbsp; It shuts down on me daily, even with smaller files.&nbsp; It runs like a beta version of software, not production.

            I'll bite.<br />
<br />
Word has been a complete nightmare.&nbsp; It seemed to work on day 1.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Then I noticed the preview did not work in Outlook 2013.&nbsp; I then tried to open documents in protected mode.&nbsp; Word just never finished loading.&nbsp; Word would sit there and spin its starting display.<br />
<br />
I then tried to repair the installation.&nbsp; This put all of office into a broken state and none of the programs would run.&nbsp; I couldn't install.&nbsp; I couldn't uninstall.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Eventually I went on line and found a utility program from MS to force the uninstall.&nbsp; It analyzed the system and found that the installer had broke itself.&nbsp; It did some magic removing all of office.&nbsp; After than I reinstalled office and the only good thing
 that ever occurred since I started using this defective program is that it remembered my mail settings and did not force me to create new data files.<br />
<br />
After reinstalling, I found that outlook would not preview a file or open it in protected mode.&nbsp; I figured it is not worth the pain to attempt to fix this.&nbsp; After all, I could alway save the document in my c:\temp folder and then run word manually and then
 try to open it.<br />
<br />
But, today I just tried to launch word, it is sitting on the "start" screen and shows the "Blank document" and a message "Getting Featured Templates".&nbsp; I can't do anything with it.&nbsp; So any word capabilities are now beyond my reach.<br />
<br />
I had been using Office 2003.&nbsp; I thought that now that I was upgrading to Windows 8 after Vista puked for no known reason (definitely not hardware) and was just reinstalled less than 6 months prior, I would avoid troubles by upgrading to the latest.&nbsp; Certainly
 they would have tested it.&nbsp; Big Mistake. <br />
<br />
I have never had a company's incompetence waste more of my time than Microsoft.<br />
<br />
If I was not dependent on MS for career related functions, this complete lack of respect for my time and productivity would probably have sent me running to Mac.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I am off to reboot to find out if Word starts working again.&nbsp; <br />

The issues you have listed sound more like computer or user profile related than actually Microsoft Office. I only say this because I have been using Microsoft Office 2013 on several different machines for many months now without any of the problems you are
 experiencing. I have also installed it on many systems outside of my use and they have not complained other than the flat look.
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>Office 2013 32-bit or 64-bit?</div>
<div>Clean install or upgrade?</div>
<div>&nbsp; (I was, admittedly, confused by your description of insulation and clean up. &nbsp;Thus my follow up question about whether the installation of Microsoft Office was a clean installation or if this machine had a prior Microsoft Office installed on it?)</div>
<div>Is the OS and Microsoft Office fully patched on the machine?</div>

            <p>You say that you had 126GB free space, but where was it?&nbsp; If you have more than one drive letter you have partitioned the disk.&nbsp; I f the free space is on another partition&nbsp; you need to resize your partitions.&nbsp; I use EasUS Partition Master to do my partitioning.&nbsp;
 It has a free version that works well.</p>

            I have Windows XP and have Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007. When I first installed it before the computer crashed, the Microsoft button in the top let of Microsoft word would blink orange to let me know it was connected to the internet. Since I
 have re installed it on my desktop, it doesn't do that any more. It will blink on my sons laptop computer though. He has an HP Windows 8.

    <title>DriverUpdate from Slimware Utilities - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robertstreander  say:</h3>
<h2>            DriverUpdate from Slimware Utilities</h2>
                    While online a window popped up with an official microsoft look to it, in the form of an urgent notification that my drivers were outdated for my operating system.&nbsp; I had just recently upgraded to windows 8.1, and wondered how the driver update during
 the upgrade could be outdated so soon.&nbsp; Nonetheless, a scan of my drivers was recommended so I went&nbsp; along, (this was microsoft right?) and all of a sudden a "utility Scanner" was being downloaded, which then boldly stated that "14 out of 32 drivers for windows
 8.0" were outdated and needed updating.&nbsp; The reference to 8.0 should have done it for me, but in this day of relentless updates from your manufacturer, op systems, devices etc, I thought it must be something normal, so I reluctantly clicked to proceed, and
 another download proceeded, a window stated in small print that these updates were available at NO CHARGE from the manufacturer's, next an offer for a subscription and when I saw a price charge, I immediately hit the cancel download button.&nbsp; Multiple windows
 then barraged me with ominous statements to the effect of urging me to proceed.&nbsp; I went to control panel, remove programs, and a normal "un-install" seemed to proceed, except when I hit the un-install button, I was asked the question "Do you really want to
 un-install "DriverUpdate". Clicking "yes" then brings up a window asking, "Do you want this program to make changes to your computer software?"&nbsp; It is obvious I do not want this, since I am asking it be "Un-installed.&nbsp; Why won't windows perform this command
 for this program?&nbsp; Why does it question my command to un-install this program?&nbsp; When re-assuring windows I indeed want it removed, why does it then ask me if I want to allow this program&nbsp; "to make changes to my software"?? And when I say no, why does it assume
 that means that I don't want it uninstalled, and leaves it there. &nbsp; Can someone tell me how to get this off of my computer?<br />

<h2>            Cannot edit &#47; or insert embedded Excel Spreadsheets in Word 2013 and Windows 10 PT 10061</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Word offers the ability to embed Excel Spreadsheets within the document. I recently tried to edit an embedded Excel Spreadseet wihin Office 2013 and Win 10 TP 10061. When I click into the Spreadsheet the Excel-Grid shows and I can modify the contents. However
 - as soon as I exit the excel-mode the old values are displayed. After I open the excel mode again, the updated values are displayed. Those updated values however are not preserved wehen saving and reopening the document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon creating a new document and trying to insert an embedded excel-spreadsheet, instead of embedding the object it just opens the excel application.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>The problem I'm experiencing shows a different behaviour depending whether I try to INSERT an Excel Spreadsheet object within a just created document or if try to CHANGE/EDIT an Excel Spreadsheet object which was created with Office2013 running on Windows
 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on "Table" (found on the "INSERT" Ribbon) within Word and then choose "Excel Spreadsheet" the correct behaviour would be that an excel Spreadsheet-Object is placed within the Word Document. If click this button on office 2013 running Win 10
 TP, instead of creating the object it launches the Excel Application.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I try to edit an Excel spreadsheet Object within Word 2013 on Win 10 TP the changes are not visible within word once I exit the spreadseet-embedded excel view.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Repairing the Office Install (both repair options - quick an online) did not solve the problem.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me first answer No 2)</p>
<p>When I edit Data and click outside the old data is shown again. When I click back into the object the new data is shown again. If I hit save and reopen the document only the old data is preserved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For No 1)</p>
<p>Sorry if my description was not clear enough - To break it down: I'm experiencing a problem with those embedded Excel Spreadsheets (as we already know by now :).</p>
<p>I first noticed the problem when I tried to edit the data of an embedded Excel sheet. The document already existed on my disk and the data was already present within the excel object.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To track down the problem (and exclude the possibility that sth. within the old document broke) I created a new, blank, word document and tried to insert an embedded excel sheet. I noticed that instead of creating the excel object it just opende the excel
 application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I conclude that those two issues are very likely connected to each other and the excel spreadsheet object functionality might be broken. Maybe other "objects" are also broken I haven't tried that yet.</p>

            Fixed in Build 10130 for me. However there is some weird GFX going on when the Excel SpreadSheet object is edited. The Window border changes to an old layout. As soon as you leave the excel object gfx return to normal

<h2>            Logging in - email address not recognized</h2>
                    <p>I have been using a skype account for the past month and a half, without problems. Last week I opened skype and not only had I been automatically logged out of my account, but when I tried to log in with my email address it said that the account didn't exist.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After trying to log in several times, without my account being recognised, I even tried creating a new account with the same email address. However, even though I've resent the activation code several times, it never arrives in my inbox.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, how can I gain access to my account again? I am certain I have the correct email address and password, so that is not the issue here. (it's a different skype account to the one I'm using here to post my query)</p>

06/20/2012 17:32 lsz<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How to suspend Word 2007 spell check for part of a document?</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>

<p>PROBLEM</p>
<p>Part of a document contains program and data strings that are not words.<span>&nbsp;
</span>But as long as spell check is active it will tag these strings with red underline to be checked.<span>&nbsp;
</span>How can this functionality be disabled for a section of the document (a table, for instance) yet leave the spell check enabled for the rest of the document?<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>There appear to be only two options in Word 2007 – global disable, or disable for the instant document only.<span>&nbsp;
</span>There does not appear to be a way to disable it selectively within the document.</p>

            You can define a character style whose only property is "Do not check spelling or grammar", and apply that style to any text you don't want checked.<br />
<br />
Follow these steps:<br />
<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Select some character that has no special formatting.</li><li>On the Review tab of the ribbon, click the Set Language button in the Proofing group (its icon is a globe and a page with a red check mark).</li><li>In the dialog, check the box for "Do not check spelling or grammar" and click OK.</li><li>On the Home tab of the ribbon, click the bottom one of the three arrow buttons at the right end of the Quick Styles gallery (the one with a line over a triangle) and choose Save Selection as a New Quick Style.</li><li>In the box that pops up, click the Modify button.</li><li>In the dialog, change the name to No Spelling or something similar, change the style type to Character, and select the "New documents based on this template" option at the bottom. Verify that the definition (below the preview) includes "Do not check spelling
 or grammar" and "Based on: Default Paragraph Font". Click OK.</li><li>When you exit Word, if you're prompted to save changes to the Normal.dotm template, answer Yes.<br />
</li></ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Now, whenever you have text that you want the spell checker to ignore, select it and apply the No Spelling style to it. Its appearance won't change, but it will be ignored.<br />

            <p>While both of these instructions have been helpful, what I had to do in order to get the basic functionality working was to open the Styles list and manage things from there.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The functionality is very flakey to set up, and often when I thought I had it, the spell check would reappear and highlight my text ('No spellcheck' appearance&nbsp;would fail after working).&nbsp; On the other hand, in the beginning it would indicate a 'No spellcheck'
 style but nothing would happen.&nbsp; </p>
<p>After more than three hours working on this issue, and the problem cascade flowing from the problems using the Word 2007 ribbon, I can say without fear of contradiction that Word 2007 is a giant step backward for the productivity of experienced users like
 me. </p>
<p>The directive to apply to "New documents based on this template" is especially misleading because 1) it fails to note the name of the 'template' it is referring to, 2) where that template is located, and 3) it fails to mention how to apply this new style
 to older documents. </p>
<p>My understanding is that Word (at least the old version 2003) is different than Excel (as I recall) in that documents are created with the normal.dot template in existence at the time and that template is attached to that document as a static template.&nbsp;
 When changes are made to the 'global' normal.dot, these changes are not reflected in existing documents.&nbsp; This has been my understanding, and seems to be true here.&nbsp; The new style 'No spellcheck' is not available to documents already created from an earlier
 normal.dot.</p>
<p>While I can Google/Bing this problem myself, and will, for the purposes of making this a complete thread, I would be grateful if one or both of you would indicate how this functionality/new style can be made available to all documents as a global style,
 not just for new documents. </p>

            Your question about how to make the style available to existing documents has been answered in
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2007-word/how-make-custom-styles-available-to-existing/51f2b242-df1a-409f-9d71-a943aa667e3e">
your other thread</a>. To make a long story short, every existing document's style list is disconnected from the styles of the template used to create it, or of any other template you attach to it, unless you take some specific action for that specific document.

This is not something new in Word 2007 and has nothing to do with the ribbon. (That's a whole different kettle of smelly fish.)<br />

<p>No, it hasn't.&nbsp;&nbsp; As I pointed out there (and here) this is not a global solution.&nbsp;And your answer repeats what I have stated above.
</p>
<p>My comment about the ribbon relates to the difficulties introduced by the lack of a menu bar.&nbsp; The care with which you had to craft your instruction, and the concentration required by the user to follow what are almost entirely steps in the navigation to
 settings, is what makes the ribbon virtually useless in comparison with describing navigation using an hierarchical menu (with clearly-noted keyboard shortcuts).&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there is a ready-made global solution, I'd be very appreciative of hearing about it (other than writing my own macro or add-in).</p>

            Any user coming to a new application is going to have problems with the transition. I am sure that most experienced users felt that the ribbon impaired their productivity when it was introduced and cursed Microsoft for its adoption. But if you are going
 to continue with Word then this is the way of the future. It takes a while to find your way around, but it then becomes second nature and you will wonder why you made such a fuss about it. Certainly I have no desire to go back to using Word 2003 (though I
 have it installed for support purposes).<br />
<br />
Word 2010 provides rudimentary ribbon editing, but you can format the 2007 ribbon with a bit of effort to have it work the way you want it to -
<a href="http://gregmaxey.mvps.org/word_tip_pages/customize_ribbon_main.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://gregmaxey.mvps.org/word_tip_pages/customize_ribbon_main.html
</a><br />
<br />
However if all you want to do is to flag some sections of text in a document as no proofing, Right click the status bar at the bottom of the Word window and ensure 'Language' is checked. That will put the language button on the status bar. Any text that you
 want to flag as no-proofing can easily be selected before clicking that language button and the no-proofing option selected from there.<br />
<br />
As for the way styles and templates behave, that is the same in Word 2007 is it always has been.<br />
You may however find it advantageous to locate the QAT (Quick Access Toolbar) below the ribbon and add to it the 'Styles ... ' and 'Style' commands to the QAT from the popular (or all commands) group of commands which will give you the styles drop down you
 are familiar with from earlier versions.<br />

<p>Yes, agree with most of what you've said. However, in contrast to you I only use Word 2007 for support purposes -- I use Word 2003 to get work done.&nbsp; It may well be that over time 2007/2010 results in increased productivity.&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the meantime actual work
 has to get done.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are other threads which trash the design decisions that went into Word 2007.&nbsp; I don't want to do that here.&nbsp; But since you are clearly in the 2007 camp, perhaps you can explain in some way why 'Delete Table' is still not in the context menu?&nbsp; It's
 even farther away from the user than it is in 2003.&nbsp; But if you'd rather pass on this one, that's OK -- it's a diversion from the subject of this thread, and I am as big a critic as anyone of thread drift.</p>

            <p>I suspect that until ability to edit the context menus is restored (if it ever is), there are still going to be a lot of unhappy campers. I also still use Word 2003 for production work, though increasingly, as a result of having to use Word 2007/2010 for
 support purposes (and even for some contract work), I find myself occasionally wishing I were using Word 2010. What I can tell you that you may find helpful is that is
<strong><em>is</em></strong> possible to edit the Word 2007/2010 context menus if you are very sneaky.</p>
<p>Start with Graham's "<a href="http://www.gmayor.com/Toolbars_in_word_2007.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Toolbars in Word 2007</a>" article. I discovered quite accidentally that, by virtue of creating an add-in to add toolbars to the QAT, I had also managed to import menu customizations.
 These affect only the context menus, but since most of my shortcut menu customizations have been in the Tables context menus, I was very pleased by this unexpected side-effect (one of the customizations I most rely on is the old-style Vertical Alignment submenu).</p>
<p>You'll need to save those customizations explicitly in your global add-in (not sure how I managed to do that, actually, unless I created the add-in as a copy of Normal.dot, which I'm pretty sure I didn't), and it may require some trial-and-error, but if
 I can do it without meaning to, it can't be that hard!</p>

It was clearly an oversight. It has been restored there in Word 2010. <br />
<br />
In the meantime you could add the Delete Table or the more useful Delete Rows command (which will delete a selected table) to the QAT

    <title>Missing autocomplete, autocorrect entries - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> terrijuge  say:</h3>
<h2>            Missing autocomplete, autocorrect entries</h2>
                    I am using Windows 7 and word 2010. &nbsp;Recently, I had to shut down my computer to move it and when it was all reconnected I experienced several problems with programs. &nbsp;The main problem that I have is that my autocomplete and autocorrect seem to have lost
 most of the entries that I have done over the past 3 years. &nbsp; Saved documents have been resized, if that makes sense, and I was not able to run my symantec program. Also, my Dragon program will not load because it says my user profile is damaged. &nbsp;Any idea
 about what may have happened? Other than those items, the computer is working, I can add entries and work but I really need these shortcuts to help in my work.

            It sounds as if your default file locations changed. This is consistent with a damaged user profile.<br />

    <title>Podcast client for E72&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hateman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Podcast client for E72&#63;</h2>
                    In my previous E63 there was a nice podcast client Nokia Podcasting. I was surprised when bought E72 and found out that this app is absent! Ok, I went to OviStore and what a bad news that there is no any podcast client there! So do somebody know podcast
 client for e72? If this forum reads Nokia team - why did you erase it from E72? It also S60 and diffreneces between E63 and E72 are only in feature packs!

<p>All I can say is that the PODCATCHER application otherwise known as Escapod, is FANTASTIC!!</p>
<p>It will download automatically, only using the selected connection (wifi at home for me). And you can add your own feeds no problem. I have the Nokia E72.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am downloading the radio five live podcast (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/5live/podcasts/)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/5live/podcasts/)</a> wake up to money, other sites with documentaries, and contract law lessions etc.. so I
 don't know how Nokia could have dreamt that Businessmen wouldn't want it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only other major outstanding issue as far as I am concerned with the Nokia E72 is the voice recorder which is so useful for work, meetings, lectures etc.. - but it only lasts 1 hour??? Come on - how hard is it to get a programmer to fix that so it lasts
 12 hours or so!! Its probabily a 10 min change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suppose that is always what happens when what where prevously immensely innovative companies like Noka become corportised and run by lawyers. The fact that the Nokia Podcast application on so many phones was absent on the phone and the Ovi store is unbelievable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I only hope that the recent replacement of Nokias management by a CEO who is adapt in the world of software is going to be a real bonus going forwards.</p>

<p>I would just love the podcast client, which I have always had on my E61i, but I'm not a hacker by any means and I just need the client. Is there / has there ever been any reason why Nokia didn't put the podcast client on the E72 from the outset?</p>

    <title>Having trouble trying to complain to Microsoft - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> colins1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Having trouble trying to complain to Microsoft</h2>
                    <p>I am not making a complaint here but I am concerned that there seems to be a lack of any way to contact Microsoft if things happen a customer is unhappy about.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few months ago I contacted the Tech office as with a problem I had with Windows 10 and OpenOffice. I started to write a book about my ancestors but when I tried to on OpenOffice I found OpenOffice would not hold pictures every time I logged and logged
 back on the pictures were missing. I tried everything, I came on here and got ideas and tips to try but to no avail. In the end I contacted the Tech office, I asked them if they could either get OpenOffice to work or failing that help me reload windows 8 so
 I could use word as I had never had a problem with word, I allowed the agent to take control of my PC, after about an hour he had to admit defeat, he also could not reload windows 8 but he said he could down load Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2013. When
 he down loaded it I noticed it had (60 day Trial) written at the top of the page, I asked him what would happen after 60 days, he said nothing and put a Key code on my desk top and said it was free and all I had to do was key in the code, Great just what I
 needed. When it came near to the end of the trial I put in the code but it didn't work, I contacted the Tech office and after a lot of discussion they finally said the Agent had miss-informed me and it was not free so if I wanted to carry on I would have to
 buy it, I asked about the book I was writing and at first I was told I would be able to read it but not edit it of add to it... some more discussions later they said there was a free word something that would probably work. I was not really happy about 'Probably'
 losing all the work I had done on the book. Told the line manager that a lot of work had gone into the book and if the agent had said it was only a trial I would never have started to use it. In the end he was rather abrupt, not nasty but I could tell he was
 not interested anymore and we parted our ways. I have looked for a Complaints / Customer care to contact but was amazed that the agent I spoke to today said Microsoft did not have a complaints department and there was a sort of Customer care but it was letter
 or Phone but the phone number is 0344 number which I believe is between 26p and 57p per minute to call. The agent today suggested I come on here and register what had happened.</p>
<p>Like I said I am not making a complain here I am just asking if:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Am I being unreasonable asking that they abide by what was agreed between myself and the original Agent&nbsp;even if he was wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) you can chat to a tech agent on line free of charge so isn't it reasonable that we should be able to contact a customer care agent or Complaints department the same way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) And isn't it wrong that a Microsoft agent has to suggest I put what happened to me on this forum to get my concerns across to Microsoft.</p>
<p>If anyone has any ideas of how I can go forward, preferably without losing all the work I have already done on my book I would be very grateful.</p>

            I think Project 2010 was the first version to allow changing cell background (but can't remember) so you will need to check version number of Project.<br />
In Project record a macro of you changing the background and then just convert to C#.<br />

I have had this exact issue happen to me on my 6555 also ... twice! I'm Sending phone back to nokia for the second time now for repair. first time i sent in for repair the reason they gave as to why this happened was data comm. error and remedy was to re-install
 o/s and send it back to me. that fix lasted all of 3 mos. Hope theres a fix for this out there somewhere but don't even think nokia knows what is is :(<br />
<br />
Good Luck!!!

            My wife's 6555 did the exact same thing right after I added an SD memory chip. While she does not use the AT&amp;T apps, she does use the calculator occasionally. Annoying! Has anyone tried a master reset for this issue?

            Tried the master reset (twice) to no avail. This seems to be unfixable without sending back to Nokia. These&nbsp; apps aren't worth the cost of repair (for me). This all happened 3 weeks after warranty expired. :smileymad:

<br />
I am having what I believe to be an account problem but the account support folks have directed me here. I am getting errors when trying to login to office.com/myaccount. I need to download my copy of office 2013 home and business. &nbsp;The PC this was originally
 installed on has been replaced. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have tried multiple browsers on multiple PC's. &nbsp;I have done remote support sessions with multiple different Microsofts techs. &nbsp;I have changed the password on the account multiple times. &nbsp;Cleared browser caches, set my default browser to IE, reset IE and done
 inprivate browsing. &nbsp;I can access portions of the account but the myaccount page wont work. &nbsp;When I enter my credentials on office.com/my account I get taken to a page asking my to add more details asking me for first and last name. &nbsp;I enter the info and it
 takes me to a page that says&nbsp;<br />
<br />
"There's a temporary problem<br />
<br />
There's a temporary problem with the service. Please try again. If you continue to get this message, try again later."</p>
<p>
</p><p>URL is https://account.live.com/error.aspx?errcode=1086. &nbsp;The account can also not login to Outlook.com. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
I am hoping you can help on this side but I believe this to be a server side issue.</p>

            You must uninstall office on your old computer before attempting to login to your office account.&nbsp; Once you have uninstalled office on your old computer and if you still cannot login to your office account I will provide instruction on how to change your
 email address associated with your office account.&nbsp; You have to understand that the email address and password you used when you first installed your office act as a unique password for your office account.

            I am working on getting the old PC back online.&nbsp; I do want to make sure we are on the same page though.&nbsp; I have not yet installed office on the new PC.&nbsp; I have never before encountered this problem when using digital delivery of office on previously activated
 licenses.&nbsp; I understand that it can only be on one PC and I am certainly happy to comply with your request.&nbsp; I am just concerned that I cannot access the digital download when using the correct credentials.&nbsp;

            <p>Office 2013 was a new concept in delivering office products. The idea was first to combat breach of licence etc and secondly to force/encourage everyone to use 365&nbsp;Office online.&nbsp; Office 2013 is designed to get round the problem you will be aware of with
 obtaining ISOs for Windows 7 for reinstalling, particularly with OEM versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Office 2013 it is almost if not&nbsp;impossible to breach the licence conditions.&nbsp; The reason that I did not give you the instructions to change your email address above is because you may not need to change it if you are sure you are using the email address
 and password that you used when you first installed Office 2013. If you are sure and you have uninstall office on your old computer the help desk will assist you. It probably will&nbsp;not be the&nbsp;same tech help you have been in contact with.</p>

            <p>I have just realised what you mean. What confused me is mentioning of installing office on&nbsp;another computer, which I now realise is irrelevant, if I have got it right you are just making sure everything is working correctly on your old computer. Sorry. See
 below this should allow you to access your office account on your old computer.</p>
<p>
<strong><span>
</span></strong></p><p><strong>Changing the email address for a Microsoft account </strong></p><strong>
</strong><span><span>
<p>If the customer remembers the incorrect email ID and password they used to redeem Office then you can help them change it with the following steps:
</p>
<p>1. Ask the customer to go to https://login.live.com/ </p>
<p>2. If they get auto-signed in, have them sign out manually. </p>
<p>3. Have the customer sign in using the incorrect email id they have used. </p>
<p>4. Normally a customer on sign-in would be redirected to the mail box. However, since the account is unverified, they will be taken to Account Summary page. 22
</p>
</span></span><span><span>
<p>5. Click on Rename account and you will see the below page. Select the option "Use a different address" to correct the misspelled email ID.
</p>
<p>6. You’re done. If the correct email id does not already exist as a Microsoft Account, then the rename is successful.
</p>
</span></span>
<p><span><strong>Note</strong></span><span><span>: If they already receive an error message that the account already exists, it is possible that they already have an account under their
 email address. Have the customer logout and use the "Can’t access your account?" link on the sign in screen to reset their password.
</span></span></p>

            <p>Actually, what I mean is old pc had office 2013 installed via digital delivery in 2014.&nbsp; A Microsoft account was created for the purchase of the software.&nbsp; That was well documented and I have the email address and password for the account.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>That PC has been replaced and I need to reinstall Office 2013 on the new PC.- I understand that&nbsp;office 2013&nbsp;needs to be uninstalled from the old PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When trying to login to <a href="https://office.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://office.com/myaccount</a> to access the valid software download, the page that loads instead is asking for first and last name.&nbsp; When those are entered and I hit "NEXT" the next page is
<a href="https://account.live.com/error.aspx?errcode=1086" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com/error.aspx?errcode=1086</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you go that page while logged into your account you will see in the upper right corner an option to Sign In and in the upper left The Microsoft logo followed by Account.&nbsp; If I click account I can get to the account details page.&nbsp;But there is no way for
 me to get to MyAccount to download office 2013. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Home Insider Preview Build 10130 cannot find Desktop Location</h2>
                    <p>Hello, after I updated my laptop, I shut it down and went to sleep. Later the next day, I turned it back on and I got an error message immediately, and everything on my Desktop is gone, except for the Recycle Bin. The message said this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\WINDOWS\system32\config\systemprofile\Desktop is unavailable. If the location is on this PC, make sure the device or drive is connected or the disc is inserted, and then try again. If the location is on a network, make sure you're connected to the network
 or Internet, and then try again. If the location still can't be found, it might have been moved or deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried searching for the location, but nothing happened. This happened after I&nbsp;installed the&nbsp; Definition Update for Windows Defender - KB2267602 (Definition 1.201.1097.0). I have not installed &nbsp;fbl_impressive Core 10162 (I'm not sure if this has anything
 to do with it, but it has been at 0% for a while now).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me and thank you for your time.</p>
