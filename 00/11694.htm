<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's get started.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>First, <strong>falacious</strong> is not a word...&nbsp; And, I'm not sure what <strong>
integral software</strong> is...</p>
<p>Next, you really need to understand that you should not provide PERSONAL information.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Third, you have posted at least 3 different forums.&nbsp; One post, in the proper forum, is enough.
</p>
<p>Fourth, you are not providing information that can help with your problem.&nbsp; If your email is provided by MSN, HOTMAIL, Windows Live Mail, then we may be able to help.&nbsp; If not, go to your email ISP for help.</p>

    <title>How to Link Drop Down List Items to Specific Choices in Secondary Drop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lostnspace  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to Link Drop Down List Items to Specific Choices in Secondary Drop Down List&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I want to create multiple drop down lists, and each selection of the first drop down list&nbsp;corresponds to selected items in the second list.&nbsp;When a choice is made in the second drop down list, that will define the specific items available in the third drop
 down list.</p>
<p>As an example:</p>
<p>My first drop down list will be for the four seasons. Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter</p>
<p>The second drop down list will be these holidays in the year: New Years, Easter, Memorial Day, Fourth of July, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, Christmas</p>
<p>The third drop down list will be foods associated with particular holidays: hamburgers, hot dogs, ham, turkey, barbecue, fish fry.</p>
<p>If I select Winter in the first drop down list, only Christmas and New Years will be an option in the second drop down list.&nbsp; If I then select Christmas in the second list, only ham and turkey will be an option in the third drop down list.</p>
<p>If I select Summer in the first drop down list, only Memorial Day, Fourth of July and Labor Day will be available.&nbsp; Selecting Fourth of July will then give me only hamburgers, hot dogs and barbecue as choices in the third drop down list.</p>
<p>Forgive me long explanation, and if I overlooked the solution to&nbsp;this problem elsewhere I apologize.&nbsp; Thanks for your help!</p>

            Since this is a public forum, I can't ask your Skype Name to check the details. You should chat with a live agent from Skype Support on this issue to keep your personal information protected and take required help. (This is not a bot support but staffed by human agents)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/skype/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/...</a>
<br />
<br />Not all options will allow you to chat with a live agent. Select following one from the categories dropdown to get the option for chat.
<br />
<br />Payments &amp; purchases
<br />Account, profile &amp; sign-in
<br />Privacy &amp; security
<br />
<br />On the next screen, you get the Chat link which you can click.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

</p><p>No, it can't damage anything. I use windows 10 from the moment they release it and it works fine.&nbsp; I must confess, I have backed up my windows and I can reinstall everything very fast, but all the hardware works perfectly. The only concern is related to
 the software, some applications might not work.</p>

<p>I installed W10 as a sole OS on a HP notebook.&nbsp; It is performing great except for the couple of little quirks such as no lites on the keyboard.&nbsp; I also use Start8 from Stardock which gets the W10 interface back to the beloved, by many, W7 desktop.&nbsp; Classic
 Shell is the free edition of all the same features.&nbsp; Start8 gives me full customizing so I am just 1 click away from almost anything, including the W10 interface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a matter of fact, I cannot really tell if I am using the W10 PC or 1 of my fleet using W8.1.&nbsp; I recently brought on board a notebook running W8 and I had a hellva time until I got it to W8.1 and then Start8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is my W10<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4e64d0ad-44b2-400a-a261-819b955aaa23" /></p>

<p>Hello Sir/ Ma'am..</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hope u will fine.&nbsp; I purchased lumia720 4th Sept 2013. After 1 day, means on 5th Sept. my phone became dead, and from the next day it starts having other issues like, touching problem, camera is not fine (pixels are not clear),
 battery backup problem and phone heated in short time. In 10 days it became dead 8-9 times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On 2nd day i went to Nokia Care Canter (NCC) in my city (Agra).&nbsp; After facing such problems again I went to NCC, they keep my phone and ask me to come after 10 days and ensure me that they will solve my all issues of phone, but they didn't do their
 work properly and when i receive my phone on 25th Sept. same day my phone troubling me again and some other problems are also arise. Again i went to NCC and they again keep my phone. I asked them to replace my phone from 1st day but they didn't.&nbsp; But when
 i make my 2nd visit to NCC and tell them to replace my phone they told me they don’t have any replace facility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now i request you very politely please pay attention to my problem asap because i am getting so much trouble with this phone and your NCC system. And please take action against that NCC, and if you don’t pay attention
 on my problem and if i don’t get your response in positive way than i will go to CONSUMER COURT, because i have no other option.. i am fed up from you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The purpose of posting my problem here is that I want my problem must be solved asap and the nokia authority get to know about my problem...</p>

            My new 520 is gone back to Nokia for repairs and am disappointed that as a new phone it does not get replaced. Will not buy Nokia again. I hope things work out for you.

                    Is the above application running on Windows v8.1 capable of syncing playlists with the later Sony Walkman media players?&nbsp; The Sony website is impossible to use so I can't ask them directly.

<h2>            MSN settings are out of date</h2>
                    I recognize the "community" issues and have the same problem. Since I see no answers, can I assume that I can proceed by simply clicking off the "MSN settings are out of date" and presume it will not affect the performance of my computer until this issue
 is resolved by Microsoft?

    <title>Incompatibility problems with Windows defender OFFLINE&#58; Caution - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> questions_  say:</h3>
<h2>            Incompatibility problems with Windows defender OFFLINE&#58;   Caution &#47; Warning  using WDO</h2>
                    <p>The&nbsp;problems below are currently (3/27/3016) being worked on by Microsoft support level III in India.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the anniversary edition (version 1607) of windows 10, windows defender&nbsp;OFFLINE (WDO) was integrated into the operating system.&nbsp; The OFFLINE feature is available when opening windows defender and clicking in the right upper corner on settings.&nbsp; A pop
 up will appear and on this pop up is an options to click on windows defender OFFLINE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Information about WDO is available immediately after a clean install of windows 10 version 1607.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Others have reported blue screen boot loops using WDO and there are threads available in Microsoft TechNet and Microsoftanswers as well as via google search.&nbsp; Those that had reported WDO boot loops reported their problems but did not know how to reproduce
 it.&nbsp; This thread provides information on how to reproduce the windows defender OFFLINE blue screen boot loop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There have been no blue screen boot loop problems running windows defender in quick or full mode</p>
<p>The problems are only with running windows defender OFFLINE where the end user could encounter blue screen boot loops.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem with WDO blue screen boot loops was reproduced or confirmed twice using windows driver verifier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are the steps to set up windows driver verifier:&nbsp; https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/driver-verifier-tracking-down-a-mis-behaving/f5cb4faf-556b-4b6d-95b3-c48669e4c983</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are the steps to set system failure settings:&nbsp; https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/bsod-finding-and-fixing-them/1939df35-283f-4830-a4dd-e95ee5d8669d</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) right click left lower corner windows icon</p>
<p>2) click system</p>
<p>3) click advanced system settings</p>
<p>4) click settings in startup and recovery</p>
<p>5) remove check mark from automatically restart</p>
<p>6) modify write debugging information to automatic memory dump</p>
<p>7) in the box immediately to the right of the windows icon or the search box type verifier</p>
<p>8) then run</p>
<p>9) move the dot from create standard settings to create custom settings (for code developers)</p>
<p>10) select all settings except randomized low resources simulation and DDI compliance checking and if present DDI compliance checking (additional)</p>
<p>11) move the dot from automatically select unsigned drivers to select driver names from a list</p>
<p>12) click on the column heading provider</p>
<p>13) places check marks in all providers that are not Microsoft (typically there are approximately 12 drivers on a clean install) and many more on a system that has computer manufacturer installed drivers</p>
<p>14) finish</p>
<p>15) restart</p>
<p>16) computer produces a blue screen :(&nbsp; with stop code driver verifier detected violation</p>
<p>17) power off</p>
<p>18) power on</p>
<p>19 ) repeat power off and power on until automatic repair</p>
<p>20) when troubleshooting menu is available navigate to start up options</p>
<p>21) choose number 6 safe mode with command propmpt</p>
<p>22) enter the command:&nbsp; verifier /reset</p>
<p>23) shutdown or restart using the command: shutdown -r or shutdown /r or shutdown -s or shutdown /s</p>
<p>24) if that does not work then enter exit and then open task manager with control shift escape then file then new task then shutdown /s</p>
<p>25) reboot to desktop</p>
<p>26) if interested you can look at the minidump or memory.dmp files to find information about the driver triggered by windows driver verifier</p>
<p>27) enter windows defender in the search box next to the left lower corner windows icon</p>
<p>28)) open windows defender and click on settings in the right upper corner</p>
<p>29) in the pop up windows scroll to the bottom and above the version information is windows defender OFFLINE</p>
<p>30) click on windows defender OFFLINE</p>
<p>31) it will reboot, then it will load windows defender with a green bar, then it will open windows defender and run a quick scan</p>
<p>32) after the scan you will be back on the desk top</p>
<p>33) up to this point there should not have been any incompatibility problems (one run of windows driver verifier producing a blue screen and one run of windows defender OFFLINE).&nbsp; Each of these programs has required a reboot in order to run.</p>
<p>34) run windows driver a second time having already run one WDO</p>
<p>35) when it reboots you will blue screen :( with stop code driver verifier detected violation and power off and power up goes to a WDO load and WDO quick scan.&nbsp; This is the WDO blue screen boot loop.&nbsp; The troubleshooting menu is no longer available as each
 attempt to go into the advanced troubleshooting menu is overcome by a WDO load and WDO quick scan.&nbsp; Canceling the WDO has no impact on the blue screen boot loop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Attempted repairs when in the WDO blue screen boot loop can be performed with a bootable windows 10 iso downloaded from:&nbsp; https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most often your computer will boot to the flash drive.</p>
<p>In case it doesn't boot to the flash drive the method for boot depends on the computer manufacturer and the bios boot order settings</p>
<p>For HP computers clicking on F9 allows choosing the flash drive as the bootable source</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the bootable windows 10 iso file navigate to repair</p>
<p>All repairs available have failed multiple times.</p>
<p>Unlike the troubleshooting menu on your computer the flash drive windows 10 iso file does not have startup repair options.&nbsp; So there is no safe mode with command prompt</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you attempt reset and save files you may get either:</p>
<p>The drive where windows is located is locked.&nbsp; Unlock the drive and try again</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>There was a problem resetting your PC.&nbsp; No changes were made.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you attempt reset and remove all files you may get either:</p>
<p>Unable to reset your PC.&nbsp; A required drive partition is missing</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>Resetting this PC.&nbsp; There was a problem resetting this PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps to perform clean install:</p>
<p>highlight the drive where the windows operating system is located and delete the partition</p>
<p>highlight the same drive and delete the next partition and continue to delete all partitions for the drive where windows is located.</p>
<p>Once all partitions are deleted the drive is unallocated.</p>
<p>Using the bios the drive if an internal hard drive can be sanitized</p>
<p>Alternatively the drive can be formatted when reinstalling the windows 10 operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reinstallation of windows 10 from the bootable iso is relatively quick compared to the amount of time it takes for the updates.&nbsp; The update time will depend on the bandwidth or download speed.&nbsp; It could take several hours especially if your speed is
 low like 5 MB/sec and it could be fast if your speed is close to 1000 MB/sec.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The above steps were performed on a computer that had factory installed windows 7 professional that had been upgraded to windows 10 professional.&nbsp; It had factory installed drivers and applications but no other applications or files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The above computer then had the windows 10 clean install.&nbsp; </p>
<p>After the clean install no other software was installed.</p>
<p>No HP drivers were installed.</p>
<p>No HP applications were installed.</p>
<p>No browsers were installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Microsoft level III manager from India then established remote access using support.microsoft.com/help and the LogMeIn software.</p>
<p>The control panel was viewed and there were 8 programs.&nbsp; The msconfig startup options were viewed.&nbsp; Task manager was viewed.&nbsp; Windows driver verifier was ran once and produced a blue screen with stop code driver verifier detected violation.&nbsp; The advanced
 troubleshooting was opened on the computer and safe mode with command prompt was used to enter the command verifier /reset.&nbsp; Upon return to the desktop the LogMeIn session was reestablished.&nbsp; The system settings were modified by unchecking automatic start.&nbsp;
 The windows defender offline (WDO) was then clicked and upon reboot it loaded and ran a quick scan.&nbsp; Upon reboot the LogMeIn session was reestablished again.&nbsp; Windows driver verifier was then ran a second time.&nbsp; It produced stop code driver verifier detected
 violation.&nbsp; After power off and power on it went into WDO blue screen boot loop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer was then booted&nbsp;using flash drive with 10 iso.&nbsp; None of the repair methods in troubleshooting worked.&nbsp; The windows 10 operating system was then reinstalled.&nbsp; First the partitions were deleted and then the OS was installed.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The above was done after a regularly used computer had the unexpected WDO blue screen boot loop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Many computers had undergone preventative maintenance using windows driver verifier to detect misbehaving drivers.&nbsp; All computers produced driver verifier blue screens.&nbsp; Some had displayed only the stop code driver verifier detected violation.&nbsp; Others had
 displayed more information about the driver.&nbsp; The driver typically had the ending .sys.&nbsp; One driver was uninstalled and reinstalled.&nbsp; A rerun of windows driver verifier displayed a second driver.&nbsp; While looking up the various stop codes or drivers windows
 defender scans were run.&nbsp; First they were ran in quick mode.&nbsp; Then they were ran in full mode.&nbsp; And then they were run in OFFLINE mode.&nbsp; Windows driver verifier was then run again on one computer and this computer went into the WDO blue screen boot loop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of the computers that had one run of windows driver verifier and one run of windows defender OFFLINE can no longer have a run of windows driver verifier.&nbsp; No further preventative maintenance can be done to find misbehaving drivers using windows driver
 verifier as the computers would like have WDO blue screen boot loops.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The above steps on a second computer were made to see if this WDO boot loop was reproducible.&nbsp; And it was reproducible twice.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first reproducible test was with a factory installed windows 7 professional operating system that was upgraded to windows 10 professional.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using a smart phone camera a video was shot of the notebook computer monitor while this computer was in WDO blue screen boot loop.&nbsp; This is a one drive link to the zipped video:&nbsp; https://1drv.ms/u/s!AhdfDD74t_q2ixVTJLjNCz06mvjB</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second reproducible test was after a clean install with only drivers installed by the windows 10 iso.&nbsp; There was no other software on the computer.&nbsp; Running windows driver verifier once with a resulting blue screen followed by a windows defender OFFLINE
 scan and followed again by a windows driver verifier reproduced again the WDO blue screen boot loop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In summary others have reported a blue screen boot loop using windows defender OFFLINE (WDO).&nbsp; The above steps have provided a reproducible way to see the WDO blue screen boot loop.&nbsp; The only method to recover from the WDO blue screen boot loop reported
 to date is a clean installation.&nbsp; Caution is advised for all those using WDO as it may put your computer at risk for a WDO blue screen boot loop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft support level III India is working on this problem and has forwarded the incompatibility reports to the Microsoft product group.</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>This category I had missed and wanted users of Windows defender offline to know about incompatibility problems and potential blue screen boot loops.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows defender offline is designed to run once in the boot.</p>
<p>Windows driver verifier is designed to run&nbsp;repetitively&nbsp;after boot&nbsp;until it is turned off with the verifier /reset command.</p>
<p>In order to enter the verifier /reset command the user has to be able to get to command prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Windows driver verifier is used to find misbehaving drivers ( https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/driver-verifier-tracking-down-a-mis-behaving/f5cb4faf-556b-4b6d-95b3-c48669e4c983) it frequently produces a blue screen with
 stop code driver verifier detected violation.&nbsp; Many times it may provide a driver ending with .sys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Windows defender OFFLINE is used after using Windows driver verifier there are no problems until there is a repeat use of Windows driver verifier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Windows driver is used after using Windows defender OFFLINE the user will experience a Windows defender OFFLINE blue screen boot loop.&nbsp; Windows defender OFFLINE was designed to only run once and there is no setting for it to run repetitively.&nbsp; However
 the repeat use of Windows driver verifier interacts with residual files from the prior run of Window defender OFFLINE.&nbsp; Consequently there is a repetitive Windows defender OFFLINE load followed by a Windows defender OFFLINE quick scan.&nbsp; Every attempt to get
 to a windows troubleshooting menu and safe mode with command prompt is blocked by a new Windows defender OFFLINE scan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ordinarily the use of a bootable windows 10 iso has usable windows troubleshooting options.&nbsp; However when in a Windows defender OFFLINE blue screen boot loop all of the windows troubleshooting options fail.&nbsp; It is not possible to perform either a reset with
 save files nor a rest with remove all files.&nbsp; The users only option is to delete drive partitions to make an unallocated drive and then reinstall the windows 10 operating system.</p>

            <p>Hey there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After much searching I've come across this page which at least assures me that the issue is on Microsoft's side and not mine. I've tried all kinds of remedies and nothing has worked so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My issue is slightly different: I decided to run WDO myself because I was suspicious of my anti-virus software not acting properly, at which point it got stuck in the loop. I didn't get a driver BSOD like in the video, but I did get the sudden switching
 off of WDO before it completes the scan. That however doesn't necessarily mean there isn't an incompatibility with the driver?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The annoying this is that WDO starts the repair mode even when I boot up in SafeMode - surely that is an oversight? What is the point of SafeMode if I can't get past a boot issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you anticipate some sort of solution developed in the next few days / weeks? I would much rather not clean reinstall Win 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Effectively all that is needed is way to disable WDO in command prompt prior to a Windows boot, so that then WDO can be disabled in Windows itself. Is there a way to do that currently?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is appreciated, thanks.</p>

            <p>Today I received a call from level III India and they asked me to repeat the WDO blue screen boot loop testing after the upcoming April windows update.&nbsp; I was disappointed that they were not doing the testing themselves and are relying on me.&nbsp; They don't
 have windows 10 version 1607 on their domain and still have version 1511.&nbsp; They were able to get a computer with version 1607 but the WDO scan online button was not clickable as it was gray.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is my&nbsp;guess that the problem with WDO is what it does to the registry.&nbsp; It leaves something there that interacts with other software producing problems.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have multiple computers that had windows driver verifier scans and windows defender OFFLINE scans and are at risk for WDO blue screen boot loops.&nbsp; So I am eager to get these problems with WDO fixed.&nbsp; I am making every effort to channel this to people that
 potentially troubleshoot and fix the software incompatibility problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the information that I found about the timing for the next windows 10 upgrade:&nbsp; https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2017/03/30/managing-windows-10-creators-update-rollout-seamless-experience/#IYKOdjX4lU2b3Ep8.97</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tomorrow I will get a follow up call from Microsoft level III India.&nbsp; If there is anything new I'll post it.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I am not optimistic about any quick fixes as they did not have the information about the WDO blue screen boot loop until recently..&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This option I have never tired but it may help you with your situation.</p>
<p>You could possibly go for a short period of time without malware protection:</p>
<p>Try this only at your own risk.</p>
<p>click the windows key and r key simultaneously.&nbsp; Then type msconfig.&nbsp; then in the system configuration click on the column heading service.&nbsp; You will then have all items in the column sorted alphabetically.&nbsp; Then scroll to the items beginning with windows.&nbsp;
 Then uncheck the items labeled windows defender.&nbsp; Then reboot.&nbsp; This may disable windows defender and allow you to do whatever you want to further troubleshoot.&nbsp; After reboot you can then do whatever you want.&nbsp; You can restart windows defender and see if that
 helps with the disabling of the WDO repair mode&nbsp;that you are experiencing.</p>

            <p>I have a feeling we have slightly different problems - I was working on a laptop completely unable to get past the boot loop due to the WDO bug - so I wouldn't have been able to access msconfig to begin with. As I said, my issue might not have been related
 to the driver clash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That notwithstanding, after much trial and error I did manage to fix it - when you get to the boot menu instead of trying any of the safe modes scroll to the bottom option which reads "disable early launch anti-malware driver". I had no idea what it did
 but it sounded like it might disable WDO - and it did! When my laptop booted it loaded windows normally, albeit a bit slowly.
<br />
<br />
Then once logged in I did a few things that I thought would fix the issue and restarted - but it got stuck again! So I repeated the operation, logged and ran a regular Defender virus scan - which completed normally. Once I did that I could then reboot normally
 and was finally out of the loop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

            <p>Yesterday 4/5/2017 I upgraded one of my computers from windows 10 version 1607 to version 1703.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I tested the new version for WDO boot loop using windows driver verifier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It no longer produces a WDO blue screen boot loop!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So this problem will soon be history as the Windows 10 version 1703 upgrade rolls out this month.</p>

<h2>            Blue tooth headset released after 30 seconds</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes my Jabra BT125 ear piece disconnects after 30n seconds or so even though</p>
<ul>
<li>The battery of the head set is fully charged</li><li>The headset is next to the phone</li></ul>
<p>Other times it works just fine.&nbsp; I wonder if anyoner else has observed this behaviour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Andy</p>

<p>I have some new input.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The E63 will release after 30 seconds if it believes that it is connected (via Blue Tooth) to a non audio device and the transaction is complete.&nbsp; The trick is to have the E63 'know' that it is connected to a headset (or car handsfree).&nbsp; The easiest way
 to do this is to have the audio device initiate the pairing.&nbsp; With my Jabra headset this involves powering it up and holding down the (only) Jabra button for about 5-10 seconds.&nbsp; Once this is done the phone stays connected to the headset.&nbsp; I think I used the
 same trick with my handsfrees (Move-on and parrot).&nbsp; In hope that this helps</p>

            Yes, I initiate the pairing from the headset, not the phone. Hasn't been an issue for me in a few weeks. But, I initiated the pairing previously from the headset when it was disconnecting me, so for the Plantronics headset that I have I don't think where
 the pairing initiates is a variable. But that was a good thought!

<p>Hi Eloise,</p>
<p>Firstly, I’d like to confirm whether the OneDrive refers to personal OneDrive or OneDrive for Business. To sign in with our education account, we need to use the OneDrive for Business on Mac. Here is a thread for your reference:
https://community.office365.com/en-us/f/154/t/282905</p>
<p>If it is OneDrive for Business, to narrow down the issue, I’d like to confirm the following information.<br />
1. Can you sign in to the Office 365 portal (<a href="https://portal.office.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://portal.office.com</a>) ? If so, please capture a screenshot about the license status via
<a href="https://portal.office.com/profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://portal.office.com/profile</a> &gt; Subscriptions.<br />
2. The version of your OneDrive and Mac system.<br />
3. The screenshots about the error message.</p>
<p>To insert a screenshot, please click on <strong>Use rich formatting</strong> and select the
<strong>Insert Image</strong> icon.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Allan</p>

 to click it. I loved working in focus view because I could focus on one piece at a time. I have microsoft office 2010-2011.

<h2>            tow kinds footnotes in a word document - how to do it&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I must translate an old text.&nbsp; This text has 2 Kinds of footnotes</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. First one is horizontally and in letters: In this one the publishes has written his comments about the text.
</p>
<p>It same like:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D) etc..
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. The second kind is the normal automatic footnotes which all of us know and that is vertical</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1)</p>
<p>2)</p>
<p>3) </p>
<p>4)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EVERY Page has this Picture and this layout. </p>
<p>I must now translate this in the same way. I can easily realise the second kind of notes, but cannot realise the first one.
</p>
<p>It is not allowed to mx both of the footnotes,&nbsp;( a) 1) b) 2)) </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you please help me in simple applicable steps to realise that in my word text (Word 2003/2007) ? &nbsp;</p>
<p>I write my document with word 2007 &amp; 2003. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I appreciate your help, thank you!!</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>A couple of ideas for you:</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> Use a combination of Foot Notes and End Notes.<br />
Insert your abc style notes as Endnotes.&nbsp; At the insertion point, click the dialog box launcher button (bottom right of the Footnotes group on the References tab in the ribbon).&nbsp; You can set the Endnotes to appear at the End of Section.</p>
<p>Then insert your 123 style notes as Footnotes.&nbsp; Again, at the insertion point in the document, click the dialog box launcher button and set Footnotes to appear Below text.</p>
<p>You said "EVERY Page has this Picture and this layout."&nbsp; Does that mean there are only pictures on every page?&nbsp; And if you make the pictures the same size, you could insert a Section break on each page.</p>
<p>However, I don't see a way (in Word 2007) to put several footnotes on one line... (don't know if Word 2003 lets you delete paragraph marks in the footnote section?&nbsp; Word 2007 doesn't let you.).</p>
<p><br />
<strong>2)</strong> You could insert the 123 style notes as normal Footnotes, with the Footnotes appearing at the Bottom of page.&nbsp; Then you can manually add the abc style notes as follows.&nbsp; Position the cursor in the footnotes at the bottom, at the left of
 the first footnote number (1).&nbsp; Press enter and you now have a paragraph where you can enter your required abc notes.&nbsp; You could even insert a 4-column 1-row table there to contain your
<br />
a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d)</p>
<p>This second solution obviously doesn't maintain the link between the content and the abc notes, so if content is added earlier in the document which causes additional pages to be inserted there is a risk that the fake footnote table would become separated
 from it's reference.&nbsp; But a quick experiement indicates the table stays with the other "real" footnotes, so as long as the document text for the abc notes stays "with" the footnote reference for a 123 note it should be ok (you could use Keep with next, etc.
 in paragraph formatting).&nbsp; You'd also have to add the fake footnote references in the document text using superscript and you wont get the hover-over functionality that you get with real footnote references....&nbsp; but, you could make the abcd in the table to
 be bookmarks, then add cross references at the required points in the document.&nbsp; That could work...</p>
<p>Hope that helps.<br />
Cheers<br />
Rich<br />

            <p>You can use Word's standard footnotes for (2), but you can't reliably do or combine these with (1).</p>
<p>Although you could achieve the appearance of (1) via Style Separators, last time I tried this, Word allocated just as much vertical space as if they'd been inserted the normal way. Furthermore, it would be difficult to ensure your (1) footnotes appear in
 the correct order for Style Separator linking. The best I think you'll be able to for (1) do is to use bookmarked characters with cross-references to them from entries in&nbsp;a floating table at the foot of the page.</p>

            <p>Hello Rich, </p>
<p>your ideas seem to be helpful, I tray it. </p>
<p>There are no pictures. I donot mean pictures, I mean layout, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is an example: it is pages with 2 KInds of footnotes </p>
<p>the above one of footnotes is numbers</p>
<p>the second in the bottom Latin letters</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lectio.unibe.ch/05_2/troyer_names_of_god/image001.gif" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.lectio.unibe.ch/05_2/troyer_names_of_god/image001.gif</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have now really no another idea than Footnotes and End notes, but the appearance of my translation of the page will be different.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I still welcome&nbsp; new ideas </p>

            They were the ones who did the Belarc Advisor and when they saw that there was no license for Office they didn't know what to do. &nbsp;Apparently something similar happened in the past, but when they used Belarc it showed the license for the program and they

<p>If Office 2013 was supplied preinstalled when the PC was purchased any Key would be with the receipt/info received - possibly there may be an Office sticker with Key, on the PC (not the win Key), or in the battery compartment if a laptop</p>

            Hi Emma2.1.2
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />No you won't be knowing if somebody forwards the recording to somebody else.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.       
        </p>

            Hi Emma2.1.2 
<br />
<br />When a Skype recording is made, both parties are told the session is being recorded, so no-one can record you without your knowledge.
<br />
<br />Then after the call, both of you can each download that recording, but you will not be alerted when the other party downloads that recording, so please be careful, because once that  recording is downloaded, it can be sent to anyone . . .

    <title>Can&#39;t boot Windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lastgas  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t boot Windows</h2>
                    <p>I have a Dell&nbsp; XPS 8700 that boots from SSD. It has Windows 10 Insider on it, whatever fast ring Insider build was current on October 21. It was working on October 21 when left it powered up, and not on November 3 when I returned. There was a power failure
 during this period.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Dell boot screen says that it is "Preparing Automatic Recovery" over and over. Windows will not start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created installation media for the FallCreator update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dell and Microsoft disk diagnostics do not report any hard drive errors. I can get to the command prompt using recovery media and the disks look OK and the directories I expect to find are there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the recovery option to return to the last restore point. The only restore point I had was to Oct 20, and it said that the restore was successful, but "Preparing Automatic Recovery" keeps happening. I also tried Return to Previous version, but that
 didn't make any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The SrtTrial.txt file says "A recent driver installation or upgrade may be preventing the system from starting." Everything else in that file says "successful." Recovery.txt is empty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I have an external file history drive that is intact, it will be very difficult to re-install all the software on the machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What are my options?</p>
<p>
</p><p>[Additional info]</p>
<p>
</p><p>I said it was working on October 21, but I probably didn't look at the machine on that day, but rather last on October 20. On October 20 there is a restore point at 11:41 PM. It may well be that there was some sort of Windows update on October 20 that may
 or may not be related to the failure.</p>

<p>When you made the USB key did you put a check mark in the UEFI/MBR support box so your UEFI system would be supported.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also if your system is UEFI you might have to turn off Secure Boot to insure some things will work the way they should and when done you can always turn the Secure Boot back on.</p>
