<h2>            No way to input admin user&#47;pass</h2>
                    <p>So, I somehow managed to make my PC ask for admin username and pass everytime I wish to make a change to PC, as seen here :<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1ad3867c-ea94-458d-a6a2-7d0de1dbbeb6?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1ad3867c-ea94-458d-a6a2-7d0de1dbbeb6?upload=true" /></a>but
 as you can see, I have no way to input my admin user name and pass. Is there any way I can fix this so I can exit administration so it goes back to the normal&nbsp;<strong>(Would you like &lt;program&gt; to make changes to pc? [Yes] [no]) ?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>

</p><p>EDIT: is this a known bug?</p>

            Hi Scrippy.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Are you running as Standard User and want to stay that way but just get the UAC sign-in prompt again?  See here:
<br /><a href="https://winaero.com/blog/fix-yes-button-disabled-in-uac-dialogs-in-windows-10-windows-8-and-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://winaero.com/blog/fix-yes-button-disable...</a>
<br />
<br />Or were you Admin of the PC (always recommended if you own it) and have lost  your Admin rights here and need them back?  See here:
<br />
<br />If you have lost Admin rights then try these steps leading up to if necessary creating a new Local Account which sometimes is the only way to escape Account Corruption in Windows 10:  
<br />
<br />Right click Start button to open Run box, copy and paste in netplwiz, press Enter.
<br />
<br />Highlight your account, then click Properties, then Group Membership tab.  click on Administrator, then Apply, OK, restart PC.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help then try this:  <a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/fix-lost-administrative-rights-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.kapilarya.com/fix-lost-administrati...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also try taking ownership of the affected files or folders to see if this suffices.  Use this handy tool that adds Take Ownership shortcut to your right click context menu:  <a href="https://www.askvg.com/add-take-ownership-option-in-file-folder-context-menu-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/add-take-ownership-option...</a>
<br />
<br />If nothing helps try creating a new Local Admin Account to sign into to see if it works:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a-new-local-user-account-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a...</a>
<br />
<br />If you can't get the rights to do this then use whichever method works here to enable the hidden Built-in Administrator to be used only in emergencies:   <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable-disable-elevated-administrator-account-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable...</a> 
<br />
<br />It may be necessary to create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC to access the Command Prompt without needing a password:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />After it loads, on second screen, choose Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Startup Options, first try System Restore to a point before this.  If that fails then choose Command Prompt to follow the step above to access Built-in Admin Account.
<br />
<br />Sign into Hidden Admin account, see if you can use netplwiz now to elevate the account.  If not try another of these methods: <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/how-change-user-account-type-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowscentral.com/how-change-user-...</a>
<br />
<br />If not then set up a new Local Admin Account, sign into it, move your files over, set it up, hide the Hidden Admin Account, when ready delete the old account in Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family and Other Users.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>All Win 8.0 discs unusable for recovery. Here&#39;s the - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shawnsnyder  say:</h3>
<h2>            All Win 8.0 discs unusable for recovery. Here&#39;s the workaround&#58;</h2>
                    <p>Okay, so after a few days of misery, I have my computer back up and running, but found some an important bug in the process.&nbsp; That is, if you started with 8.0 installation discs, and upgraded to 8.1, you cannot use your 8.0 discs for restoring from a backed
 up system image (if that image is from after you upgraded to 8.1)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's see some testing:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) fresh install win 8.0 64 pro from system builder disk.</p>
<p>2) installed all updates</p>
<p>3) upgrade to 8.1 from app store</p>
<p>4) installed all updates.</p>
<p>5) system image backed up to drive on home network</p>
<p>6) boot to 8.0 install disk, recovery menu, restore from system image.</p>
<p>7) connect to network drive, recognizes drive, recognizes backup file. Select backup, start restore.</p>
<p>8) Starts, prep discs, then 5 seconds later...</p>
<p>9) "Re-image your computer</p>
<p>The system image restore failed.</p>
<p>Error details: The processor architecture or OS version of Windows Recovery Environment is not the same as that of the computer that was backed up. For example, a backup of an Vista x64-based computer can be recovered only by using an Vista x64-based version
 of Windows Recovery"</p>
<p>10) Restart</p>
<p>11) "An operating system wasn't found. Try disconnecting any drives that don't contain an operating system.</p>
<p>Press Ctrl+Alt+Del to restart."</p>
<p>
</p><p>This leaves the fresh install unbootable and unusable.&nbsp; Bad, right?&nbsp; Well, this all stems from the fact that for whatever reason, it was decided that 8.1 should be another class of operating system.&nbsp; You would expect that you could use an 8.0 installation
 disc to recover an image of any 8.X type, but this is not the case here.&nbsp; 8.1 is considered a completely different operating system, and for this it is either mislabeled or mis-tagged as a new OS.&nbsp; For the purposes of the "Recovery Environment" utility on
 the 8.0 disc, 8.1 may as well be windows 9, because it's incompatible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So let's test this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) fresh install win 8.0 64 pro from systembuilder disc.</p>
<p>2) installed all updates</p>
<p>3) upgrade to 8.1 from app store</p>
<p>4) installed all updates.</p>
<p>5) system image backed up to drive on home network</p>
<p>6) Make a bootable USB drive, which will make a "recovery environment" of version 8.1, different from the 8.0 on the discs.</p>
<p>7) Boot to the USB drive, and initiate a recovery from system image.</p>
<p>8) Connect to Backup we just made of 8.1</p>
<p>9) Poof, it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thus, 8.0 discs are UNUSABLE to recover a system image that is 8.1.&nbsp; You must have made a USB recovery drive after you upgraded to 8.1 to recover an 8.1 image, or else you will need to reinstall 8.0 and update and upgrade all the way to 8.1 so you can make
 a recovery USB drive, then go back and try the restore image.&nbsp; So it is possible to restore, albeit non-intuitive to most.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd imagine 8.1 discs won't have this problem.&nbsp; And since this whole issues stems from 8.1 being considered a different operating system, it seems the easiest way to remedy the situation would be to undo the characterization of 8.1 as another operating system,
 which doesn't make sense in the first place.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>After seeing the path that was taken as far as marketing and selling all the different versions and upgrades, which is probably why it happened, undoing it might be more difficult, but they got themselves into this mess.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone else think of a less messy fix to this so it's actually feasible to deploy for Microsoft, reaches as wide as possible, and minimal effort for the consumer?&nbsp;
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">I'm thinking a permanent blog post that support can easily link to and consumers can easily find on the correct process might be a different route that could benefit all parties.</span></strong>&nbsp; Hey, I guess
 this works. Link to this page for the process.</p>

<p><span>W</span><span>hat Do I Do to Make a Windows 8 Repair Disc?</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Windows 8 allows administrators to prepare a system repair disc that <br />
helps them repair a Windows 8 computer in case it fails to start or <br />
behaves obnoxiously. To create a Windows 8 system repair disc, insert a <br />
blank DVD into the DVD drive to start.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Although all system repair tasks can be performed by inserting Windows 8<br />
bootable installation media in the DVD drive and performing system <br />
repair steps, a system repair disc contains precise information and <br />
files that are required to repair a corrupt Windows 8 system. With the <br />
help of Windows 8 system repair disc, even non-technical users can bring<br />
a Windows 8 computer up if it fails to perform as expected.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Creation process of a system repair disc in Windows 8 requires elevated <br />
privileges, which means that in order to create a system repair disc, <br />
administrator account must be used to log on to the computer. Once <br />
system repair disc is created, the computer must be started using the <br />
DVD, and on-screen instructions must be followed to repair the system <br />
and bring it back.</p>
<span><strong>How to Create a System Repair Disc?</strong></span><br />

<div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Log on to Windows 8 computer with the administrator account system repair disc of which is to be created.</li><li>Click <span>Desktop</span> tile from the <span>Start</span> screen to go to the desktop window.</li><li>Once on the desktop screen, hover mouse to the bottom right corner of the window.</li><li>From the displayed options, click <span>Settings</span>.</li><li>From the <span>Settings</span> pane in the right, click <span>Control Panel</span>.</li><li>On the opened <span>Control Panel</span> window, click <span>System and Security</span>.</li><li>From <span>System and Security</span> window, click <span>File History </span>

            Thank you for responding, but making a recovery USB drive is already outlined in my steps and I note that one version is usable, while another is not. The post doesn't really relate to the issue I'm describing affecting every person with 8.0 installation
 discs.

            <p>I &nbsp;had a similar issue and was able to restore my Yoga 13 by using the Windows 2012 Server R2 Evaluation ISO which you can get free from Microsoft now. &nbsp; Burn the ISO onto a DVD and boot with them. &nbsp;It will then allow you to do a System Recovery from your
 8.1 System Image.</p>

<h2>            How do I stop the Microsoft family features pop-up spam&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hey so I've had this problem and somehow solved it before, but a week or two ago the pop-ups started appearing on both my devices again like the plague and won't go away, I read a few other questions about this issue and tried completely removing myself
 from the family I was in but that didn't help, my devices still show me in the family even though when I go to the Microsoft family website it shows that I am not in a family.</p>
<p>Basically I just want a way to remove the spam pop-ups because they are a massive annoyance.</p>
<p>Thanks for any replies, here's a pic of the pop-up:</p>

<p>What the hell Xbox? I played&nbsp; Ninja Gaiden, Burnout Take Down, Halo 1 and 2 no problem, but when I try to play Capcom vs Snk 2 EO, denied.&nbsp; In my opinion this is one of the best fighting games of all time and Ive seen others state this also.&nbsp; Im a playstation
 old schooler that has been won over by the first xbox, and then&nbsp;the first 360 ihave now 5 years no repairs no red circle of death just a sticky cd door, oh did I forget that this xbox has outlasted TWO ps3's?&nbsp; Cmon guys lets get SOME kinda SOMETHIN goin here?</p>

<p>I believe that Capcom vs SNK EO was never made backwards capable like the other games you mentioned. Some of the original xbox games were not running correctly when tested for capaility for the 360.</p>

<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/games/xbox-games/play-original-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>They are saying that what you're suggesting would affect game balance. It'd be easy to be one away from a blackbird out of ammo and about to die, but have a teammate kill you before the enemy can. Then you'd have full ammo and be one away from a game changing

<h2>            Generic PnP Monitor Not migrated after laptop display change</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I have an Acer nitro 5 laptop, the display broke so I went and had it changed, it's a full HD display,</p>
<p>after that the resolution options got reduced alot and the max resolution I have now is 1366x768, before I had 1920x1080, and after some searching found out that the "Generic PnP Monitor" does not migrate, giving the following error:<br />
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
Device DISPLAY\BOE061D\4&amp;29d2b3cb&amp;7&amp;UID265988 was not migrated due to partial or ambiguous match.<br />
<br />
Last Device Instance Id: DISPLAY\LGD0590\4&amp;29d2b3cb&amp;0&amp;UID0<br />
Class Guid: {4D36E96E-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}<br />

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />
</p>
<p>I tried a lot of things to get it back to normal but no use nothing seems to work,</p>
<p>so far I tried:</p>
<p>1- restart.</p>
<p>2- shutdown.</p>
<p>3-restart with advanced troubleshooting -&gt; repair.</p>
<p>4- disable/enable the device (with/without restart both).</p>
<p>5- uninstall device.</p>
<p>6- uninstall device and both VGA drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>basically I tried everything I can think of minus formatting.</p>
<p>please someone help.</p>

<p>if I understood it right, the problem seems that windows tries to migrate using the old monitor's hardware Id which is : (<span>DISPLAY\LGD0590\4&amp;29d2b3cb&amp;0&amp;UID0), byt the new one has a different Id (of course) which is :
 (</span><span>DISPLAY\BOE061D\4&amp;29d2b3cb&amp;7&amp;UID265988).</span></p>
<p>

<p>Hi Abdullah,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The existing display adapter driver might be having a compatibility issue with the new hardware installed on the laptop. That being said, I will need more information to properly address your concern. Kindly answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Was the display screen replaced by Acer or are you referring to having a separate display for your laptop?</li><li>Is your laptop <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027667/windows-update-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Update Windows 10">up to date</a></strong>?</li><li>Can you tell me the <strong>OS Build</strong> of your Windows 10 laptop? Select the
Settings</span> &gt; <span style="font-weight: bold">System</span> &gt; <span style="font-weight: bold">
About</span>. Scroll down to <span style="font-weight: bold">Windows specifications</span> to find this information.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Some device drivers might have a specific software left when it's removed from the system. To help you resolve the issue, I suggest removing the existing display adapter driver on your laptop and then delete the driver software. You can check this
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/using-device-manager-to-uninstall-devices-and-driver-packages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Using Device Manager to Uninstall Devices and Driver Packages">
<strong>page</strong></a> for more information on how to delete the driver software of your device. After removing the driver, you can run the troubleshooter for hardware and device to automatically find issues with the device drivers. Make sure that you're
 signed in as administrator to run the tool.</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Select the
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Start</span><span>
 button.</span></li><li><span>Type
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Troubleshoot</span><span> and then hit

<p>
</p><p>already tried it and after going through almost every possible solution I could find, I gave up and replaced the hardware again as I needed it working for me to be able to do my job, for now it's working fine, even though the display in issue worked on another
 laptop just fine! (tried it on a dell laptop).</p>
<p>
</p><p>what I think is that maybe the hardware itself is not compatible since it's not from Acer but from a third party producer so maybe something to do with how the hardware is configured.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>I recently got into sea of thieves on my xbox and wanted to start on my pc. My issue is that whenever I click install/play it redirects me to the Microsoft store and tells me sea of thieves isn't available. Anyone know why this is happening?</p>

            Good day ! I am an independent adviser here to help you!
<br />
<br />Do you live outside the US? If so, you need to change your region to the US. 
<br />
<br />Go to settings &gt; time &amp; language &gt; region &amp; language &gt; change your country or region settings to the United states. 
<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Lenovo T530 Laptop driver issues</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded my Lenovo T530 Laptop to Windows 10 and had a number of issues primarly with the video/monitor drivers. &nbsp;Windows 10 installed a genric PnP driver and would not allow me to reinstall the Intel Graphics driver. &nbsp;I saw some discussions that
 this is a known defect and that Microsoft and Lenovo are working to resolve, does anyone have an update? &nbsp;The upgraded also changed the settings of my Strong VPN and conflicted with my Norton Anti-Virus.</p>
<p>The good news is I was able to re-install Windows 7 and everything worked again. &nbsp;I what to upgrade to WIndows 10 but will wait until the "bugs" are worked out.</p>

            <p>I have had upgraded my Lenovo T530 (2392AQU) from Win 7 (was pre-installed) to Win 10 and faced severe issues, including unstable display drivers and a faulty "Power Management" process (from Lenovo) that hogged the memory infinitely with endless spawning
 of multiple process instances, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All this, while I followed the Microsoft "Ready to go" kind of notifications after I had reserved the&nbsp;upgrade.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After this, I brought my system back to Win 8.1 pro (I had the recovery disks from Lenovo). This meant hundreds of "Windows updates" :-( that had to follow the next couple of days, in order to bring the state of the system "back to latest updates", as the
 recovery disks were, indeed, of 2012!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win 8.1 was quite stable and the thought of giving up did cross my mind! But then, I was too curious on Win 10, and continued!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure and did not wait to check with Lenovo separately, but I observed this
<a href="http://support.lenovo.com/us/en/downloads/ds029249" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.lenovo.com/us/en/downloads/ds029249</a> and it said that this "Important BIOS update" had "Added support for Windows 10 (64 bit)". Does it mean it was mandatory before I tried upgrading
 my T530 to Win10? Why did either Microsoft or Lenovo software on my machine not figure that out while I attempted upgrading?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Being more cautious, I brought this BIOS update first, this time round.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, followed the usual Win10 upgrade process, and it was a Smooth experience! My T530 IS SUCCESSFULLY RUNNING Win10 now!</p>
<p>
</p><p>But then, I cannot prove if that pending BIOS update was only missing link.&nbsp;A lot of older "processes" that I observed&nbsp;in my Task Manager while running that pre-installed Win 7, such as the troublesome PWMUIAux.exe (Program files (X86) --&gt; ThinkPad --&gt; Utilities)
 were all cleaned up anyway when I brought it to Win 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bottom line is, jumping from Win 7 to Win 10 was problematic and I cannot pinpoint which exact ones were the problems, but the machine was simply unstable. When I went back to Win 8.1 and then moved to Win10, it was pretty smooth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, more than being curious, why did I not stay on stable Win 8.1?</p>
<p>Well, my other laptop I use at my office (Lenovo T440) runs 8.1 and I'm quite happy with that, as the T440 is touch-screen one. The T530, on the other hand, isn't a touch screen one, though it has larger screen and good hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Win10 solving all those niggles that made Win 8.1 less friendly to non-touch-screen devices, you should have no complains on that regard with Win10. The Mouse-n-Keyboard convenience is back, the Touch works as well, and I love Win 10!</p>

            <p>Thanks Sesha,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good information. I don't suppose you use your T530 with three monitors&nbsp;(two external, plus the laptop monitor), do you? If so, how did this work out?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what keeps me from moving from Windows 8.1 to 10, as I have heard of trouble doing this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Annu Singh: No one marks your reply as helpful, because these very general replies from Microsoft "Engineers" are too vague and contain the standard "Go read everything and reinstall everything and after spending two days of your precious time let us know
 what you find out but we won't get back to you anyway.". Save your fingers ...</p>

            <p>Hello Dan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>well, ... you got me curious, and I tried now this simple stuff:</p>
<p>I have a TV, simple 32 inch LCD monitor that is. I used to project my laptop screen easily to that via the small "Display port", and a mini-converter that changed the Display-port output as HDMI output (as the LCD screen had only HDMI input), and it worked
 when my T530 was on Win 7. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Pity, the same stuff does not work fully now that the PC is on Win10 :-(</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be precise, there are options, as we know,&nbsp;"PC screen only", "Duplicate", "Extend", and "Second screen only".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Neither the "Duplicate" nor the "Extend" options worked with Win10.</p>
<p>The "Second screen only" did work. But this merely means I would be able to view some movie, photos etc. that I may play on laptop, but won't be able to "work" with both the screens at the same time! So, what you heard was also correct, I confirm.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did the same experiments now with my other laptop which is still on Win8.1, and everything worked!</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, I am receiving continuous "small" updates on Win10, whenever I connect to internet. This confirms that the issue you mentioned about is still not resolved. I quickly scanned through the postings in "Windows Feedback" app that comes integrated with Win10.
 Yep, loads of posts confirm this and other related issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thankfully, the screen on laptop is stable and I was lucky to escape many other issues with many other display drivers that worked with Win8.1 and Win7 but no longer works with Win10, as per those posts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure if this was due to market pressure that MS released Win10 in this state. Many other apps do not work as good as it did in Win8.1 ("Photos", "Mail", "Store", all have worsen a lot).&nbsp;&nbsp;I really do not get it -- the main complain about Win8.1 was
 only the fiasco with "Start" screen / button.&nbsp;The target, a bold one, was to get both kind of users, the "Touch"-crazy and "Keyboard-Mouse" loyal groups into one seamless experience, and I like it the way they pulled it in the new "Start" menu. That bit works!
 Why the other good things had to undergo such massive regressions is beyond my naïve knowledge!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us not discuss those here though as this is a thread about "Display Drivers". I hope this is a temporary phase. Question is how fast can MS get past this phase!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

            <p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>
</p><p>sorry for premature post above, and I'm happy that the curiosity did not let me give up!</p>
<p>
</p><p>just tried the following:</p>
<p>Device Manager --&gt; NVIDIA NVS 5400M --&gt; Update Driver Software!</p>
<p>Some update took place and it got the driver s/w to the "latest" one from internet (not sure which version, but 'latest' as of today).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I tried the above experiments again.</p>
<p>And guess what?</p>
<p>The "Extend" option worked now!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm little bit puzzled why the "Duplicate" option still did not work. Under the "Extend", both the screens, one on laptop and the other one was that LCD of my TV, displayed the screen appropriately, e.g. highest resolution that the LCD had while keeping
 the laptop-screen's highest resolution (higher than that of the TV LCD) as is. I could not yet try yet another monitor as Dan suggested (I do not have another yet).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another open question my mind has: Win10 is supposed to follow "continuous updates" mechanism, and I had kept it that way, as I mentioned in the last post. The latest "Windows update" too ran minutes before I manually updated the NVIDIA NVS 5400M driver.
 Question is, do these driver updates then remain user's responsibility? Or, should I turn some other option ON from Lenovo side?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nevertheless, things getting better!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Thunderbolt 3 not able to display&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hey there, having huge problem with my new adapter.</p>
<p>I can't seem to make my laptop display on my monitor with a thunderbolt 3 to displayport adapter, here is the Info I can give:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a gaming laptop and used a HDMI cable to plug it in to a monitor.</p>
<p>The Monitor is 144hz and g-sync capable, so I decided to ditch HDMI and go for DisplayPort.</p>
<p>I have recently bought a Thunderbolt 3 to DisplayPort adapter (LAPTOP&lt;--TB3---DisplayPort--&gt;Monitor)</p>
<p>I know that my computer is TB3 capable since there is the little "lightning" sign on top of the input area.</p>
<p>When I connect the Adapter, it emits light, I therefore know Its being powered, though there is no signal received by the monitor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;-Every time I connect the TB3 into my laptop, it says "<span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">thunderbolt device functionality might be limited</span>" and that links me to a very unhelpful Windows support page telling me to literally verify that I plugged it in well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>can someone help me fix my issue? I really want to be able to use TB3's full potential to display my laptop's screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Windows 10 Home 64bit version 10.0.16299 build 16299</p>
<p>Laptop is Dell's Alienware 17r3&nbsp;</p>
<p>monitor is an Acer Predator</p>
<p>adapter is a Startech TB3 to DP</p>
<p>(drivers are normally up to date)</p>

<p>Hi Alexander,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since your computer is detecting the Thunderbolt adapter, there's a possibility that the problem could be on the monitor as it doesn't detect the adapter when you plugged it. To isolate this problem, please check if the monitor you're using supports a Thunderbolt3
 to DisplayPort connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, do you have another TB3 to Displayport adapter to try on to your monitor?
</p>

<h2>            File History - my expectations versus reality</h2>
                    <p>I have several observations. Would like a discussion on each, thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Managing "Backup these folders"</p>
<p>I assumed I&nbsp;could define the folders to backup at a top level so I wouldn't&nbsp;have to manage new subfolders. I deleted the many entries for c:/users/myname/subfolder in order to add c:/users/myname.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>a) I couldn't add a folder after emptying the list. Eventually after repeated attempts I got it to list c:/users and c:/usersmyname.</p>
<p>b) I turned File History on and it suggested it would do a backup. It created the top level folders on my&nbsp;backup drive but did not backup anything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had previously turned File History on weeks ago and turned it off. I deleted this on my&nbsp;backup drive before setting the new options today. How can I force File History to backup everything in the list?, and then presumably it will just keep incremental
 backups going forward.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) How does it work?</p>
<p>I assume File History would initiate a backup of everything defined in "Backup these folders" and then perform incremental&nbsp;backups. It kind of suggested it would but it hasnt&nbsp;backed anything. So I created a new file and saved it directly under c:/users/myname&nbsp;and
 set file history to backup every 10 minutes. Nothing was backed up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) I go to advanced&nbsp;settings and hit Run Now. Nothing happens.</p>
<p><br />

<h3> sotiredofthis  say:</h3>
<h2>            ICS error&#58; the service cannot accept control messages at this time</h2>
                    
<p>i am trying to share my laptops wireless internet&nbsp;connection&nbsp;with my desktop, both windows 7, because my wireless router cannot bridge&nbsp;wireless, and i can not run a cable to or move the existing wireless router in this building.</p>
<p>i read on this site that i shouldn't 'bridge' my connections like you used to in xp, and i tried it and it didn't work anyways, and when i try to set up ICS (internet connection sharing) on the wireless&nbsp;adapter&nbsp;on my laptop i get the error: "the service

<p>i can set the laptops wired connection to ICS, but it is my understanding that i am supposed to turn on ICS for the connection that connects to the internet, not the connection that goes to my desktop.</p>
<p>i have read and followed the directions on the MS help site, and probably am doing it right considering i don't get an error when i set up ICS on the wired connection. &nbsp;how do i make my wireless&nbsp;adapter accept ICS.</p>

<div>this is confusing. you state you have a wireless router in the building. don't</div>
<div>understand why you don't get a USB wireless adapter for the desktop. </div>

            Just an FYI because they actually never helped you find out what the answer was or even could be. Yeah go Microsoft and none win for you guys. Ok I was also trying to do something similar. I have a wired connection and a wireless card also. I wanted to
 turn my wifi card into a hotspot and when i clicked the box to allow others to use as a connection I would also get that error. I tried everything but finally figured it out after 20min. What you do is just disable the adapter you're trying to share off of.
 Then uninstall the drivers and restart your pc. I used my wireless card to connect back to the internet then ran windows update. After it was finished installing restart your computer again. After that it worked and allowed me to check the box with no issues.
 I dont know what happened to make this mess up but at least its an easy fix. I was using my wifi card as a hotspot for a while now but then it wasn't working. I use mHotspot incase anyone needed a good program that's reliable and free.

    <title>Windows 10 upgrade automatically scheduled - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tehsparx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade automatically scheduled</h2>
                    <p>Today, the Windows 10 upgrade has changed from notifying about upgrading to automatically scheduling itself to upgrade on Wednesday 18th, without my permission!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has changed itself from 'optional' to an 'important' update within Windows update. Ok, this is sneaky but supposedly fine for me because I had always had the option set in Windows update to 'download updates but not install them'. Wrong!
<strong>This option has been changed</strong> back to 'download and install updates automatically' without my knowledge or consent?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is going on with you Microsoft?! This is not the way to earn or keep you're loyal user base's trust, and such actions could (and have from what I have quickly read across Google and Reddit) cause problems for people who have critical or bespoke programs
 set up in a specific way or designed to run specifically on Windows 7, not to mention the multitude of less computer savvy users who would become confused. I'm thanking my stars right now I don't work in customer facing technical support for a manufacturer
 like Dell, or an antivirus company who would have to directly handle the fallout of your actions. I wonder if Bitlocker would play nice during such an upgrade? Soon to find out! Antivirus programs usually have some issues during or after such an upgrade too..
 Oh, and don't forget the litany of scam calls from India who will certainly jump on the bandwagon of "You're computer was upgraded to Windows 10 by a virus, it is fake, you have a virus, we are Microsoft and will help you remove the virus for a small fee."
 - I'm sure you know of the scam cold callers which are commonplace since 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I guess I'm lucky I spotted this unsolicited change to my update settings before they actually happened, I was even planning to upgrade to Windows 10, but I'm not so sure it's a good idea seeing as Microsoft cannot help themselves with invading their users
 computers and pulling the rug from under their feet - It's not the first time either! I lost all my Hotmail emails when Hotmail was automatically upgraded to Outlook.com - Guess who has never actively used their Outlook.com account since? There are others
 like Windows Defender / Security Essentials I don't care to recount right now as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>My question to you, Microsoft staff, is are you planning on making this a regular charade of changing settings without notifying users as I'm game for whack-a-mole so long as I know I'm playing it, and will you revert the changes you made to Windows Update
 for people you've affected already before you get a huge string of complaints about Windows 10 automatically upgrading on unsuspecting users computers?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Gina,</p>
<p>I believe that you missed the whole concept in the original message. I fully agree with what he is saying although I was not as fortunate as he, as my computer did the upgrade automatically with out my consent.&nbsp; which by the way shut down my computer (as
 well as my business) for several hours while updating... then when it was finally done updating, I had to choose to either keep using windows 10 or revert back (which gave a warning that it may take a while to restore) so I opted to keep windows 10 because
 I was considering upgrading.&nbsp; this also took some time to complete and then I had to restore all of my settings. I figure it cost me several thousand dollars for the time i was unable to do business due to this "automatic upgrade"</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was a very sneaky and underhanded way to get users to upgrade.&nbsp; I am not a very happy camper!

<p>What makes this different than an unwanted virus? Will Microsoft pay for my software that no longer works? This is outrageous. Is there a class lawsuit I can join? My computer is running soooo slow. I have an Acer laptop quadcore.HELP!!!!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Manually check for drivers as indicated, those driver programs are accidents waiting to happen<br />
and they rarely actually find the most current versions.<br />
<br />
Note the cautions on the memory checking where error tests do not find all memory errors so<br />
some actions might have to be taken concering physical placement.<br />
<br />
Do not have more than one major antivirus on the machine, much less running, at one time.<br />
Even the remnants of a 2nd one can cause strange issues.&nbsp;Uninstall BitDefender and&nbsp;use&nbsp;it<br />
maker's Removal Tool to stop remnants. Do&nbsp;same for any others you have or EVER had on<br />
the machine, except&nbsp;Avira,&nbsp;even if they were uninstalled. Multiple antivirus programs actually<br />
lower your security and cause these strange issues.<br />
<br />

<p>1 crash is cased by the Bitdefender driver: bdfsfltr.sys. This version is too old:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Image path: \SystemRoot\system32\DRIVERS\<strong>bdfsfltr.sys</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Image name: bdfsfltr.sys<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Timestamp:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Mon Dec 31 09:12:12 2007</strong></p>
<p>other crashes is caused by <strong>memory_corruption</strong> , so it may be a RAM issue. Also check your HDD for errors. The old Bitdefender program my damaged the ntfs file system.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Drivers for Alfa AWUS036H</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read&nbsp;<a href="http://store.rokland.com/blogs/featured-stories/6843876-installing-alfa-awus036h-on-a-windows-8-pro-laptop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a> that if I had access to an internet connection, I could use the "Search Automatically for
 Updated Driver Software" wizard to download the correct driver file for the AWUS036H USB Wireless network adapter. &nbsp;I don't have a internet connection setup for my windows 10 computer, so I have not been able to try this method.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note:</p>
<p>I have tried manually installing the device drivers from older documentation CD, and from online downloads. &nbsp;The drivers will usually install successfully, but I will immediately start having issues with the wireless card cycling between disconnected and
 connected every few seconds (as if I were physically disconnecting and reconnecting the USB cord from the computer).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had no problems using this card with Windows 7. &nbsp;Is this because I am using the wrong driver for Windows 10, or do I have something else that is interfering?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi Jordan, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for being part of Windows 10. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would request you to install the drivers in Windows 7 compatibility mode and check if it helps.
</p>
<p><strong>a:</strong> Right click on the driver file and then select <strong>Properties.</strong></p>
<p><strong>b</strong>: Then click the<strong> compatibility </strong>tab and then select Windows 7 from the drop down list for Run this previous version.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Do get back to us for any issues pertaining in the future. We will be happy to help.</span></p>

            <p>This does allow me to install the utility along with the driver directly from the CD, but it does not get rid of the disconnecting/reconnecting issue. &nbsp;After the installation, the<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;wireless
 card will begin cycling between disconnected and connected every few seconds (as if I were physically disconnecting and reconnecting the USB cord from the computer). &nbsp;I uninstalled my other network utilities/drivers and my antivirus software, but I am still
 having the problem. &nbsp;Is there a way that I can download the Windows 10 driver for this device manually without using the wizard that requires the internet connection?</span></p>

 that there is a driver that will work for Windows 10, but I have not been able to find it online on my Windows 7 laptop. &nbsp;I don't want to update my laptop to Windows 10 if I won't be able to use my device.</span></p>

            <p>I think Windows 10 was released in a haphazard way by Microsoft even when there were so many bugs yet to be removed after getting feedback for technical preview version. I had no issue on my licensed Windows 7 Home and before upgrading to Windows 10. I carried
 out&nbsp;compatibility test with my already installed&nbsp;apps and drivers. And at that stage it gave me 1 incompatibility issue with an app. And once I upgraded to windows 10 my IDT sound driver, Alfa AWUS036H and so many other apps were corrupted / defunct. Windows
 10 is an immature OS with a lot of backward compatibility issues. The installation of older apps in compatibility mode is seemed to be an eyewash. Only 1% apps successfully get installed in that mode. It's my biggest mistake that I trusted this OS and ruined
 my stable Windows 7 OS. I have more than 1500 Apps installed on my PC and startup shows only a few. Some services start up during boot and remains closed in next boot. I had a loss of huge amount of money coz of cancelling my contract with my client as a freelancer
 coz I ruined up my needed apps after upgrading it to windows 10. Sometimes system hangs up without any warning. Event viewer shows usb driver issue. Watch Dog blue screen of death. Stub error during Access Control. All **** is going on.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use AWUS036H by simply pointing to the win64 or win86 folder to update driver but now u cannot use your awus036h to control its power or as an AP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it hardly matters to Microsoft coz they are not having pain for you. </p>
<p>May be Mr Bill Gates being a Software Engineer get some time to develop empathy and feel some pain for us in which we engineers are entangled after getting this buggy OS installed in our machines.</p>

            Yeah, I've kept my laptop with Win7 just to so I can use a lot of my older programs/hardware. My desktop is Win10, and it sometimes feels like I made a mistake when I upgraded.

<p>No, not yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran DISM.exe on April 4th and will wait and see if&nbsp; fixed the problem first. If I get additional unexpected system shutdowns I'll run the System File Checker. If not, then there will be no need to run System File Checker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to be able to pinpoint what fixed the problem which means running one fix at a time and then letting it soak for a while.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error is most likely caused by a driver on the computer. Did the random shutdowns start after installing updates?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can review the update history in Windows Update to check if the problem started after updating. If you determine that the issue started after an update was installed, you can uninstall the update to fix the problem. Checking installed updates is explained

<h2>            &#34;User must change password at next logon&#34; does not work</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to force Windows 10 Pro user to change his password at next logon. I wanted to do it using Computer Management -&gt; Local Users and Groups -&gt; Users. I clicked on user and opened Properties dialog, then I click on 'User must change password at next logon'
 and OK. I tried it several times, but without success. User can still login with his old password and he is not asked to change password at logon. How can I force user to change his password at next logon?</p>
<p>Mentioned user account is linked with Microsoft account. Could this be reason why it does not work? If yes, is there a way how to to do it for Microsoft account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            Yes. That was a problem. I switched back to local accounts and it works now. That's pretty strange that you can not use any password security policy on your own computer while you are using Microsoft account. That's a BIG BIG disadvantage. I will not use
 Microsoft account anymore.<br />

    <title>Problems connecting to a projector via HMDI - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problems connecting to a projector via HMDI</h2>
                    <p>I am having a problem connecting to a projector for presentations. </p>
<p>Projectors are a plug-and-play devices that does not require any software (I am using OPTOMA HD65 ).</p>
<p>My HP ENVY 15 TS laptop is running Windows 10&nbsp; ver 1709 ( OS 16299<strong><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">.214</span></strong>)&nbsp; and has latest versions of display drivers.
</p>
<p>I tried connecting with different laptops and contacted OPTOMA technical support.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is what I have done to diagnose the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. <strong>Projector works with an old HP Pavilion running Windows 10 ver. 1709 ( OS 16299<span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">.192</span>) !!</strong></p>
<p>2. Projector does not work with HP ENVY 15 TS, DEL XPS 13, and Acer notebook all running latest Windows 10&nbsp;ver 1709 ( OS 16299<strong><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">.214.</span></strong></p>
<p>3. HDMI cable works and my laptop and the others and can be connected to TV/monitors and it works fine.</p>
<p>4. I hooked up the projector to my Verizon Fios cable box via the same HDMI cable, and it worked fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only difference I see between the old HP Pavilion and the newer laptops is the OS 16299.192 vs 16299.214.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Windows 10&nbsp; OS 16299.192::</p>
<p>In SETTINGS,&nbsp; the moment the HDMI cable is plugged in, the DISPLAY setting changes and new&nbsp; choice is added on top :: "Select and rearrange displays" followed by red rectangle&nbsp; with 1/2 in it.&nbsp; and two buttons "Identify" &amp;&nbsp; "Detect".</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Windows 10&nbsp; OS 16299.214::</p>
<p>All the newer laptops do not have that . The Display settings have "Brightness and color" and the first setting and the HDMI cable is not detected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need help and assistance to get this working. I use projector in many presentations, and I am dead in the water right now.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 won&#39;t install on my Samsung ATIV 500T1C Tablet PC</h2>
                    <p>Trying to update from 8.0 to 8.1.&nbsp; Install gets about 80+% and hangs up the tablet. All I hear is the drive going click, click, click, and nothing happening. I do a hard reboot and the tablet reverts back to the last Windows version point. I have done this
 5 times without success. When I go to the app store and try again it already&nbsp;shows the download bar at a little beyond approximately 60% downloaded. Can't get some apps or upgrade to 10 until 8.1 is installed. Basically I have a nice paper weight. Getting
 error message:&nbsp; 0xC1900101-0x40017. </p>

            <p>Windows 8.0</p>
<p>Error Code: 0xC1900101-0x40017&nbsp;</p>
<p>Samsung Tablet PC Model: XE500T1C-HA2US&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update 09/08/15 07:00 EST: Trying to perform another attempt to update to 8.1. I read&nbsp;on this site that some&nbsp;users have done "Prefetch" and deleted all the files in that folder before trying the download and install. I have performed all essential and non-essential
 updates from both&nbsp;Microsoft and Samsung. I have been online with Samsung two times using remote access to&nbsp;let them run diagnostics. A couple of things were found, but didn't help with the install.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update &nbsp;09/08/15 12:57 EST: Just tried my 6th or 7th attempt at updating my paper weight without success. Same error message as above. Just ran "Prefetch" and deleted all files in that folder, ran Windows Update and Samsung Update again, ready to give it
 another try. Good&nbsp;thing I'm retired!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update 09/08/15 19:20 EST: Recent attempt failed again. Same error code. Download from WS is fine, it appears to hang around 82% for a while and then eventually moves on. It goes through "Getting Everything Ready" just fine and seems to have problems after
 100% success and re-launch of software is where everything stalls. At this point it's a hard reboot twice to get back to the original version of Windows. I'm lost....</p>
