                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought Texture pack for my windows 10 minecraft edition within the game. I can't access it now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Atleast my bank account is billed 3,99â‚¬. so maybye something went wrong. Only thing I can think what went wrong is that when I did the purhase I was not logged into my xbox account ingame.</p>

<p>Hi GES_Malus,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To give you a heads up, there's a recent issue with using the Game DVR when recording clips on Windows 10. We detected that the issue occurs after installing the recent Windows Update. It's possible that you're affected by this issue that's why you're unable
 to record clips normally on your computer. Can you tell us if you got this issue after installing the recent Windows Update on your computer? Also, what troubleshooting steps have you tried so far?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, I recommend that you download and run the Windows Update troubleshooter to scan and repair any corrupted files on your computer that may affect the functionality of Game DVR. You may refer to this
<em><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027322/windows-update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong></em> to download the troubleshooter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your reply.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 reports incorrect mhz as well as throttles on Dell D830 - Thread moved to a more appropriate forum category.</h2>
                    <p>Well this is odd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I took a Windows 7 installation on a Dell Latitude D830 up to Windows 10 and when I boot it only reports it as&nbsp;0.59ghz in task manager. I figured some kind of throttling was going on or that windows wasn't controlling the processor speed correctly so tried
 the high performance profile and nothing changed. It also reports the processor pegged at 30% consumption but it won't ever reach 100%. Very odd. So I load up throttlestop to see if I can see whats going on and it immediately jumps back to its normal 1.2-1.8ghz
 range. So clearly throttlestop is resetting something in the OS that allows the processor to run at its normal speed. Weird. If I reboot its the same result. Slow processor pegged at a speed below the minimum. I think the min is supposed to only be 1.2ghz
 on the old Core Duo. This one is a T7100 for what its worth. I would have expected this to be a fairly well supported chipset/processor so I don't know what's going on. Disabling speedstep in the BIOS does nothing. Windows 10 actually runs really pretty well
 on this old machine. Good work. It would be nice to have it boot to the proper speed. Here's another strange thing: the speed reported in throttle stop is typically like 1.5ghz and in the task manager at the same time it is only 1.2ghz! Something very odd
 is going on with the reporting here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas??</p>

            Running the troubleshooters does nothing. I ran the hardware troubleshooter and it claims to have made some changes but the effect is still the same.

            Something else I thought I might add. This machine was originally overheating terribly. Under windows 8 it wouldn't throttle, but would shut off. It seems like Windows 10 was detecting that the processor was overheating and throttled it permanently or
 something. Initially after a clean reinstall it seemed to be running normally then started throttling. I took the whole laptop apart and cleaned out the 4" ball of dust and hair that were trapped in the heatsink. I then let it update the the newest current
 build hoping a 2nd fresh install would clear the issue. It runs fairly cool now, but now at boot it just throttles to half its minimum mhz. In BIOS it is reporting to be running at its normal minimum so clearly windows is causing the throttle. What's odd is
 that I think that the 1.2ghz windows is reporting after I run throttlestop is probably accurate as that is supposed to be the minimum. TS just says 1.56-1.8 all the time so maybe it is reading the register wrong somehow? I just find this so d

            <p>ThrottleStop shows CMod at 75.0%. &nbsp;That stands for Clock Modulation which is a method used for throttling a CPU. &nbsp;Many Dell laptops have issues in the bios that cause this. &nbsp;You need to set that to 100.0% by using ThrottleStop, check that option off and
 then click on the Turn On button. &nbsp;Laptops can be miserable to use when Clock Modulation throttling is in progress. &nbsp;You can ask Dell why this happens but good luck getting a straight answer from them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also check off the Set Multiplier option and set that to the maximum value (10). &nbsp;This is called Intel Dynamic Acceleration (IDA). &nbsp;The maximum speed when both cores are active is 9 x 199.44 MHz = 1795 MHz and when only a single core is active, IDA
 mode lets the CPU increase to 1994 MHz. &nbsp;In the newer Core i processors, IDA got renamed as Intel Turbo Boost. &nbsp;Same thing though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your CPU is running at approximately 1600 MHz in your screenshot. &nbsp;ThrottleStop separates the CPU speed from the clock modulation throttling so you can see exactly what is going on. &nbsp;Looks like the Task Manager is combining these two items together and is
 calculating an equivalent MHz value after taking internal throttling into account. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>75% of 1600 MHz = 1200 MHz</p>
<p>
</p><p>The normal idle MHz for a T7100 is</p>
<p>
</p><p>8 x 100 MHz = 800 MHz</p>
<p>
</p><p>75% of 800 MHz = 600 MHz</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is what the Task Manager is doing, it sort of makes sense. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>So this is a lot later in time. But the heading of this thread is accurate, so I'm reusing it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suddenly, probably since the latest windows 10 update, all my old Dell laptops are slow.</p>
<p>So my Dell 1735 was running at 42% of it's 2.1 GHz&nbsp; and two Dell 1555 where running 57 % of 2.0/2.2 GHz.</p>
<p>This was a hard limit no stepping up above these percentages. So loaded condition gave a nice flat line on these percentages during this condition. It wasn't just wrong metrics, I could tell, every thing was running at the given percentages (compiles and
 launches of applications were at double times). At this time I also realized why my son was complaining about slow game speeds...&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now this 1735 was running with an old power supply (PS) as a new one broke down before I noticed the slow speed. But when the replacement came (a brand new one) the new max frequency was still only 57%.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which made me search the inter net again. Lots of related topics but by now I was pretty sure it wasn't related to power configs (Switching to "High Performance" or related registry changes) or "Intel Speed Step" (switch on or off didn't matter).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally I found a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/4w0bke/cpuclockspeed_doesnt_change_anniversary_update/?st=iy7bnw7c&amp;sh=30139101" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
thread at Reddit</a> that nailed it for me, but as the heading and content is a bit of topic I decided to add it here in the hope that people in the same situation can find it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The value contribution was by "V__2" (what in a name?),&nbsp; which fitted my problem nicely as he explained about "Intel Speed Shift" being introduced to windows 10 recently, and made me try the following:</p>
<p>- Go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Power</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Change CsEnabled to 0 (should be previously 1)</p>
<p>- HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Power\PowerSettings\54533251-82be-4824-96c1-47b60b740d00\8baa4a8a-14c6-4451-8e8b-14bdbd197537</p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Change Attributes to 0 (should be previously 1)
<p>- Restart</p>
<p>
</p><p>This worked on all 3 Dell's: all operate at normal speeds again reaching 100% CPU frequency and stepping down normally (as they are on the "Balanced" power scheme). Even my son was pleased ...

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was hoping that there was an "Add-on" component somewhere. I have an issue that may be related to performance when mixed versions (1 and 2) are used. We can reproduce performance problems only in mixed evironments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ran across the article below that applies to my situation&nbsp; (mixed SMB versions in a WAN). It mentions perforamance issues in general but it appears I may have to dive deeper into the signing features to see if that's related.</p>

            <p>Did you encrypted the driver with bitlocker or bitlocker to go?</p>
<p>If you encrypted the driver using bitlocker, (not bitlocker to go), then you should unlock it using the PC that you lock or depend on the way that you lock use smartcard or pin to unlock it .</p>

<h2>            chkdsk runs on every boot with fat32 hard drives</h2>
                    My system runs windows xp home edition with service pack 3. I have 4 disk drives with only 2 drives&nbsp; used. Each drive contains 2 partitions&nbsp; of 60 gB formatted FAT32.<br />
AS the above title indicates chkdsk runs on every boot of the system. I can stop chkdsk from running and the system loads properly. When i then check for the setting of the dirty bit, i get a clean indication. Can anyone give me some hinits as to what to look
 for?<br />

            If you are convinced that the disk is not dirty, you can manually exclude a drive from being checked at boot time (or reset behavior to default) by using the "chkntfs" command from a command prompt window.&nbsp; It can also report the state of the dirty bit.
 Despite the fact it has "NTFS" in its name, it applies equally to FAT formatted volumes. To use the command, bring up a command prompt window (Start -&gt; Run -&gt; "cmd").&nbsp; To exclude drive Y: , enter the command:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CHKNTFS&nbsp; /X&nbsp; Y:<br />
or to get the status of a drive simply:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CHKNTFS&nbsp; Y:<br />
<br />
More info on the "chkntfs" command here:<br />

or, within a command prompt window, enter the command:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; help&nbsp; chkntfs<br />

    <title>Bluetooth stopped working after latest Windows 7 update&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jerseymilker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluetooth stopped working after latest Windows 7 update&#33;</h2>
                    After the last set of Windows updates I installed, my bluetooth keyboard and mouse will not work anymore. &nbsp;Battery level is fine, and I tried re-pairing the devices, but no luck. &nbsp;Both my bluetooth keyboard and mouse work fine on any other device. &nbsp;It
 just seems bluetooth stopped working immediately after the last Windows update. &nbsp;Anyone have any ideas on how to fix this?
<div><br />
</div>
<div>EDIT: Here is some more info on what I have tried...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What's weird is, there is no "Bluetooth Devices" under "Hardware" in the control panel. &nbsp;However, if I run services.msc, "Bluetooth Support" is installed and started though.
<div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am on an Apple iMac, running Windows 7 OEM with bootcamp drivers, trying to get an Apple Wireless Keyboard and Apple Magic Mouse working again. They were working fine for the last year, and still work in Mac OSX, as well as any other device I try to
 pair them with. &nbsp;However, it seems Windows just doesn't recognize bluetooth devices anymore, and I can't find said "Bluetooth Devices" in control panel. &nbsp;Also, there hasn't been any recent Apple Updates. The issue started for me immediately after the last
 Windows Update my computer performed.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The recent KB updates that were installed are listed here (see screenshot of recent update history):&nbsp;https://www.dropbox.com/s/y20g2317v1ner65/updateHistoryPostBluetoothProblems.png</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>EDIT #2: Well guys, after over a month of troubleshooting, I found out this whole thing was a motioninjoy conflict, possibly triggered by a windows update. &nbsp;I was using motioninjoy drivers for using my PS3 controller with PC for gaming.... turns out motioninjoy
 was the culprit. &nbsp;I uninstalled/deleted motioninjoy through Device Manager, then rebooted PC. &nbsp;My bluetooth radio was now visible again, but I still had problems connecting my keyboard. &nbsp;I then opened services.msc and restarted the Bluetooth service. &nbsp;After
 doing these things, my Apple Wireless Bluetooth keyboard works great again in Windows 7! &nbsp;TL:DR... Don't use motioninjoy PS3 controller drivers! &nbsp;If you really want to use PS3 controller in Windows, I recommend using "XInput Wrapper" drivers instead.</div>
<div><br />

<h2>            Chinese version of Windows 7 OS rather than Chinese language pack on English OS</h2>
                    I want to install a traditional chinese version of Windows 7 as opposed to installing an English version then using the traditional Chinese language pack. How do I do this?

            To whom it may concern:<br />
<br />
If you want to wind up with a Traditional Chinese language on top of what I call a "native" version of Chinese, you must first install from the "<span>Windows 7 Enterprise with Service Pack 1 (x86) - DVD (Chinese-Simplified)</span>".&nbsp; I found this on the MSDN
 subscription site.&nbsp; You must then use Microsoft Update to download and install the Language Pack for Traditional Chinese.<br />
<br />
If you are like me (and can't speak or read Chinese), then you might try doing a parallel installation of the English version so you can tell what the dialogs are asking etc.&nbsp; I did this side by side on two VMware Virtual Machines, and that seemed to work pretty
 good.<br />
<br />
Good luck.&nbsp; Thanks, Andre, for lending a hand.<br />

    <title>Encryption with Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> juliagoodfellow-smith  say:</h3>
<h2>            Encryption with Windows 10</h2>
                    I used to have Windows 10 on my machine with Bitlocker, having upgraded from Windows 8.1 Pro. I have had to rebuild my PC from factory settings, and need to re-instate Bitlocker. Now I have Windows 10, I believe from other posts that&nbsp;I need to upgrade
 this to Pro to be able to use Bitlocker&nbsp;- but having already paid for the Pro bit of Windows 8.1, can I somehow use that to upgrade Windows 10, or will I have to choose between either downgrading back to 8.1Pro vs paying (again) for the upgrade to Pro, but
 this time for Windows 10?

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern in Microsoft community and welcome to the Windows 10 Family.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the description provided, I understand that you want to use the Bitlocker feature in Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before we proceed further, have a look at the upgrade matrix for Windows 10.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>To be able to assist you better, provide us a few more details on the below questions.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello. As you can see from my previous note, I did not upgrade from another operating system - my support people had to rebuild my computer from factory settings and uploaded Windows 10. It seems that the edition is 'Windows 10 home'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I previously had Windows 10 Pro - my computer was initially supplied with Windows 8, which I paid to upgrade to 8.1 Pro. I then upgraded to Windows 10. The difficulty is the computer rebuild - I cannot find any record of previous Pro upgrade. Obviously I
 don't want to have to pay for it again, but I do still need encryption.</p>

            <p>I have a different question.&nbsp; My Surface Pro 3 running Windows 10 Home had the device encryption turned on when it was still on Windows 8.1 prior to the upgrade to Windows 10 Home.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>I want to know did it...</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) keep the Device Encryption turned on when upgraded and </p>
<p>
</p><p>2) does the Device Encryption stay on if a factory reset is done? <em>(Did a factory reset about 3 months ago)</em></p>

            <p>The first thing I would recommend doing is cropping off as much of the photo that is not essential as possible - you can use the Windows 7 built in Paint program do that. Resizing the photo is another option available. Please see:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Using-Paint#section_5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Using-Paint#section_5</a>&nbsp;.</p>
<p>Secondly you can compress the file. You do not say what format the photo is in but if you convert it to a compressable file format such as .JPG you can reduce the size. Again Paint can import several types of photo format then save them as JPGs. However,
 Paint does not allow you to set the compresssion ratio so that you can choose how much you want to compress the file - you will need a 3rd party photo-editor to do that. You should know that .JPG compression is a lossy form of compression which means that
 the quality of the photo is reduced the more you compress it.</p>
<p>8MB is fairly large for a typical photo - you may want to consider reducing the quality setting in the camera so that your photos are all smaller in size to start with. Also avoid using RAW formats which produce larger file sizes.</p>

            <p>Hi Brian456,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you wish to permanently delete a deleted message, then you just need to go to the settings options. Kindly follow the steps below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1. Login to your Hotmail acocunt.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Go to your inbox.</span><span><br />
3. Click on <strong><span>Options </span></strong>found on the upper-right corner of the page (just under your name), and then select
<strong><span>More options</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Under "Customizing Hotmail", click on <strong>Advanced privacy settings</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>5. Under "Deleted messages", tick the last option which states "<span>Don't let me recover deleted messagesâ€”once they leave the Deleted folder, don't give me a link to get them back."</span>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you!</span></p>

<br />
There's no option in Windows Live Mail to permantely delete emails, you have to do it manually.<br />
<br />
You can also ask assistance to your email provider.<br />
<br />
Thanks</p>

<h2>            Program is &#34;incompatible&#34;.. used to work before</h2>
                    i had a program installed on my windows 7 computer , called vSide. it is a virtual&nbsp;world game&nbsp;that uses graphics and all. it used to work fine about half a year ago and now all of a sudden it does not. i installed it&nbsp; but when i try to open it says "compatible
 device not found . please update your graphics or devices, etc.", so i updated everything and windows is telling me everything is up to date. i went on the vSide website and it is saying this happens to people and they told me how to fix it but it still isnt
 working. i looked into the application's details and it says problem detected: its environment&nbsp;is "incompatible." i tried fixing the problem (by switching to windows xp, vista, etc) and it still didnt work. vSide is only compatible with windows XP but it still
 doesn't work with that. well it says "windows XP (pack 2)" and "windows XP (pack 1)" is that different from plain windows xp or something? anywya, i dont know what to do.

<h2>            Audio Recording Problem. Microphone not working</h2>
                    My audio recording software is not functioning properly. I talk to friends over Skype and TeamSpeak 3 almost everyday but today my microphone was not picking up my voice unless I put the mic basically in my mouth, and even then it was very quiet. I have
 multiple microphones, so at first I assumed that it was the one I was using, so I tried a different one, and the the same thing happen, the microphone was not picking up my voice. I also checked to see if it was just the port that I was using, and it wasn't
 both the front and back ports did the same thing. What should I do?

    <title>Xbox 360 Wired Controller, Windows 7 Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> deadbloke117  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox 360 Wired Controller, Windows 7 Problem</h2>
                    I'm attempting to connect an offical Xbox 360 controller to my PC, so as to allow me to play PC game with it.&nbsp; The operating system I'm currently running is Windows 7 64-bit<br />
<br />
I've followed the online help to do this, downloading and installing the file <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/6/9/4/69446ACF-E625-4CCF-8F56-58B589934CD3/Xbox360_64Eng.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox 360 Accessories Software 1.2 64-bit for Windows 7</a> (from http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/download/DownloadResult.aspx?category=Gaming&amp;type=Gaming&amp;name=C8G-00004&amp;os=Win7_64&amp;lang=en)
<br />
<br />
When I plug in the controller using the Play and Charge kit, it registers the controller is there in Control Panel/Hardware and Software/Devices and Printers under Unspecific, but not in the Microsoft 360 Assessories Status or the Game controllers section of
 the control panel.<br />
<br />
What am I doing wrong, and how can I fix it?<br />
Thank you in advance<br />

    <title>Trouble Reinstalling Update Rollup 2 for Windows XP Media Center - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Trouble Reinstalling Update Rollup 2 for Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005</h2>
                    <div>
I am having problems with MCE 2005.&nbsp; My harddrive crashed and the technician that restored my systme said he could not get MCE 2005 working.&nbsp; it is unfortunate because it was working before the harddrive crashed.&nbsp; I am working with windows XP.</div>
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
When I go to setup the internet and start testing the connection it gives me "Critical Process Error - Code 2"</div>
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
When I go to setup the TV, it tells me "Tuner not found".&nbsp; Even though I know it works because I also have Win TV7 from Hauppauge. My TV tuner is HVR-1600.</div>
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
With these problems I thought the solution would be reinstalling rollup 2 as per the note from Microsoft.</div>
<div>
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/910905</div>
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
However, when I go to reinstalling rollup 2, it seems to be establishing a restoring point and then it stops when it hits Hotfix (KB891593).</div>
<div>
I took a copy of the mcelog and have attached a copy of the log below.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Any help or direction you can provide me to resolve this problem would be very much appreciated.</div>
<div>
At this point, I am a beginner at this and I do not have a clue as to what is causing my problems and any insights you might have for me would be very much appreciated.<br />
</div>

<h2>            Weird grinding noise on new 360S &#40;and strange warranty&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Heya everyone,</p>
<p>on 15 June 2013 (so about 2 weeks ago) I bought a brand new 360S - the Star Wars Kinect LE bundle pack. It was working fine, until yesterday I noticed a weird grinding noise whenever a disc slows down in the drive. It's a short buzz that sounds much like
 an old floppy drive. I notice it makes this sound right before it ejects a disc, but also when I'm in at the dashboard for an extended period of time without using the console, when the disc slows down when I'm playing an installed game (the game boots, then
 the disc spins for a while before it comes to a stop in the drive, which takes about 2 or 3 minutes), and at random during gameplay when I'm playing games that aren't installed on the HDD (I think there, too, it has something to do with disc-speed, as I heard
 it most clearly when I was playing Guitar Hero and the game had to load data from the disc, so it spun up the disc again and then when it slowed down, there was the buzz). The noise is quite loud - I can hear it through the sounds of the game I'm playing.</p>
<p>Why is my 360 making that sound? Will it damage my discs? Is it bad for the drive? Should I send it in for repairs?</p>
<p>Fun fact: when I entered the serial number on the Microsoft website to register it, the website stated that the warranty on the Kinect sensor that came in the bundle had already run out and that I only have one year left on the console itself - even though
 A) local law states I have 2 years of warranty from the day of purchase and B) it came as a bundle, and thus should have the same period of warranty (as per Microsoft's own statements on the website).</p>

<p>It is probably the laser reading the disc, just extremely fast. The tattling is the disc spinning, the loud hum you hear is the processor / CPU. Probably nothing to worry about too seriously. Installing the game to your HDD may fix the problem, and I'd also
 reccomend laying your console flat if you have it standing up. You may want to give Xbox Support a call to find out more about the warranty though. (1800-4MY-XBOX). Let me know if any of this helped.</p>

<p>The console is already lying flat, there's no room next to the TV so I put it on a shelf underneath. :-P The sound that I hear doesn't come from the CPU, as I can hear the disc drive's active when I hear the noise. I'll try and upload a video to YouTube
 and link to that here later today. It's also not the laser reading the disc, because it occurs when the console stops loading data, not when it starts loading data.</p>
<p>Installing games doesn't change anything, as the disc will still spin up to be recognised by the console and then slows down again, resulting in the noise. I've tried DVDs and CDs now as well, as soon as the drive has to stop the disc, it starts buzzing.
 Sounds like the worm motor to me. Also, it's not a very practical way for me to play - I've got 53 disc based 360 games, no way I can install all of them...</p>
<p>EDIT: regarding the warranty - I bought it in a store, with cash, so no credit card involved. ;-) Dutch and European law both prescribe a 2 year warranty from the date of purchase, so I'll have to call Microsoft about that. Especially weird that my Kinect
 sensor and console have different warranty expiration dates, because they came in a bundle and thus should have the same warranty period anyway - in the worst case scenario, my Kinect sensor's warranty should be extended to June 2014 to match the console's
 warranty.</p>

<p>UPDATE: I contacted Microsoft. They were really accommodating about the whole thing. Here's what happened.</p>
<p>Apparently, the Star Wars bundle was produced in 2011/2012, and bought by retailers in bulk. That means that sometimes, a pallet of bundles is lost somewhere and then found some time later. Normally when consoles are shipped to stores, Microsoft assumes
 they will be sold within 3 months, so the warranty 'starts' 3 months after the retailer gets the shipment. In my case, that means that the console was shipped to the retailer in March 2012 and just spent a really long time on the shelf. It gets weirder, because
 the console's DoM even states that it was made in 2011! Were these R2D2-themed consoles not popular or something? :-P Anyway, they sent me an email with details on how to get the receipt to them, so they can change the warranty for me - just scanned it and
 sent it to them, so it should be fine.</p>
<p>The disc drive problem probably stems from the laser being out of alignment. Once the console has stopped reading the disc, it pushes the laser back to its standard position. Either the worm motor is misaligned, or it is trying to push the laser further
 back than the maximum. I demonstrated it while on the phone. My problem seemed new to the guy, he'd never heard of a 360 making that noise, but he recognised that it was a problem as there is a risk the laser might break. Especially because I only got it 2
 weeks ago and because it's a special edition, it's going to be shipped to Microsoft rather than returned to the shop. UPS ticket is now in my inbox, going to ship it on Monday if everything goes well.</p>

            Hi Elmer.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) Update your drivers from the PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />2) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />3) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
