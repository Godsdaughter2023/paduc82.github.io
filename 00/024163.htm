    <title>AD Users with mailboxes on third-party on-premise mail server - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            AD Users with mailboxes on third-party on-premise mail server</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just recently implemented a hybrid environment without Exchange on-premise (I use MailEnable software). About 25% of my users have O365 mailboxes and others have MailEnable mailboxes. I have quite a few distribution groups that have users from both systems
 as well as external contacts. I can email external contacts (they all have email addresses in mail field), MailEnable users and receive emails from them. However, my MailEnable users don't receive emails sent to AD Distribution or Security groups they're part
 of. I tried to add SMTP:*** Email address is removed for privacy *** to their proxyAddresses and *** Email address is removed for privacy *** targetAddress attributes, still no luck. I'm getting the following bounceback error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Delivery has failed to these recipients or groups:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Firstname

<p>
</p><p>I can probably workaround this issue by creating contacts for all my users who are not in O365, but I was wondering if there is a better and easier approach.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

            Hi Alex,<br />
<br />
Generally, for the hybrid environment, we recommend you have at least one on-premise Exchange server to manage exchange attributes. Admins can also move mailboxes to cloud or leave them on-premise. Now, you don’t have any on-premise Exchange servers. Meantime,
 based on the error message, the recipient’s primary SMTP address is missing. It may be related to your configurations. To better help you, I’d like to collect the following information:<br />
<br />
1.<span> </span>About “mailEnable software”, do you use any third party tool to enable the mailboxes?<br />
2.<span> </span>Since you don’t have any on-premise Exchange servers, you cannot have mailboxes. And only 25% mailboxes are moved to cloud, you should move all mailboxes to cloud.&nbsp;<br />
3.<span> </span>Do you have any special requirements about why not move all mailboxes to cloud?<br />
4.<span> </span>Can you provide the full non-delivery report to let us check? To protect your privacy, I have sent you a private message to collect them. Please click on the link below to access your Private
 Message:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox</a><br />
<br />
5.<span> </span>When you mentioned “I can probably workaround this issue by creating contacts for all my users who are not in O365”, did you mean that the mail flow would work well after creating mail contacts
 in cloud? If not, please let me know the details.<br />
<br />

<p><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>About “mailEnable software”, do you use any third party tool to enable the mailboxes?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>No, I can either provision them beforehand using MailEnable software (</strong></span>http: // mailenable.com/)&nbsp;<span><strong>which uses LDAP to authenticate users or there is
 an option for mailboxes to be automatically provisioned when users login the very first time.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Since you don’t have any on-premise Exchange servers, you cannot have mailboxes. And only 25% mailboxes are moved to cloud, you should move all
 mailboxes to cloud.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>You mean I can't have mailboxes in Exchange Online? I understand that hence I use third-party mail server. I won't be moving all mailboxes to the cloud due to the cost factor and moreover those 75% of the users
 don't require any O365 functionality&nbsp;besides ability to send-receive&nbsp;emails.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Do you have any special requirements about why not move all mailboxes to cloud?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Answered in 2. Basically, cost is the main reason.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>5.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>When you mentioned “I can probably workaround this issue by creating contacts for all my users who are not in O365”, did you mean that the mail
 flow would work well after creating mail contacts in cloud? If not, please let me know the details.</span><span><strong>Yes, if I create contacts in AD with any valid email address in "mail" attribute, they
 will receive messages sent to AD distribution groups they're members of.</strong></span></p>

<p>This might not be a specific reply to your question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also noted your issue on costs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pop3 Email has been around since 1998. That's 30 years. Also most collaboration is happening outside of email nowadays, thanks to the smartphone. Yet 30 years later we are still pulling hairs on how to save money on a 30 year old communication platform.&nbsp;
 From what I notice, If the company doesn't provide these modern collaboration tools, users likely would use what they can get on the phone for free anyway. This introduces shadow IT and the issues that come with it. Namely no admin oversight, no ownership
 of accounts, no ownership of data, and no control of how information is being used and shared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office365 is more than just a email engine. It is also a platform that allows modern communication / collaboration that is safe, secure and supposedly hassle free. Its many apps does the job of what users use from free socially eg Teams-&gt; Whatsapp,&nbsp; OD4B
 -&gt; Dropbox, Yammer-&gt; Facebook, Planner -&gt;Trello, Teams-&gt; Slack..etc</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rather than deal with the specific scenario that you have now that is complicated and may not work very well, perhaps considering petitioning management to go full Office365?</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the cost aspect, perhaps use the justification for complexity and productivity gains? A Business Essential license is only USD5 per user per month, cheaper if you possess good negotiation skills and right timing.&nbsp; Even where I come from where labour costs
 are cheap, its less than 1% of payroll, and I am sure your company can figure out productivity gains of more than 1% with what a business essential license brings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That might be an out of the box way of solving your problem. Hope it helps.</p>

<p><span>Hi Alex,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your detailed information.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Based on your reply, I understand that you use the third party on-premise Exchange mail server and the MailEnable software. Since they are third party tools, they are not supported in our forum.
 Your understanding is highly appreciated. If this is your situation, we don’t have any official documents to set up Hybrid between Office 365 and third-party Exchange mail servers. We recommend you move all mailboxes to Office 365 cloud. Of course, I definitely
 understand that you need to consider many other factors, such as cost.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Did you run HCW (Hybrid Configuration Wizard) to set up Hybrid environment? About the question 2, you can have mailboxes in Exchange online. Since you mentioned that you don’t have any on-premise
 Exchange servers, you couldn’t have on-premise mailboxes. However, I assume that you still use the third-party on-premise Exchange servers. Is it right?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Given the situation, we suggest that you can still use the workaround you mentioned before. In the future, if possible, we still recommend you move all mailboxes to Office 365 cloud. If you
 have any concerns about it, please feel free to let me know.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>@Vincent, thanks for your sharing.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Best Regards,</span></p>
<p><span>Erick</span></p>

<p>Hey Vincent,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply. I specifically mentioned which third-party I use and provided the link above - it supports all modern communication protocols and tools such as IMAP, ActiveSync, Calendars, Contacts, webmail, etc. However, none of those things are
 needed for my users who don't have O365 licenses. They need to be able to receive emails from management with some company wide information or documents pertaining to their departments and barely send any emails due to their primary job functions. I could
 justify switching everyone to O365 licenses but it would simply be a waste.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>@Eric Chu MSFT</p>
<p>Let me give you another example. We have a vendor who has an AD account to access Remote Desktop to troubleshoot some software. That vendor's email (his company's email) needs to be included in AD Distribution group to receive alerts about that software.
 Why would I need to assign O365 license to that vendor if:</p>
<p>1) He has his own company's assigned email address</p>
<p>2) He only logs in to Remote Desktop every once in a while to tweak or troubleshoot his software</p>
<p>3) He only needs to receive alerts/notifications sent to AD distribution group and no direct emails</p>
        </p>

<p><span>Hi Alex,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Yes, I understand your example and it is correct. The users don’t need licenses and they just receive some emails from AD group. Actually, if the situation is in the pure Office 365 cloud,
 you can help the users to create mail users or mail contacts and add them to the members of the distribution groups. After that, they can receive emails from the groups when using external email accounts. Therefore, given the situation, you can still use the
 workaround. It is the better way for your situation. Thanks for your understanding.</span></p>

<h2>            How many times can you install Microsoft Office 2007 Ultimate&#63;</h2>
                    Greetings,<br />
<br />
I'm a student looking to purchase the "ultimate steal" discounted Microsoft Office 2007. Before I buy, though, I wanted to know how many machines I can install this on. I have a laptop I often take to class and a desktop at home, and I'd like to install it
 on both machines. I've heard somewhere that Microsoft allows for up to three installs, but I can't find any documentation as to whether that's true or not. Can someone fill me in on this?<br />
<br />
Thank you very much.

            <p>the solution they recommend is not suitable at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no workaround I can see to this, other than sending a completely new meeting request to the additional people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You also can not see who has accepted or declined a request.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Office 365 for Mac is quite poor with meeting functionality.</p>

            <p>After reading all the posts on this, there does not appear to be a solution to sending an invite to an existing meeting without sending to all attendees...this is available on the Windows version but doesnt appear as an option on the Mac version (of Outlook).&nbsp;</p>
<p>As one of the posts indicated, it may be related to the use of Webex which is how many of my meetings are scheduled. Perhaps Webex (Cisco) can look into this feature request and fix?</p>

<h2>            Recover previous edit on Word Online</h2>
                    <p>I was writing a speech on word online and tried to download it. On doing so it said the custom error module does not recognise this error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The version i had been editing had been lost and went back to a previous version of the speech. It says that everytime i type in word online it is autosaving?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure where it is saving to and whether or not i can recover the edited version that i had written before the crash?</p>

<p>Word Online documents can only automatically save in OneDrive. If in case that you can’t find the documents in OneDrive, it means the document wasn’t saved properly. Recovering documents or files from Office Online is a great idea. Of course, we don't want
 this idea to go to waste. As such, we strongly believe that this needs to be heard in our

            <p>Hello chin007,<br />
<br />
Thanks for visiting the Answers forum.<br />
</p>
<p>With regard to your inquiry about how to properly create/set a ringtone for Windows&nbsp;Phone 7 devices, please ensure that you are following these metrics:<br />
<br />
You can use your own ringtones so you can match your jingle to your mood, or match just the right tune to your contacts. Just make sure the audio file is:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In MP3 or WMA format. </strong></li><li><strong>Less than 40 seconds. </strong></li><li><strong>Less than 1 MB. </strong></li><li><strong>Not protected with digital rights management (DRM).</strong> </li></ul>
<p>To make any file that fits these criteria into a ringtone, all you have to do is assign it the genre of
<span><strong>ringtone</strong></span>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please take a look at this article which explains the process: <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/How-to/wp7/start/create-ringtones" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            It's easily done with a little function such as that which Hans posted, but your question sets my relational antennae twitching.&nbsp; What attributes do these three date columns represent?&nbsp; If they are in fact three values of the same attribute then the table
 is not normalized to First Normal Form (1NF), whose definition is:<br />
<br />
First Normal Form: A relvar is in 1NF if and only if, in every legal value of that relvar, every tuple contains exactly one value for each attribute.<br />
<br />
Loosely speaking, in the language of the relational model, a <em>relvar </em>(relation variable) equates to a table, and a
<em>tuple </em>to a row (record).<br />
<br />
By normalizing such a table by decomposition into two related tables the latest date which relates to each&nbsp; row in the referenced table can then be easily returned by means of the MAX aggregation operator.<br />

            <p>Hi Ken,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't pretend I understand everything you say here (it's like another language!), but I can explain a little about how the three fields are used.&nbsp; I am using Access to track an multi-step application review and approval process that involves multiple internal
 departments. The first date is the original application submisssion date, and every record has this field completed.&nbsp; The second and third dates are resubmission dates if the application was denied at 1 or 2 points along the process, and then resubmitted.&nbsp;
 Not all records have a date in these either or both of these fields.&nbsp; I wanted to track the average processing time from the last date an application was submitted until it was approved, and to do so I needed a way to return the latest of all three dates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this makes sense!&nbsp; And thanks for taking the time to respond to my original post!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p />

            Your description of the underlying reality confirms what I suspected to be the case.&nbsp; A relational database models the reality in terms of its entity types and the relationships between them.&nbsp; Each entity type is modelled by a table and the attributes
 of the entity types are modelled by columns in the tables.&nbsp; The entity types need not be physical ones, and are in many cases abstract.&nbsp; A relationship type is in fact an entity type, merely one of a special kind.<br />
<br />
If this sounds like a foreign language, that's because it is in some respects.&nbsp; Like all disciplines relational database design has a vocabulary of its own.&nbsp; I try to use as plain English as possible here, but without dumbing it down to a level where its meaning
 is lost. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
What you have in essence is a many-to-many relationship type between applications and submissions, so this should be modelled by Applications and Submissions tables in which the latter has a foreign key column which references the primary key of the former.&nbsp;
 The Submissions table will have columns which represent the attributes of each submission, the date being one, but which will probably also include a column to indicate the success or failure of the submission.&nbsp; You will know better than I what other attributes
 each submission can have.<br />
<br />
With a correctly normalized design like this aggregation operations become set operations by means of queries. In your case there is firstly the MIN and MAX operations over the subsets of submissions to get the first and latest dates per application, and then
 an AVG operation over the complete set of applications to get the average duration between the first and latest dates per application.<br />
<br />
What you have at the moment is really more akin to a spreadsheet than a relational database table.&nbsp; In fact some of my colleagues here have been known to refer to this type of design as
<em>'committing spreadsheet'</em>.&nbsp; As you've seen you can often get the data to confess if you torture it for long enough, but that does not hide the fact that it's poorly structured data.<br />
<br />
I hope I haven't left you in too much need of an interpreter, but good relational database design really is a question of following the advice given by Richard Feynman to his students in the quote below my signature.<br />

<h2>            PowerPoint 2011 for MAC Suddenly stopped me inserting audio files - no longer enables them. Offers MOVIE files instead.</h2>
                    I have inserted several short WAV audio files into my presentation. Suddenly I am unable to add any audio files into any presentations. It automatically switches to enable MOVIE or ALL files, not AUDIO files. i try to insert Audio file through ALL FILES
 and it no longer loads. I open new presentation and same thing happens. MAC 2011.

            Reinstalling may help, but if there is a problem with a preference file, reinstalling won't change a thing because the preference files will be unaffected.

    <title>OneNote file size problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> henryching  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote file size problems</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am new to OneNote and like the concept.&nbsp; I thought I will save a lot of printing.&nbsp; So I have loaded a number of PDF files into my notebook, using the "Printout" feature so that I can take notes in them.&nbsp; However, I am having problems with the file size.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently backed up my note to an SD card and it took up about 30GB of space. I have loaded about 10-15 PDF files which have an average page number of about 60.&nbsp; Most of the content in the PDF is in text.&nbsp; As I am writing, I am loading another 100 page
 PDF (of mostly text, 6mb file size) into my notebook, and the available space of my hard disk has so far reduced by about 7GB already.&nbsp; So that's about 70mb per page.&nbsp; How is it possible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have OneNote on a Surface Pro 1 and as you know, it has very limited space.&nbsp; I am quite concern if I can rely on OneNote to do what I need.&nbsp; Am I doing this wrong?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Henry</p>

            <p>Hi WebsterBoyd,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the message.&nbsp; I have tried the "Optimize all my files" button a few times.&nbsp; I have only gotten it to complete once.&nbsp; I have left it run overnight yesterday but it was still running this morning, and in fact it appeared to have spent most of its
 time being idle based on Task Manager.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>In the one time it was completed, my notebook size was reduced by a couple of GBs, but it's still well over 30GB in total. It's GB, not MB.&nbsp; I am surprised that no one seems to have a similar file&nbsp;size issue, and I felt my usage is fairly typical.&nbsp; Am at
 a loss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Henry</p>

    <title>just reset N95 8GB with a code - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            just reset N95 8GB with a code</h2>
                    I found this code (*#7370#) on internet so I did reset my 8gb. As some users said on this website, after resetting I must do sync with PC suite then I can play all music files, videos and games same as before. (ex. I saw one guy lost fifa and asphalt games
 after resetting). without the sync with old backup datas, I won't play all of them cuz I would lose all licenses in my phone comes from factory. but with some reasons, my phone works just like b4. why wasn't that happened on my phone??

The fact is before the hard reset use the PC Suit, select the back up option and then backup C Drive data such as contacts, messages etc to your PC/MM Card.

Is that a question?<br />
No particular event/occasion/reason. If you see a MINOR fault with the regular activities of system app like display doesnt set the brightness as it should for example then you need it.<br />
We PARTICULARLY do hard reset when our phones hangs/restarts frequently.

            On the topic, the reason you didn't loose your content is because you backed up your device using PC Suite.<br />
<br />
When you restore the PC Suite Back UP you restored the licences for the games and videos/movies.<br />
<br />
If you hadn't restored using PC Suite Back Up then you would have lost them.

If I do a hard reset, will I need any PIN and/or PUK code to start it again?<br />

Which file contains the license for my Spider Man 3? I do not wish to use backup/restore since it may restore too much, so I ONLY copy the individual files I really need...

<h2>            Outlook mobile - Android - Meeting Notifications</h2>
                    <p>I have Outlook install on an Android device. &nbsp;I also use it in office on the PC. &nbsp;When I am in the office, I only need meeting notifications 15 minutes prior to a meeting. &nbsp;On the phone, I need them 1 hour prior to the meeting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I set them on the phone to be 1 hour prior, while keeping them at 15 minutes on the PC in the office?</p>

            <p>Hi Joe,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We regret to inform you that if you are&nbsp;connected to the internet, Outlook.com app will automatically sync all your events, therefore, any changes made to the application will reflect the other applications&nbsp;in which you might have synced your&nbsp;Microsoft account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, you may try changing the event in Offline mode i.e. while not connecting to the internet&nbsp;and check if&nbsp;it helps you as a workaround.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps. Please respond if you have further related queries.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Jesinta Rozario</p>

            Perhaps MS should realize that people use different devices in different ways, i.e. phone vs PC. &nbsp;When I am home, I'd like to be reminded to leave early by my phone to get to meetings in the morning. &nbsp;But while at work I only need 15 minutes notice from
 my work PC to prepare. &nbsp;Ugh.

<h2>            Word docs that I send via Outlook 2016 cannot be opened</h2>
                    <p>Here's exactly what happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Surface Pro 3 that I got with Windows 8 on it. I had Office 2013 (365 version). Everything worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few weeks back, I upgraded to Windows 10. Everything still worked fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two days ago, I upgraded to Office 2016. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, if I write a brand new doc in Word OR even just edit another one and then save it, and then send via Outlook 2016 to anyone, they cannot open the doc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It says "We're sorry. We can't open xxx.doc because we found a problem with its contents." If I hit details, it just says it is corrupt. If I tell it to recover the doc, it eventually gives up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, to be clear, if I use a web-browser version of my email to send the same doc, it gets to the destination fine and it can be opened. So part of this has to be Outlook 2016. At the same time, if I just take an old doc that I haven't opened in Word 2016
 and forward it to someone, they can still open that doc. So it is only docs that were created or edited/saved in Word 2016 that I cannot then successfully send to anyone via Outlook 2016.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did find this article and tried both options suggested, but neither worked:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.outlook-tips.net/tips/email-attachments-wont-open-after-upgrading-to-windows-10/</p>
<p>
</p><p>It should be noted though that I upgraded to Windows 10 FIRST and there were no issues. The problem started when I upgraded to Office 2016. HELP!!!! Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Thanks for checking in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I have sent to almost 20 different people that use different versions of Outlook, Thunderbird, and even just GMail (like in a web browser). What they have doesn't change the outcome, the file can't be previewed or opened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I did not because I wouldn't have thought any setting that would be so key would have changed when upgrading from 2013 to 2016. I will try, although please tell me how in case I can't figure it out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) I had not done that, so I just did. In my Sent Item folder, they will not open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Sorry, I looked up Protected View. Yes, I was on the phone with Microsoft support. They had me uncheck all three protected view options on my machine and restart. That did not fix, so yes, I did your question 2.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason that I am posting on this forum is that three times I was on the phone with Microsoft support, and three times, I was disconnected at some point in them trying to help. The first person did the protected view thing and the quick repair and then
 suddenly I got a dial tone. The other two, we barely got anywhere. I got tired of it so I'm posting instead.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I have the exact same problem. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To item #3, I cannot open the attachments in my Sent folder. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the error message:</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>The only commonality that I've seen so far is that all of the docs that fail to open by the recipient, or in my Sent file have the same size (regardless of the original doc's size) of 38KB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>If you restart the PC, then start outlook using the safe switch (Hold the Ctrl Key when starting OL) then a new msg, to yourself with a 2016 word attachment, when received can that attachment be opened?

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I also have the same problem as mentioned above after upgrading to office 2016 on windows 10. earlier I used win 10 + office 2013 &amp; everything worked for fine. the drag &amp; drop option suggested did not work for me.</p>
<p>office 2016 sucks. I think I have to go back to office 2013.</p>
<p>if anyone has any new fix , pls post it here.</p>

    <title>Tabs Freaking out in IE - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dragonfly68  say:</h3>
<h2>            Tabs Freaking out in IE</h2>
                    Sometimes when I have 2 or more tabs open the new tab will 'freak' out. It won't load it the tab header just flips constantly from IE symbol to searching and the bottom will constantly flip from done to the url. It's fast, constant flipping and the whole
 browser freezes up.&nbsp; Trying to close the browser is almost impossible. You can try and click close on the tab and the X in the right corner, but it can take up to 5 minutes to react. Most times you have to go to task manager to stop it.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Help would REALLY be appreciated. <br />
Thanks.

            Hello,<br />
<br />
I would suggest trying two different things to try and solve this problem.<br />
<br />
Firstly, lets do a complete virus scan (using your tools of choice) as well as a full malware scan (using
<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
malwarebytes</a> ). This will check your machine doesn't have any nasty software installed on it.<br />
<br />
Next, can you try opening Internet Explorer without any third part add ons (start --&gt; all programs --&gt; accessories --&gt; system tools --&gt; Internet Explorer (no add ons)), as you may have a faulty third party add on causing this type of error.<br />
<br />
Looking forward to your responses.

            Hi! <br />
<br />
Well, I ran a malware scan, removed a bunch of adware stuff (how did that get through my securitycenter, grrr!), ran a virus scan (no viruses) and checked the IE options.&nbsp; I was already running it with no add-ons.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Did everything except the malware Thursday, at first it was fine but yesterday is started up again so I ran the malware. So far it's been running good, but I haven't really had much time to be on the computer.&nbsp; Keep your fingers crossed. :)&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
On another forum someone had mentioned that they had heard that several people were having this same problem, I wonder what's causing it?<br />
<br />
Anywho, thank you for your help, very apperciated. :)

<p>Here are a couple things to check.&nbsp; First, if you have a <strong>Coming Soon</strong> switch showing in the upper right of the
<strong>Home </strong>tab window, make sure this is set to OFF, the spacing increases when its turned on</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4430c088-9a58-45c8-b3b2-6f0457aec5bf?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4430c088-9a58-45c8-b3b2-6f0457aec5bf?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't have this switch, please check your <strong>View </strong>tab for a button labeled
<strong>Use Tighter Spacing.</strong>&nbsp; If you find this button, click it to turn it ON:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e33bd07a-4008-4e73-8f1f-d20cb58d143d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e33bd07a-4008-4e73-8f1f-d20cb58d143d?upload=true" /></a></p>

<h3> ermali17  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia Lumia 900 can&#39;t play embedded youtube videos</h2>
                    I uninstalled the microsoft YouTube 1.0 app a couple of days ago because I downloaded the 2.0 version. It was a little strange because it didn't come as an update but as another app. Anyway, now I can't play embedded YouTube videos. Everytime I try, it
 asks me to download the YouTube 1.0 app but when it takes me to the marketplace the app os not available anymore for my device.<br />
Anyone having the same problem? How can I solve this? Do I need to reset my phone?

            I can view youtube videos from the youtube website. The problem is that I can't open them when they're in other websites, like for example, gsmarena.com or others. I mean, when i just want to look at a video quickly, without having to search for it on
 youtube.

            <p>Hello ermali17:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to the forum regarding the issue you are having accessing embedded YouTube videos.&nbsp; If accessing these videos requires a version of the app you cannot get for your phone, this may not be able to be resolved.&nbsp; I do have a couple things
 for you to try though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first thing I would like you to do is check the current website preference.&nbsp; You can adjust this by tapping settings &gt; applications &gt; Internet Explorer &gt; change the current preference from mobile to desktop or visa versa.&nbsp; While you are here, make sure
 that allow cookies is checked and delete your history.&nbsp; After you make these changes, restart the phone and try to access these embedded files again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We would also like you to explore and notate your experience from other locations.&nbsp; If you use Facebook, you will often times find YouTube videos.&nbsp; Let us know if you are able to find any sites that embed YouTube videos which work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would also suggest you try to install some additional YouTube applications from the marketplace.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We would also like to gather the following details:</p>
<ul>
<li>Current OS version on the phone, tap settings &gt; about &gt; more info.</li><li>Firmware version running on your phone.&nbsp; You will find this in the same location as the information above.</li><li>What other sites did you try accessing embedded videos from?</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let us know if any progress is made, I will continue to look into this myself to see if any new&nbsp;information is found.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let us know if you have any other questions or concerns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark W.&nbsp; </p>

<div>Thank you for answering. I did the browser procedure a couple of times, but still nothing. Another site that I tried is phonedog.com, which still doesn't work (I'm trying both mobile and desktop versions of the pages).</div>

<div>- Firmware: 2175.2905.8853.12440</div>
<div><br />
<div>Until now, except the YouTube website, I can't open the videos from anywhere else. I can open non-YouTube videos though.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Anyway, what if i reset my device? Do you think this would help? I</div>

<p>Thanks again. At least I won't have to reset my phone and loose the apps.</p>
<p>Anyway, today I found out that I could play normally&nbsp;the videos from "mynokiablog.com" website, but still nothing on the others. I was wondering though, what if I change the region of my account to an europian country, would I be able to download the YouTube
 app 1.0? Do you think this would help?</p>

<p>Thank you for the updated information.&nbsp; This may be very helpful in us determining what is at the root of this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to migrating your account region.&nbsp; I would suggest you do not do this.&nbsp; I am in the U.S. and have experienced the same issue as you with the referred sites.&nbsp; I also am unable to get the 1.0 version of this application.&nbsp; There are a couple reasons
 to avoid this:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you did change the region, a hard reset of the phone would be necessary for the changes to take effect on your phone.&nbsp; From our past discussion, this is something you are trying to avoid.</li><li>An account migration can cause issues with paid subscriptions and purchased apps.&nbsp; I would hate to see you try this and find it resolved nothing but did cause larger long-term issues with your account.</li></ol>
<p>If you have the opportunity or would to use another phone that could be hard reset, or you decide to hard reset the phone, you can create a test account in the European country of your choice and add that to the phone.&nbsp; This would at least allow you to avoid
 any issues with the account currently used on your phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let us know if there is anything else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark W.</p>

            Hello Mark,
<div><br />
I did the country/region change and it didn't require a reset of the phone because things have changed already. Almost everything works the same as before and I was able to download the bluetooth share app which I couldn't download earlier, but it still isn't
 possible to download the YouTube 1.0 app. Now, I think I may have made a mistake because I changed the country to Albania (which is my native country) and for the time being I think some of the features are not available for this country. For starters, the
 music recognition option from the bing search app is not there anymore, and the marketplace app quality is (to my opinion) a lot lower.</div>
<div>Given all of this, I am preparing for a reset of the phone. Do you think I should create for example a German or Italian e-mail account, and try to see what happens? Can this make a difference? Or should I just go ahead and reset the phone, and then wait
 for the 3 months to pass so I can change my region back to USA? What about the music recognition option from bing? Is it possible that I disabled it accidentally, or is it because of the region change? Also, I'm sorry if I'm asking too much questions, and
 I really appreciate your help and patience.</div>

    <title>I want my Skype account back - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sallymemole  say:</h3>
<h2>            I want my Skype account back</h2>
                    <p>Years ago I downloaded Skype. I was prompted by microsoft to send a code to a work email address that I no longer have. I don't remember what email address I used for my account. It must have been the old work email because filling in my most recent sent
 emails and subject lines did not help me get my skype account back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do know contact names that are in my skype account, but the didn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did purchase software from microsoft and I did purchase skype credits, however, I no longer bank at the companies nor do I have debit cards for the companies I used when I set up the account so I don't have that information.<br />
<br />
I can't get past the automated crap and I've used my 3 tries to get my skype back up and running. Someone help me please. This is awful.</p>

            This is the forum for testing newer builds of Windows 10 before being released to the public, as it isn't directly monitored by Microsoft, it is only monitored by users just like you (peer to peer), do you mean you contacted Microsoft by phone? as Preview
 doesn't have any direct support from Microsoft, you need to explain just what you have done as we have no way to look at your system.

<p>Lol I've been apart of the program for a while now, but someone was literally controlling my computer from Microsoft. You know with the shares assistant. I just haven't seen them do anything in a while&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm assuming that remote connection was authorized by you...if it was not, there might be a larger problem.&nbsp; I am fairly certain Microsoft support technicians do not arbitrarily initiate remote sessions.<br />

<h2>            Can&#39;t get my Hotmail account to work in Outlook anymore - Please help</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I had some send/receive problems with my Hotmail account used in Outlook 2010 so i decided to remove the account and try to set it up again to hopefully repair the problems. Anyway I've made it completely worse because now I can't add Hotmail at all, via
 the Connector or when I try to add the account manually it. It comes up with errors shown on screenshot.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ae5f916f-4b53-4dbb-8a1e-ce077518ba78" /></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I really need my Hotmail in my Outlook as I have used it for so long like this. So annoyed I can't just get it working. It seems to also ask for my hotmail password a lot and not recognise it although it's correct.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Hope someone can help me.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Regards,</div>
<div><br />

            Hello,
<div><br />
<div>Well I just want to add on the end of this problem (because i worked out the problem and fixed it last night).... so others can see.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I had a feeling my XBOX live accounts were causing problems because they are very connected really with it being windows live, Xbox live, Microsoft log ins, so I contacted Xbox and they suggested i turn OFF on my Microsoft profile, the 2 step security
 thing. So I did and my e-mail instantly works again.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So there you go.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Solved.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for reading, goodbye :-)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Caroline&nbsp;</div>
