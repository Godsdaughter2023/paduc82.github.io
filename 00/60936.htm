<h2>            Lenovo Flex 2-14D Freezing Before Going to Login</h2>
                    <p>Hi There,</p>
<p>I have a Lenovo Flex 2-14D and the labtop has been working fine until recently. The computer froze while using it and shutdown. Then, when rebooted, the computer went to the login/welcome screen and after logging in the computer would not fully prepare the
 desktop (taskbar would remain empty and other desktop items would not appear) and freeze. The compiter did this for a while until eventually it was functioning for a day however the next day the computer would freeze again. Now, the computer freezes before
 the login screen and at the moment the computer tried to update but due to freezing it was unable to complete. So it now when powered on says "We couldn't complete the updates Undoing changes Don't turn off your computer" and freezes. Now if the computer is
 left ruuning it will remain frozen till the battery dies. When booted up the same cycle repeats itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone is aware of any solution to this problem any assistance would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi Blake,<br />
<br />
It is possible that the freezing issue could be due to the programs that are running from the background. To properly isolate the issue, kindly answer the following queries:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What troubleshooting steps have you done to isolate the issue?</li><li>Have you checked if there are any errors on the Windows update?</li><li>Have you tried performing a <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Click here">clean boot</a></strong> to eliminate software conflicts?<br />
</li></ul>
<p><br />
We're looking forward to your response.</p>

    <title>Blue circle and task bar continually flickering with task manager - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> p lather  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blue circle and task bar continually flickering with task manager acting strange</h2>
                    <p>We have a HP laptop envy m6 operating on Windows 10</p>
<p>The blue circle next to the cursor continually flashes. (The blue circle is not spinning just flashing.) In task manager when you try to click on one process, it jumps around from one process to another, not staying where you want the cursor to stay. Even
 when no program/app is open the CPU usage goes from 13 to fifty two percent, the disk changes from nine to thirteen percent. We have been able to search for things and use the computer but we are annoyed at the task bar and blue circle continually flashing
 esp when watching a movie.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today neither the keyboard on laptop nor the cordless keyboard would allow me to enter a password into itunes (I assume it is related)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run Malwarebytes program and Norton 360 but no change.</p>
<p>Researching the problem on internet suggests that the simple pass program is to blame. We don't use that app nor can i find its settings anyhow here to turn it off/delete it as suggested by one online problem solver.</p>

<p>Hey smitty2k7,</p>
<p>Unfortunately I don't have any workarounds that may help to resolve this. When did this issue start, and have you previously been able to sign in to the Xbox App successfully?
</p>
<p>You can also try downloading the Beta version of the Xbox App (if you're using the standard version) and that may help to resolve the issue.
</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Why won&#39;t .flv files show as thumbnails&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have googled this problem extensively and still can't solve this. Yes, I have unchecked the box that says "show icons, never thumnails". I have downloaded several programs and codecs: xnview, icaros, ffdshow, k-lite codec pack. Nothing works.
</p>
<p>Is there any way to get these files to show as thumbnails? They did on my old computer. By the way photos show the thumnail with no problems. So do wmv and mp4 files. Just has a big&nbsp;problem with flv. Can anyone help? thanks</p>

            Well, as far as I know, you need a decoder (codec) pr a player that can play flv files. I use KMPlayer and Win7Codecs(althogh KMPlayer has it's own codecs I prefer to use) and .flv files show up as thumb.

            No, whatever player I use doesn't seem to matter. I just get the icon of that player instead of the thumbnail. Anything I'm still not doing right?

            <p>All I did was to set FLV files to be opened by KMPlayer and since I'm not using other player I cannot be sure.</p>
<p>But I do remember that CCCP codecs had an option to enable thumbs for less common formats like MKV &amp; FLV. Without that option I also didn't get the thumbs. That's why I assumed it had something to do with the codecs.</p>

<h2>            The Grumble indie supplement &#58; Taking unprofessional reviews to a new level</h2>
                    
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><br />
</span></b></p>
<p>Hello yes I’m back with another dose of indie games genre massacre that is the grumble indie supplement, the review where I shamelessly admit to barely playing most of the games and spend all of 9 minutes on the trial normally before passing a verdict where
 I either slam the bad, praise the good or just go meh.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>If you’re wondering why this issue is the first for a while its totally not because I’ve just sobered up from Valentine’s day and have found fresh victims........sorry I mean games to pass judgement on like a true egotistical moron sitting on his throne
 of empty beer bottles.<br />

<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Gamerscore Tracker<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><b>Cost:80<br />
<br />
</b></p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> What’s there to do in your lonely life well get gamerscore of course and dedicate yourself to it, this thing gives you all the stats you could ever want while you slowly die alone and don’t get found for 12 months until the debt recovery
 agency break the door in because you left the bathroom light on. So what does gamerscore tracker give you ? Well not much it puts up graphs showing how quickly people are earning gamerscore that you know and some kind of prediction of how long it will take
 you to catch up if they stop. That’s it really it’s less a game more excel for the OCD gamerscore MLG moron.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> Only worth it if you are a braindead moron that has nothing else in their life other than a meaningless number to cling on to claim you’re superior.</p>

<br />
</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> I’m from the UK but my geography is dire I once got lost in an open field with a map and compass so I thought this might be useful for me, however it’s not as the counties part for the UK isn’t there only Scotland, wales and Northern Ireland
 so for example you won’t get the county names like “the Black country” (Named due to its industrial heritage incase anyone unfamiliar with the name is reading this ), it provide what appears to be a stock image of the UK and displays buttons pressing them
 brings the direction the place is in, the name of 2-3 towns and some old publically available census info.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> go buy a map from poundland it will be more useful than this thing</p>

<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Nyan cat Adventure<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> Ok I have no idea how to start this review, I really don’t so I’m writing this what could be seen as reviewer 4<sup>th</sup> wall breaking thing to say hello to everyone reading this review, because thats how Nyan Cat adventure feels very
 weird even for something carrying the poptart cat hybrid that craps rainbows, everything is there, pretty much all the Nyan cats as selectable characters to play as however something feels off about the game itself, there are 4 distinct gameplay sections each
 seems to jarringly run into the next one even if the game does warn you when a new one is coming. The first mode is jump, a simple runner style game jump over the platforms and avoid the spikes, the next is gravitate where you switch gravity and either run
 on the ceiling of floor floating between the two and you strategically activate it to get collectables, the third is flight where those familiar with smartphone flight games will find again the familiar gameplay of holding down a button to rise and letting
 go making you fall back down. Finally there’s the rather broken mode called Toast where you launch Nyancat from toaster to toaster trying to get the timing right however this is where the games first big flaw (other than being a compilation of a lot of other
 games) comes in, and that’s the level is randomly generated, which for the most part works until it doesn’t and the toasters don’t line up right and no matter what happens you have to fire yourself into nothingness, start the section again ad lose part of
 a heart. Now onto the games next big flaw in the items, sure the hearts are a good idea as they restore your health and let you play more, and candy gives you more points however the pills are a problem. I have never taken mind altering drugs and the closest
 experience I have is a rather unfortunate incident while working with Chloroform however if Nyan cats depictions are anything to go by then I have no idea why anyone would want to. The drug effects include messing up the screen to make it wobble so much any
 motion sick gamers out there will lose their lunch (assuming they haven’t already from the insane scrolling background) other include making the screen flash worse than rave cat adventures or whatever it was called and even though I don’t suffer from photosensitive
 epilepsy I had to look away as it was messing with my eyes, the final one grays out the colours with the level being like a child’s drawing.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> Nyan Cat Adventure is like a PSA but without the joy of being able to laugh at it and considering the fact it has two ways that could quite literally make some people physically ill I’d suggest Nyan cat Adventures doesn’t&nbsp; so much Nyan to
 the Nyan as end up being a bit of a failure.</p>

<br />
</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80<br />

</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> I went into this game as I do most games with a Christmas theme and the word zombies in the title, with a drink in one hand and a large blunt instrument close by to knock myself out cold incase the alcohol failed to subdue my inner rage
 that I fully expected to feel at a dire indie game. If it was the 3<sup>rd</sup> double rum or not I am still unclear but this game was enjoyable, sure it was terrible, no reload animations, terrible weapons, awful character animations, a stupid concept and
 really poor and cheap enemy infinite spawning. However the game managed to be fun under all the terrible pile was something shiny a game that was fun to play and by fun I mean to me it was on a par with playing COD. The game lets you level up by killing zombies,
 has working headshot and hitbox mechanics, randomly generated levels and unlike most Zombie games, an objective something other than simply shoot the zombies and survive even attempting a bit of tongue in cheek humour.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> Terrible backgrounds, textures, no recoil guns, animations are poor and yet it’s fun to play. This game could well be described as a good Christmas Jumper of indie gaming really terrible but still something you can enjoy a game which if it
 were a film it would be one of those filler films that somehow manages a cult following for how cheesy it is but how well its core things are, and not in the it’s so bad its good way “The Room” has been described.</p>

<br />
</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> Initially I expected to be playing an RTS or possible turn based strategy here but not so, here you play a sort of minimalistic version of what Stubbs the zombie Rebel without a Pulse was all about, creating hordes, infecting people and
 moving forward in the game. It’s not known for me to attack a games graphical style but in this one it feels so out of place due to the characters appearing so small and the fact it’s often hard to see the enemies field of view. Another major problem with
 the game is it misses the point of having a zombie horde, you get ratings at the end of each level and the ratings depend on how big a zombie horde you build, which when enemies can destroy fairly quick and often it comes down to luck as to if all your horde
 survive an attack, there’s a big problem. Sure you could say there are certain ways you have to approach an problem but in I Zombie you can seemingly change your movement by one step and a battle can take an entirely different turn. Another huge problem is
 the game seems both unforgiving and too easy, as you have regenerating health and so do your horde however in battle if you lose more than 50% health you slow down and can’t escape, locking you into a losing battle so you can’t sneak off to recover.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> A game that would have been better fitting for the real I zombies out there with their 4SG who will no doubt be going out to buy the 5 on release. So no I zombie to me and no Apple peal ...... du dum chi.</p>

</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> Oh why did I open my big mouth........ no not about that stupid event where I messed up a really great friendship, a while ago I said about APR Halloween edition, and I said it seemed like avoiding the objects was easier than dealing with
 them by say jumping over them, apparently the developers took this to heart and decided rather than fix the jump mechanic they’d just break the movement mechanic instead, and this is extreme Jogging a game where you have to use the jump button because moving
 feels like you’re doing it in quick setting cement (a place that the next person who tries to use the “people have worse problems in the world than you” line will end up). The main problem with &nbsp;Extreme jogging is the developer missed the point of the genre
 as some obstacles are hard to tell apart as to if you should go over or under them, and while there are different stages this doesn’t help the problem, in fact it makes it worse as the industrial plant level simply has higher and lower versions of the same
 obstacle meaning until your close you can’t tell if it expects you to jump or crawl. This is the next big problem, crawling, rather than have the standard slide mechanic the devs decided to be different and put in a crawl mechanic which slows you down, breaks
 the flow of a running game and has a timed bar on it which takes time to reload.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> You know your game has issues when the in water controls feel better and more responsive than the on land ones. Run away from this it’s not a patch on Tec 3001 and is so un enjoyable even compared to APR Halloween edition.</p>

 the point was cards are expensive so sometimes it’s nice for an alternative to appear. With the ability to customise a range of options for the cards I was oddly impressed, even with layer tools, sure the “game” only lets you place the items in certain points
 and its pretty generic with what items are there to use but it’s a nice idea which I’d love to see someone really develop allowing avatar poses and other random stuff to be added to the card. The main point of the game being it lets you send the cards to other
 people over live even with a card code to see the card presumably without needing to buy the game.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> By all rights this isn’t a game and as such should be burned alive for its crime but for some reason it’s being saved from the fires as it’s something I can’t help but smile at the idea, sure this generation we won’t be sending one another
 xmas cards over xbox live but who knows in the future I can easily see some big company trying this idea out and it being a fair bit more expensive, so for trying something new here I’m not going to hand this game over for Krampus to punish.</p>

<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Colonies Neociv<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 240<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> This game seemingly has flown under the radar by more than a little bit, a rather high quality CG rendered game with large amounts of it not only fully voice acted but with dialogue options and for large sections lip synching. That’s right
 this is a 240 MSP game that is doing something that 1200 point game blood forge didn’t do and neither did full £39.99 Battleship the game. The CGI is high quality and however this was made someone deserves to be hired now. The gameplay is that of a linear
 plane cover based shooter with also a large emphasis on exploration which in real terms means hide, shoot enemies from cover and then loot them and when you’re not you can look round the environment to pick up bits from there.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Another huge aspect of the game is the extra elements, from in game email with reply options like the .hack games to a data compilation puzzle minigame to unlock extra in game videos that play like company adverts for the in game items such as the defence
 turrets.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>The game just has a great appeal to me with its campy old school sci fi aesthetic which hides what promises to be a dark plot line about deceit and double crosses. The game also seems to know how campy it is with the male character being very much han-solo
 right down to the black jacket and firing first and the female protagonist &nbsp;reminding me very much outfit of Uhura from the original star trek. The interesting fact I did pick up was the enemies seem very much like modern age sci fi characters complete with
 power armour, bad attitudes and over sized guns with the female “villain” looking possibly like she got lost on the way to an all leather S&amp;M party.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>I don’t think any indie game has grabbed me and made me love it so quick especially with the robot obsessed with protocol and order in the meeting room of an old abandoned factory where the rest of the place is trashed, and the emergency exit requiring a
 signed permission form to use that takes the character 2 hours to fill in then requires a full manager meeting to approve its use.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>The game does have a couple of minor annoyances, first the game uses still scenes sometimes rather than animated lip synched ones which does kind of knock you out of the game a bit. The Combat is a little clunky though it gets round this by having combat
 puzzles as such which stop combat issues weighing down the game. The final minor gripe would be the exploration controls feel a bit out of place as while moving the right stick to aim might seem right using it to explore when the left stick no longer moves
 you feels a bit off.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> If this had been fully animated entirely and 400 MSP I’d have been hollering that the developers are mad and undercharging on what is really a full arcade game quality game. However the game isn’t fully animated with some of it being voice
 acted with still scenes However I’m still going to claim the developers are mad as if anything should have been 400 msp and probably not only sets but goes well over the bar it’s this game. So at 240 MSP I’m still going to call the Devs totally insane for
 selling it so low, bioware could buy this game up and send all Mass effect 3 purchasers a copy of this to say sorry for the ending and people would come out in apology to bioware for any trouble they’ve caused, that’s how good this game is it.</p>
<p>It has a couple of issues but then again the issues are more mine than the game and this is way above anything I’ve seen so far in the indie marketplace, the shocking fact being the developers plan to release another game (not a sequel) very soon according
 the game itself and its suggested that the next game is even better.</p>
<p>Buy this, Buy it now and when the sequel comes out no doubt I’ll be saying buy that one too</p>

<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Ramen Ninja<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> Why are so many games obsessed with adding Ninjas where they don’t need to, Ramen Ninja is kind of one of these games, it’s for lack of a better description an isometric stealth game like the old NES Metal Gear Solid games, the objective
 is to steal back the Ramen noodles the Udon (or something like that) company has stolen from your farm (that’s a game I want to see now, ninja farmer). The game has basic stealth and puzzle elements you get a nice cone field of view showing which is nice,
 you can stomp to attract enemies to help draw them out of place, you can walk slower so enemies don’t hear you when you’re close, and you can crawl to hide blow the line of sight. The big problem is when discovered you run till the enemy gets tired then falls
 asleep they then hunt for you, there doesn’t seem to be any real way to deal with an alert guard other than run and they don’t feel like they pose a real threat and when puzzles require to go against what the game has taught you by not going near enemies it
 just doesn’t feel right.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> It doesn’t feel fun and like the terrible noodle pun earlier it misses the mark.<br />
<br />

<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Avatar climbing<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> well it was only a matter of time before the build a burger arcade game got an indie imitator and here it is, Avatar climbing, the simple idea is you race upwards platforming , trying to beat your opponents up both to the top and by hitting
 them, the problem is the game is so unintuitive, with Y being the button to run when walking is near useless, B being the jump button which is also used to ledge grab and right trigger being the melee button. It’s so awkward to use with two of the Y and B
 and right trigger buttons being the main ones and often requiring all 3 be used at once.</p>
<p>Next the Melee barely works and is more hit and miss than the most recent series of skins with its plotlines. The climbing is also broken as to score points / cost people points you force them off the bottom of the screen the issue is they then respawn in
 the middle or above on the screen and will pull the screen up forcing others off the bottom then just by respawning, adding to this the large points benefit for reaching the goal it means you can abuse the respawn system with no real issue and win easily.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> A poor game not even redeemed by the build a level option as the level options are just so basic. Avoid like that Bird in the Ice climbers game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> AvatarBall</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 400<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> Previously I looked at a game that should have been 400 msp at minimum and was clearly under priced, this game has the opposite issue and is clearly overpriced by a long way, the game menu tries to describe what to do and how to play,
 the problem being the background obscured the control description so I had no idea what to do really, the game offered me only the options of local network or multiplayer and having no multiplayer in the trail and no LAN set up i was a bit confused but was
 able to set up a LAN session without needing to be on a LAN. The games problems however didn’t stop once I got into the game as the game simply confused me, the idea is you slam into enemies the use your expand ability to add an extra kick for more points
 that’s really it except the fact I managed to smash my way out the arena and have the game crash, then the second round when I got back into the game randomly I was stopped from moving, I had no idea why or what was happening but I thought I’d crashed it again,
 I hadn’t the rest of the match went on and in the end I had some-how been eliminated which with no indication how it’s happened further confused me especially as the game is based on points not a visible health system.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> This game is far from being the dogs doo dars, its broken confusing and in its present state barely worth 80 MSP let alone 400 MSP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Zombie snowmen</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> A long while ago I reviewed Zombies, Zombies Everywhere. I attacked the game for being terrible with barely any game play and the developer trying to use XBLIG / XNA as a kick starter for a terrible game to begin with. The worrying thing
 is this game is worse, its less a game more Simon says with Zombies and without requiring any memory ability, you can just mash the controller buttons and still do almost as well as by paying attention. Luckily this game doesn’t have delusions of grandeur
 and the horrible attempt to try to get others to buy it that Zombies, Zombies everywhere does.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> Terrible game and when its redeeming feature is it simply doesn’t try to further screw you over you know it’s bad.</p>
<p>This is one snowman no one will cry for when it melts into obscurity</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Invasion one</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> Destroy all humans was an enjoyable enough shoot em up / invasion game with some moments of decent humour. Rampage is an enjoyable if mindless destroy everything game where the military turn up to fight you. Invasion one takes the destroy
 all humans ship and smashing stuff up but puts it in the Ramapgae 2D without the over the top super destructive powers of the destroy all humans ship, instead you end up chipping away and buildings and using the tractor beam to beam humans up to re power the
 ship.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Initially I found it boring and thought the ship might be slightly op having self repair systems and invincibility mode then I managed to hit the % where the military attack and they destroyed me, ripping me apart the shield lsot all power in about 3 shots
 the self repair failed and all the power was used so I couldn’t use weapons and the tractor beam kept cutting out too.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Looking at the leaderboard I was shocked to find there’s probably about 4-5 people who have actually played this game and played seriously enough to rack up some big scores.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> Presumably the developers for this game as victims of Crypto’s probe as with no multiplayer that I could find the joy Rampage has can’t be present but then the single player joy of Destroy all humans visceral super destructive weapons are
 lost too. Avoid like you would an probing<br />

<p>Only a bit of news this time</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>XNpay ?</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;For those not following the indie games community much won't be aware of the running issues with sales stats and now developers pay, normally developers are paid once a quarter<strong>,
</strong>Well Ms managed to be spectacularly late with some developers pay this time, for some up to 40 days late paying them.</p>
<p>You might think being paid would be an end to this, well its not as due to this there's now big&nbsp; calls amongst developers to change their pay to once every 30 days much more often than at present to make sure they get paid faily quickly and won't end up
 having 3 months money take over a further month to reach them. The idea being in MS are taking 2/3 of the indie games sales money and the $100 a year XNA membership the developers now want their money to be going back into the service and not being pocketed
 so the call for better developer service is being made.</p>

<p>glad you enjoyed it. All I really do so far is just that, pick games that look interesting be it for being really bad or really good as often the bad games can turn round and surprise me.</p>
<p>damn I forgot about the Radian games thing and the fact they're having a sale on all their games.</p>
<p>Oddly I've never really been interested in their games due to not being a big fan of geometry shooter esc games, though I think I have their latest game fluid or something waiting on a list of games to be reviewed.</p>

<p>Hi pflanagan,</p>
<p><br />
Welcome to Microsoft Answers Forums.</p>
<p><br />
First I would suggest that you check if the service related to the printer is running on the computer.</p>
<p>A print spooler is service that temporarily stores print jobs on the computer hard disk or in memory until the printer is ready to print them. If you've been waiting an unusually long time for a document to print, or if you see an error message about the
 print spooler, spooler subsystem, or spooler resources, you might need to change and then restart the Print Spooler service on your computer.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Open <strong>Administrative</strong> <strong>Tools</strong> by clicking the
<strong>Start</strong> button, clicking <strong>Control Panel</strong>, clicking <strong>
System and Maintenance</strong>, and then clicking <strong>Administrative</strong>
<strong>Tools</strong>. <br />
2.&nbsp;Double-click Services. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
3.&nbsp;Right-click the <strong>Print Spooler service</strong>, and then click <strong>
Properties</strong>.<br />
4.&nbsp;On the <strong>General</strong> tab, next to <strong>Startup</strong> <strong>
type</strong>, make sure that <strong>Automatic</strong> is selected.<br />
5.&nbsp;If the service is not already running, under <strong>Service</strong> <strong>
status</strong>, click <strong>Start</strong>, and then click <strong>OK.</strong> If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</p>
<p><strong>Also check if the file and printer sharing is turned on.</strong></p>
<p>Make sure network discovery and printer sharing are on by following these steps:<br />
1.&nbsp;Open <strong>Network</strong> and <strong>Sharing</strong> <strong>Center</strong> by clicking the
<strong>Start</strong> button, clicking <strong>Control</strong> <strong>Panel</strong>, clicking
<strong>Network and Internet</strong>, and then clicking <strong>Network and Sharing Center</strong>.
<br />
2.&nbsp;If <strong>network discovery is off</strong>, click the arrow button to expand the section, click<strong> Turn on network discovery</strong>, and then click
<strong>Apply</strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
3.&nbsp;If file sharing is off, click the arrow button to expand the section, click <strong>
Turn on file sharing</strong>, and then click <strong>Apply</strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</p>
<p>If you are still unable to install the printer on the computer I would suggest that you uninstall all the drivers related to the printer on the computer and later download the printer drivers on the computer and make sure that you only install the drivers
 for the version of windows installed on the computer if you have 64 bit of windows install only 64 bit drivers.<br />

<p>If the above steps fail refer the below link and try the steps mentioned.<br />

<br />
<br />
If the above steps do not fix the issue I would suggest that you contact the printer manufacturer for more information.<br />

            <p>As FIFA 16 was released several months ago it is possible that the free trial offer is no longer valid. &nbsp;However, you could always try loading the game from within the EA Access app itself. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't work or you have already tried going that route then please give EA support a try and see what they have to say. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.twitter.com/ea" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.twitter.com/ea</a></p>

<p>Hi JimboJambo86!</p>
<p>onyx62is is right. The free trial offer to play fifa 16 have already ended months ago. But if you have an EA access subscription. You could download the and play the game by going to the EA vault through the EA access app. But you need to have an active
 EA subscription. If you said that you have an inactive EA subscription.</p>
<p>I would suggest contacting chat support so they could check and confirm if your EA access subscription is still active or temporarily suspended(maybe due to billing issues). EA support have nothing to do with EA subscription. They will just direct you back
 to contact Xbox Support. All subscriptions are handled by Xbox support. Unless the subscription is bought through a third party website.</p>

                    Hello, I have had a strange thing that I don't understand happen several times (3) at startup called "checking disk consistency". I am a moderatly (or less) knowlegable user. I have windows XP:( , IE8, 32-bit, SP3, hmm, that's about it I guess. I would
 just like to know what this means, and if there is anything I can do to fix it (prefferably for free). Thank you so much!

<br />
Click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />

cmd<br />

<br />
For example, to query the dirty bit on drive C, type:<br />

Sample output: <br />
Volume C: is dirty<br />
Volume C: is not dirty<br />
<br />
Is your drive dirty or is it not dirty?<br />
<br />
Type 'exit' to close the command prompt window.<br />

The reason is to try to figure out why it comes randomly as chkdsk only runs if the drive dirty but the oringal title is:

 account 1$ 2 times for the game pass i got that refunded&nbsp; but yet the account that i was supposed to get game pass on now cost 9.99 instead of 1$ because "the system detected i was not eligible for the promo for 1$ game pass" mind you it did not tell me it
 was going to be 9.99 until the last minute but to sum all of this up they took 2$ that has not posted back into my account and tried to "sneak" in a 9.99 charge for something that was advertised as 1$ for me but as the title says i would never use another

<p>Just cancel the subscription and get your money back.&nbsp; If you are not eligible for the promo then you must pay full price.&nbsp; You can cancel you subscriptions by logging into your account and going to subscriptions.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using any product is a choice that you make.&nbsp; Personally, I like Microsoft and have always had great service.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Yes phone conversations are difficult to understand what they are saying because they never have English as their native language but chat works really well. I've never had an issue with chat.

<h2>            How can I remove people from Skype in Windows 8.1&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi there</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an unrecognised contact in my list of people in Skype and there seems to be no way to delete it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Various messages on the help forums say 'go to people' and delete it there, but if I do that I get a message that says...</p>
<p>
Some of this contact's details come from another service. You'll need to delete the contact there to keep them from appearing here.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I am using windows 8.1 on a laptop. I have no other windows devices running skype and only have a microsoft account since last month which was apparently required to get a skype account. Why can I not just right click and delete like almost everything else
 in microsoft?</p>

<h2>            Jeux Kinect Adventure Non reconnu par ma Xbox </h2>
                    
<p>Bonsoir ,</p>
<p>je me permet de vous écrire , en espérant avoir une réponse nette car là je commence à perdre patience ...</p>
<p>Je m'explique , J'ai une Xbox Elite 120 GO La semaine dernière , j'ai acheté la Kinect ( le pack Kinect Adventure).</p>
<p>Tout content , je commence à mettre le jeu Adventure , et sur l'écran d accueil cela m'affiche "Disque non reconnu", alors que le jeu est NEUF je tiens a le préciser!</p>
<p>Bon là sur le coup j'ai misé sur le fait que ma console doit déconner , alors je test mes autres jeux , Fifa 12 , Modern Warware 2 , Zumba Fitness , Just dance 4 et le tout fonctionne parfaitement , même dans la console d'un ami le jeu Adventure fonctionne
 parfaitement...</p>
<p>Là je n'y comprend rien de rien , je décide d'échanger le jeux Adventure , et rebelote "Disque non Reconnu" , &nbsp;je commence vraiment a me poser des questions...</p>
<p>Si quelqu'un peut m'éclaircir ...&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cordialement&nbsp;</p>

<p>Salut, supprime les données du jeu en passant par le DD déjà. Ensuite vide le cache. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Une fois que tu as fais cela sur l'interface reste toujours dans paramètres, puis système. Maintenant tu as une option pour choisir si la console doit automatique lancer le jeu si il est dans le lecteur, tu choisis l'option pour lancer le jeu manuellement.
</p>
<p>Insère le CD de ton jeu, et sur l'interface tu pourras soit lancer le jeu, soit afficher des détails ou l'installer. Voilà.</p>

<p>C'est un problème étrange qui m'était arrivé aussi sur Forza 2 impossible de le lancer alors qu'en magasin il fonctionnait très bien. Essaie une dernière chose, retire le disque dur et regarde si le jeu se lance.
</p>
<p>Sinon à part un retour en magasin je ne vois rien d'autre, c'est ce que j'avais fait pour Forza 2...</p>

<br />
Open the Run box (Ctrl + R)<br />
<br />
then type in &gt; "control userpasswords2" without the ""<br />
<br />
Then at top uncheck the box saying - Users must enter a username and password to use this computer<br />
<br />
If you ever want to change it back then simply re-check that box<br />
<br />
Report back if this fixes your problem<br />

            Windows can't control your fan speed from inside the VM, you'll need to do this on the Mac OS directly.

<h2>            Surface Pro 3 i7 model performace - stops and stutters</h2>
                    <p>I spent quite a chunk of money on the top of the line i7 model and I am fairly unhappy with the performance.&nbsp; Just in the course of a normal day's work - plugged in at my desk - I get multiple times where everything seems to freeze while I am typing an email
 or in an Office document.&nbsp; And I have to sit and wait for a couple minutes until the typing starts again (the keys I typed two minutes ago).&nbsp; I am would think that I should be able to have Word, Excel, antivirus&nbsp;and the IE browser open with multiple tabs without
 experience this type of interruption but when I open Task Manager -- which I can do btw during these stuttering periods -- it will show quite a few CPU spikes but only moderate utilization and 60-70% memory use (I have 8GB which I think is the max).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read all the tips and I am keeping up to date on the Window Updates.&nbsp; I thought by investing in the top model offered I would get the best performance.&nbsp; So far the performance is disappointing.&nbsp; What options do I have without losing everything I have and
 starting all over again?</p>

            <p>Hi there Ben_MK,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for responding helpfully to this question. I share the same issue and I am using a Surface Pro 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although I haven't tried your fix and I plan to, I really don't think this is a turn-it-off-and-on-again fix.&nbsp;It looks for all appearances like a memory/performance problem, as if there were too many background programs or something (in spite of not actually
 running too many things).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, I wonder whether it has anything to do with the connection between the snap magnetised keyboard and the Surface itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have another question which may be related or may not be. When using Facebook, this problem&nbsp;seems massively worse. Instead of simply taking some time to glitch back in with my typed words, Facebook seems to reset my words so that as I continue writing
 it enters the information behind my previous glitched words.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For an example:</p>
<p>Say I was writing "Wow - that sea otter was GAWKED when it got woken up, bro!" on Facebook. I start writing "Wow - that". As soon as my tenth [arbitrary example number] keystroke is entered, the appearance of my words on the screen gets gummed up. In the
 meantime, I have entered another fifteen keystrokes of my tragically idiotic and meaningless Facebook comment. It should now read: "Wow - that sea otter was ". But none of the latest&nbsp;letters have appeared visually on the screen. It appears as if the computer
 is running slowly, or that it hasn't registered my keystrokes. Because I have a habit of visually confirming my typing, my brain tells me that I need to re-enter those fifteen keystrokes. So I start re-typing them. I get about five keystrokes in when suddenly&nbsp;the
 fifteen keystrokes I entered (" sea otter was ") drop in out of hyperspace. I freeze. A moment later, the five keystrokes I re-entered (" sea ") come in from the Bermuda Triangle. My sentence looks like this: " sea Wow - that sea otter was ". If I continued
 typing now, it would type from the position of the fifth character in line. Often that's what I do, since this phenomenon no longer surprises me so much. If I am lucky, my sentence ends up looking like this: " sea otter was GAWKED when it got woken up, bro!
 Wow - that sea otter was ". If I am unlucky, this whole process happens three more times before I finish, and I've habitually backspaced a couple of times too, so it looks more like this: " sea otter was WowGAWKED when it WOW - that seaotterw got woken up,
 bro! asdkjhjjff F#*K!!"<br />
<br />
This is far less dramatic when using Microsoft word or other non-Facebook online text boxes., such as this one. Without a reset, I can simply keep typing and ignore the fact that it hasn't visually caught up yet. But I am still likely to get confused and backspace
 a couple of times, which causes problems when the text appears again. It's slow. It's annoying. Please help XD</p>

Never-mind... Regardless of the source, and the potential issues that may come with
<br />
downloading from that source...<br />
From what I can find, the Lenovo C200 uses an&nbsp;<i> </i>Integrated graphics processor.<i>
<br />
Intel Graphics Media Accelerator 950</i>.<br />
<br />
This is a low end Integrated graphics processor that is suitable for video, and games<br />
with very low graphics requirements, such as hidden object, and games such as Bejeweled, but<br />
not suitable for games with 3D graphics, even those with relatively low system requirements
<br />
such as <i>Bully</i>.<br />

            <i>"but i can play gta IV"<br />
<br />
</i>Maybe your machine has a different graphics processor than what was shown in the<br />
specifications I read. There is no graphics processor specified in the list you posted,
<br />
and there may be variations from the base model of the Lenovo C200.<br />
As you can see from the review the<i> </i><i>Intel Graphics Media Accelerator 950</i> is not a very capable processor.<br />
<br />
I you are able to play GTA IV you should be able to play Bully.<br />
If you did not download the game from a legitimate source that could also be the problem.<br />

<br />
Good, but you never said where, and I asked twice, so as these forums are regularly frequented
<br />
by those who download 'free' versions, what to expect ?<br />
<br />
As Bully was also published by Rockstar, and was released before GTA4 (closer to GTA-SA graphically)<br />
I would think it should have not problems on your&nbsp; machine if you can run GTA4. <br />
<br />
If you have installed the 1.2 Patch for the game and still have problems you may get better results
<br />
by asking at the Rockstar forums, as there may be problems specific to the game.<br />
<br />

            Yes, well it seems you are misinformed as to what constitutes a legitimate download,<br />
or just blatantly contemptuous of what constitutes software PIRACY.<br />
'Free' Torrent downloads are PIRATE downloads, so your problem would be directly associated with this.<br />
When you have problems with PIRATED games you need to inquire at a forum where PIRATES<br />
hang out, not the official MS forums, of all places.<br />
