    <title>Windows 10 with EpsonStylus cx6600 - Unable to find a core driver - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mattstaples929  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 with EpsonStylus cx6600 - Unable to find a core driver package that is required by the printer driver package</h2>
                    <p>My uncle recently ran an update on his Windows 10 machine. Upon completion he found he was no longer able to print from his EpsonStylus cx6600 printer. He was able to do so just minutes before the update, and then lost the ability after the windows updates
 rebooted. The printer's scan function still works, but the printer no longer shows as an option on his Devices and Printers list, and cannot be chosen from any application when attempting to print (all other printer options (such as Print to Adobe PDF) work
 fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I've tried to fix the problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rebooted</p>
<p>Unplugged printer. Removed device that shows up for the Scanner (USB2.0 MFP). Rebooted and plugged printer back in. USB2.0 MFP reinstalls itself, but still without printer options.</p>
<p>Restarted Print Spooler through Services</p>
<p>Checked Print Management (driver for CX6600 does not appear nor do possibly related drivers). Generic drivers (such as XPS writer) show up normally.</p>
<p>Attempted to update print driver through Device Manager. When i do this, the computer brings up the attached error message.</p>
<p>Attempted to get print drivers from Epson website. Drivers were unavailable as site states that windows 10 will install them automatically. No manual option is provided.</p>
<p>Attempted to get print drivers from generic third party website. No Windows 10 drivers were available in the same manner.</p>
<p>Attempted to install as a local printer. The option for the CX6600 appears in the list, but it requests the INF file. when i do this, the same attached error message appears.</p>
<p>Attempted to replace INF file where i believe the print driver is contained in system32 folder. No effect, reverted back to previous version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone assist in fixing this? Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>Thanks Gemzon, but i'm afraid this didn't work for me. When i follow the first fix (choose from a list of driver locations) it prompts me to provide the inf file location again. If i try the automatic search fix it brings up the same attached error message
 i included at the start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kinda feel this would be easier if Windows would just let me download and install the print drivers manually like I've been doing for the last twenty years...</p>

            That's a very old printer.&nbsp; The most recent driver available on the Epson site is for Windows XP.&nbsp;&nbsp; This was bound to happen sooner or later.&nbsp; I don't know what you think would be accomplished by Windows letting you download and install drivers manually
 if there are no drivers available.&nbsp; If there are any workarounds, and there probably aren't, Epson will know about them.

            Ron,Hi.<br />
<br />
Do you know how I can save my emails from my Windows Hotmail account to my external hard drive?<br />
<br />
If I delete my emails from my Windows Live account, can I import back into into my Windows Hotmail account?<br />
<br />
What will occur if I delete and remove my Windows Live mail account? Will I lose all my emails in my Hotmail account?<br />
<br />
Thank you Ron, you are the only response I received in months of inquiry.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

 move to another account folder, ........</p>
<p>Open WLMail, Alt, F, Export messages.</p>
<p>You may have to export to a empty folder on the computer hard drive, then move the folder to your external hard drive.</p>
<p>If you drag messages into an opened Hotmail folder, the messages will sync back to the Hotmail server.</p>
<p>If you remove the Hotmail account from WLMail, the account will only be removed from your computer.</p>

            <p>Ron, Thank you for the quick reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a method to save my Hotmail emails to my external hard drive without using the Windows&nbsp;Live Email account?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I delete the emails from my Win Live email account, will my emails be deleted from my Hotmail account?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ever since&nbsp; used my Live email account, many emails are being sent from month&nbsp; ago from my Hotmail account. There appears to be some bug in the 2 accounts since they are not synced. Is that normal?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HP told me I can create a folder on my external hard drive and export my Live emails to the external hard drive. If I export the Live emails&nbsp;to the ext. hard drive then delete them from Live, can I import back into my Hotmail account?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your patients and help,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>Hi paul, </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I do apologize for the late response to your post. Here’s my answers to<span>&nbsp;
</span>your query. </span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Is there a method to save my Hotmail emails to my external hard drive without using the Windows&nbsp;Live Email account?</span></p>
<p><span>Yes,<span>&nbsp; </span>solution that you mention to create folder is the way to import you email to your hard drive.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>If I delete the emails from my Win Live email account, will my emails be deleted from my Hotmail account?</span></p>
<p><span>Depends. If the windows live mail is sync to your Hotmail whenever you delete email from your Live Mail, it will also be deleted to your webmail, or whatever changes you might do to your Windows Live Mail
<span>&nbsp;</span>will also applied to your webmail. Ex, adding and deleting folder, deleting emails. Etc.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Ever since&nbsp; used my Live email account, many emails are being sent from month&nbsp; ago from my Hotmail account. There appears to be some bug in the 2 accounts since they are not synced. Is that normal?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Yes, It is possible that your second account is set to forward email to your other email that is sync to your Live Mail, therefore every email that your second account received, will be forwarded to the current email that you are using now. If you
 don’t want your other email to forward to your current email account. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Here’s how:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Sign in to your Hotmail account. <br />
2. Click <strong><span>Options</span></strong>&nbsp;and then <strong><span>More options</span></strong>.
<br />
3. Under <strong><span>Managing&nbsp;your&nbsp;account</span></strong>, click <strong><span>Email forwarding
</span></strong>or use the direct link below:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://snt123.mail.live.com/mail/home.mvc?n=1571447931&amp;livecom=1#!/mail/options.aspx?subsection=32&amp;n=780619669" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://snt123.mail.live.com/mail/home.mvc?n=1571447931&amp;livecom=1#!/mail/options.aspx?subsection=32&amp;n=780619669</span></a></p>
<p><span>4. On the <strong><span>Forwarding</span></strong> page, click <strong><span>Don't forward.</span></strong><b><br />
</b>5. Click <strong><span>Save</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10&#58; Microsoft Windows Search Filter Host is Using lots of CPU</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft Windows Search Filter Host is taking up way to much CPU (&gt;25% of an i7).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried rebuilding the search index as a previous post recommended, but it didn't help. Actually, it seemed to help for about 10 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm really fed up with Windows 10. It's burning &gt;25% of my CPU on something I don't even want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't terminate the program in Task Manager, because it just starts up again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seriously, I'm so mad at this garbage OS right now.</p>

<p>The URL that you have for your calendar is a very old one, and&nbsp;its DNS record seems to have been removed*. You can access your calendar at
<a href="http://calendar.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://calendar.live.com</a>, which you will see resolves eventually to
<a href="https://outlook.live.com/owa/?path=/calendar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com/owa/?path=/calendar</a> or something similar.

<p>It's not a new calendar. Its appearance has changed a bit over the past three years, but the entries it contains should still be the same. The factor that determines which calendar you see is the Microsoft Account you sign in with. What do you mean by 'Live
 calendar'?</p>

<p>I'm not sure, I'm afraid. It's still not entirely clear to me what you're trying to do. You have posted in the forum for Windows Live Mail and say that you're trying to find the entries in your Windows Live Mail calendar. You have at least two calendars
 in Windows Live Mail: the <em>default</em> one which you see when you're <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
not</span> signed in, and an <em>account</em> calendar belonging to the Microsoft Account you sign in with that you see when you
<p>
</p><p>Because of the changes at Outlook.com, the Windows Live Mail calendar no longer synchronizes with that at calendar.live.com. However, events entered at either end before the change should still be present at both ends. Are you able to say when your account

<p>Hi, thank you for your prompt reply - much appreciated.&nbsp; Let me try to elaborate.&nbsp; I am referring to the calendar that I use when I am logged into my Microsoft account (calendar.live.com/calendar/calendar.aspx).&nbsp; Sorry for the confusion but I thought that
 it was related to the calendar that is in my WLM client.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started to not be able to view my calendar in November 2017.&nbsp; However there were a few days in December (17th, 18th and 19th)&nbsp;when I did receive the automatic email notification for Daily Schedule (from
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***) with my events listed so I thought it must be fixed.&nbsp; But no, I still cannot access that calendar (URL
<a href="https://bay04.calendar.live.com/calendar/calendar.aspx)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>If I click on an event in one of those Daily Schedule notifications it takes me to a calendar at Outlook.live.com but none of my events appear there (it is an empty calendar).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this Microsoft Live calendar is no longer working or supported then I would at least want to be able to import/export my calendar events into a new calendar (such as Outlook).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I look forward to hearing back from you.</p>
        </p>

<p>OK. We seem to have established that this has after all nothing to do with Windows Live Mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I explained in my first reply to you on 14 December that the URL you were using (<span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://bay04.calendar.live.com/calendar/calendar.aspx</span>) was no longer valid, so it won't ever work again however often you try. This was the
 address of a server cluster which doesn't exist any more. Please track down all shortcuts you may have to this URL and delete them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds as if you're accessing a different calendar from the one your events are stored in, possibly as a result of some confusion about Microsoft Accounts. You should be able to check this: find the latest Daily Schedule email and check carefully which
 address it was sent to. Then open Internet Explorer and press Ctrl-Shift-P to start an InPrivate session, which ignores any cookies you may have stored. In address bar in the InPrivate window, type<strong> outlook.live.com/owa/?path=/calendar
</strong>and press <em>Enter</em>. You should be invited to sign in; do so using the email address your daily schedule was sent to. This should lead you to the calendar in question. Does it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can create a new shortcut to this page by right-clicking on a blank bit of it and selecting
<em>Create shortcut</em>.</p>

<p>Thanks again for your help.&nbsp; I did as you instructed and it took me to&nbsp;a <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
blank </span>Outlook calendar (the one I go to if I click on an event in one of those Daily Schedule notifications - again, there are no events in this calendar).</p>
<p>
</p><p>What seems strange is that for a few days in December I was getting those Daily Schedule notification emails with all my daily events so they must be stored somewhere (but then they stopped again).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Other people must be experiencing the same problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think I am mixing up calendar accounts as I only have one Microsoft account (linked to my email address).&nbsp; It is just that my original Live calendar no longer works and the Outlook Calendar I am now taken to is empty.</p>

    <title>Has Call of Duty ruined online gaming&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mattacular117  say:</h3>
<h2>            Has Call of Duty ruined online gaming&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Ok so ignore the sensationalist headline but as we all patiently wait for E3 to roll around I would like to start a discussion about the direction of online gaming. Having just finished
 a round of Max Payne 3's multiplayer I have come on these forums to vent my frustration at the progress system of competitive online games that seems prevalent ever since the widely successful COD 4. I'm talking of course about online multiplayer which allows
 progression unlocks of weapon attachments, perks etc. I jump on a game on MP3 or BF3 or COD and feel that I'm getting beaten, not because I lack the necessary skill to compete, but simply because the other person has more time than me to play and has, thus,
 unlocked better perks, better attachments and most annoyingly better weapons. </span>
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Battlefield BC2 was terrible for it, as it allowed things like mortar strikes and hugely better weapons at higher ranks. Am I alone in just wanting to be able to jump online and feel
 like it is at least an even battlefield? And yes I know that there will always be issues with people being able to invest more time (learning maps, weapon placements etc); it is just lately I feel that online gaming has become an exercise in frustration, and
 having to put up with getting my @@@ handed to me by a better weapon. With the reports that Halo 4 is likely to follow with a similar unlock system does anyone else wish that they would focus more on making you keep playing because of the fun element rather
 than feeling you have to grind to keep yourself competitive? </span></p>

<p>No.</p>
<p>Players who play the game more/longer than you have always had the same advantage.
</p>
<p>Quake: Someone who knows where all the weapons are has advantage over you.</p>
<p>If anything CoD's progression equals out the playing field.</p>
<p>So in short.</p>
<p>No, no it has not ruined online.</p>
<p>To a extra point you cant blame CoD for other developers using a familiar system in games, it works thus more will use it.

<p>@Linko</p>
<p>I'm not sure that I agree its not the same advantage is it? Say you play the game 3 times in a row under the "COD" style progression they will always have that advantag. Under a system such as quake or Halo in the second game you may spawn closer to a power
 weapon/ or a different map the first person isn't so familiar with. How does it equal the playing field people who invest more time have better weapons how is that even?
</p>
<p>Do you not sometimes feel you have to play the game just to unlock the next weapon, the next attachment etc? I think I had my epiphany moment and I just don't enjoyment out of that.</p>
<p>Yes I know that COD isn't to blame it was a flippant remark, that system was around before it just became more popular after.</p>

<p>No, no i dont.</p>
<p>Like i said, in every multiplayer game going the people who play it more will always have the advantage.</p>
<p>The only multiplayer method that i disagree with is when better items can be unlocked exclusively by paying extra. &nbsp;</p>

<p>No it werent, I got 1000/1000 gamer points from COD 2 and put a lot of time into the multiplayer and I tell ya right now MW3 is much more fun the COD2. This crap that games were once much better than they are now is a pile of crap.<br />
<br />
<br />
Its like when your a kid and ya dad tells ya to watch a film and its crap but he thinks its the best film ever, or someone tells ya music was better in 1980 IT WASN'T/ games are no different. You may of got off playing "Stunt car racer" in 1990 when you were
 15 but give that game to a 15 year old now he would hate it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>But a 15 year old today will be moaning in 10 years that games aren't what they used to be and he will be praising the great multiplayer community that was MW3 and how MW22 has ruined online games. I can remember people saying Halo 2 on xbox1 had ruined
 online games, An comment about how Ghost recon is being ruined by Halo 2 players.</p>

<p>So why do you disagree with paying to unlock the weapons? Surely it is essentially the same thing. On one system you simply invest time to unlock and on the other you simply invest a few quid. If you use the old adage that time = money, then you end up paying
 either way. Therefore, you have just kind of contradicted yourself. </p>
<p>Besides where did I say that wasn't the case I agreed with you on that point, however, having a system that rewards players with better weapons is surely the worst option for a new player? I fail to see how you can compare someone knowing where the sniper
 rifle is in Halo to someone in Battlefield hitting you without you even being able to see beacuse they have unlocked a longer range sniper and a 20x optical scope. It is not the same and one system is inherently flawed.</p>

<p>Perhaps I shouldn't have used the words COD as I have a feeling this is going to descend into a flame war with fanboys of either side bickering, when all I really wanted to do was discuss the merits (or flaws as I see it) of the progression system.</p>

<p>No it werent, I got 1000/1000 gamer points from COD 2 and put a lot of time into the multiplayer and I tell ya right now MW3 is much more fun the COD2.<span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">So much for a opinion.&nbsp; Give me COD 2 any day</span>
<br />
<br />
Its like when your a kid and ya dad tells ya to watch a film and its crap but he thinks its the best film ever, or someone tells ya music was better in 1980 IT WASN'T/ games are no different. You may of got off playing "Stunt car racer" in 1990 when you were
 15 but give that game to a 15 year old now he would hate it.<span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Nope not at all, I prefer COD 2 for the reason I could pick up and play and not care what the other had or what level they were every one is one a even playing field with
 just skill.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>But a 15 year old today will be moaning in 10 years that games aren't what they used to be and he will be praising the great multiplayer community that was MW3 and how MW22 has ruined online games. I can remember people saying Halo 2 on xbox1 had ruined
 online games, An comment about how Ghost recon is being ruined by Halo 2 players.<span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">That not what I am doing is it<br />
</span></p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>I know many love the new COD format but I don't it nothing to do with old games are better it is just down to me prefering COD 2 over the modern COD i found it more enjoyable both single and MP.</p>
<p>I am not saying new COD is bad just to me and my opinion I preferd it before all the perks and weapon advancing which I find tedius for a FPS and should be left to RPG's</p>

    <title>Why do the Xbox One Games for Gold suck so badly&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why do the Xbox One Games for Gold suck so badly&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Before I go into why I think they suck, I think it's hella generous for Xbox to give us some free games every month, but I mean come on. How much longer are you guys at MS gonna shaft the Xbox One owners? I traded in my 360 for an Xbox One and when my brother
 got excited the other day about Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag being on 360, I was like hell yeah. Cause you know they even said when it came out they had an Xbox One equivalent. So I was happy thinking they would actually have a good game for once! Joke's
 on me I guess. Instead we as Xbox One owners get shafted with these crappy indie games most of us have no intention of ever playing. Child of Light? Looks like a freaking side scroller game. Now as I said before, while they are nice enough to give us the free
 games to begin with, why couldnt Black Flag at least come to Xbox One for Games for Gold instead of *** us over? And all I ask for and I am sure a lot of One owners will say the same, at least give us a decent game every once in awhile *cough cough* Black
 Flag for example *cough cough*. But no it seems like MS dream child is still the 360 rather than actually encouraging the One. Starting to wonder if I shouldnt have gotten the PS4 instead. At least some of those games are good and not garbage like this month's.
 Now that my rant is over, what is your guy's take on it? And yes I know that 360 has at least 9 years on the One, (little over a year) but still there are a lot of good One games that they "could" bring to Games for Gold over this indie trash :) just saying</p>

<p>If none of the FREE games are up to your high standard, don`t download them.</p>
<p>As they are completely FREE you won`t be losing anything at all, you can just go on with playing your purchased games online with your gold subscription.</p>
<p>Or you could just accept that the xbox ones back catalogue of games is extremely small compared to the 360`s, and just be happy to accept any FREE games you get.</p>
<p>If you really want some of the top games for xbox one, you could always buy them.</p>

<p>You complain about "indie crap" but praise the PS4 monthly offerings....umm you realize most of the PS4 one's are indie titles, right? Child of Light is also one of the best offerings either system has had for free.

<p>aircobra, if that is the "best" they have to offer, then they seriously need to rethink their collection :) and I was making a comment that I have gotten some pretty good games for my brother off PS Plus that were "free" that wait a minute, wait for it,
 were NOT "indie" games :) so your comment holds little water in the first comment :)</p>

<p>I mean, think about it. Microsoft is trying to sell the X1's. People are willing and eager to buy them. Why give away games when there's still people willing to pay full price. With new consoles the 360 isn't do good in sales so they're giving away higher
 quality games. Not to mention the 360 game library is ridiculous compare to the new Xbox.</p>

<p>Ok,it may not be to your tastes but then again I didn't realise GWG was solely there to make you happy.</p>
<p>There have been some great games so far from the very limited xbox one catalogue.They've not all been my cup of tea but i'm not complaining &amp; nor should anyone else.</p>

<p>Games with Gold have to branch out and hit a wide variety of demographics. &nbsp;What you may like others may love. &nbsp;</p>

<p>You also have to realize the Xbox One is still a fairly new console. It's only been out over a year now, and there isn't a huge library out. Be patient and soon enough they will be bringing out much more.

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yeap, I had to reinstall windows due the disappearance of sound after update....</p>
<p>There are tons of win7 updates that actually harm your pc instead of making it better... and the "windows 10" virus is included....</p>
<p>
</p><p>My opinion....try to restore your system to an earlier restore point (...well...like 2 weeks ago), and be careful what updates are you installing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to know which updates are the poisonous ones and which are making your computer "sneakily" download win10, or just creating annoying messages, head to my webpage at
<a href="http://www.windows-addict.com?videos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.windows-addict.com?videos</a>, and in the 6th tutorial you will find everything explained. You also have a list of the bad updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the best,</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I agree with you, there is one problem I did restore the computer to one month back, it did not change</p>
<p>anything, checked everything still cannot have the internet connection.</p>
<p>I will look at your site and remove the bad KB.......</p>
<p>Unfortunately when updates are sent they never specify which one.</p>
<p>I just wander if there is a way to block the unwanted updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This should be reported to the Attorney General.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help and support</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have a Window 7&nbsp; 64 bit Home Premium and have been trying to connect to the internet wireless and cable to n o avail, I am getting&nbsp; "SBVIPRE_FW_EN msi"</p>
<p>and also limited access, spent hours with Verizon technicians checked everything cannot connect to the</p>
<p>internet, finally told me that this is probably an update that is create&nbsp;the blocking.</p>
<p>I also know that Microsoft is sneakily putting some Window 10 updates in my computer. Those two program</p>
<p>are not compatible. I already lost my sound due to those updates, I have to use external speakers to hear anything
</p>
<p>I wish Microsoft would stop update my computer to Window 10 it only creates problems.
</p>
<p>Now I am stuck for the last two weeks with no access to the internet.</p>
<p>What can I do to have my internet back ??????</p>
<p>What do I do with this&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "SBVIPRE_FW_EN msi"&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there is a fix please let me know.</p>
<p>Thank you for all help</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not a problem with an update or anything to do with Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The file SBVIPRE_FW_EN.msi is an installation file for the VIPRE Antivirus product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the home page for that product.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vipreantivirus.com/home-antivirus/free-antivirus-download-trial.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.vipreantivirus.com/home-antivirus/free-antivirus-download-trial.aspx</a>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are having any problems with the Windows 10 update messages, you can easily remove these. See the following threads for several different solutions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How To Prevent Spontaneous Windows 10 Upgrade? </p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-update/how-to-prevent-spontaneous-windows-10-upgrade/27491fd6-c542-484b-9dfe-68266756b5ad">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-update/how-to-prevent-spontaneous-windows-10-upgrade/27491fd6-c542-484b-9dfe-68266756b5ad</a>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Be careful, there are certain support people who will blame a problem on Microsoft (Like, "it must be an update causing this problem") just to get you off of the phone. If this happens again, ask them which update and what problem is it causing?</p>

            <p>I agree with Ronnie. It does not sound like your issue has to do with your windows installation or the updates. Although Microsoft is pushing users to try to upgrade to Windows 10, you cannot install Windows 10 specific updates on your Windows 7 computer.
 Windows update will just plainly not let you do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like there may be some sort of issue with the anti-virus program you installed.&nbsp;Try uninstalling the program and see if it fixes the problem. You can also run the internet connectivity troubleshooter (though Internet Explorer)&nbsp;and post the results
 here to get more insight from the community.</p>

            <p>hi</p>
<p>yeap, saw what others replyed as well...and yes, I can't say this is&nbsp;strictly an update related problem.... though it seems like it</p>
<p>Over the last few months I had a lot o f people coming to me with messed up laptops after update....</p>
<p>and majority of them lost their internet connection... so I guess there is a big possibility</p>
<p>the updates you found...just right click and uninstall them and when they appear again next time, right-click and select "hide update"</p>
<p>be sure to check the other ones as well, and uninstall them if necessary</p>
<p>
</p><p>The updates can be set not to install automatically....just go to &nbsp;windows-update--&gt; change settings --&gt; and select "check for updates but let me choose whether to download and install them".</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;If anything, my recommendation will be a clean windows installation...&nbsp;and don't forget about the spoiled updates :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>As you posted this problem before an a answer was supplied as your problem was from a 3rd party virus program that was installed on your Win7 did you removed the program? &nbsp;this is from your previous posting "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The
 file SBVIPRE_FW_EN.msi is an installation file for the VIPRE Antivirus product" also you were told that Win10 up<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>dates</strong></span> would not load on a Win7 Operating system what you are getting is the notice
 to up<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>grade</strong></span> to Win 10 for free.</span></p>
<p>

<span>Vipre has been a name to conjure with in the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2372364,00.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">antivirus&nbsp;</a>business
 for quite some time. The product has changed over the years, bouncing from company to company and, at one point, incorporating spyware protection from the well-regarded CounterSpy. Perhaps all that moving around wasn't the best for its health. The current
 incarnation, ThreatTrack Vipre Antivirus 2016, isn't your best choice for comprehensive protection. It did improve its antiphishing and malicious URL blocking scores significantly over the tests we ran on last year's edition, but it fared poorly in tests by
 independent antivirus labs."</span></p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>I'm not aware of any size limit for an RTF file, so you could probably accomplish creating&nbsp;a file that size.</p>
<p>The real problem would be the performance of the&nbsp;file. Just opening an RTF file that large would take an unacceptably long time in Wordpad.</p>
<p>Even the latest version of Microsoft Word (2010) has a 512MB limit for opening RTF files.</p>
<p>I would advise you to reconsider creating an RTF&nbsp;file that large.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Lynne,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. We will help you in resolving your issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From your description, I understand that you are facing issues connecting to wireless network and your adapter software is requesting for the installation disk to install on your PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: </strong>I suggest you to run the <span><strong><span>network adapter troubleshooter</span></strong></span><span><span>by following the steps below and check if the issue is resolved.</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>Type </span></span><span><strong><span>Troubleshooting</span></strong></span><span><span>in the search box next to
</span></span><span><strong><span>Start</span></strong></span><span><span>button and press
</span></span><span><strong><span>Enter</span></strong></span><span><span>.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Click on </span></span><span><strong><span>View all</span></strong></span><span><span>options from the left side panel of the screen.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Click on the </span></span><span><strong><span>Network adapter</span></strong></span><span><span>.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Follow the on-screen instruction.</span></span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: </span></strong><span>If the issue is not resolved,</span><span>
<strong>update the network adapters</strong> driver from the device manager by following the steps below:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong> keys on the keyboard and click on
<strong>Device Manager</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Expand the <strong>Network adapters</strong> driver from the list.</span></li><li><span>Right click on the driver and click on <strong>Update driver Software</strong>.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Method 3:</strong> If the issue persist, run the network adapter software in
<strong>compatibility mode</strong> and check if the issue is resolved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Compatibility mode runs the program in the current version of Windows using the settings from previous version of Windows.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Download the network adapter driver from the manufacturer’s website.</span></li><li><span>Right-click on the driver setup file and click on <strong>properties</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click on the <strong>compatibility </strong>tab, check the box <strong>
Run this program in compatibility mode for</strong><span>,</span> select Windows&nbsp;10 operating system from the drop down menu and proceed with the installation. Once this is done,
<strong>restart</strong> the computer and check if the changes are effective.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Refer to the link below on </span></span><span><strong><span>How do I fix network adapter problems?
</span></strong></span><span><span>(Applies to Windows 10 also):</span></span></p>

            <p>Hi Maher,<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>The file <strong>QtGui4.dll</strong> is a legitimate component of Adobe Photoshop Elements. Do you have Adobe Photoshop Elements installed on your computer?<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>If you have Adobe Photoshop Elements installed on the computer, I would suggest you to uninstall and re-install Adobe Photoshop Elements and check if it helps.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Refer to the link:</strong> <a href="http://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop-elements/kb/reinstall-photoshop-elements-or-premiere.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop-elements/kb/reinstall-photoshop-elements-or-premiere.html</a><br />
<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
If the issue persists, I would suggest you to set the computer in clean boot and check if it helps.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font>Setting the system in clean boot state will help to identify if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.<br />

    <title>Fallout New Vegas&#58; Disc read error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> unholiestadune  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fallout New Vegas&#58; Disc read error</h2>
                    
<p>Every time I load the game up, it gives me the option to 'press start' I do so and it scans for DLC, when I try and load any save I get a disc cannot be read error and I'm booted back to the dashboard.</p>
<p>Slightly before this it would crash at key points in the game like; entering the strip, fast traveling or using the barge to Caesar's fort or trying to talk to Boone in Novak.</p>

<p>The disc is in nigh on perfect condition and it's also installed to my harddrive, so there is no logical reason it should be doing this as I played it a few days ago with no complaints.</p>

<p>Hope someone has an answer that isn't just F:NV is full of bugs, I am aware of that.</p>

<p>Please try the following steps and report back to see if it's an issue with your hard drive causing this problem with DLC and the disc unreadable's.<br />
<br />
First, format a USB Flash Drive to work with the XBOX 360 (instructions&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/accessories/usb-flash-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>)<br />
Then, transfer one save file from Fallout: NV to your flash drive by copying it (instructions
<strong><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/games/xbox-games/manage-games-data" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>)&nbsp;<br />
Once you've moved the save onto the flash drive, please remove your hard drive from your console (instructions
<strong><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/accessories/add-remove-hard-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>)&nbsp;<br />
Once you've done that, download your XBOX 360 profile onto the flash drive (instructions
<strong><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/profile-move-delete" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>)<br />
<br />
Then download any of the DLC that was giving you trouble onto the flash drive, once it's downloaded, load up a game and see if when pressing the Start button and loading a save still produces a disc read error.<br />
<br />
These troubleshooting steps are needed to find out if there is an issue with the hard drive, the XBOX 360, or the content that your trying to play.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well that's a slight problem as I don't have a large enough flash drive to have over 6GB of Fallout data on it... So the point is quite moot.</p>

<p>That's why I said 1 save, and 1 piece of DLC. 1 save and 1 DLC does not equal 6GB of data. If it works with one DLC then try with another after that.</p>

<p>i would also recomend that you make sure you have the most recent updates install for the game, sometimes when you skip over this when the system prompts you for it, your xbox will go to the home screen after a disc load up.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may want to try the steps listed below and check if it works:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To run the files in Command Prompt,</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Go to the following location in <strong>File Explorer</strong> -
<strong>C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe a</strong>nd <strong>right</strong> click on it to access cmd.exe
<strong>Properties</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Select the <strong>Shortcut</strong> tab and edit the <strong>
Target</strong> text box as the following - </p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /k</strong></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Reboot the machine</strong> once after making the changes and later check if you are able to access Command Prompt.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>For better understanding, you may check the screenshot below. </span></p>

<p>Thank you for the reply, Jellius. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We will have to create a Shortcut of cmd.exe file onto the desktop. To do that, kindly follow the steps listed below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Go to the particular location - <strong>C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe</strong>.</li><li>Right click on the file and select <strong>Create Shortcut on desktop</strong> option. &nbsp;</li><li>From desktop, right click on <strong>cmd.exe - Shortcut</strong> file to choose its
<strong>Properties</strong>. </li><li>In there, you get <strong>Shortcut</strong> option and <strong>target text box</strong> to make the changes as said above.
</li></ul>

</p><p>•&nbsp; Press <strong>'Win + R</strong>' keys on the keyboard together to open the Run dialog box and type the following into the Run box:
<strong>cmd /d</strong></p>
<p><br />
<strong>Note</strong>: Running <strong>cmd /d</strong> starts the command prompt bypassing its auto run entry.</p>
<p><br />
If the above said method works, navigate to the x86 directory and try running <strong>
ansicon –u</strong>.</p>

<p>Hi cybertek,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ok, I followed all of this all the way through, but my situation is slightly different. All I can get to is the boot device menu, regardless of whether I use a bootable cd ( i have tried the PE builder method) or the original Windows disc. no safe mode or
 anything. I ran Hard Drive Diagnostics from the Boot Device Menu, which gived me a fail - Return code: 7 message on my Samsung hard drive. Is my only alternative to try to get my files off of this drive from another PC or is there any other alternative? I
 also have a "boot to utility partition" selection available on the boot device menu if this can be utilized in any way</p>

            Not in my opinion. I would try and grab files ASAP as previously described. Chkdsk /f is notorious for losing data on failing drives (and sometimes on OK ones) so I wouldn't mess about with it until you try and get your data.

                    Attempting to disable "small windows" that pop up when you mouse over icons in taskbar. Annoying me. They could be disabled in vista, but can't figure out how in W7. afraid i'm stuck with them. when i personalise and chose windows basic screen,&nbsp;"windows"
 become picture of icon. better, but still not good.&nbsp;

            <b>Method 1:</b> is not available in Windows 7 Home Premium , only in the Pro version. And I could not find any registry value that would match the gpedit.msc corresponding option.<br />
<br />
<b>Method 2</b>: works on my system. Without "ExtendedUIHoverTime" registry entry:<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fbaaef75-6c9a-4379-a955-b6d273a31f58" /><br />
<br />
With "ExtendedUIHoverTime" registry entry:<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cb2dad9b-9b12-459f-bfdc-e3adc4676513" /><br />
<br />
So it prevents (for the number of milliseconds specified) the pop up of the taskbar thumbnail, but does not remove the additional (!) pop up (text box black on white) I guess known as "taskbar icon name".<br />
<br />
After hours of investigation on the Internet, the only efficient solution I could find is indeed this light program that also brings lots of additional functionalities. It works also on Windows 8.1, does not change anything to the regular registry (quoting
 FAQ -&gt; "The only registry keys the tweaker modifies are it’s own settings. There are no registry keys for the options it provides. The tweaker does that by injecting a DLL to explorer, hooking/subclassing/some other methods of the dark side.")<br />
<b><a href="http://rammichael.com/7-taskbar-tweaker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://rammichael.com/7-taskbar-tweaker</a></b><br />

I now use it, no more registry manual manipulations ("ExtendedUIHoverTime" registry entry removed),&nbsp; I love it.

<h2>            Laptop Black screen and restart looping &#40;WINDOWS 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>A few days ago, I was deleting some useless programs from my laptop and may have deleted something important from the Registry Editor.Then, I was restarting my laptop and it gave me the Blue Screen of Death with an error message saying CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED
 and then it restarted for me. After that, I put in a recovery disk and tried to recover my computer. I selected the "Keep all personal files" option since I wanted to use my laptop after fixing it. I did this twice and they both gave me a message saying that
 it has failed. After I removed the recovery disk, my laptop kept on restarting with a black screen and only showing the start-up screen and 2 options. (F2 for setup and F12 for boot options).

            <p>Don't forget to put your device into pairing mode if you are unable to connect via Bluetooth. On BB Pro, hold down the phone button on the right earpiece until you see blinking blue and red lights.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 created 2 entries under Sound Video and Game Controllers in Device Manager. The first became my default device and the sound was limited to 1 channel, telephone quality:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>PLT_BBTPRO Hands-Free</strong></p>
<p><strong>PLT_BBTPRO Stereo</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Right click on the Hands Free entry and select Disable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, right click on the volume control in your system tray and select "Playback Devices". Set Headphones (PLT_BBTPRO&nbsp;Stereo) as the default playback device. Note the change here from Hands Free to Stereo.&nbsp;When I right click on Headphones and view properties,
 the Advanced Tab now reads "2 channel, 16 bit, 44100 Hz (CD Quality). The sound is now great.</p>

<p>That will ensure good Sound Headphones, but doesn't solve the Problem to use it&nbsp;as a Headset. Programs now let my voice appear to the others, but i didn't get what they are talking to me :)<br />
I think thats the Problem of him</p>
