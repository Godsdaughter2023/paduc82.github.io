<h2>            Shared Workbook is shown as Readonly</h2>
                    <p>I have shared a workbook and given Edit access to all my team members and when they access it on OneDrive, it still shows up as Readonly for the persons accessing it. I have shared the workbook and I have done all possible settings.</p>
<p>If i'm doing something wrong, Can you please guide me how to give access to everyone to work on the same workbook simultaneously.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I'm still experiencing the issue. Can we have some kind of webex or something where we can try to reproduce or resolve this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have given permissions:</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When they open the document, there is an option to edit:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6d0364dd-bc4e-4f70-9ad9-d3cc2bbd5f22" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6d0364dd-bc4e-4f70-9ad9-d3cc2bbd5f22" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Once they click on Edit, it says read only:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a8b7358e-a8bd-4605-8f86-e3b88dac6af7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a8b7358e-a8bd-4605-8f86-e3b88dac6af7" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This is happening when i have the document opened in my system and the other person is trying to access the same document and to whom i have given edit permissions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if i'm missing something or doing something wrong. I stay in Indian Time zone. Please see if there
</p>
<p>is a webex required, is scheduled which is comfortable for both of us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

    <title>How to remove extra comma from the text field - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> irshadalam  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to remove extra comma from the text field</h2>
                    <p>I have a text field which has extra comma's inbetween or at the end or only comma in the field.<br />
Actually earlier this text value was imported from excel where the text value was the addition/accumulate of 4 cells where the comma was used to seprate each. Therefore where the situation was that there was no value in the text but the comma was been taken
 according to the formula given there. Details sample below<br />
</p>
<p><br />
Present 4 records sample<br />
1.&nbsp;service,,,Check,<br />
2.&nbsp;,,,check<br />
3.&nbsp;Repair,,,,<br />
4.&nbsp;service,elec repair,hyd repair,test,<br />
5.&nbsp;,,,,</p>
<p><br />
Required to be like below:<br />
1.&nbsp;service,Check.<br />
2.&nbsp;check.<br />
3.&nbsp;Repair.<br />
4.&nbsp;service, elec repair, hyd repair, test.<br />
5.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Note: at the end it should be . Not comma.&nbsp; If no value other than the comma, it should be blank.</p>
<p><br />
Please advice a solution to how to do.<br />
</p>
<p>Regards.</p>

            <p>Is this a one-time sort of thing? If so, you could create an Update query and run it a few times. Make a backup of the table or database before you try this, of course.</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE YourTable SET YourField=Replace(YourField, ",,",",")</p>
<p>
</p><p>To run this, create a new query but do NOT add any tables, and then switch to SQL view. Copy the above into the SQL editor, and be sure to change the Table and Field names to match your own. You'll have to run it a few times, but it'll eventually get all
 the double commas out of the field.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can change the ending comma to a period like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE YourTable SET YourField = Left(YourField, Len(YourField)-1) &amp; "."&nbsp; WHERE InStrRev(YourField,",")=Len(YourField)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is something that's ongoing - that is, you'll need to run this periodically to fix up data you're moving over - you might be better off creating a Function that will handle this for you</p>

<h2>            10240 add new pin in tablet mode, unable to use pin to sign in</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an HP Stream 7 tablet with Windows 10 10240 on it. It did not have a PIN associated with the account and is not part of a domain. I added a PIN and logged out and when I got to the sign in screen, I was only given the option for my MS password and
 not my PIN. I have had pin's with my MS account previously on Windows 8.1 so I am surprised that I am not given a sign on choice at the main screen.</p>

<h3> jessegalloway  say:</h3>
<h2>            I URGENTLY need access my hotmail account which I&#39;ve forgotten the password to</h2>
                    My Xbox has recently asked me to sign in using my old Hotmail account details (something which it has not asked for a very long time) before I can access my Xbox account, but I have forgotten the password. I tried having my password reset, but I cannot
 provide enough information on the recovery form to have any affect. I know all of the basic information, but I don't know anything regarding sent emails and received emails, as I have not accessed this account in up to a year, and I never sent any emails with
 the account - I used it simply to receive emails which were generally just from services who required an email to create an account with.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I desperately need to regain access to my account so I can continue to use my Xbox account, or, at the very least, cancel my automatic Xbox Live renewal so I'm not paying $50 a quarter for a service I am not able to use!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I've tried finding a Microsoft support email I can contact with my problem, but I can't find anything and have resorted to attempting to resolve my problem on this forum. I've seen that other people with the EXACT same problem I am having have been able to
 have it resolved after being contacted with a Microsoft representative via a question post such as this one.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Please, help!&nbsp;

            Yes, that's why I suggested using a <strong>Stacked Line</strong> for the second axis. The stacked line will add the 2 amounts together and the top line will be the total.

<p>When I click on back up it says it is backed up, however when I try going on to one drive, it says I need to upgrade my phone in order to do this . So, I am afraid if I did hard reset it might lose my stuff. As I am not sure the back up,is working. I don't
 want to go through all this and find out &nbsp;this silly username is still there .? &nbsp;Someone said I could send my stuff to my computer but I don't have the right cable for that.</p>

    <title>OneNote spell check - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michaeldp4  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote spell check</h2>
                    How do I turn on autocorrect on onenote? and where is spell-check? I would like to have those features because my misspellings are always underlined which catches my eyes when I study my notes. It is a hassle to go and individually spell-check each word
 as it currently lets me do when I right click.

            Okay i see, you're using OneNote for Windows 10, that app is integrated in Windows 10 and the one that i sent you the screenshot is OneNote 2016 that came with Office 2016.
<br />
<br />This one doesn't have a lot of features for speel checking words, go to the 3 dots at the right top of your screen &gt; Options &gt; And there you'll see the options for spell checking and AutoCorrect.
<br />
<br />If that options are not enough i suggest you to tweaks some settings in the Windows Spell Check settings, that will have an impact in OneNote.

<h2>            Build 10122&#58;  Changing Multiple Display Options Doesn&#39;t Work Correctly &#40;Fixed in Build 10130&#41;</h2>
                    I've now got two displays (of different resolution) on my system. &nbsp;Going to Display Settings | Multiple Displays and changing between the options ("Duplicate these displays," "Extend these displays," Show only on 1," and "Show only on 2") only partially
 does the job. &nbsp;It looks like it will send the screens to the proper display, but it doesn't properly change the scaling. &nbsp;Logging off the computer and logging back on will correct this. &nbsp;Oddly, the first time I did this, it popped up a warning something like
 "for best behavior, log off and log on." &nbsp;But, since the first time I did that, I no longer get the warning.

            <p>Hi David,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for being a part of Windows 10 Insider Preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We regret for the inconvenience caused. I would appreciate if you could provide the make and model of your computer. With the information, it seems there could be Display Drivers compatibility issue.</p>
<p>I suggest you update the Display driver from Device Manager manually and check if this helps. Here sis the steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong> and hit <strong>Ente</strong>r.</li><li>Type <strong>devmgmt.msc</strong> and click on <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Look for <strong>Display Adapters</strong> and expand it.</li><li>Right click on the video driver and select <strong>Update Driver Software</strong>.
</li></ol>
<p>Once this is done, restart the computer and check.<br />
</p>
<p>If the issue still persists, then I suggest you to download the <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
drivers available on the computer manufacturer’s website, then trying installing it in compatibility mode.
</span>Compatibility mode runs the program using settings from a previous version of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Follow these steps to install the drivers in compatibility mode and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a.</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> Download the driver from the manufacturer’s website.</span></p>

<p>Hi Nokians,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After I have upgraded E71's firmware to 200.21.118, the GPS positioning server address is changed from</p>
<p>supl.nokia.com</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>h-slp.mnc016.mcc502.pub.3gppnetwork.org</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now my A-GPS not working. Previously, it took less than 1 minute to show my current position.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
On another issue,&nbsp; If I turn "assisted" off, GPS is not working as well -- not able to showmy current position.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>200.21.118<br />

<p>Hi there</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can edit the positioning server by entering menu, tools, settings, general, positioning, positioning server, server address.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Change it to the supl.nokia.com and make sure the correct access point is selected. It must be a WEB and NOT a WAP access point. i.e there must be no proxy configuration on the access point selected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps you.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How I can load an app on my Window phone 6.5</h2>
                    <p>I'm using HTC phone with windows 6.5 professional. When ever I want to load any app on my phone, it asks to login into window account. When I login, it shows message that there is no registered phone. I know that Microsoft has stopped Marketplace. Please
 let me know, how I can load an app on my phone?</p>
<p>Does&nbsp;Microsoft provide supports only to latest version of phone and not to earlier one?</p>
<p>If so I would like to say sorry to windows phones for ever.</p>
<p>Please answer soon with authentic answer.</p>

            <p>Microsoft's current app marketplace for windows phone can only be used with windows phone 7 &amp; 8 phones and none of the apps in that marketplace can be installed on a windows mobile device.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You've got an old phone that runs a discontinued mobile OS. There's still lots of fine software you can get for a windows mobile device, but since the windows mobile OS was discontinued several years ago, many newer apps won't be available and the apps that
 are compatible for your phone have reached the end of their development and will never be updated. Most&nbsp;developers are only&nbsp;supporting and creating apps for the more modern and prevelent mobile OS's.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can find places on the web that sell &amp; distribute windows mobile software. Any place you&nbsp;find that requires a windows live account before you can install software does NOT provide compatible software for your phone - a windows live account is a requirement
 for the windows phone 7 or 8 OS but is NOT a requirement for the windows mobile OS.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can search through some of the threads in this forum to find links to some 3rd party or developer websites you could use. If you're looking for some specific software for your phone, tell us what you're looking for and we might be able to recommend software
 you could use. </p>

    <title>Bing Ads Suspended After Two Days - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Bing Ads Suspended After Two Days</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>***** Update 6/1/17 *****</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last update from Bing Support, for the update, please scroll to the bottom of this original response or do a search for 'Update 6/1/17' &nbsp;Thanks!</p>

***** Update 6/1/17 *****</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>***** Update 5/25/17 *****</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have since gotten an update from Bing Support, for the update, do a search for 'Update 5/25/17' &nbsp;Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>***** Update 5/25/17 *****</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Full disclosure, I am an affiliate marketer and I only use white hat methods to promote my products. &nbsp;I wholly respect the wishes of my customers when it comes to email communication, opting out of email lists, and I do not share nor sale their personal
 information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's my story:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I opened my first and only Bing Ads account on 4/29, everything went fine for the first 24 hours. &nbsp;The next day when I logged in, I was told that my account has been suspended due to suspicious activities and that I should call customer support. &nbsp;I spoke
 with a customer rep named, Dyan, and she assured me that this was customary and that my account looks fine and everything checks out. &nbsp;She even went as far to let me know that she can expedite the review process so that I can be on my way with Bing ads. &nbsp;To
 my surprise, this is the email I received the next day:</p>
<p>
</p><p>---------- beginning of email ----------&nbsp;</p>
Hi Ken,<br />
<br />
This is Dyan with Bing Ads Support.<br />
<br />
I tried to call you today but the line was busy.<br />
<br />
Based on our review, your account FXXXXXX has been closed. For privacy and security reasons, we cannot provide details around your specific account closure, but the most common reasons that require us to close Bing Ads accounts include:<br />
<br />
The payment method on file was not authorized by the account owner.<br />
<br />
The account was accessed without authorization.<br />
<br />
The account is related to an account that was previously closed.<br />
<br />
The account was determined to be high-risk to other customers or advertisers, as stated in our Editorial Guidelines.<br />
<br />
As described in the Bing Ads Terms and Conditions, we do not need to state a specific reason for account closure. Please know that we have taken this matter seriously and have thoroughly investigated the issue. This decision is final and we consider the issue
 closed.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Dyan| &nbsp;Bing Ads Support<br />

<p>---------- end of email ----------&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I received the above email, I then decided to contact Bing Ads support to plead for help. &nbsp;I can't remember who I spoke with, but he told me there is nothing that he can do but he can escalate this to the editorial team which will take about 10 business
 days. &nbsp;After about 15 business days with no answer, I decided to call Bing Ads today...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spoke with Amand (I hope I spelled your name correctly), he was trying to be as helpful and honest as he can be and pretty much told me that my account is permanently closed and there is nothing I can do. &nbsp;Pretty much, "I AM DONE WITH BING ADS." &nbsp;I feel
 I am being judged too harshly and quickly only after 1 day with Bing Ads. &nbsp;Also, I have seen the same products being advertised on Bing Ads. &nbsp;I don't really have a next course of action within the official channel for Bing Ads since they told me that I'm done.
 &nbsp;So I'm here to plead my case and hopefully someone in Bing Ads that has the authority can review my case. &nbsp;Here are the 4 points from the email that I might of violated:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The payment method on file was not authorized by the account owner.<br />
<br />
The account was accessed without authorization.<br />
<br />
The account is related to an account that was previously closed.<br />
<br />
The account was determined to be high-risk to other customers or advertisers, as stated in our Editorial Guidelines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I can prove to you that I am the account owner of the site and the credit card(s).</p>
<p>If my account was accessed suspiciously, I'm sure I can create a stronger password or even provide my IPs if needed to prove my location.</p>
<p>This is my first account with Bing Ads, there are no other accounts.</p>
<p>If I have broken any editorial guidelines, I would like to be given an opportunity to fix it instead of just shutting my account down. &nbsp;I also have reviewed your guidelines. &nbsp;All my pages has privacy policy, terms and conditions, and the testimonials I have
 are suffixed with a disclaimer. &nbsp;On the advertising side of things, all my ads do not make any false promises or miracles that I know of. &nbsp;The messages are relatively conservative in nature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I'm asking is an opportunity for someone in the Bing Ads team to review my case thru the phone or in person if we're in the geographical vicinity. &nbsp;You can see that I am real and I just want an opportunity to work this out instead of behind a bunches
 of 0s and 1s. &nbsp;Thank you for your time and I hope to hear from you soon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ken</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>------------------------------------------ Update 5/25/17&nbsp;---------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is an addendum to my situation, please read above for the whole story. &nbsp;Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mandy from Microsoft support reached out to me yesterday (5/24) to better understand the situation. &nbsp;She was able to re-open the ticket for me so that my account can be reviewed once again by the higher-ups. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I received a call from Mandy, and she informed me that the decision to keep my account closed still stands.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reasons given were the same canned response I've been given from my last 3 encounters with customer support and for security reasons they can disclose the exact cause on why my account was shut down despite the fact I have been completely transparent
 with Bing Ads support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this juncture, I really have no other options in pursuing to do business&nbsp;with Microsoft. &nbsp;I also believe I have been judged harshly on their decision to close my account permanently. &nbsp;For the record, I have NEVER opened a Bing ads account, this is my
 first. &nbsp;Second, I am promoting a product that other advertisers are also promoting in Bing Ads. &nbsp;Third, my account was only active for 1 or maybe 2 days max. &nbsp;After 2 days, with no human contact from Bing, you decided to close my account, despite the fact
 I have repeatedly trying to engage with customer support and trying to fix this situation. &nbsp;I know I am NOT a fraud and have every documentation to do so, yet your decision stands...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am VERY disappointed with how I've been treated by Microsoft. &nbsp;From here on out, I would advise my friends and readers to stay away from doing business with Microsoft. &nbsp;This is my story and if you decide to conduct business with them, this could be your
 story too. &nbsp;I understand Bing isn't Google Adwords, but even Google wasn't that harsh and I'm happy to give money to your competitors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, I am tired and yes I can open another account and hope that I wouldn't get caught, but I'm not that kind of person. &nbsp;From one human being to another, Microsoft (as an entity) did not make me feel like one. &nbsp;I wish you the best, but I'm out,
 you have lost a loyal customer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the record, Mandy, Microsoft customer support supervisor, has been nothing but stellar to me. &nbsp;She listened and was very kind to me. &nbsp;In fact, all the customer support agents were fine, the higher-ups (I really don't know who they are, for all intensive
 purposes, they could have been Sauron the Dark Lord) just wouldn't talk to me so that I can remedy this. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you hate your job that much? &nbsp;</p>
<p>So that you have to make other people feel like ****?</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>------------------------------------------ Update 6/1/17&nbsp;---------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will probably be the last update and marked the end of the saga that I have been through with Bing Ads and Support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2 days ago, I received a call from Mandy and she has told me that my account has been reopened and should I choose to do business with Bing ad, it is totally up to me. &nbsp;Yesterday I was able to go back to my account and I am now running ads with Bing. &nbsp;So
 far my ads have been running with no issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to take the opportunity to publicly commend Mandy for her determination and conviction in getting my account review and for believing in me that I am genuine. &nbsp;Not sure if this will ever make it back to&nbsp;Satya Nadella, but you have a model employee
 on your hand. &nbsp;I truly believe that it is employees like Mandy that makes all the difference in the world. &nbsp;Again, thank you so so much for your help!</p>

</p><p>I spoke with Amand (I hope I spelled your name correctly), he was trying to be as helpful and honest as he can be and pretty much told me that my account is permanently closed and there is nothing I can do. &nbsp;Pretty much, "I AM DONE WITH BING ADS." &nbsp;I feel
 I am being judged too harshly and quickly only after 1 day with Bing Ads. &nbsp;Also, I have seen the same products being advertised on Bing Ads. &nbsp;I don't really have a next course of action within the official channel for Bing Ads since they told me that I'm done.
 &nbsp;So I'm here to plead my case and hopefully someone in Bing Ads that has the authority can review my case. &nbsp;Here are the 4 points from the email that I might of violated:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The payment method on file was not authorized by the account owner.<br />
<br />
The account was accessed without authorization.<br />
<br />
The account is related to an account that was previously closed.<br />
<br />
The account was determined to be high-risk to other customers or advertisers, as stated in our Editorial Guidelines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I can prove to you that I am the account owner of the site and the credit card(s).</p>
<p>If my account was accessed suspiciously, I'm sure I can create a stronger password or even provide my IPs if needed to prove my location.</p>
<p>This is my first account with Bing Ads, there are no other accounts.</p>
<p>If I have broken any editorial guidelines, I would like to be given an opportunity to fix it instead of just shutting my account down. &nbsp;I also have reviewed your guidelines. &nbsp;All my pages has privacy policy, terms and conditions, and the testimonials I have
 are suffixed with a disclaimer. &nbsp;On the advertising side of things, all my ads do not make any false promises or miracles that I know of. &nbsp;The messages are relatively conservative in nature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I'm asking is an opportunity for someone in the Bing Ads team to review my case thru the phone or in person if we're in the geographical vicinity. &nbsp;You can see that I am real and I just want an opportunity to work this out instead of behind a bunches
 of 0s and 1s. &nbsp;Thank you for your time and I hope to hear from you soon.</p>

</p><p>------------------------------------------ Update 5/25/17&nbsp;---------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is an addendum to my situation, please read above for the whole story. &nbsp;Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mandy from Microsoft support reached out to me yesterday (5/24) to better understand the situation. &nbsp;She was able to re-open the ticket for me so that my account can be reviewed once again by the higher-ups. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I received a call from Mandy, and she informed me that the decision to keep my account closed still stands.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reasons given were the same canned response I've been given from my last 3 encounters with customer support and for security reasons they can disclose the exact cause on why my account was shut down despite the fact I have been completely transparent
 with Bing Ads support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this juncture, I really have no other options in pursuing to do business&nbsp;with Microsoft. &nbsp;I also believe I have been judged harshly on their decision to close my account permanently. &nbsp;For the record, I have NEVER opened a Bing ads account, this is my
 first. &nbsp;Second, I am promoting a product that other advertisers are also promoting in Bing Ads. &nbsp;Third, my account was only active for 1 or maybe 2 days max. &nbsp;After 2 days, with no human contact from Bing, you decided to close my account, despite the fact
 I have repeatedly trying to engage with customer support and trying to fix this situation. &nbsp;I know I am NOT a fraud and have every documentation to do so, yet your decision stands...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am VERY disappointed with how I've been treated by Microsoft. &nbsp;From here on out, I would advise my friends and readers to stay away from doing business with Microsoft. &nbsp;This is my story and if you decide to conduct business with them, this could be your
 story too. &nbsp;I understand Bing isn't Google Adwords, but even Google wasn't that harsh and I'm happy to give money to your competitors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, I am tired and yes I can open another account and hope that I wouldn't get caught, but I'm not that kind of person. &nbsp;From one human being to another, Microsoft (as an entity) did not make me feel like one. &nbsp;I wish you the best, but I'm out,
 you have lost a loyal customer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the record, Mandy, Microsoft customer support supervisor, has been nothing but stellar to me. &nbsp;She listened and was very kind to me. &nbsp;In fact, all the customer support agents were fine, the higher-ups (I really don't know who they are, for all intensive
 purposes, they could have been Sauron the Dark Lord) just wouldn't talk to me so that I can remedy this. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you hate your job that much? &nbsp;</p>
<p>So that you have to make other people feel like ****?</p>
<p>
</p><p>------------------------------------------ End of Update 5/25/17&nbsp;------------------------------------------</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to speak to me again today. I am very happy that we were able to get this issue resolved for you and restore the access to your account. It has been my pleasure assisting you. Please reach back out&nbsp;with any questions or concerns.

<p>Dear Rohan .... read my question again completely .all the steps needed to be taken and suggested were taken by me and mentioned&nbsp; . You should have read question properly and instead getting personal should have remained confined to answer if you you know
 anything better .learn etiquette. You are associated with a big organisation. Most of windows customers spend more time on windows than their work for which it is bought. For your information product as bought and not stolen. Okay ? and withdrawing support
 after 5 or 7 years is well panned marketing conspiracy of most such organisations to launch modified products and forces consumers to sped. Serious marketing ethics are involved. Better avoid such discussions. I am fed up with windows 10 and office 2007 both
 . The only good product Microsoft ever launched was windows 98</p>

    <title>Cancelling an update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chris lp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cancelling an update</h2>
                    <p>So I was wondering what everyone else thinks. I feel at least on the insider builds we should have a way to either A) pick and choose which upgrades get downloaded or B) Cancel an upgrade that has started or been queued.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Part of why I suggest this is for my own benefit and part for the purpose of being able to say "well I installed this update and by itself ran fine but then installed this update and started blue screening etc." For my own benefit take like tonight I looked
 at the list of updates a complete new insider build was not in the list. So I went ahead and told it to get the updates. I was then shocked to see the build appear. The problem I have with this is I work long hours came home was actually going to have an hour
 and a half or so to unwind online gaming and now instead I'm stuck waiting on a preview build to download and install. So my hour and a half has dwindled now to maybe an hour if I'm lucky. If MS would give us a way to stop or pause or anything I would have
 had the ability to do that and not have to just wait.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do you guys think?</p>

            <p>Sorry, but being in insider program is not democratic or free program to choose what you want.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its more like being a mouse in scientific study when it gets that experimental injection that mouse cannot say "wait, I want the next one". The study on the mouse is to find out what are the results from each injection on that mouse.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Insiders are getting to test new builds before public release and Microsoft needs results from each build not just a build that you choose.</p>

            Well, when your pc gives message "do not turn off your pc..... with some update results appearing on the screen... (during install process) Try playing your game and let us know what the results are?.

            I was more thinking about what he said that when he got home there was the download and Preparing to install that interrupted his game playing.&nbsp; Since at this time you can get out of Settings and you have access to the Start menu or the Desktop and should
 be able to launch a game.&nbsp; Also you can defer the restart that does the install.<br />
There is also the fact that if you turn on your computer and do not go anywhere the download and preparing to install can happen without you noticing it until Notifications tells you.

            <p>Hi Chris</p>
<p>
</p><p>JMarco is correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you commit to test a pre-release version of any software package there are some things that you must accept.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One main thing is that the program must be used as intended to be used by the customer&nbsp;when it is released. Another is that you never install pre-release software on your main, primary computer.</p>

            <p>agree you can get games to work during download but when <strong>install</strong> starts with ...do not turn off...... message. your pc is in installation grip.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway insider Chris LP wanted to choose his updates or just postpone them. Insiders can choose slow or wait for that new lane to defer fast lane build installs. But if you need pc for games to relax I would think using one with insider build is not the
 best choice. Once insider build begins its install process games are interrupted.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows Device Recovery Tool</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I had previously restored my Lumia 520 with the&nbsp;Nokia Software Updater For Retail_4.1.0 and got my phone to work when there was an error with launching apps. This had installed Cyan on the phone and then I could upgrade to Denim with OTA</p>
<p>
</p><p>The phone now has an error: "ERROR: Unable to find a bootable option. Press any key to shut down." and does not switch on. I downloaded the Windows Device Recovery Tool Installer, this could not detect the phone firmware however was able to connect to the
 phone. It downloads the firmware for Black and when installing on the phone throws an error - "The software is not correctly signed or not signed for this phone."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe the problem is with the firmware being downloaded by the recovery tool. I guess the 520 does not support Denim to be installed and only Cyan can be installed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I can remember the phone came with Windows 8.0 and Black, which I had then updated to Cyan and then to Denim.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way or link for me to download the Cyan firmware as the recovery tool by default downloads Denim. I did chat with support but they did not really understand my request and after the usual troubleshooting suggested me to take the phone to a service
 center.</p>

            <p><em>ERROR: Unable to find a bootable option. Press any key to shut down.<br />
</em>This error message sadly indicates hardware failure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some users have reported being able to recover with unofficial tools, but to me it is like a hard drive failing with 'bad sectors' - better replace it now, instead of have it fail again soon with important data.<br />
The error launching apps suggests&nbsp;this issue has been lurking for some time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The required motherboard replacement is not economically advisable. A second-hand 520 or even a new budget Lumia is more affordable.</p>

<p>I've created a form to view the details of a lighting component based on a combobox selection that returns a value to an invisible textbox.</p>

<p>Instead to put a filter on a text box (what is the use of it?), use your combo-box (cmbCombBoxName). Also I will first do the check and then open recordset, instead to open recordset, do the check of value in the combo box and then close recordset (no need
 to open recordset if the combo box is empty).</p>

            Hi ashokpappachan,
<br />What version of onenote is installed?  If you are talking about the new mini editing toolbar, it comes up when you select text, if you have the newest version installed.  It's in the insider build now, not sure if its in the general release version yet, if not, it soon will be.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6df9e1a2-ac50-445b-b1a3-78a876f9fc38?upload=true" />

            Click the 3 dots on the right, to open the menu. Under options is Enable experimental options (near the bottom) and the insider options are under their own section.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ddf75390-14f8-47f9-8933-54ad91aad4bc?upload=true" />

<h2>            &#35;FIELD&#33;</h2>
                    All of a sudden, when I use the 'sum' function in Excel, the result is #FIELD!&nbsp; I am not using the pivot table function and I don't have any linked data.&nbsp; In fact, I tried to calculate a sum on a brand new blank worksheet with the same result.&nbsp; Interestingly,
 I can calculate a sum if I am pulling the cells from another sheet within the workbook.&nbsp; Any help will be much appreciated.

<p><span>Hi KHHead,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for providing the information in detail.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Based on the formulae from the screenshot provided, when we tested at our end it gives the same result as you get, because of the error in the formulae.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Instead of the formulae you use, we suggest you to use “ =SUM(E2,E4)” gives the result 40 and “ =SUM(E2:E4)” gives the result 50.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
