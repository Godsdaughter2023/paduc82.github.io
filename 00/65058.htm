<h2>            Keyboard won&#39;t work on my laptop w&#47; Windows 7 or 8</h2>
                    <p>Keyboard won't work on my laptop. Originally running Windows 7. I've tried the laptop's keyboard, a usb keyboard, and a wireless keyboard. None worked. The first time this happened, a Dell tech got it to work by disabling some startup
 processes. After a few weeks the keyboard failed again and no matter what or how many processes I disabled, the keyboards don't work. Finally decided that the OS was corrupted and I installed Windows 8 Pro. That didn't help. Would appreciate some ideas - typing
 with the on-screen keyboard is no thrill.</p>

<p>I really have no idea what is going wrong, I went through the step by step guide of previously stated but nothing has changed. I have the new Asus netbook and I don't have the receipt of the laptop so I can't take it back to the store....

<h2>            My Skype account looks different today than it was yesterday</h2>
                    <p>I would like to change my Skype password.</p>
<p>After some tough hours of progress I could log into my Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on change password (in the Skype section) I get the "oops something went wrong", and after that I can go on to my Skype account.</p>
<p>However, this account looks completely different than the one I was editing yesterday, my name is there, but it's asking me to complete my payment details, and if I go to the billing details there is nothing. I've just loaded yesterday 10Euros Skype credit,
 I have auto recharge enabled, - all vanished. &nbsp;Also my personal details are missing; it looks like a new account, only my name on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just changed actually yesterday my home country because we moved, it was all there yesterday, and I cannot imagine that this change suddenly took away my Skype credit and all my further details.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, my Skype Apps (all, in the computer and the mobiles) still show the credit I have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone with similar experience???</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. I don't even try costumer support any more because it seems there is no one existing...</p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/0b4245f9-1d77-4b74-82d6-e1c2070da906" title="NandorSzederkenyi">
<p>
</p><p>The steps on how you can chat with a customer representative are listed on this support article:
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA10656/what-is-live-chat-support?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
What is live chat support?</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>When you are not seeing a "Text chat support" option and you're being&nbsp;routed to the Community, it is more likely because your concern can be diagnosed and resolved here.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>For your issue, it is true that you might have signed in to Skype with a different account. When you sign in to Skype using your Microsoft account (email or phone number) that is not connected to any Skype profile, it will result to the creation of&nbsp;a new
 Skype profile&nbsp;under your Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you reset your password for your Skype Name&nbsp;but you're getting an error, I strongly suggest you to clear the cache and cookies of your browser or use a different browser and let me know how it will turn out for you.</p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span> </span>
<p>There are a number of possible explanations for why security codes don't always arrive. Below are some of them:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Did your email send your security code to your junk folder?<br />
</strong>&nbsp;Please check your junk and SPAM&nbsp;folders for a message from Microsoft account, and use the code you find there. To prevent this from happening in the future, mark Microsoft as a
<em>
trusted sender</em>. Valid security codes come from an <em>
@accountprotection.microsoft.com </em>email address.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Your domain blocks the email from Microsoft</strong>. You need to contact your
 domain provider to know how to allow emails from Microsoft.</li><li><strong>You typed your email address incorrectly</strong>. Make sure you've typed your
 correct email on the password reset page to receive the security code.<br />
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><br />
</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>

<p>Thanks Jomel;&nbsp;</p>
<p>well, I tried chat several times without success.</p>
<p>Never mind the empty Skype account...</p>
<p>
</p><p>But no matter how, from what device (computer iPhone iPad) I am trying to change the password I end up at the code; tried all my email addresses, Skype user name, Microsoft username etc. it just not sending the code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I first time tried this last week, I've got auto emails from Microsoft that my account had "unusual activity" and because we moved from Austria to the UK, I assume that is the problem. Actually, I could login with an old computer, but because this computer
 doesn't have a new version of Skype on it (too old system) I cannot do the password change from there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I never had any issues with my Skype account, but because I see and hear from others having problems, I really should change my quite simple password, so I hope there is a solution to do that.</p>

1. The chances of passing the validation increase if you fill out this form from a computer you previously used to access the account.&nbsp;<br />

                    <p>I have purchased windows8 pro and downloaded the os online. when I tried to install the same on my Windows8 release preview platform the following error messages showed after installing 90%. " Setup is unable to initialize the start up folder" then "setup

            <p>I had this problem too, and could not find an answer:&nbsp;&nbsp; What I found was I had attempted to setup and failed.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I looked in the C:\ drive, I found a temp install directory.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is what I did to clean it up:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Hit (Windows + R) keys and type c:\ (or what ever your install drive is)</p>
<p>2) Look for a folder called $WINDOWS.~BT</p>
<p>3) Rt click on folder and rename to OLD_$WINDOWS.~BT (it won't delete without admin perms, so you'll need to clean it later.</p>
<p>4) Open Task Manager (rt click on Windows Start Bar, select Task manager)</p>
<p>5) Find and highlight "Windows 8 Setup (2)" or "Windows 8 Setup"</p>
<p>6) Choose End task</p>
<p>Result:</p>
<p>Trying running setup again, and see if it works now.&nbsp;&nbsp; If yes, when you are all done, remember to go back to your C: drive and delete the OLD_$WINDOWS.~BT directory</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps some of you!&nbsp; Good luck!</p>

<h2>            Error Code&#58; 0xc00000e9 - Help re-installing Windows&#33;</h2>
                    Hello, I have a Toshiba Satellite C855D-S5209 with Windows 8 (Upgraded from Windows 7) recently it was getting laggy and freezing so I thought I would re-install Windows 8 onto it, this was last week so it didn't happen right after I installed it, but
 I'm assuming that's the reason for it because I didn't do anything else unusual on my laptop
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried to get on this morning and I got this error&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />

<div><b>Press Enter to try again</b></div>

<div>Also, the file name that it says is missing or corrupted sometimes changes or sometimes it is the first screen that loads</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried putting my windows 8 (and tried Windows 7) installation disc in but it wont boot from the disc.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I just want to know how I can at least load my windows installation disc to re-install the operating system? Its barely a year old and I cant replace it, so any help would be appreciated, thanks!</div>

            Hello,
<div><br />
<div>If you have the ISO image or setup for any of the Windows edition regardless of preview version or stable one, make a bootable flash drive with it. Now try to install the edition using this bootable drive on a empty or less used drive (making dual boot).
 This probably will fix the errors happened during booting. Once you installed new edition try to boot into the same. After one boot restart the system and now boot to your old edition, most probably it will boot normally now. Once it booted, format the drive
 on which you installed edition using bootable drive as mentioned above. Now everything should be normal.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>You can also try to <b>Reset</b> at booting :</div>
<div><br />

<p>This is a Dell utility called the “Dell Dock”. You can try reinstalling it. You maybe just lost the shortcut in the startup folder. You can download the app here

<p>Really wish I could help you but I don't remember how I did it exactly....</p>
<p>But if memory serves you have to do it from the xbox. &nbsp;you go to the parents account settings and find the child underneath and set it from there. &nbsp;can't be done from the website. &nbsp;it is remotely possible you go the child account and ask permission but I
 am pretty sure it is the parents account.</p>
<p>I remember it took several days and lots of experimenting to get it to work so the exact steps or fuzzy.... sorry!</p>
<p>If I think of anything I will drop another note.</p>

    <title>advanced tag editor - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> timgriffiths  say:</h3>
<h2>            advanced tag editor</h2>
                    Why do Microsoft insist on taking the perfectly functionable parts of their software and trash it? They did it with Movie Maker taking out the timeline and they have done it with Media Player taking out Advanced Tag Editor.<br />
<br />
Tag editor was the only way to correct mistakes properly because it wrote it to the original file rather than to the library.
<br />
<br />
The 'new' way of editing frankly doesn't work. I have tried to reassign a track wrongly labelled to a completely different album only to find that you cannot change reassign a track to another album in Media Player itself and have to go online, when you do
 this and edit all of the details the changes are not applied to the original track - very frustrating.&nbsp; I access my music library from two different machines, fortunately the older machine has the earlier version of Media Player on it and works perfectly.<br />
<br />
If you find that different spellings of the same band are used then they will be listed separately in Media Player. If you unify the spellings it brings them under the same heading - but only in that particular media player! To apply a change such as this across
 a network I have to go to the older version of Media Player and use Advanced Tag Editor.<br />
<br />
I find it interesting to note that on the Microsoft website the article on editing media information ends with the last resort being, you guessed it, Advanced Tag Editor!<br />
<br />
If it isn't broke don't fix it. I am hoping that Microsoft listen to their customers and bring it back. Meanwhile I am looking around the alternatives.<br />
<br />
Will Microsoft be bringing it back?<br />
<br />

    <title>How do I add extra memory&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I add extra memory&#63;</h2>
                    Ok so I'm a mom! Lol! My son has the Xbox 360 4gb kinect and he needs more memory to download games. What is the best and cheapest way to do this?? I've read you can use a USB, but then there's something about not being able to use HDD??? Whatever that
 is..... He is 9 so I don't know what all he needs for it. He has Xbox live and he uses his Microsoft points to download games, but it is now telling him he doesn't have enough space. So any advice, help, recommendations would be GREAT!!! Anything extra you
 think is an awesome add on too that he would enjoy would be great if you have recommendations! His bday is coming up and I would like to buy him more, but I totally don't know what all it can do....

<p>Pretty much any USB stick can be used for Xbox 360 storage, here is how to use one with your console
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/accessories/usb-flash-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../usb-flash-drive</a>. Be aware though that you can only use up to 16gb of space on the USB for 360 storage no matter how large it actually is.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>To use a hard drive with the 360 it needs to be an official Microsoft product <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-gb/Xbox360/Accessories/HardDrives/Home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.xbox.com/.../Home</a>. You can buy one at almost any retailer that sells Microsoft's console or online from places such as Amazon.</p>

<p>a hard drive is the wiser option, as memory sticks can only use up to 16GB and that will fill up fast. Make sure when purchasing a hard drive that it is an official microsoft product. There are plenty of cloned ones out there. Amazon are currently selling
 a 320GB hard drive that comes with a free code for lego star wars 3 :) it works out cheaper than buying a 250GB product. I bought this hard drive from amazon a week ago and can confirm it is official.</p>

<p>Thanks! I will probably go with getting the hard drive at GameStop. </p>
<p>His age was simply to explain around about reason why he doesn't know too much about why he need either so that's why he really can't tell me and I have no clue! As far as what he is doing or playing I have every parental control set and he only has the
 games "I" buy of course and he can't download anything without me entering the password to get to the Microsoft points or even his Xbox live. I have unfortunately had to report a few people who are incredibly rude and don't care that they are talking to a
 9 year old. So I'm not worried about what he's playing or any of that. I've been on top of that. I just don't know too much about the additional features you can buy as far as upgrades of any kind including hard drive. I haven't checked too much into it. Now
 the Xbox live and Microsoft point etc.... I have and thats is why I have an account and everything of course is in my name and my credit card so no way will he be getting access to that anytime soon! :)</p>
<p>Thx for the hard drive info! </p>

<p>If you ever want to add some serious memory to your Xbox 360, you're going to need to add an external hard drive. These units are easy to install, come in a variety of storage sizes (20GB to 250GB as of 2010), and let you save games and other media.</p>
<p>If you still want extra memory, the Xbox 360 recently began supporting flash drives, which can be plugged into the USB port in front of the Xbox (up to 32GB of memory).</p>

    <title>When does computer go to sleep when using &#34;do nothing&#34; option - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nsriku  say:</h3>
<h2>            When does computer go to sleep when using &#34;do nothing&#34; option for closing lid&#63;</h2>
                    I changed the setting on my computer to "do nothing" when I closed the lid of my computer. But I noticed, my computer does not seem to ever go to sleep when I close my lid now. I thought it would follow the regular power options to go to sleep after a
 certain amount of time, but it seems to not do so. How would I be able to change my computer setting to be able to do this?

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your question in the Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would like to let you know that when you close your laptop lid, Windows can “shut down”, “do nothing”, or “enter a power-saving state”, such as sleep or hibernation option you have selected. You can apply the same setting to all of your power plans
 or you can apply different settings to individual plans.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When you select the option “do nothing”, it means even after you close the lid the computer remains active as per the selection opted. To check if the options are working fine or not you may choose “shut down” or “enter a power-saving state”.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>There are three ways to shut down your PC—you can turn the PC off completely, you can make it sleep, or you can hibernate the PC. Refer to this article to know more about this topic.</span></p>

            Thank you for your help, but that's not exactly answering my question. I wanted to know if my computer will&nbsp;<em>eventually</em> go to sleep (and if I can set it to go to sleep after a specific set time) even if my computer is set to do nothing after my
 lid closes. Like can I ask my computer to do nothing at first but sleep after 20 minutes once I close my lid.&nbsp;

    <title>Has FBWGG got EASIER&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> praetorian viii  say:</h3>
<h2>            Has FBWGG got EASIER&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Back when I last played ME3 MP before I took a break from it, FBWGG farmers had a strategy.<br />
<br />
1x Inflitrator for the Terminal Objectives<br />
1x Salarian Eni with a Decoy to distract enemy Geth<br />
Toss a coin for the remaining 2 spots - another Engineer or an Adept maybe?&nbsp; Sentinel?<br />
Camp the control room<br />
<br />
Since I've returned to the MP side however and started farming because I'm far behind on the new characters and weapons (still need 2 N7s, 5 of the other DLC&nbsp;characters, all the weapons), only one of the strategy points seem relevant now - camp the control
 room.<br />
<br />
I've done successful&nbsp;FBWGG runs since my return&nbsp;with 2x Soldiers, an Adept, and a Vanguard (bio slash guy).&nbsp; Before my break, go into FBWGG with that party of characters and it was doomed for failure before Wave 3 ended.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
It's stupidly, mind-numbingly easy.&nbsp; You don't even need to try anymore.&nbsp; With all the buffs they gave to the Geth and the new modes (Retrieve, Escort) you'd actually think it would be harder since you'd have to come out of your camping spots to complete the
 objectives but it's not.&nbsp; It's somehow got easier.<br />
<br />
What do you guys thing?</p>

<p>That's what I thought too.<br />
<br />
Every game has at least one, usually it's the Slayer.<br />
<br />
Strange thing is that you don't even need the Inflitrator for the Terminals anymore, I did a game earlier where a Vorcha Soldier deactivated 3/4 terminals.<br />
<br />
Think it would&nbsp;be far harder if the Slayer's biotic slash move couldn't go through/round objects.&nbsp; I was spectating on one guy today who was doing the slash move whilst facing one of those huge storage containers up by where the jet was parked and he still
 managed to kill the final Prime to end the wave.</p>

<p>Yeah would make the gold runs a bit harder they've already nerfed the cool down for the slayer &amp; the shadow as the slashes were basically spammed out before I don't see bioware making that possible though they will properly nerf something that doesn't need
 nerfing just like battlefield 3 :( &nbsp;tell you what though praetorian I find the N7 destroyer &amp; the paladin great against geth on gold the N7 fury isn't that good though I've noticed against geth

<p>It was easy braindead easy before the N7 characters came out. It was braindead easy before the dlc with the Vorcha, Phoenix, etc came out. I wasn't around from the beginning but I'm 100% sure it was Braindead easy since release which is why people play on
 it and they are nowhere near ready for Gold or Platinum.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yeah but it seems even easier than it used to be.<br />
<br />
I remember having half a dozen Wave 3 fails because people weren't geared up properly - no Inflitrator, etc.&nbsp; It was easy back then but without the right gear/classes, you'd fail.&nbsp; Now?&nbsp; Now you can go in with any combination of classes and get a full extract.&nbsp;
 4x Soldiers?&nbsp; Easy.&nbsp; 4x characters below level 15?&nbsp; Easy.<br />
<br />
And so on.<br />
<br />
Maybe the farmers have honed their skills since I last played?&nbsp; Not that playing FBWGG takes skill mind you...</p>

<p>Now that I don't feel so left out and actually have a few new characters, I'm going back to proper Gold...if I can find any games that is.<br />
<br />
Joined a Gold game yesterday on Giant and had all my high level mods and weapons.&nbsp; I was ready wreck stuff.&nbsp; When I realised no one was following me to the vantage point where the ramp is, I checked the menu and found that the freaking host had switched it
 to Bronze.<br />
<br />
What a ***.&nbsp; I wasted my high level stuff on Bronze.</p>

<h2>            Toshiba Laptop startup registry error after manual shutdown</h2>
                    
<p>original title: Toshiba Laptop startup registry error after manual shutdown - HELP!</p>
<p>Hello,&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a Toshiba laptop with Windows Vista.&nbsp; Yesterday it completely froze up and I had to manually shut it down (holding down the power button until it shut down) twice.&nbsp; The second time when I tried to reboot it the Toshiba screen came up, then
 the screen with the little bar scrolling across the bottom, and then it went to black, waited for a while, and then flashes a blue screen with some writing at the top REALLY fast and cycles back to the Toshiba Screen.&nbsp; This time after the scrolling bar it
 gives me white writing saying the system failed to restart and do I want to start normally or do startup repair. If I say startup repair it goes through loading files, trying to repair, and then says it was not able to repair it and when I look at details
 it has something about a registry error.</p>
<p>I really need to fix this soon and desperately want to save all my files if possible because this is our main family laptop that has all our digital pictures on it and they are not backed up. (I know, terrible of us).&nbsp; Can anyone help me?</p>
<p>Thank&nbsp; you,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Charity</p>

<p><span>Try tapping F8 at startup, and from the&nbsp;list of startup selections, select Safe Mode by using UP Arrow Key to go there &gt; then&nbsp;hit Enter.<br />
<br />
Try a System Restore once there, to pick a Restore Point&nbsp;before your problem..<br />

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>If Restore does not work and you do not have a Microsoft Vista DVD, make a Bootable Repair Disk to do a Startup Repair:</span></span></strong></p>

<p><span>Go into your Bios/Setup, or Boot Menu, at startup, and change the Boot Order to make the DVD/CD drive 1st in the Boot Order, then reboot with the disk in the Drive.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At startup/power on you should see at the bottom of the screen either F2 or DELETE, to go into Bios/Setup, or F12 for the Boot Menu.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Above link shows what the process looks like, and a how-to, as it loads to the Repair Options.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Neosmart contains the contents of the Windows Vista DVD's "recovery center," as we've come to refer to it. It cannot be used to install or reinstall Windows Vista, and just serves
 as a Windows PE interface to recovering your PC. Technically, one could re-create this installation media with freely-downloadable media from Microsoft (namely the Microsoft WAIK kit, a multi-gigabyte download); but it's damn-decent of Microsoft to make this
 available to Windows' users who might not be capable of creating such a thing on their own.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Read all info at the website about creating and using it:</span><br />
<br />
<span><a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></a></span></p>

<p><br />
<span>It makes a very good Vista Startup Repair Disk.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
You can do a Startup Repair, System Restore, etc from it.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
It is <strong>NOT</strong> a reinstall disk.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And the 32bit is what comes normally on a computer, unless 64bits requested.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>Data Recovery:</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Slave your Hard Drive in another computer, and read/save your Data from there.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2. Put your Hard drive in a USB Hard Drive Enclosure, plug into another computer, and read/save from there.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3. Or, use Knoppix Live CD to recover your Data:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Download the Vista Burning software from the above link.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After installing above ISO burning software, right-click on Knoppix ISO file &gt; Copy Image to CD.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Knoppix does not install on your PC; just uses your PC's resources, RAM, Graphics, etc.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Change the Boot Order in YOUR computer/laptop to make the CD/DVD Drive 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; in the Boot Order.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Plug in a Flash Drive/Memory Stick, BOOT with the Live CD, and you should be able to read your Hard Drive.</span></p>
<p><span>When the desktop loads, you will see at least two hard drive icons on the desktop (one for your hard drive and one for the USB drive).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Click on the hard drive icons to open them up and figure out which drive is which.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Right-click the USB drive icon and choose "Actions &gt; Change read/write mode" so you can write to the drive (it's read-only by default for security reasons).</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Now find the files you want to back up and drag and drop them to the USB drive. When you are finished, shut down the system and remove the USB drive.</span></p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

<h2>            Hackers, Xbox Live,  and Activision as well as  whoever makes Call of Duty version X Klled the game</h2>
                    
<p>For those that Read this Great.&nbsp; For those that post&nbsp; and don't read thanks for being part of the problem.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has gotten there where I can play a game where I am not spawn killed at least 6 in every 10 games ... often by the same person to the game. ( this happens in most shooters so that is an issue in the making)
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for allowing people to get on on Dial up and to Modify their console so they can cheat all day long.... and not getting rid of or placing them in their on moder purgtory (this is aimed at Xbox Live and Canada and the EU) because of this it makes most
 online games unplayable. (btw I have a 36mb download and 2mb upload so it's not my issue)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and to the Cheater thanks for taking the fun out of the game... and the Skill proving that only those with the best toys .... Bought&nbsp;, stolen, and modified makes the best players.</p>
<p>I also want to Thank MS for **** mikes and Kinect as I have heard many&nbsp;a 12 year old being yelled at by their mothers .... as well as echoes of myself through their TVs&nbsp; as well as Bad music&nbsp;and Fans in the mikes thanks&nbsp;Xbox for low Quality</p>
<p>also thanks for makin the botmode unable to Prestiegeable... and exp not linked to&nbsp;both areas of multiplayer games&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheaters have ruined all the multi player fun... again Thanks... For doing nothing ... keep up the good work... oh I would say look forward to this in other games ... but too bad it's already there..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It has gotten there where I can play a game where I am not spawn killed at least 6 in every 10 games ... often by the same person to the game. (This happens in most shooters so that is an issue in the making)</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Don’t play so many objective games. &nbsp;Objective game spawns are so easily manipulated
<i><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">because of the objectives</span><span>. If you play more TDM you will see far less spawn trapping. &nbsp;I play Core TDM almost exclusively, and cannot remember ever being hard-core spawn trapped
 in it. &nbsp;</span></i></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><i><span>If you must play objective, learn to combat the spawn trapping. &nbsp;Learn to recognize when the team is attempting to spawn trap, then spend the game hunting the spawn trappers. Know where they
 will be trying to camp from, and always take them out fast enough to leave a hole in the spawn pattern (so that you can hopefully get away from spawn and begin hunting them.</span></i></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><i><span>Also, play with a team of friends, even if there are only 2 or 3 of you. &nbsp;A small group of coordinated players can be enough to turn the tide of a spawn trap game (or any game for that matter).</span></i></span></p>

<p>Thanks for allowing people to get on Dial up and to Modify their console so they can cheat all day long....</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">I can personally guarantee you that there are VERY FEW if any dialup players that are actually playing BO online in matchmaking. &nbsp;I know this from personal experience. &nbsp;It is possible to connect to XBL on a dialup connection,
 and it uses NO MODDING, in fact its easily capable because of a MS technology (internet connection sharing). &nbsp;However, COD:BO requires too much bandwidth to be playable on even good dialup. &nbsp;I recently spent a week out of town with family, they only have dialup
 access, I was able to connect and play combat training, nothing more. &nbsp;Imposible for me to join a game.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">When I was younger, and first got my Xbox360, I lived where there was only dialup. &nbsp;I used dialup to play Halo 3 online. No game was even joinable if it had more than 6 total players (me included). Only 4 player games were really
 playable (i.e. Team Doubles). &nbsp;The halo 3 net engine is much older, and thus assumingly lower bandwidth. &nbsp;BO needs about 50Kbps upstream and downstream at all times while in game (roughly 25Kbps in lobby). &nbsp;These measurements are far outside even the best
 dialup connections (though still technically possible on paper).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">All that most dialup users that are even connecting to XBL are using it for is for online content, or to access certain parts of the game, only avail when online but that don’t actually use the internet (i.e. combat training).</span></p>

<p>and not getting rid of or placing them in their on moder purgtory (this is aimed at Xbox Live and Canada and the EU) because of this it makes most online games unplayable. (btw I have a 36mb download and 2mb upload so it's not my issue)</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">I’m all for ridding the net of cheaters and modders, but what’s with the anger to the UK and Canada players. &nbsp;If you are having issues playing with these people its not because of your net or theirs, its because of how far away
 they are. &nbsp;The solution? Set your searches to local, or local only. &nbsp;I live in the northern part of the US and have no problems playing with many Canada players. Just because you do doesn’t meant that I should not be able to. Accept that there are limitations
 in the connection quality over long distances and that you will occasionally have to play with laggy players. Do your best to compensate for it yourself, with the settings you have available to you.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">I would have to agree that there are some thing bought that give unfair advantages. But if you are simply referring to sounds systems, HDTV's or headsets, you are wrong. &nbsp;People who argue that HDTV or surround sound are unfair
 advantages or cheating need to look at the facts. &nbsp;Surround sound has been part of games for over 10 years now, long before XBL was even around. &nbsp;Thats right, surround sound was part of Xbox games before online!!! &nbsp;Further more HDTV has been something that
 was part of the original (in a max 480P widescreen format) and part of the 360 (up to 1080P) since release of those consoles. &nbsp;It is part of the system built into the games and cannot be considered an unfair advantage.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">I have issues with this game, but there very few cheaters in it, at least to my experience. &nbsp;There do seem to be issues with lag, specifically if you are host, but that’s not cheating. &nbsp;I understand if you want the patches faster,
 but remember that they are at least updating this one as much as they can, while others will be luck if they ever receive and update again (and thus are now rampant with cheaters).</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is unusual that you got 6.35.0.54 version of Skype after the update. The latest Skype for iOS version should be 8.4.0.53426 or 8.4.0.53425 which we are calling as the New Skype.</p>
<p>For this case, we advise you to uninstall Skype using iTunes, and reinstall the app using the App Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know what happens after the update, and check if this resolves your issue with contacts. I am looking forward to your response.</p>
<p>

            Hi Jomel<br />
<br />
First of all, I'm so sorry for this late, late reply, I've been out of town and could check the devise only now.<br />
<br />
No luck, the latest Skype update available is still 6.35.0.54, even after uninstalling and installing the app again.<br />
Maybe it's a limitation of the Ipad2?<br />
<br />
By the way, uninstalling everything and reinstalling (predictably) cleared the call history from all marked and unmarked calls, which was kind of the point of the request. Is there a way (any way, really) to get back the call history of the account?

<p>
</p><p>1. What’s the make and model of the Mouse?<br />
2. Have you tried connecting the Mouse to a different USB port?<br />
3. Have you made any recent changes on the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try connecting the Mouse to a different USB port and check if the Mouse works, you may even try connecting the mouse to a different computer and check if the Mouse works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to run Hardware and Devices troubleshooter and check it works.</p>
<p>
