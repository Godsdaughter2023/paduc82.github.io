<h2>            new opened web page opens behind original</h2>
                    When I access a link on a web page, sometimes the new opening screen will open up behind the original page that I pressed the link on. I would have to minimize the original page to see the new page. What causes and solution to this problem?

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Tab options, perhaps.&nbsp;&nbsp; Try pressing&nbsp; Shift-&nbsp; or&nbsp; Ctrl+Shift-&nbsp; when you click on a link?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also try Shift-Middleclick.&nbsp;&nbsp; Or, if you think it is a popup window, press&nbsp; Alt+Ctrl- when clicking.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Also, are you saying that you can't get the background window both into focus and on top by using Alt-Tab too?&nbsp;&nbsp; That would be a significantly different symptom.&nbsp;&nbsp; XP users&nbsp;might try&nbsp;&nbsp; TweakUI's&nbsp; maximal avoidance of focus-stealing to modify
 that symptom.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not sure what causes that but I once saw it in XP with OE windows.&nbsp;&nbsp; That's how I found out about the TweakUI mod.&nbsp; I also saw&nbsp;a related symptom a long time ago with the Taskbar Auto-hide function.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Heh.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was just experimenting with&nbsp; Task Manager's right-click Bring to Front command for you and found that not all windows respect that command.&nbsp;&nbsp; But that is another thing that you could try.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>BTW always disclose your OS and version of IE when you are asking for help with&nbsp;UI features.</div>

    <title>Access Report Columns and Page Breaks - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danwhxu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Access Report Columns and Page Breaks</h2>
                    <p>I have a report that is generated with three subreports in the detail section.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have each sub report stacked on top of each other with a small space inbetween.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each subreport is less than 4 inches in width.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I want to do is to have each sub report print out on two columns each on its&nbsp;own page</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I set each subreport for two columns, everything works, but not on its own page and the second sub report will begin in column 2 then go to column 1 on the next page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When&nbsp;I put page breaks between each sub report, it no longer prints in two columns but only in one column.&nbsp; When I remove the page breaks, it all goes back to 2 columns but not separated by pages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anybody offer any suggestions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Dan</p>

            My guess is that you have set up the subreports' columns to flow <i>'down then across</i>', what are known as
<i>'newspaper columns'</i>.&nbsp; This was possible in Access 95, but since then, for some unknown reason, has not worked in subreports, only in parent reports, though I can only speak categorically for version up to 2007 as I don't use anything later than that.&nbsp;
 Multi-column subreports only work with an&nbsp; 'across then down' column flow.

            I did have 'down then across' column flow and changed it 'across then down' and nothing seems to happen.

            <p>It sounds like you have set the main report to use two columns when you need to set each subreport to two columns.&nbsp; Make each subreport wide enough for both columns and, as Ken said, in general the subreport columns should be set to Across then Down.&nbsp; Also
 make sure you uncheck the Same as Detail box and specify the column width manually.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>After doing taking care of all that, you can then add PageBreak controls between the subreports.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If your subreports always fit on a single page, you might be able to make the subreport CONTROLs on the main report tall enough to display all their records.&nbsp; If you can do this without trying to exceed the section limit of 22 inches, you can then set column
 snaking to Down then Across.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If doing that exceeds the 22 inch limit, you can create a group header and footer section based on the same field(s) that are used to sort the records.&nbsp; Then you can place each subreport in its own section where the 22 inch limit is applied to each section
 separately.</p>

    <title>CK-600 software 3.02 update failure - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> st_halcyon  say:</h3>
<h2>            CK-600 software 3.02 update failure</h2>
                    
<p>Hello:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A couple months ago I bought a Nokia CK-600 from Europe and had it imported to the USA.&nbsp; I finally got it today, and it works great.&nbsp; I looked at the Settings tab, and it is showing it is running on version 2.36.&nbsp; Having owned a CK-100 and had multiple experiences
 with upgrading the firmware, I decided to update the CK-600.&nbsp; Was able to download the latest, 3.02, but when I try to update the CK-600, I get the following error message:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Connection to the device was interrupted.&nbsp; Check your USB cable and device power."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Using the Nokia DKE-2 cable.</li><li>Using a regular USB 2.0 cable that came with my external hard drive.</li><li>I tried above two on my main PC (Win 7 Pro 64 bit).</li><li>Same but with my secondary PC (Win XP Pro).</li><li>The first few attempts were done with Nokia Car Kit Software Updater version 1.4.1.</li><li>Then I tried again using the latest Nokia Car Kit Software Updater, version 1.4.4.</li><li>I also went to my Windows Device Manager's Power Management setting for the CK-600, and unchecked "Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power."</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The device manager recognizes the CK-600 device just fine, using Nokia driver 1.0.0.8 dated June 27, 2010.&nbsp; But no matter what, near the end, the update simply fails with that error.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anybody know what the problem could be?&nbsp; Updating my older Nokia Car Kits have always been an easy task, except for the CK-600.&nbsp; Please help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS:&nbsp; I should also add that when I initiate the update, Windows disconnects from the device, reconnects, disconnects, then reconnects (just like the CK-100 as well as when doing firmware updates on cell phones, except with cell phones the disconnect/reconnect
 cycle is just once instead of twice).&nbsp; The error occurs about 45 seconds after the final reconnect.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>The screen must be attached to the control unit for the update, yes. Without the screen, the update will fail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Power is needed to the unit too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully this is the cause of the problem you are experiencing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Online update instructions below)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Download Nokia Car Kit Software Updater tool and save it to your computer.
</li><li>Install Nokia Car Kit Software Updater and accept installation of drivers (if such warnings appear).
</li><li>Launch Nokia Car Kit Software Updater, click on the arrow to start the update, and follow instructions.
</li><li>If Internet connection is permanently available, then select
<strong>Download software and update device</strong>. Otherwise, you may firstly to download a new software (<strong>Download software only</strong>), and than when Internet is not available to update device (<strong>Update device with local software</strong>).
</li><li>Connect Nokia Car Kit CK-600 to your PC with Nokia Connectivity Cable DKE-2 or a standard USB cable with mini-USB connector. Start the ignition on your car.
<br />
Please make sure that the display SU-34 of the car kit is connected to the hands-free unit HF-23 all the time.
</li><li>Nokia Car Kit Software Updater will check for new updates on the Nokia Firmware Server. This can take several minutes, which depends on speed of Internet connection you have.
</li><li>Accept the license agreement and the firmware will start reflashing of the device.
</li><li>You can be prompted again to accept installation and use of a driver.
</li><li>Wait for the new software to be updated. Enjoy your updated Car Kit!
</li></ol>
<p>Important: If you do not have a USB driver for CK-600 installed (for instance you declined installation of drivers when it was prompted), install it by following the instructions at the bottom of this page.</p>

<h2>            Where is Name Manager&#63;</h2>
                    just found out there is no name manager in mac version. there is another advantage of the windows version. now when I change the name (label) of a defined name, I got to go search for all references of the name and replace it with the new name. the 2007
 name manager does it for me automatically.

    <title>Hotmail to Outlook - Name&#47;email change problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jaimin patel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hotmail to Outlook - Name&#47;email change problem</h2>
                    Ok when i first got to know about Outlook around 1 or 2 months ago, i wanted to try it and signed up. Without knowing that i would lose my Hotmail email, i created a new Outlook email address. Only after, i realized that my Hotmail ID was gone and for
 all Windows/Xbox products and sites i had to use my new Outlook to sign in. <br />
<br />
I recently found out that there is a option to merge those accounts. That i can get my Hotmail ID back and have the same *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.
<br />
<br />
Is this true? <br />
<br />
If not, is there a way i can delete my *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and get my old Hotmail ID and get that with Outlook extension?<br />
<br />
For eg.- my Hotmail ID was *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and my current is *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, coz i didnt get *** Email address is removed for privacy *** then, and now I hear, there is a way to get your original id on outlook.<br />
<br />
Please help.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

            I actually read all the previous Answers and was able to work though it. I have my original @Hotmail ID.
<br />
<br />
Thank you Dan T, all the Moderators and Users.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I got one more Question though!<br />
<br />
Now what happens to the people who still have their @Hotmail ID's in the future? Will they become @Outlook automatically? Will they merge? Or will they remain the same without Hotmail existing at all?<br />

<p>Good to know that your issue has been resolved.</p>
<p>Microsoft account users can keep their existing @hotmail, @live, or @msn address with the option to get a new @outlook.com address.

            Hello Johan, <br />
<br />
Sorry for responding this late to your post, but this is a question that's been bothering me. I have a good @hotmail.com address(*** Email address is removed for privacy ***) and am having trouble finding the same or similar variations with @outlook.com(all are taken). I
 did settle for an alternate @outlook alias, but i'm not happy with it and would like to have an address which is similar to my Hotmail but with a Outlook extension. I don't find this fair since i've been using Hotmail for more than 12 years now.<br />
What happens to Hotmail now? I know and even you mentioned that I can keep my @hotmail ID, but for how long? Will I have to switch? What happens to Hotmail? What if i want a @outlook extension that is proper like my @hotmail one? I really want a *** Email address is removed for privacy ***,
 or something with my initials without adding any numbers to them.<br />
<br />
Is there any way to get around it? Please help.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />

<h2>            close dashboard in  Outlook mailbox</h2>
                    Does anyone know how to close the dashboard in the new Outlook mailbox?&nbsp; It is so annoying, and if the dashboard cannot be closed I will go back to hotmail.<br />
<br />
Many, many thanks!<br />

            Firstly be aware that this forum is for the Outlook component of MS Office, not the web-based email application. (Why oh WHY did MS decide to go back to complicating things? It was bad enough when there was Outlook and Outlook Express...)<br />
Secondly I presume by the "dashboard" you mean the large panel that appears when you click the arrow just to the right of "Outlook" on the top l/H side of the window and has large icons for Mail, People, Calendar and Skydrive?<br />
To get rid of it just click anywhere in a blank part of the "dashboard"..

<p>Hi Ziv Ka,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is different if you enable MFA and not enable MFA in SSO environment or pure online environment. Whether you enable SSO or not, if you enable MFA, we need to use app password to set up Outlook. However, if we enable ADAL in tenant level and Outlook client
 level (by default, Outlook 2016 enable ADAL), it will use browser to authenticate so we do not need to use app password. After passing it, we just need to verify it via MFA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, let’s back to the issue. If the window prompt to let you enter credential, please enter app password to see if it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: If you use Office 2013, we suggest upgrading to Office 2016 as it exceeds support life circle. Thanks.</p>

<h2>            N8 Connection failed &#47; Connection unavailable for WiFi after Hard Reset</h2>
                    
<p>My N8 C: was always running out of memory so I thought of doing a Hard Reset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I backed up data, Hard Reset(wipes off all memory), Restored.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I am able to find my WiFi hotspot but not able to connect, it says Connection failed / Connection unavailable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WiFi hotspot is created using Nokia E72 JoikuSpot which worked smoothly prior to Hard Reset but not now. My other devices are still able to connect to the hotspot so everything is fine at Joiku in E72.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried Soft Reset, Hard Reset of my N8 and even deleting the HotSpot from saved connection &amp; then re-saving it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pls advise.</p>

            Replying for an update because i had this problem, fixed, but have it again:<br />
<br />
Well I did about a month ago i had the same problem with the mobile data saying connection failed. I did the soft restand then hard reset, but then still had the issue. I deleted all the access points and then took out the sim card. Put the sim card back in
 and then had to manually setup my access point.<br />
<br />
That worked, not sure if it was one specific thing or the whole combination.<br />
<br />
but now the same problem is back, the mobile data not working and saying connection failed/connection unavailable. Cannot get it fixed no matter what i try so far (tried resets, manually inputting apn settings again, etc)<br />
<br />
my wifi works by the way.<br />
<br />
Did you find a fix or does anyone have any suggestions?

            That’s correct. At least once a year we need to sign into onedrive.com to keep it active and files stored there. <br /><br />If not, Microsoft sends the notification email. And if no action is taken, the files will eventually be deleted.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Try this ARRAY formula ( paste into formula bar, not a cell). See below on how to enter it. In practice instead of using kristy in the formula I'd use a cell reference</p>
<p>=SUM(N(FREQUENCY(IF(D1:D12="Kristy",MATCH(C1:C12,C1:C12,0)),MATCH(C1:C12,C1:C12,0))&gt;0))</p>
<p>This is an array formula which must be entered by pressing CTRL+Shift+Enter<br />
and not just Enter. If you do it correctly then Excel will put curly brackets<br />
around the formula {}. You can't type these yourself. If you edit the formula<br />
you must enter it again with CTRL+Shift+Enter.</p>

</p><p>OneDrive for Business sync agent is not supported on a Terminal Services based implementation. To</p>
<p>gain access to OneDrive for Business files, users have to use a web browser. Reference:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.citrix.com/content/dam/citrix/en_us/documents/products-solutions/deployment-guide-office-365-for-xenapp-and-xendesktop.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft
 Office 365 for Citrix XenApp and XenDesktop 7.x.</a>&nbsp;There are 3 options in recommendation listed in the article:</p>
<p>Option 1: Continue to use OneDrive for Business but require users to access their files via the web browser.</p>
<p>Option 2: Use Citrix ShareFile for file storage because it includes selective sync capabilities, which only synchronizes the files accessed by the user. With selective sync, users see their entire ShareFile directory structure in Windows Explorer, but none
 of those files are physical present on the system until they are requested.</p>
<p>Option 3: Continue to use OneDrive for Business for user file storage and utilize the ShareFile Desktop App, a stand-alone Windows app, to access the user’s files and folders.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Syncing Notes with Active Sync with Exchange Server 2003</h2>
                    Hi All,<br />
<br />
In ActiveSync&nbsp;options on the local device WM 6.0 CE OS 5.2.1620 (Build 18125.0.4.2)&nbsp;there are only Contacts,Calendar,E-mail and Tasks available for Sync with the Exchange Server&nbsp;not Notes.<br />
Does anyone know why Notes is not available?<br />
Is this an Exchange Server process that needs to be activated&nbsp;or the ActiveSync version in WM 6.0<br />
I want to be able to Sync Notes.<br />
<br />
regards<br />
Dave

            First try SFC scan if it can fix anything:<br />
<ol>
<li>Press Win key + X.</li><li>Click on "Command Prompt (Admin)".</li><li>Type "sfc /scannow" in Command Prompt and hit enter.</li></ol>
<p>Please share its results with us.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If SFC scan fails then I want you to perform these diagnostic steps:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1. Navigate to <b>C:\Program Files\Windows Defender</b>, single left click on <b>
MSASCui.exe</b>, press <b>Alt + Enter</b>, click on <b>Security</b> tab and then on
<b>Administrators</b> and make a note of rows (Read, Write, etc) in which <i>tick mark</i> is in
<b>Allow</b> and <b>Deny</b> column. Perform same with <b>MpAsDesc.dll</b>.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>2. Press <b>Win key + R</b>, type "<b>regedit</b>" and hit <b>enter</b>, navigate to
<b>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\WinDefend</b>, double click on
<b>RequiredPrivileges</b> and make a note of everything in <b>Value Data</b>.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Please return back with results of both SFC scan and the two steps above.<br />

<h2>            Excel Calculations</h2>
                    <p>I need to look at the date in cell AX3 and add a certain number of days based on the text shown in cell AC3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>AC3 will equal one of the following values: At Step 1, At Step 2, At Step 3, Between Step 1 and 2, Between Step 2 and 3, Between Step 3 and 4 or Under Minimum</p>
<p>
</p><p>AX3 = 12/06/2017 (Date in Position)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>IF $AC3="At Step 1" OR "Under Minimum" OR "Between Step 1 and 2" - I need cell $AW3 to show $AX3 plus 90 days in date format</p>
<p>IF $AC3="At Step 2" OR "Between Step 2 and 3" - I need cell $AW3 to show $AX3 plus 365 days in date format</p>
<p>IF $AC3="At Step 3" OR "Between Step 3 and 4" - I need cell $AW3 to show $AX3 plus 720 days in date format</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll add some conditional formatting to reflect when $AW3&gt;TODAY() so that the reader understands that the individual is past due for a wage increase. But for now, I need assistance getting all of this logic into one formula.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>HOW TO SAVE ITEMS FROM Deleted Items FOLDER - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> palmy  say:</h3>
<h2>            HOW TO SAVE ITEMS FROM Deleted Items FOLDER</h2>
                    
<p>I was going to empty the Deleted Items folder when I noticed the following:<span>&nbsp;</span>In addition to some deleted e-Mails, I noticed that my Deleted Items folder also included many calendar items and contacts (Is this normal?)---- knowing that I had not
 deleted that many items I was hesitant to clean the Deleted Items folder.<span>&nbsp;</span>Although, I think this may have happened when I synchronized my PDA with Outlook 2007.<span>&nbsp;</span>So, I thought of saving the contents of the Deleted Items folder instead,
 by creating a .pst file and transferring them.<span>&nbsp;</span>I highlighted all 1658 items and when I dragged them to the .pst file the following message popped up: “creating a new item from the selected items could take some time.<span>&nbsp;</span>Are you sure
 you want to create a new item from the 1658 items?”<span>&nbsp;</span>I did not want to create a copy and was not sure at this time if the calendar and contact items would transfer properly.<span>&nbsp;</span>So, I did a test and when I dragged the test calendar appointment
 to the .pst file it ended up in the Drafts folder as a new appointment window and the file (deleted appointment) as an attachment.<span>&nbsp;</span>Weird!!<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>At this point, I need some assistance filing off the deleted items.<span>&nbsp;</span>Does anyone know how to do this?<span>&nbsp;
</span>I am afraid to empty the Deleted Items folder and loose some old important appointment or file.</p>

            Will, that is exactly what I did.&nbsp; I just explained it differently.&nbsp; I have no problem moving the e-Mails.&nbsp; But the contact files and calendar appointments I do not know how to move them or save them.&nbsp; For instance, I tried moving one contact and a message
 stated that "you must first enter a valid e-Mail address for this contact before Outlook can send mail to it."&nbsp; When I tried moving a calendar item it opened an e-Mail message an inserted the text to the e-Mail.&nbsp;

<p>I have the issue too, and only on some spreadsheets.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Possible work-around</strong>:</p>
<p>I tried copying all the sheets to a new workbook. The new workbook auto-saves just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still haven't figured out what caused the issue though. This was a spreadsheet that I've been using for years, and was likely updated from .xls to .xlsx somewhere along the way. I'm guessing that there might have been something incompatible in the older

I have been unable to figure out how to center text vertically on a page in the 2011 version of Office for Mac. I recently converted an old manuscript done in Windows 2007 to Mac 2011 .docx and while the text appears to be centered on the page when I convert
 it a pdf, it no longer is.&nbsp;
<div>I have been unable to locate any help text on vertical allignment. &nbsp;Can this be accomplished if so How?</div>

            The first point to emphasize is that there is no such thing as a 'page' in the structure of a Word document. However, if a document will print on a single sheet of paper (1 page) you can center the content vertically between the Top &amp; Bottom Margins by
 going to:<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li>Format&gt; Document</li><li>On the <span style="font-weight: bold">Layout</span> page open the <span style="font-weight: bold">
Vertical Alignment</span> list</li><li>Select <span style="font-weight: bold">Center</span></li><li>Click <span style="font-weight: bold">OK</span></li></ol>
<br />
If the document will require more than one page but you don't want all pages to be vertically centered you have to use Section Breaks. Each Section can have different layout specifications.<br />
<br />
If the document is supposed to have been set up for vertical centering but the PDF does not render it there must be something about how the document is constructed. Check to see if the setting described above has been used. It might also help to display the
 non-printing characters (¶) in order to reveal more about how the document was constructed.<br />
<br />
It's also possible that there is a misinterpretation by the PDF driver. Make sure you have OS X, Office &amp; your printer driver fully updated. You might also try going to
Any Printer</span> from the <span style="font-weight: bold">Format for:</span> list to see if that makes any difference.<br />
<br />

<h3> chrisltq  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft&#39;s &#34;Call Us Overprotective&#34; Verification Code program is not working &#33;</h2>
                    <p>I have been trying for 3 days to Open my outlook email account , but every time I try an on-screen message appears stating:</p>
<p>"Call Us Overprotective" and an instruction to apply for a Verification Code._</p>
<p>Every time I apply for a Verification Code to be sent to my friend's outlook email account Microsoft send a 4 digits code._</p>
<p>Every time I enter each 4 digits' verification code and press "next" I receive an on-screen message that states a 5 digits' verification Code is needed ,
</p>
<p>so I apply again , but every time only a 4 digits' code is sent._</p>
<p>I spend an hour reading Microsoft's self-help pages but cannot find anything to stop the problem._</p>
<p>I telephone to the Australian number - 132058 - and type into the keypad and wait for half hour till a person answers ,
</p>
<p>and then I explain the whole problem._ Person says he CANNOT fix it , and that I must go to Microsoft's "answerdesk" and to "chat"</p>
<p>where he says the problem will be fixed._</p>
<p>I wait at "chat" and the type the problem in , but tech person's reply is that he&nbsp;CANNOT fix the problem , but that I must PAY to have the problem fixed !_</p>
<p>That is WRONG and VERY UNFAIR , because I did not cause the problem , Microsoft caused the problem , thus Microsoft should pay !_</p>
<p>I did not ask for a Verification Code , and I do not want a Verification Code - I want only to Open my email account with my Password ,
</p>
<p>which&nbsp;I have not forgotten._</p>
<p>If I had made that program I would have tested it to find out if it worked before I sent it to account holders._</p>
<p>Why did the Microsoft program person not test the Verification Code program before sending it to account holders ?_</p>
<p>_</p>
<p>Please , either:</p>
<p>(1)- turn OFF the Verification Code program at my email account , </p>
<p>or (2)- change the program so it will accept the 4 digits' verification code that it sends ,
</p>
<p>or , (3)- change the program so that it will send the 5 digits verification code that is required._</p>
<p>Please do one of those very soon , before I am locked out of my email account._</p>
<p>Please reply to this message and inform me what is being done ?</p>

<h2>            Office telling me my subscription is about to expire..why&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a school account with Microsoft. So I should have access to office 2016. I installed these apps on my new computer, however when I use office programs it tells me my subscription is about to expire. I originally thought it was because the Microsoft
 account I used when I first logged into the computer (personal one) was logged in, but when I switch it so it's only logged into my school account I still get this message. It also keeps saying the product is office 362 and not office 2016, which is what the
 school subscription should be. Help?</p>

<p>Hi Leek,</p>

 methods as well as the number of users that you can share these subscriptions with. Office 365 can be paid on a monthly or yearly basis, while Office 2016 is sold as a one-time purchase.

<h2>            Lumia 820 charges ONLY with USB connected to computer</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Something happened with my Lumia 820 . It charges only with USB cable connected to PC/laptop.</p>
<p>It does not charge neither when plugged into standard socket at home nor at my car socket.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cable and plug is ok, I checked it with other Lumia.</p>
<p>Since the USG charging works, it seems like it's a software and nat hardware issue...</p>
<p>I recently updated my Lumie to WP 8.1 (Cyan update) - maybe that was a problem? Unfortunatelly, I am not sure if this was broken before the update (I bought used Lumia and before charging it, I used the Nokia Recovery Tool to upgrade it and migrate my data
 from previous Lumia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If someone knows what to do... please let me know :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Szalas</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;<span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/08AB1A57-0D83-4C2F-90E9-14D31798CE41">szalas</a>,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After installing the Lumia Cyan SW, have you checked if the system apps have been updated as well? You can go to
<strong>Settings &gt; swipe to Apps &gt; Store &gt; Check for updates</strong>. This step will help us verify&nbsp;if the issue is software (whether after the Cyan update or not) or hardware related.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW, are you using the same wall charger or cable that came with the phone? The compatibility of 3rd party&nbsp;accessories with Lumia&nbsp;devices&nbsp;isn't 100% assured, though they&nbsp;might work with some of our&nbsp;phones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We'll wait for your feedback. :cathappy:</p>

<p>Hi @poochini21,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your response :)</p>
<p>I use the original Nokia charger that came with the phone. So it shouldn't be a problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will check for updates tomorrow or on Sat and let you know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW: I migrated the phone from HTC WP 8S to Lumia. Maybe that caused the problem (after downloading emergency backup)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>talk to you soon!</p>

            phone backups may cause problems if there is software incompatibilites etc, so i would suggest making a clean wipe if you need to go down the path. kinda defeats the purpose of having a backup to restore, but in case of the errors it may have introduced,
 it may very well be warranted in this instance.

<p>Hi poochini21,<br />
<br />
I ran into the same problem, it also happened after installing the Cyan update, also on a Lumia 820.<br />
<br />
I was on the Preview for Developers on 8.1.1 before I got the update.<br />
I only use an original Nokia cable and USB wall plug and I know for a fact that it worked right before the update.<br />
I made sure to install all updates afterwards, I also did some restarts (was prompted by some settings apps) and even tried a soft reset.<br />
Since nothing worked I used the Nokia Software Recovery Tool to reinstall Cyan clean without the Developers Preview (no restored Backup @adrianhughes). But even now it won't charge other then from my laptop.<br />
<br />
I'm looking forward to hear from you and hope there's a solution to this.<br />

<p>&nbsp;if you were able to apply the Nokia Software Recovery Tool successfully, and you still face your issue&nbsp;– even if it looks like, the cause was the firmware update – sounds like a&nbsp;hardware issue. Therefore, did you consider to bring this phone to your dealer,
 who in turn sends it over to a local but genuine Nokia Care Centre?</p>

<p>thanks for the tip, I'm considering it, but the coincident is very big...<br />
So I searched on the Internet and found this thread and thought I post here before going weeks without my phone.<br />
<br />
The charger as well as the cable both work fine on another phone and my 820 dose still charge, but only if it's plugged into an USB port of a computer.<br />
Some while ago, I read something about some hidden USB settings menu, maybe Cyan changed something in there?<br />

<p>Hi, similar problem here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Lumia 930 recently updated to Denim stopped charging from battery pack after I've changed USB settings by unchecking the "Inform when I connect to slow charger" option. Checking the box again doesn't help much. I can see the message appearing, but only&nbsp;for
 maybe 0,1s and the phone wont charge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Not sure if system update had any influence on that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Charging goes well with the same USB cable&nbsp;connected to both wall charger and a PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Shall I go for a refurbish or is there another way?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any help.</p>

<h2>            Delete old hotmail contacts from current outlook account</h2>
                    Unable to delete old hotmail contacts from my outlook account. It is just really annoying to see my calendar full of birthdays of my people I don't even know or remember of. Any help would be really appreciated. FYI the delete button doesn't even show.
 Thanks!
