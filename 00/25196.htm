<h2>            deselecting spell checking not available&#63;</h2>
                    
<p><span>How do I turn off spell checking (red underlining) when composing new emails (or just ALWAYS…)?</span></p>
<p><span>Microsoft Outlook for Mac version 15.22</span></p>
<p><span>OSX 10.10.5</span></p>
<p><span>I have already tried turning it off "system-wide", but spell checking is still on in Outlook: &gt; System Preferences, click Keyboard, click Text, then deselect the “Correct spelling automatically” checkbox.</span></p>
<p><span>As I understand I should have an option for the specific App Outlook:&nbsp;</span><span>Edit &gt; Spelling and Grammar &gt; Correct Spelling Automatically (it’s off when a checkmark isn’t shown).</span></p>
<p><span>But there IS not checkmark shown, and yet, my email compose window is still full of red underlines.</span></p>
<p><span>Help?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

                    <p>I have a problem with writing messages in Skype built into Windows 10 1709!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Namely, after entering the message, there is the word interception ... And nothing else happens. And with the person I'm talking on the microphone, but she does not receive this message. What you need to do to fix the problem. Windows is after clean installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, if I do not want to be disturbed by calling me how to block Skype so that no one calls?</p>
<p>
This caused me to reinstall Skype 7.40.0.151. I do not have any problems with him.<br />
<br />
I do not know English so I used the Google translator. So please forgive me for mistakes.

<h2>            how to print an address book from access</h2>
                    <p>We want to print off a concise address book containing all the data we have entered in access --we have Outlook 2010, but don't know if that can be used with some sort of merge--or if outlook would allow us to print a concise "little black book". Are there
 avenues for this? </p>
<p>We have an access trial deadline of March 9 to be able to use the acccess data base. We wouldn't mind buying access if we can be assured it&nbsp; will actually work for our purposes.</p>

            In the access database, you could create a report that looks like an address book and print that report from access. It takes some know how, skill and time - you can get a decent address book that way.<br />
<br />
Outlook 2010 has an import feature, it imports from access database files up to and including Access 2003 versions.<br />
<br />
To import your contacts into Outlook 2010.<br />
File<br />
Open<br />
Import<br />
Import from another program or file - you can import from Access 2003 and earlier databases. (same thing for excel files).<br />
<br />
<br />
You could export the data to word or excel. However you would need to do some formatting to make it look like an address book before you print it.<br />

<h2>            Outlook has not been installed</h2>
                    
<p>Until a few days ago my iPaq would sync all areas like calendar, contacts, Avantgo,&nbsp;and emails.&nbsp; Then I noticed that I had no appointments listed on my pda after syncing.&nbsp; When I went to correct the problem, I was
 unable to place a check mark by those options that I wanted.&nbsp; Underneath the option the error msg appears "Outlook has not been installed".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried working out the problem myself including "repairing" Office 2007 using the built in feature of the program.&nbsp; No&nbsp;problems were&nbsp;found in any of the tests.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next I deleted the partnership and created a new one.&nbsp; But when I went to &nbsp;set up the partnership, under each category that I wanted, e.g., calendar, it said the same thing "Outlook has not been installed".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The transition to a new Vista machine about a year ago went fine.&nbsp; From Active sync to WMDC was no problem.&nbsp; Something within the last few days has occured that is causing the problem.&nbsp; I tried an older backup that I had for my pda but that
 did not help.</p>
<p>Any help?</p>
<p>Thanks, Tom</p>

<p>Did what you suggested but it did not solve the problem.&nbsp; In addition, I "repaired" outlook and after all tests were run, the msg was that there were no problems.</p>
<p>As before, when I got to the screen to set up the pda, "Outlook has not been installed" was listed under Calendar, Email, etc...&nbsp; And mouse over said "You must install Outlook..."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is a mystery is that it was working fine until several days ago.&nbsp; I made no changes but did get an automatic update from windows several days ago.&nbsp; "Update for Windows Vista KB941649" failed to install on 4/27/08.&nbsp; It is asking for me to
 install it again.&nbsp; But, the problem that I am having with Outlook started several days before that.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The other recent updates were: Microsoft Corporation - Networking - HP USB Sync Installation date: ‎4/‎27/‎2008 11:26 AM Installation status: Successful and Update for Windows Vista (KB943411) Installation date: ‎4/‎27/‎2008 11:24 AM Installation

<p>Finally chapter with my issue:</p>
<p>A tech from MS gave me&nbsp;a ten-page&nbsp;solution what was very easy to follow and was "right on".&nbsp; In a nutshell, what I had to do was to create a new profile under Control Panel/Mail.&nbsp; When I sync-ed for the first time after the fix, it worked perfectly.&nbsp;
 Of course, you have to delete the old profile but import the settings into the new profile first.&nbsp; I saved the email and can forward it to anyone who wants it.</p>

<p>I have sent both of the two most recent users an email that was sent to me from MS&nbsp;with a fix.&nbsp; It is 10 pages long with lots of graphics.&nbsp; In essence, it calls for you to go to Mail and create a new profile.&nbsp; When you sync for the first time, the program
 will ask you to go to settings.&nbsp; There all of the settings, like mail, calendar, etc will be clickable whereas before it said Outlook has not been installed.</p>

<br />Quotation: It is not possible to separate your Skype profile from your Microsoft account.

            Hi   Gamie123 ,
<br />
<br />Since October 2016, Skype accounts are now linked to Microsoft Accounts just like other Microsoft Services such as OneDrive. Due to this change, it is no longer possible to delete your Skype account without also closing your Microsoft Account. 
<br />
<br />The best thing you can do is no longer sign into that account and use the available options of transferring your contacts and credits to the new account. 
<br />
<br />If you wish to continue:
<br />
<br />Before you close your Microsoft account, let's make sure you aren't leaving anything important relating to Skype behind:
<br />
<br />    Sign in to Skype.  
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/myaccount</a>
<br />
<br />    Follow the steps in this article to verify that: 
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/12412" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/help/12412</a>
<br />
<br />        Important information such as files and contacts are saved.
<br />        Your Skype Credit balance has been used. Once your account is closed, you can't get it back. 
<br />        Active subscriptions have been cancelled so you don’t continue to get charged. If you have Auto-recharge enabled and cancel your account without first cancelling your subscription, you will continue to be charged until your account has been permanently closed in 60 days. Learn how to disable Auto-recharge.
<br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/faq/FA633" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/faq/FA633</a>
<br />
<br />You can close your Microsoft account by following these steps:
<br />
<br />    Go to our Microsoft account closure page (<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=523898" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=523898</a>). You may be prompted to sign in or verify your password.
<br />    Make sure you are signed in to the Microsoft account you want to close and select Next. 
<br />    In the Select a reason drop-down list, choose the reason you're closing the account. 
<br />    Select Mark account for closure.
<br />    Your Microsoft account will be closed in 60 days. We wait 60 days before permanently deleting accounts in case you change your mind or need to access something before it's gone. You can change your mind any time during the 60 days, just sign in (<a href="https://go.skype.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/myaccount</a>) to cancel the closure. 
<br />
<br />Here steps for doing both:
<br />
<br />Transfer contacts:

            <p>Hi Benjamin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on the Microsoft Communities. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is not clear. It would be really helpful if you could brief us on the issue you are facing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Where exactly do you see the 'Black Start'? <br />
2. Are you able to boot to the desktop?</p>
<p>3. What is the make and model of the PC?</p>
<p>4. Are you referring to the Windows updates or the new version Build 9879 for Windows 10 Technical Preview?</p>

            There is a bug with the boot manager on Builds 9860 and 9879. During the time period when the boot manager should be displaying at startup, the display will stay black. The cause has been traced back to using updated third-party display drivers for Windows
 10. To test this, you can disable the display driver in your device manager by clicking on Display Adapter, then right clicking on what ever your&nbsp;display device is to disable it. When your restart your computer after doing&nbsp;this, the Windows 10 boot manager
 should show up again. Remember to re-enable your display driver&nbsp;when you are finished testing. There is a work-a-round to the problem. What you need to do in your case&nbsp;is to set your default operating system to&nbsp;Windows 7. To do this, you need to go to your
 Control Panel &gt; System &gt; Advanced System Settings. Click on the Advanced tab and go to Startup and Recovery, then click on settings. Once you are in there, you can set your default operating system to Window

    <title>formulas for cells with multiple data sets - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dizzydizo  say:</h3>
<h2>            formulas for cells with multiple data sets</h2>
                    <p>I have cells with either one, two or three dates in them, example below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><font color="#000000">28-Feb-13</font></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><font color="#000000">30-Nov-12<br />
20-Jul-12</font></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><font color="#000000">30-Nov-12<br />
20-Jul-12<br />
20-Aug-12</font></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and&nbsp;I have used a formula to&nbsp;calculate the date 6, 9 and 12 months periods in advance, eg, for the first cell the results in the next three cells are returned as:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>28-Aug-13, 28-Nov-13 and 28-Feb-14.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This works&nbsp;for the cell with one date in it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I use the same formula to calculate the&nbsp;dates (6, 9 and 12 months in advance) for the cells where more than one date entered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried splitting the cells but can't get it to work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas would be very much appreciated.</p>

            <p>The problem is that you have Two UDF"s in that workbook with the same name.&nbsp; You must have added it twice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you open the VBEditor&nbsp; with &lt;alt-F11&gt; and inspect your project, you will see Module1 and Module3.&nbsp; They contain the identical macro, with the same name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Excel sees to different items with the same Name, it has no way of knowing which you want, so produces a Name error.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest Removing Module3 (from the right click menu), then <strong>save and re-open</strong> the workbook.&nbsp; This should get things working properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the way, the macro will work also work with a single entry in column A, so there is no need to use different formulas for the different cells.&nbsp; And it should return a blank if An is blank, so you probably don't need to test for that either.</p>

<h2>            Are Current Outlook Emails and settings retained in Windows 10 &#63;</h2>
                    Hi.&nbsp; This may sound naïve BUT, I have reserved Windows 10.&nbsp; Before I actually install this, I need to ensure that ALL my many emails and settings in Outlook/Hotmail are retained.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have 100's of 'LEGAL' emails that I just cannot lose.&nbsp; Will ALL these
 be retained and transferred when Windows 10 is installed?&nbsp; A speedy response would be very much appreciated.

                    <p>I tried to update to Build 10547 earlier today, and something went wrong along the way (long story short, I had to restart my PC in the middle of the last stage of the update). This broke basically everything and made Windows almost entirely unusable, so
 I rolled back to Build 10532. I want to attempt to update to 10547 again, but every time I check for Updates it tells me my system is up to date. I've waited several hours in hopes the update would again become available, but so far I've had no such luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to force the update, or update manually from outside of the built-in Update function?</p>

<h2>            Outlook is searching attachment contents even when I limit my search to email content</h2>
                    I want to search&nbsp;Microsoft Outlook email contents for a certain word. But, I do not want to search attachment contents for that word. I have seen a prior post on this and it did not help me because neither limiting my search to the email body by using
 content: in the search box, nor selecting the <strong>subject field and message body</strong> option
<strong>In </strong>in Advanced Find, work. Both of these methods are still searching attachment contents. I have showed this to multiple coworkers, who also have the same problem on their PCs. Even our IT department cannot find a fix to our problem. If you
 reply, please know that I really&nbsp;appreciate&nbsp;your feedback, just be aware that&nbsp;I may not respond immediately because my personal email address account where I will receive your responses is inaccessible from work. Thank you!

<p>I uninstalled a copy of Office 2013 365 which was preinstalled on a Lenovo Think PC.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I then installed&nbsp; Office 2010 Home and Business which worked until the PC was rebooted.</p>

<p>Now none of these will run and I just get this side by side error.&nbsp; Why?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This application has failed to start because its side by side configuration is incorrect.</p>

            <p>I don't know if your license will allow a transfer or not, because I haven't seen the 2016 license terms, but I have not heard of any changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In that case, start activation again, but this time select Phone Activation. This will display the appropriate phone number for your region. When you phone in, don't reply to any of the prompts until you are given the option of talking to a live serivce
 rep.&nbsp; Explain that you are transferring the license. If you have a license type that allows transfer, they will reset the activation system to accept your activation.&nbsp;&nbsp; (HINT: tell them that your laptop died).

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I managed to move Office 2016 to another PC by:</p>
<p>- de-installing from PC 1;</p>
<p>- installing on PC 2;</p>
<p>- activating by phone and answering '1' when you are asked on how many PC's it has been installed;</p>
<p>- ready.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS after that you can even do a re-install on PC 2 with the initial product key (if required, for example after a clean install of Windows).</p>
<p>

    <title>A list of excel 2016 issues on a mac - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> murenrb  say:</h3>
<h2>            A list of excel 2016 issues on a mac</h2>
                    <p>Let's forgo the niceties. Excel 2016 for Mac is an abomination. I have been mistified by the issues I have run into. I have posted a few here and there, but I wanted to create a new discussion that takes a more holistic approach. At first I thought that
 the issues I was experiencing were so fundamental that certainly they would be fixed in the next update. But updates have come and gone and the issues remain unaddressed. Thus I have created the following list of grievances in the hope that someone at MS will
 see it and think "wow, we really have a problem here".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Scrolling. This problem has been documented since the very beginning of the beta. The scrolling in excel is very choppy and gets hung up at certain points. For me, this is especially prominent when scrolling from row ~300 to the top of the file. Often
 my view will get stuck at around row 100 and no amount of scroll wheeling with make the view go higher. The only way to get back to the top of the file is to drag and drop the scroll bar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Scroll bar invisibility. The scroll bars in excel take the trendy new approach where they hide when not in use. This would be fine, if they didn't appear and disappear randomly when in use. About 50% of the time they will appear right under your mouse
 and then disappear when you click so you click the cells below instead. This is particularly prominent in the left to right scroll bar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Auto propagate. The double click lower right corner auto propagate feature at times will turn off. This is the feature that is created when the cross hairs turn solid black. This feature will just shut off and not be possible until a restart brings it
 back. </p>
<p>
</p><p>4. &nbsp;Cursor offset. The cursor position at times will get an offset error. When this occurs the actual cursor position will be nearly exactly 1/2 row higher. It is always this offset. I have no experienced any left right error only up and always by 1/2 a
 row.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Formula bar select all. Select all does not work in the formula bar. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Formula bar cursor location. The cursor in the formula bar shows up in random locations. Sometimes its in the middle of a character. Other times it appears to be on one side of a character, but no, its on the other side so you start typing in the wrong
 place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. Series input location randomizer. When changing the series in a plot or equation that is on another sheet the calculation of the equation will send you to a random location in the sheet. IE, lets say a formula was being entered that was A1 in the current
 sheet multiplied by A1 in the second sheet in the file. You select both cells and hit enter. BAM! You are teleported to cell AB354 which does not even exist in your sheet yet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. Edit window scroll issues. When the edit window is open to the right and you scroll you will be teleported way to the right of your file. Usually about 100-300 columns.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>9. Lag. When entering numbers on a larger file there will be a consistent lag drop of your first character. IE, you might type 100 but only 00 get entered. Oddly waiting does not fix this. If you put a long pause between clicking a cell and actually typing
 the first character will still be dropped.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, that's what I got for now. There are other things I am forgetting so if you too hate office 2016, please add them below!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thank you for starting this discussion!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As MVP I can tell you that the first thing Microsoft will ask us to do is to prioritize which things we would like them to work on first, and which things can be put off until later. Of course, we want Microsoft to fixe everything right away and they will
 reply that they don't have the resources to do that. Our reply is then "get the resources" and they reply that the resources don't exist or cost too much. Then we accede to their request and offer our prioritization suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What we probably need is an additional forum to the <a href="http://excel.uservoice.com/forums/304933-excel-for-mac/suggestions/9466164-a-better-name-manager" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Excel suggestion box</a>, one that is for bug fixes and missing features. It should have a voting scheme similar to that found in the suggestion box. I'll run this by Microsoft through the MVP program and see what they say.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For this discussion thread, everyone who wants to help can post replies here with links to existing Q&amp;A in the forum along with fresh contributions. Also include your thoughts about which bug/broken/missing feature needs to be addressed first and which would
 be nice to fix but isn't immediately critical.</p>

Yeah, that sounds about right. I'm all about following the process, but I want to highlight just how silly this is. Excel is a 30 year old program and the bugs I am reporting are things like scrolling, cursor position, and general viewing. I think that you should tell MS to get their sh*t together. 



To continue the list above 



10. Decimal Points. Excel seems **** bent on adding decimal points to my calculations. If I have two cells with numbers that I have set to 2 decimal points and I multiply them in a virgin cell with no formatting excel will add ~10 decimal point which fills the cell with #####. Why is that the default? All modern languages like python have an auto decimal that just works. If that's not an option because MS developers are two "busy" then they could at least just make it the same as the source cells.  



11.  The comma. Why does the comma separator button automatically change the formatting to accounting. I just want to add comma separators. If I wanted to make it acc

            <p>Well done murenrb for nearly biting your lip. &nbsp;The MVP response was little short of patronising and quite literally added no value whatsoever. &nbsp;That said, the footnote speaks volumes " he doesn't work for Microsoft " and by all accounts not too many people
 do !!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Abomination is very strong but I think that deliberately Machiavellian is appropriate. &nbsp;There are simply too many issues with Office for Mac 2016 to support any credible show of intent by Microsoft to retain its significant Apple User community. &nbsp;That and
 an obvious desire to simply take money without any conscious regard for the customer. &nbsp;Microsoft now obviously feels that they have the monopoly and poor performance and reputation are no longer important.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Advice to the MVP's - guard your blind loyalty carefully - it may well bite you in the end. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tasked my team to review LibreOffice as, quite viably, they have more than addressed many of the failings that Microsoft seem content to roll with. &nbsp;Not only that but they genuinely respect all Platforms and are not biased by a single community - oh
 and they're so free that the donation gifting is exceptional.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, and I don't work for LibreOffice either !</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I submitted feedback requesting a forum specifically for bugs/missing/incomplete features. Maybe Microsoft will think it's a suggestion worth pursuing, maybe not. I would be happy if they do it, but I won't be heartbroken if they don't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Word, Excel and PowerPoint were converted to Cocoa for 2016. That's a big challenge. Meanwhile, Apple keeps popping out new versions of Mac OS X that include new technologies like
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/osx/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Metal</a>. Big changes in the core software of Office coupled with big changes in the OS the supports it all can cause glitches. I don't think Microsoft intended that any long-establshed
 interface behaviors get messed up. The trouble with the formula bar is probably something that Apple and Microsoft have to work together on to fix. That said, we're on update 18 to Office and I think it is reasonable to expect that most of this sort of glitch
 should have been fixed by now. At the very least, some sort of acknowledgement of "we know, we're working on it, look for a fix by (whenever)."</p>
<p>
</p><p>LibreOffice looks good by simply standing still. OpenOffice (LibreOffice is the current incarnation) has changed in very small increments since 1997. Recent changes to support the newer open standard (OOXML) as well as the old standard (ODF) file formats
 have kept LibreOffice relevant. Those changes took a decade or more to get up to speed. Don't kid yourself. Even though LibreOffice has a Mac version, I think LibreOffice people are as anti-Apple as they are ant-Microsoft. For example, there is no AppleScript
 support in LibreOffice. Microsoft at least makes an effort to support Apple technologies by supporting AppleScript, Automator, and incorporating niceties of Mac OS X within Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Focusing on the original request of this discussion - a list of issues for Excel 2016 for Mac - I am solidly behind this endeavor. Number formatting in Excel should be the same as it always was. If it isn't that's a bug.</p>

            <p>Hi murenrb,</p>
<p>I'm James from the Mac Excel team, and part of my responsibilities include reading (and opportunistically responding to) customer feedback. &nbsp;Thanks for taking the time to list these out - here's my understanding of each of your issues:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Scrolling - we've been making improvements to scrolling for a few months now (including removing the "snap-to-cell" behavior), but it seems like we're not there yet, which means we'll keep working on it - expect improvements in each monthly update until
 you're satisfied. For the latest info, vote on <a href="http://excel.uservoice.com/forums/304933-excel-for-mac/suggestions/10196106-fix-broken-scrolling-in-excel-for-mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Fix broken scrolling in Excel for Mac">
this thread</a>&nbsp;at Excel for Mac's UserVoice site to subscribe to updates.</li><li>Scroll bar invisibility - the behavior here is dependent on your OS X preferences, and it sounds like you're describing the system default. &nbsp;To change this, set
<strong>System&nbsp;</strong><strong>Preferences &gt; General &gt; Show scroll bars</strong> to
<strong>Always</strong></li><li>Auto propogate (or Autofill) - this is the first I've heard of issues with the handle disappearing. If you can give us a scenario that reliably reproduces this issue, we can work on understanding and resolving the issue.</li><li>Cursor offset - same as above. I haven't personally heard about this or witnessed it, but steps to reproduce it are incredibly valuable in getting the issue fixed.</li><li>Formula bar select all - this isn't supported in any version of Excel (Windows or Mac).&nbsp;If you'd like us to add it, submit a suggestion to the&nbsp;<a href="http://excel.uservoice.com/forums/304933-excel-for-mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Excel for Mac UserVoice">Excel
 for Mac UserVoice</a></li><li>Formula bar cursor location - we have a thread about a similar issue on the UserVoice. Follow the thread&nbsp;<a href="http://excel.uservoice.com/forums/304933-excel-for-mac/suggestions/9180506-cursor-not-properly-positioned-when-editing-direct" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Cursor not properly positioned when editing directly inside cell">here</a>&nbsp;for
 the latest.</li><li>Calculation teleportation - this is certainly not expected behavior, though I don't see this issue when I author cross-sheet formulas on my computer. We also haven't heard about this issue from other customers (we read close to 10,000 pieces/month), but
 if this is frequently happening when you create formulas we need to get it fixed.</li><li>Edit window scroll issues - I'm not clear on what you mean by "edit window", but it sounds like more random teleporatation which is never expected behavior. &nbsp;More details about this could be useful.</li><li>Lag - We're always looking to improve performance, but given that a manual delay didn't help you, this sounds unrelated to performance (I'm also unable to reproduce it in a 45MB workbook). To clarify, when you put the long pause between clicking a cell
 and typing - is that click a single or double click? They're actually two difference actions - single click will select the cell and typing will bring you in to edit mode + insert the first character. Double click will bring you in to edit mode with no character
 inserted.</li><li>Decimal points - If you're seeing ### in a cell, it's because the cell can't display the whole value. However, this usually only happens if a column width has been manually set (and thus the column will no longer auto-expand to fit the value). &nbsp;Further,
 you shouldn't see ##'s if the decimal part of the value is what's taking up too much space - Excel will automatically truncate and round to the available space (to see this type 0.123456789 into a cell and manually resize the column width). What you're describing
 is most likely caused by number formatting in either the source or destination cells.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If you have more comments or suggestions, drop us a line at the&nbsp;<a href="http://excel.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Excel UserVoice">Excel UserVoice</a>&nbsp;site - we've started using that to help democratize the prioritization of the
 features we work on. And lastly, I'd like to say that in no way is Microsoft deprioritizing Office for Mac. As Jim mentioned, developing on an ever-changing outside platform like OS X presents lots of interesting challenges, and occasionally some nice perks.
 We know that now, more than ever, people want to use Excel on their favorite device, and we're committed to delivering awesome experiences to you regardless of your preferred platform. &nbsp;As we continue to ship monthly updates to our Office 365 subscribers,
 our hope is that you'll see your list of grievances dwindling to zero.</p>

<p>Thanks again for the detailed feedback,</p>

            <p>James,</p>
<p>Thanks for these responses. It's helpful to see that MS is paying attention. Here are some responses to your comments:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Voted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. The procedure you suggest is just a work around NOT a solution. I am implementing it because the scrolling action is annoying, but I am well aware that scroll bars appearing is an OSX thing. What I am talking about is how bad excel does it. The bars flicker
 as you move over them. This is not an OSX feature. It also is not a OSX problem as I have no seen it in any other programs. Here is a link to what I am seeing (note: this only happens for medium+ size files, a fresh open wont get this bug to show up) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfCnOYlFFgE&amp;feature=youtu.be&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3-4 and 7-9:&nbsp;It seems like the scrolling update may have helped with some of these. That said, it is just as hard for me to get the bugs to manifest themselves as it is for you and when I do get them to work it means that I am loosing very precious time
 that I could be getting work done. (just like I am writing this post!). I will try to document when they happen via the frowny face, but at the same time, this is not my job.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. I will add it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Voted.<br />
</p>
<p>10. You misunderstood what I meant because you assumed I have never used excel before. I decided just to include an image that makes clear what I mean. To produce this image I opened excel, created a new document, and typed in the formulas. I listed the
 actual cell entries in column D just to make it totally clear. Do you see how it is just adding the decimal points? A) This is not how
<a href="https://www.hccfl.edu/media/43516/sigfigs.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
significant digits work </a>and B) This makes &nbsp;working in excel with any number of sequential calculations very hard. I will add this to the user voice thing.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0f3129c7-a9d7-41f1-862b-ffa3f50f0930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0f3129c7-a9d7-41f1-862b-ffa3f50f0930" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>Now, lets just be real for a second. This whole lean startup / user voice BS is cute. But y'all arn't developing the next social media app, you are making excel, a 30 year old program that helps its users do math. We do a lot of math, its our jobs, and when
 you mess with that we get pissed. When you release an update, it needs to just work. I don't want to hang around and see what trivial features or obvious bug fixes you will choose to include next month. I think for at least this one user, I'm pretty much out
 of patience.</p>

            <p>James,</p>
<p>
</p><p>well done for your attentiveness. I'm suitably impressed but whilst I live in hope of an equally comparable Excel across both Apple and PC, I'm not holding my breath in the short term. &nbsp;It is simply but hugely frustrating when work I carry out at the office
 and here at home cannot be seamlessly done because, i.e. Certain charts do not exist on both versions, vba is more constrained on Apple devises etc. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You ou will do well to convince the vast Apple using community that you (Microsft) have taken a deliberately more conservative approach to the Office for Mac 2016 than you have to Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are not however solely responsible and Apple has its part to play in not aggravating the situation with equally poor versions of its annual upgrades. &nbsp;I believe it's widely accepted that El Capitan and Yosemite both lacked a good degree of developer
 diligence; Apple need to re-energise their quality control methods even if annual becomes bi-annual in the name of quality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've travelled several forums and the view across them all is that the standalone Office for Mac 2016 is not as good as it should be but I also acknowledge the challenge. &nbsp;However with over 20 000 computers in our company - of mixed make and model, lap and
 desk top - synergy is key and the user experience critical to effective and efficient output.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I notice that Excel very regularly fails when it tries to check it's subscription.</p>
<p>When you have pressed 'remind me later', you will have called the wrath of Excel upon you.</p>
<p>For every operation you perform in Excel it will start mounting all possible drives in a quest to look for some subscription details or so.</p>
<p>In the back a process called 'diskarbitrationd' starts spinning out of control in order to mount all (network)drives.</p>
<p>Pointing at a cell or copying cells, it does not matter what you do, it seems to run some subscription detail finder process.</p>
<p>No matter if your restart/reboot/change settings, it will show this behavior because you told Excel to remind you later.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you finally get the subscription check dialog again and persist that it must check again,
</p>
<p>all problems magically dissapear when it succeeds checking your license.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft should have provided us with a decent bug reporting site so that we as users could send our bugs.</p>
<p>My Mac is great, now only Microsoft needs to deal with the reality that it's QA team isn't as good as they pretend to be.</p>
<p>Microsoft Excel for Mac is a big joke if you've worked with the PC version for over a decade.</p>

</p><p>I was intrigued by #10 - Significant digits.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Excel's default behavior was never designed to deliver significant digits. However, you can make your own functions in Excel, something a lot of people are not aware of. Once you define a new function, it works just like any built-in function taking arguments
 and providing a result.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.vertex42.com/ExcelTips/significant-figures.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>This page</strong></a> offers suggestions for custom formulas that will display significant digits. You can design your own formulas for any calculation
 you need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are <a href="http://www.bing.com/search?q=how+to+make+custom+formula+in+excel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Jim, I guess I am missing your point. Custom formulas have no bearing on the issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am reporting a default display configuration that makes excel hard to use. Displaying all digits is not always the optimum. I don't really mind if it is not using the rules of significant digits (although why that would not be the default when excel was
 originally written is a great mystery). </p>
<p>
</p><p>Mostly it is just hard to use a program where I must constantly tell it to include less digits every time I multiply two numbers. If I put in two numbers with 2 digits and I multiply them, it is very unlikely that I want a number to be displayed with 4 digits.
 Then, if I take that number and multiply it by one of the first numbers it is even less likely that I want a value to be displayed with 8 digits! This is just a dumb way to determine the number of digits to display.&nbsp;</p>

            I get this when there is apparently loads of space on my phone. I believe it's the "up front" memory (RAM is guess) which gets eaten up if you don't switch off your phone. Shortly after "Memory Low" my 7610 seizes up completely. I try to remember to switch
 it off once a week but still occasionally forget so now, as soon as I get "Memory Low" I switch it off and on again immediately. This seems to do the trick and I've had my 7610 for 17 months now. What a fab phone/PIM.

    <title>Which program would be best - Excel or Access&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jay_emm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Which program would be best - Excel or Access&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>

</p><p><span>I need to create a register at work but am unsure whether I’d be best doing it via Excel or Access.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>It will be a Uniform &amp; Equipment register. Currently working off a excel spreadsheet (manual data entry, no formulas)</span></p>

<p><span>The spreadsheet currently shows:</span></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Sizing</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Date items handed out </p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Quantities</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Expiry dates for some equipment</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Key numbers</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
SIM Card details</p>
</li></ul>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>This is the general idea of what I’m currently filling out:</span></p>

<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/38701152-0e1f-432d-a090-2de3eb0ed445" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/38701152-0e1f-432d-a090-2de3eb0ed445" /></a></p>
<p>

</p><p><span>I’d like to be able to track historical data on items mailed out, so currently at the moment if someone ordered 2 pairs of pants today, I’d overwrite the last entry against their name and add a comment
 for the last date and quantity.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>Originally I thought about using the spreadsheet I have as a ‘summary page’ and build up the data fields across multiple tabs however we have 160 – 170 employees with a quite high turnover rate which
 makes it slightly more work to constantly be changing out the tabs.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Another person in the organisation has recently created a vehicle register in Excel which I was thinking about using as the bones for the register but I think I overcomplicate things and get a bit
 confused and stuck in my head.</span></p>
<p><span>The Summary Page of the Vehicle Register looks like below, it pulls all information from individual registration tabs, this page does not require manual updating.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/909cd616-53c6-4de6-aeda-f3c8a4e86491" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/909cd616-53c6-4de6-aeda-f3c8a4e86491" /></a></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The individual tab that feeds into the summary:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f8a7e1df-4e74-487b-8a3f-17ba2d2633d4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f8a7e1df-4e74-487b-8a3f-17ba2d2633d4" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>

</p><p><span>In an ideal situation, I’d love to be able to combine the uniform &amp; equipment register with our training matrix which is also just basic excel. Example of the information in there is as follows:</span></p>

<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1b404717-1111-4938-84dd-eb473211781d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1b404717-1111-4938-84dd-eb473211781d" /></a></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>I don’t know whether I need to go all out with Excel and have fancy formulas and stuff, including multiple tabs for individual employees (like the vehicle register) or whether Access might be a better
 way to run.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Ideally, I’d like to be able to also have a few alerts come up when I need to action things – like organise new car or IDS, arrange training, etc.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thoughts and advice would be appreciated, I'm just not sure where to start!</span></p>

            <p>Hi Jay,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your concern is interesting, comparing two Microsoft products will be such a challenge. To understand simply the main difference between Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Access is, Access is a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) that helps in storing
 and relating the data for further use while Excel is a simple datasheet program where data can be calculated and tabulated for current use.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Auto Highlight Delete function</h2>
                    When editing a word document Highlighting automatically occurs when a word is clicked on or if you click between the word. This sets up the possibility of deleting the word automatically. Furthermore if you try to escaped the highlighting by clicking randomly
 the entire paragraph may highlight and again with the possibility of deleting the entire paragraph. In summary the auto highlight make editing a document very tedious.
