<h2>            Battlefield V &#47; Battlefield 1 playing online problem.</h2>
                    Hello&nbsp;<br />
Last year I created my brother ( born 23.09.1999 ) a microsoft account. Back than i didnt know that his birth date ( for joke I made his acc with birth date in 2005 ) will be such a problem. This year he bought an Xbox console , now he cant play online in games
 such as BF's collection. I guess its bcuz of his birth date. But i cant change it now .... How i can solve this problem ? He got all permissions like an adult but the game is still blocking him from playing online ....&nbsp;<br />
Is there any way to fix this ?&nbsp;

<p>The problem is that the publishers of the battlefield games (EA) will not allow users with child accounts to play the games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is an EA issue and there is nothing that MS can do to fix this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once a DOB is put onto an account it is set in stone and there is no way to change it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If he is wanting to play the games he will have to make him an account with the DOB that is over 18.</p>

<p>You need to rip CDs onto your hard drive. Burnt CDs don't work.</p>
<p>Once music is on there by those means, your music player can play, even while gaming.</p>
<p>OR, use an MP3 player connected by USB, which will work the same way.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 now shows &#34;Unidentified Network - Public Network&#34;, no internet access.</h2>
                    <p>After getting over the problems with a Windows Update that would not load, I now have a scenario where my system reports no internet access via Ethernet.&nbsp; I have had to install a Wi-Fi adapter to get connectivity.&nbsp; Whilst it's good I now have access again,
 I want to know why I don't have Ethernet access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Through the network diagnostics file, I get a report stating "Ethernet" does not have a valid IP configuration.
</p>
<pre><p>Details about network adapter diagnosis:

I've reset the configuration and updated drivers.  The only thing I have not done is uninstall the drivers - I'm worried about being able to get them back.</p><p /><p>It would be nice to have a week on Windows 10 without issues.</p>

    <title>Offline Achievement Question - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> darthlama  say:</h3>
<h2>            Offline Achievement Question</h2>
                    
<p>Hi Guys, quick question. I am not doing the 1.2 Patch, since I don't feel like breaking my game. Anyways, if I play offline and earn achievements, how does that work? When I log back into XBL does it update them? or do they just not count? I always play
 logged in for whatever reason, and it just&nbsp;occurred to me I have never earned an offline achievement. It's really not a big deal to me, I don't normally track achievements, but I was thinking of trying to 100% this game, is that possible if I play offline?
 Either way I'm not downloading the patch, just curious. Thanks!</p>

<p>I searched for the same thing and the big concern for people is that since you need to be online to get a time stamp on the achievement, some people could accuse you of cheating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But since Skyrim is not meant to be played online, don't think that will be much of a problem.</p>

<p>Ah, I see. Well that's a chance I'll just have to take then.. thanks for the heads up. Once they fix the patch I'll go back to online play, but there is no way I'm getting that 1.2 until it's fixed. Thanks again.</p>

<p>I have played a good few years offline during game campaigns like gears of war, oblivion, call of duty, you still get the gamer points and achivements for completing them. You just get the achivement with no date you accomplished it. i dont care if i get
 it online or offline cuz you get it either way regardless.</p>

<p>Cool, thanks for the replies guys. I'm just going to play offline until they patch the patch. I wasn't having any problems with 1.1, there seems to be no reason at all for me to try 1.2.</p>

<p>Due to a bad internet connection a lot of my achievements were earned offline, it says that i got 1000/1000 gamerscore but a lot of the achievements show up grey on xbox.com profile, on my xbox they are all perfect.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>This is not due to a patch, it's been like this since the game was released and i've heard it's actually like this for a few games.</p>

<p>that's an issue with Xbox.com it's been that way for weeks. It's really screwy when comparing games too, for example I compare my games to you Argonian Leader and it says you have none played, 0GS and are labeled as a Cheater for Gamerzone...</p>

    <title>WIndows speech recognition export import&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jonnf.  say:</h3>
<h2>            WIndows speech recognition export import&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm handicapped and use speech recognition for everything. I just got a new computer and I am having problems with the setup and import of my profile.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everywhere I look there is only generic copy/paste answers and they are not helping.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem 1: When I run the microphone setup wizard, it keeps telling me "The computer did not hear anything." despite the sound meter moved rapidly and on green during the test phrase.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem 2: I have used the Windows speech profile manager to backup my speech profile from the other (Win 10) pc. The program is from 2004, but I read somewhere that it still works.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sadly, when I try to import the profile I get lots of error messages. </p>
<p>
</p><p>****************************************</p>
<p>WARNING: The profile's target engine () is not available. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The profile data has been imported but will not work for the missing engine.&nbsp; If you install the engine at a later date, please run the microphone
<br />
<br />
"ERROR: Unable to create key (Files\TrainingAudio\.... " in the registry. Please insure that speech is installed and that no programs which use speech (such as office) are open, then try again.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>. </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>. ****************************************</p>
<p>The Windows speech profile manager is 12 years old,&nbsp; and windows easy transfer has been discontinued and is not a part of Windows 10.</p>
<p>Does anyone know a working way of transferring my speech profile? </p>

            <p>The WSRProfile backup/restore tool was designed for WSR, Windows Speech Recognition, used in all versions of the operating system since 2006 release of Vista. It sounds like your speech profile was created with the speech recognition built into Microsoft
 Office used with XP. If this is the case, you may have to create a new speech profile.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for WSR microphone not working, does the microphone work in other applications?</p>

            <p>The mic works in skype, but not as good as it did on the previous computer. The problem might lie with the build in sound chip.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The speech profile was built on an English installation of win 10, the same as I am using now...

            <p>&nbsp;I am wondering, does your new computer have a built-in microphone? If so, you need to set your external microphone as the default. You can do this by right-clicking the speaker icon in the lower-right task bar. Check that your external microphone is the
 default and if not set it as the default.</p>

            <p>Regarding Problem #1 ("the computer did not hear anything"), are you using an external microphone attached to your computer like a headset microphone? And does your computer have a microphone built into it? Most laptops and all-in-one desktops do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, it might be helpful to go into the Sound control panel and both disable the built-in microphone and set your external microphone as the default device. That way, you won't accidentally be trying to use two microphones at the same time. Here's how:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Open the Sound control panel. You can locate it my typing "sound" into the Start menu.</p>
<p>2. Click the Recording tab.</p>
<p>3. Locate the internal microphone in the list and right-click on it.</p>
<p>4. Choose <strong>Disable</strong> from the menu that appears.</p>
<p>5. Right-click on your external microphone in the list and choose <strong>Set as Default Device</strong>.</p>
<p>6. Click OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then try the Microphone Setup Wizard again. Hopefully it will now work better!</p>

            <p>It's a desktop computer, and the mic is correctly identified as the default one. The sound meter do move when I try to set up the mic. But the mic isn't really the problem, by that I mean I think the problem with that is the different sound chip. Since I'm
 handicapped I can't find it myself, but I have a USB sound card laying around somewhere that I'll try.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that fixes the problem with the mic, the real problem is the transfer of the speech profile. :/</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know if PcMover Express transfers the speech profile? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help so far :) </p>

<p>If you have not already, I would try re-exporting your profile on the older computer, and see if that profile will import on your new computer without error messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that does not work, I'm stumped unfortunately. As far as I know, about all you can do at that point is start from scratch on your new computer without importing the old profile. Add the words you want to the profile on your new computer, do some training
 to&nbsp;improve accuracy, and go into the future with that.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Serious instalation problems leaving me with a useless PC</h2>
                    <p>Old Advent T9307 computer that has been running fine for a good number of years, except replacement graphic card and updated memory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Came complete with Windows XP home edition...or media edition?...anyway, had a conflict with itunes and not accessing my iphone so decided to delete itunes and also Winamp, and since then i seem to have lost the lot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;After a reboot seems BOOTMGR missing came up, so a search via laptop came up with a WiNToBootsic which seems to have solved that probelm, only to now be faced with no version of windows on HDD at all??...also i have now recieved a DISK BOOT FAILURE, INSERT
 SYSTEM DISK AND PRESS ENTER...as the PC originally came without system discs or any supporting software except what was pre installed, i am a little stumped and getting frustrated after spending 17hrs on a sunday and also several hours today, so far, trying
 every method to sort this. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is no good me trying to get hold of boot disks as there is no floppy drive fitted or supplied..besides not used a floppy disc since college back in 90's.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please can someone assist...all i want is my PC back up and running again.</p>

<h2>            My printer won&#39;t print &#40;brand new HP computer with Windows 8&#41;</h2>
                    I have a brand new HP computer with Windows 8. Staples set me up supposedly so I can use my old printer. The printer, which is an HP LaserJet 6L will not print. It shows on the list of devices: HP LaserJet 6L, USB 001, Ready. And I marked it default. But
 when I try to print I get an error message. Also, now that I've tried to print a document (which won't print), the printer keeps going on and on printing out blank pages.<br />
One of the Help functions (I can't recall which, there are so many ways to get help it is extremely confusing) and it seems like the problem might be that I need to upgrade the driver (whatever that is) and in order to do this it told me to go to Search (one
 of the charms) and then type W... and then when the options showed to choose Windows Update. Well....there IS NO SUCH CHOICE as Windows Update!&nbsp; So what do I do? I don't even know if the driver is the problem. Can anyone help me to know what to do? Or to which
 help site/function to get help?<br />
Thank you.<br />

<p>did you go to the HP support site and see if there is a&nbsp;Win 8 drivers for it?</p>
<p>There are 4 different LaserJet 6 printers list, doubt HP supports any of them with Windows 8, but you should find the exact model of your printer and search the HP drivers for it.</p>

            It could suggest you need to update your chipset drivers and BIOS. 
<br />I recommend you update the most critical ones:  BIOS, Chipset, Display Driver, Network adapters. 
<br />If that does not work, I recommend you try two things 
<br />First: Boot to the Windows 10 desktop 
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Batteries 
<br />Right-click Microsoft ACPI-Compliant System. 
<br />Choose Update Driver Software. 
<br />Make sure you are connected to the Internet, the check for updates. 
<br />
<br />You can also uninstall the battery then restart.
<br />
<br />or
<br />
<br />Shutdown, remove the battery, connect to direct current, start up. 
<br />
<br />Shutdown, reinstall the battery, then start the computer again.

            Hi Cletus.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If the PC is less than a year old contact the manufacturer's Support as it has a full year's parts replacement and Support warranty.  You want them to test it for you to set it up for RMA.  
<br />
<br />Otherwise you can calibrate the battery yourself following this guide:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/172271/how-to-calibrate-your-laptops-battery-for-accurate-battery-life-estimates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/172271/how-to-calibra...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Have you tried reseating the battery? Generally, no battery is detected when either the battery is faulty or the connector pins have some issue.

<p><span>Hi ShannonMarie,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a. Did you make any prior changes to the computer (like installing any programs or updates) before the issue surfaced?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For now, I’d recommend you to open event viewer and check if there are any significant details related to the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the following Microsoft article for more information on event viewer:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What information appears in event logs (Event Viewer)?</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-information-appears-in-event-logs-Event-Viewer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-information-appears-in-event-logs-Event-Viewer</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Check-a-drive-for-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>check the drive for any errors</span></a> and check if that fixes the error.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>You can also run check disk from command line instructions. Refer the following TechNet articles for more information:
</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Chkdsk</span></p>
<p>
<span><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb491051.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb491051.aspx</span></a></span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> If any bad sectors are found while running
 the check disk utility and if <span>attempt recovery of bad sectors is checked while checking the drive for errors, the data in the bad sector may be lost while attempting to recover bad sectors.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>You may also try creating a
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/Windows7/Create-a-user-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>new user account</span></a> and check if the issue recurs in the newly created account.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If in the new user account, the issue does not persist; it indicates that your old user account could have gone corrupt.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Access the link below and follow the steps to repair the corrupt user profile:</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the delay in response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you face issues with installing Windows 10, you can easily upgrade to Windows 10 using the Media creation tool.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Media creation tool link</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>However if you still want to go back to the earlier Operating system and you don't want to get the Windows 10 upgrade, try these steps</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>You need to uninstall the updates <strong>KB3035583 </strong>and <strong>KB2976978
</strong>then Check for updates and Hide these updates </p>
<br />
<p>Refer the link if you have queries with <strong>Windows 10</strong>:</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/frequently-asked-questions-windows-10/5c0b9368-a9e8-4238-b1e4-45f4b7ed2fb9">Frequently Asked Questions: Windows 10</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also run a disk clean up and remove the unwanted installation files.</p>
<p>Refer the steps mentioned in the link</p>
<p>

            <p>You cannot, without changing hardware, and if this is a Laptop you cannot do that.</p>
<p>I assume your drivers are up to date from your PC maker, or hardware makers in the case of a generic desktop</p>

            <p>Palcouk is correct, and&nbsp;having up to date drivers can increase performance in some applications.</p>
<p>Also, don't get too hung up on WEI scores - they are only meant as rough guidance. Think about what you use your PC for then investigate what hardware, if any, to upgrade based on that.</p>

<h2>            Hiro H50113 Modem Not recognized by Windows 8</h2>
                    <p>I recently purchased the Hiro H50113 external USB Modem for my Dell Inspiron Laptop to get online since laptops don't have modems anymore for the most part. It said it was compatible with Windows 8 but I haven't had any luck so far. I downloaded the drivers
 for Windows 8 and installed them, but still no luck. Windows 8 isn't recognizing the device at all. The LED lights go on when I hook the device up, so it is getting power.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dial Up is unfortunately the only internet available in my area, and I've been stopping at coffee shops after work to get online and try to figure out some way to fix the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If anyone knows a way to make the modem work, that would be amazing, or even just a modem that will work.

I have, and the most they told me was that the modem held the stuff I needed to get it to work, and I didn't need to install drivers at all. But the modem isn't being detected, so it's not working correctly and just squeals when it tries to dial out. They couldn't
 really offer any other help then that.<br />
<br />
I got a new cord set for it just to be sure that it wasn't a flawed cord as well.<br />

            <p>I installed the Hiro H50113. Although the modem came with a CD, I never put the CD in my computer, nor used anything from it. I'm using Windows 8.1. &nbsp;Looked to me like the modem is plug and play with the needed drivers on the modem itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I plugged the phone jack ("LINE") into the wall, and plugged the USB into the computer. I did not use the "PHONE" phone jack, just the "LINE" phone jack.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started Windows Fax and Scan as Administrator. First Windows 8.1 Fax and Scan reported not finding any modems, then a window popped up asking to install the driver. I allowed the installation. I checked that Windows Fax and Scan Receive picks up and that
 Send dials. At this point, appears to me that everything is working properly. Windows Fax and Scan detects and uses the modem.</p>

<p>Hello <br />
Welcome to Microsoft answers</p>
<p>I would suggest you to follow the steps from this article and see if the issue gets fixed.<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/819836" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/819836</a></p>
<p>To troubleshoot this problem, use the following methods in the order in which they are presented.</p>
<p>Method 1: Restart the computer by using a clean startup:-<br />
When you start Microsoft Windows, other software may start together with the operating system. These programs may include antivirus software and system programs that can interfere with the game. When you perform a clean restart procedure, you prevent these
 programs from starting automatically. You must be logged on as an administrator or as a member of the Administrators group to complete this procedure. If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may also prevent you from completing this
 procedure.<br />
For more information about how to perform a clean boot, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/331796/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/331796/</a></p>
<p>Perform a clean startup to determine whether background programs are interfering with your game or program</p>
<p>Method 2: Disable firewall or antivirus programs:-<br />
Warning:-this workaround may make your computer or your network more vulnerable to attack by malicious users or by malicious software such as viruses. We do not recommend this workaround, but are providing this information so that you can implement this workaround
 at your own discretion. Use this workaround at your own risk. <br />
The game may have problems connecting to multiplayer services if you have an antivirus program or a firewall program installed. For example, firewall programs that allow access or block access to the Internet on a per-program basis, such as Zone Alarm, MacAfee
 Personal Firewall, Norton Internet Security, Black Ice Defender, and so on.</p>
<p>To determine whether the problem is occurring because of antivirus software or a firewall, temporarily disable your antivirus or firewall software. Contact the program manufacturer to help you disable the program. Icons for these programs may appear in the
 Notification area in the lower-right corner of the screen. You may be able to disable the program by using these icons.<br />
If disabling the firewall resolves the issue, contact the firewall software manufacturer for instructions about how to configure your firewall to work with your game or simulation. See the "References" section in this article for links to other articles that
 contain ways to contact hardware and software manufacturers.</p>
<p>Method 3: Bypass the router:-<br />
If you connect to the Internet by using a router, there may be a problem with the configuration settings that requires that the settings be updated. To determine whether a network connectivity problem is caused by a misconfiguration or by a problem that affects
 the router, try bypassing the router by connecting your computer directly to the modem. Remember that this test only verifies that the router is configured correctly. If the game connects to the Internet without a problem when you bypass the router, reconnect
 router immediately, and then contact the router manufacturer or your ISP for help to configure the router correctly.</p>
<p>Method 4: Download and install Microsoft DirectX:-<br />
We recommend that all participating players use the same version of DirectX. To download and install the latest version of DirectX, visit the following Microsoft Web site:
<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/directx/default.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/directx/default.mspx</a><br />
If you have the most recent version of DirectX installed, reinstall DirectX after you perform a clean restart on the computer. For information about how to restart the computer by using a clean restart procedure, see the “Restart the computer by using a clean
 restart” section in this article.</p>
<p>Method 5: Open the required ports:-<br />
Certain ports may be required to connect to the game server that you want to reach.<br />
To view the specific ports that your game requires, search the Microsoft Knowledge Base by using the game name and the keyword "ports."</p>
<p>Different routers and firewalls can be configured to either allow or block a port. Because there are many kinds of routers and firewalls, you should contact your ISP, or firewall or router manufacturer to make sure that the required ports for that game are
 open.</p>
<p>You can find many third-party Web sites that provide “test ports” or “port scanning” tools to determine whether the appropriate ports are open in your system. To locate these sites, search on the keywords "port scanning tool."</p>
<p>Note In a client/server environment, port configurations can be changed only by a network administrator.</p>
<p>Method 6: Run the Internet Connectivity Evaluation Tool<br />
The Microsoft Internet Connectivity Evaluation Tool runs several tests to make sure that you are connected correctly to the Internet. To use the toll, visit the following Web site:
<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/using/tools/igd/default.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/using/tools/igd/default.mspx</a></p>
<p>Follow the instructions on the Web site to test your connectivity.</p>
<p>Hope it helps<br />
Thanks and regards<br />

            <p>Hello Martin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I would like to verify a could of things, before we proceed with any troubleshooting steps. First, are you resetting the PC with the option to "keep my files" or "remove everything"? Also, how long has it been stuck to 33%?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you select remove everything, it might take a long while before it completes. Some of our community members reported that it takes a couple or more hours getting stuck at a certain percentage. Take a look at this
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/windows-10-reset-stuck-at-99/664bad5b-f722-45cb-9cfb-2b2db414dee4">post

</p>
<p>Note&nbsp;2 - Just in case you have heard of <em>Password reset disks</em> for local user accounts, note that they achieve nothing more than writing the password down achieves</p>
<p>Note 3 - All my own user account passwords&nbsp;are written down on paper within one of those little dog collar ID tally things that is attached to my main keyring.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c67e5fbc-a53c-4517-bdcf-69187cd3c32e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c67e5fbc-a53c-4517-bdcf-69187cd3c32e" style="margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>2&nbsp; When you have done that it is always useful [as a guard against user profile corruption in the future] to create a spare [an additional] password-protected
<ul>
<li>one for troubleshooting use only, &amp; </li><li>an used one for any user-profile-related emergency in the future.&nbsp; Accounts that are not in use do not tend to suffer from user profile corruption.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>3&nbsp; When this setting up is done, your wife&nbsp;can log in to her existing local user account and go to
<em>Settings</em>, <em>Accounts</em>, <em>Your info </em>where she will find the link
<em>Sign in with a Microsoft account instead</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;Your wife can then, if desired,&nbsp;delete your account at <em>Settings</em>, <em>
Accounts</em>, <em>Family &amp; other people</em>, <em>Other people</em> subheading&nbsp;by selecting your account and clicking on the
<em>Remove </em>button.&nbsp; She will be asked if she also wants to delete all of your files - this is probably the appropriate choice unless you have files you want to save first.&nbsp; It does no harm for your account to remain on her computer ready for use just as
 it would do no harm for hers to be on yours.</p>

More details here:&nbsp;<a href="http://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://curl.haxx.se/</a></p>
<p>curl performs SSL certificate verification by default, using a "bundle"<br />
of Certificate Authority (CA) public keys (CA certs). If the default<br />
bundle file isn't adequate, you can specify an alternate file<br />
using the --cacert option.<br />
If this HTTPS server uses a certificate signed by a CA represented in<br />
the bundle, the certificate verification probably failed due to a<br />
problem with the certificate (it might be expired, or the name might<br />
not match the domain name in the URL).<br />
If you'd like to turn off curl's verification of the certificate, use<br />
the -k (or --insecure) option.</p>

    <title>VPN Services don&#39;t work on my computer. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            VPN Services don&#39;t work on my computer.</h2>
                    Hello, over a week ago I tried installing Proton VPN, and the setup ended prematurely, but the app still worked. After trying to connect to Proton Servers, it failed endless times. So I searched for other VPN's, I tried TunnelBear, Hotspot, Betternet,
 no vpn service will either install, or connect to servers. When I went to check my network adapter devices, WAN miniport IKEv2, IP, and PPTP have warning signs below the icon, normally, I tried deleting them and restoring them, but they still have the error
 symbol. What's going on?

<p>Thanks for your help, but unfortunately nothing has changed. I will attempt to explain the problem more thoroughly. With some VPN services during install, the install fails because the TAP couldn't be installed, some services say that a windows service that
 is supposed to be running isn't. Just now when I clicked on my Network icon (on the taskbar) it says I am connected to ethernet, and below it is a "Windscribe IKE v2" which i do not know how to get rid of. I've uninstalled windscribed vpn, but that stayed.
 Most importantly, when I try to open VPN option in network settings under control center, the window itself freezes. I cannot click anything else after I select "VPN" under Network Setting Under windows 10 control center, except for closing the window. Any
 suggestions? I tried everything above.</p>

<p>Hi Nina,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's take care of your concern. Reverting the "Not a fan" option on <strong>Windows Spotlight
</strong>will be complicated and is not recommended as you will need to edit the <strong>
Windows Registry</strong>, which may result for a much bigger issue if something went wrong. However, we can try to check the Spotlight directory from your device and see if the image is stored and use it as your lockscreen/background/screensaver. Follow the
 steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open <strong>File </strong><strong>Explorer</strong>, copy and paste the following into
<strong>File Explorer</strong><strong>'s</strong> address bar: <span><em><strong>%LocalAppData%\Packages\Microsoft.Windows.ContentDeliveryManager_cw5n1h2txyewy\LocalState\Assets</strong></em></span></li><li><span>Select all files by pressing <strong>CTRL+C</strong>.</span></li><li><span><strong>Create </strong>or <strong>Open </strong>a folder anywhere on your desktop and paste the files you just copied by pressing
<strong>CTRL+V</strong>.</span></li><li><span>On the folder you pasted the files, click on <strong>File </strong>on the upper-left portion of the screen, navigate to
<strong>Open command prompt</strong> &gt; and click <strong>Open command prompt</strong>.</span></li><li><span>On the <strong>Command prompt</strong> window, type <strong><em>ren * *.jpg</em></strong> and hit
<strong>Enter</strong>. This should change the file type and you should see the images by right-clicking inside the window and click
<strong>View </strong>&gt; <strong>Large </strong><strong>icon</strong><em><strong>/</strong></em><strong>Extra
</strong><strong>large</strong> <strong>icon</strong>. See if you can find your favorite image.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>Looking forward to your response.</span><br />

<h2>            Internet stops working every 10 minutes or so. Please help.</h2>
                    Hello! <br />
I have an issue where my internet goes to "secured, no internet" repeatedly on an everyday basis.
<br />
This can range from every 2 minutes to every 30 minutes. This has been an issue for several months now, but by now I have sort of just had about enough.<br />
<br />
To get it to work again I turn off my wifi and wait for about 10 seconds before I turn it back on, and even then will sometimes have to troubleshoot to get it to work. If I just troubleshoot without turning wi-fi off and on, it's usually not enough.<br />
<br />
I know that it has nothing to do with my actual internet since it works fine on all other devices, furthermore, I've read about other people with Windows 10 who have the very same issue. Clearly without finding a solution, though. I suspect it does have something
 to do with power-saving since it usually happens more frequently when I'm streaming music or videos.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Things I have tried so far:<br />
<br />
<strong>Resetting my router.&nbsp;</strong>Didn't change a thing. In fact, I've even changed internet provider and router for unrelated reasons without it making any difference. Even when using a mobile hotspot, connected by usb, the issue persists.<br />
<br />
<strong>Resetting my computer.</strong> Curiously enough, this actually worked for a while until the issue reemerged. Not for very long though, and absolutely not worth doing for the inconvenience it caused me.<br />
<br />
<strong>Unchecking power-saving permission in network adapter properties.&nbsp;</strong>Didn't change a thing.<br />
<br />
I am&nbsp;<strong>begging</strong> someone to help me here, it's absolutely unbearable at this point.<br />
<br />

            Hi, sara
<br />
<br />My name is Kathleen and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />Try to repair your internet connection.
<br />
<br />Go to those steps, from the Start menu or by pressing the key combination Win + I open the Configuration and click on the option Networks and Internet. Once there, we select the option Status of the left side menu and within the settings and options that are loaded in the right panel we have to look for network restoration.
<br />
<br />Clicking on this option will show us a new window from where we will be able to perform the network reset in Windows 10. In this way, all the network adapters will be removed and reinstalled and the original configuration of other components of the network will be re-established. net. This implies that if we were using some software such as a VPN client or virtual switches, we will have to reinstall them.
<br />
<br />A process that is carried out automatically by the system by clicking on the Reset button now shown in Network Reset in the Windows 10 configuration. It is normal that the process does not take too long, although we must wait until the end completely and restart the computer again to proceed with the network configuration in Windows 10 as we had until now.
<br />
<br />Let us know if these steps help you to resolve the issue.

            Hi, <br />
<br />
If the issue persists can you provide the following information which may help determine any issue(s):
<br />
<br />
Windows Key + R &gt; type msinfo32 in the "Open" box &gt; OK &gt; File &gt; Save &gt; then save as an .nfo file
<br />
<br />
Then make the resulting .nfo file available via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site.
<br />
<br />
Also, can you do the following: <br />
<br />
Windows Key + R &gt; type eventvwr in the "Open" box &gt; OK &gt; expand "Custom Views" and then right-click "Administrative Events" &gt; select "Save all events in Custom View As" and save as an .evtx file
<br />
<br />
Then make the resulting .evtx file available via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site.
<br />
<br />
Here's a link on using OneDrive: <br />

            Your last BIOS Update was 2015 and the latest BIOS update is from April 2016. I would try applying that:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://dlcdnets.asus.com/pub/ASUS/nb/G551JW/G551JWAS209.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://dlcdnets.asus.com/pub/ASUS/nb/G551JW/G5...</a>
<br />
<br />There is also a wireless driver update from September 2015. If you have not yet applied that, I would do so. 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://dlcdnets.asus.com/pub/ASUS/nb/DriversForWin10/WLAN/WLAN_Intel_Win10_64_VER181203.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://dlcdnets.asus.com/pub/ASUS/nb/DriversFo...</a>
<br />
<br />I noticed you are still on the old Windows 10 1803 release, which now a couple generations behind. Try upgrading to the newer Windows 10 1809 release:
<br />
<br />Download the Media Creation Tool Now
<br /><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209</a>
<br />
<br />Right click the MediaCreationTool.exe file then click Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement:
<br />
<br />Select the option Upgrade this PC now if you want to upgrade right away,
<br />
<br />Click Next
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup does one final check to ensure your system is ready.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will check if you have enough disk space. If you don’t, review the following article for instructions how to upgrade to Windows 10 Anniversary Update on a system with limited space:
<br />
<br />Please note, you have the option of choosing what you would like to keep, which includes personal files, apps and settings.
<br />
<br />If you want to perform a new install or just keep your files click Change what to keep. Once you have chosen the desired options, click Install to begin.
<br />
<br />This will be your screen for a little while. During the installation, your computer will restart several times.
<br />
<br />After the first restart, Windows 10 setup will resume. You will notice the setup experience has once again been refined from the previous animated circle. This will be your screen for a while. When complete, Windows 10 setup will restart automatically.
<br />
<br />Sign into your account.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 completes application updates and post setup tasks.
<br />
<br />That’s it, the Windows 10 Creators Update is installed.You can check Windows Update for latest updates, click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Check for Updates.
<br />
<br />How to prepare your computer before upgrading?
<br />
<br />Although updating to Windows 10 version 1803 to 1809 or 1903 is a relatively simple process, similar to a repair upgrade; users should perform some basic pre-requisites before initiating the upgrade.
<br />
<br />If you are finding it difficult to carry out some of the steps described below, please review detailed instructions how to perform them:

<p>I apologise for the late reply.<br />
<br />
I updated my windows version to 1809, but when I check for updates, I get no options to update to 1903.<br />
<br />
I applied the wireless driver update. <br />
<br />
I attempted to install the BIOS update, but my computer went BSOD and I haven't attempted since.<br />
<br />
The issue has unfortunately gotten worse now and I have to both turn off/on and troubleshoot every single time, sometimes several times for it to work. Earlier it was so bad that my internet only worked for about 30 seconds before it went back to no connection

<h2>            Auto pressing keys</h2>
                    My computer is auto typing several unknown keys! Sometimes, when I work on a list, it scroll back to top! Its not my mouse because it works like the arrow keys- one by one. I have formatted all drives and disconnected laptop built in keyboard. I am currently
 using an external keyboard. (Note: My external keyboard is tested and there is no issues). I have also tried uninstalling keyboard drivers and updating them. But nothing seems to be the solution.&nbsp; What can I do to solve this problem?<br />
I am using HP ProBook 440 Windows 10 with external mouse and keyboard.

<p>So by disconnecting the built-in keyboard we lessen the issue, but we don't necessarily eliminate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you recall when the issue started happening? Perhaps there was an update or certain change on that day.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, please try updating your touchpad's driver. Although this isn't directly connected to the affected devices, its still one of the input devices. Thus, it can affect the process of the laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, we highly recommend that you contact your laptop's manufacturer. Their input will be vital since this is primarily affecting the hardware.</p>

<p>Been having this problem as well but the 'disconnecting from live' isn't working. it took me literally over 24 hours to install Battlefield 4 and it's driving me crazy. Any other help would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hi Javsha,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The link to the Sky Drive is not accessible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please check the private message and follow the instructions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For now, you may refer to the instructions given below.</p>
<p><br />
What is the make and model of the PC?</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Unplug any external devices connected to the computer and check if that helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>You may&nbsp;use powercfg to turn in and off hibernation. When you hibernate, Windows saves the system’s memory to the Hiberfil.sys file on your C:\ drive. If this file becomes corrupted, hibernate may not work properly. To fix a corrupted Hiberfil.sys file,
 you can disable and re-enable hibernate in Windows. Windows will delete the Hiberfil.sys file and recreate it when you perform this process.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>To make hibernation unavailable, follow these steps:</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.Go to start screen, and then type command prompt.</p>
<p>2.In the search results list, right-click Command Prompt as Administrator.<br />
3.When you are prompted by User Account Control, click Continue.<br />
4.At the command prompt, type powercfg.exe /hibernate off, and then press Enter. <br />
5.Type exit, and then press Enter to close the Command Prompt window.</p>
