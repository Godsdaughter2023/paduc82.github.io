<h2>            Unable to boot Windows 10 due to storport.sys error</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a HP laptop, 1 year old. After a year without malfunction I booted it today, and it rebooted on its own when on desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From then on, Windows 10 crashes each time I try to boot my computer, after I log in on my user account. I have no access to desktop and further functionalities (bear that in mind if you have a solution). Just a deep black screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes I get a BSOD telling me something like "driver irql isn't less or equal" mentioning it is a storport.sys error.</p>
<p>Windows then tries to fix the problem, always fails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I tried so far :</p>
<p>- Clean boot : makes me get to the desktop but I can't do anything, nothing works when I try to launch a program or open anything.</p>
<p>- sfc/scannow : works until like 70% then says Windows couldn't complete the task.</p>
<p>- Loading a restauration save : tried it twice with save from 4 and 15 days ago, no luck.</p>
<p>- Reinstall Windows from boot menu : at nearly 30% it says it couldn't reinstall, thus no change has been made.</p>
<p>- Chkdsk doesn't work for some reason</p>
<p>- BIOS : loaded default setup already&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>No new program installed before crash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Soooo... is there a way to make Windows launch again without losing all my data?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Cakesemoule, storport.sys is the device driver for your chipset . . .
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager 
<br />
<br />Expand the IDE ATA'ATAPI AHCI Controller Section
<br />
<br />Right click the contained device and choose 'Update Driver'
<br />
<br />Restart your PC
<br />
<br />If that does not resolve the issue, go to the Support page for your device on the manufacturers website, then download and install the Chipset driver they recommend . ..

<p>Sorry my English may be a bit off and some terms aren't quite the same ìn my language.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot do anything in safe mode, Windows crashes on the desktop and I can't open anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already have access to recovery environment (and only that) but so far none of the tools available resolved this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your quick answer&nbsp;</p>

            Hi, From the Recovery Environment, does System Restore have any restore points you can go back to - that would be the best way to fix this . . .

<p>See J W Stuart's reply, but let me add the following:</p>
<p>Most people with multiple "partitions"on a single physical drive<br />
really have two partitions--one primary and one extended. The extended<br />
partition then contains multiple logical drives.</p>
<p>Using a logical drive is almost exactly like using a partition, so the<br />
logical drives are typically also called "partitions," even though it<br />
is literally incorrect. &nbsp;</p>

<p>You are only allowed a maximum of four partitions. More than likely you have created four "Primary" partitions.</p>
<p>If you want to access that "Unallocated" space you have two choices:</p>
<p>1) Expand/Extend the last partition to include the unallocated space.</p>
<p>2) Delete the last "Primary" partition (save your data first) and create an "Extended" partition, which then can be used to create one or more logical drives.</p>

<h3> bob428  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB keyboard not working</h2>
                    Hi, can anybody help please, I have a Dell Dimension 8400, the origional keyboard (PS/2), stopped working, an old keyboard works fine in the same port, so I bought a Comfort Curve Keyboard 2000, with a USB connector, but it will not work in Windows, it
 will work in the BIOS screen, in this screen USB is enabled, but the only referance to Legacy is under the Mouse section, PS/2, which is on, the mouse is USB and working fine. I tried it with a PS/2 adpter, still no good, on an XP Pro machine, it worked straight
 away, it was reconised as a Human Interface Device, but on my machine it is listed as a USB Composite Device, there is an error message in Device Manager, code 28 driver not installed, I have been through the Wizard and allowed it to go online to find a driver,
 none found, I did install Microsoft IntelliType Pro, from the links for my keyboard type, not made any differance. Any Ideas, Thanks<br />

            Problem solved, not sure how, but I went into Device Manager, right clicked on the keyboard under USB devices, and selected uninstall, then re-started and selected F8 into safe mode, keyboard worked fine, so re-started into Windows, still working ok, plus
 all the hot keys are working, re-started again, still ok, so hope that's it,<br />

Hi</p>
<p>Please provide some details?</p>
<p>Has this been working and it no longer works?</p>
<p>Are you using an Aero Theme?</p>
<p>The Flip3D will not work if you are using the Windows 7 Basic or the Classic Theme.</p>
<p>Also, this feature is not available in the Starter or Home Basic editions of Windows 7.</p>
<p>Let us know.</p>

<h2>            False charges to credit card</h2>
                    
<p>I know I need to call Xbox Live support for this, but I just found out and it says support is closes at 1am, so I figured I would call tomorrow. Before I do that I thought I would go ahead and post something here. It seems that my account was charged falsely
 2 times a couple of hours ago. First was for a 6000 point package and the second was for a 4000 point package. The first charge went through, but the second didn't. That is still $75 dollars that has been charged that I did not do. To top it all off, the points
 I did have vanished and all I have are 10 points now. Not even the 6000 that someone charged to my account.</p>
<p>I am just making sure that the right thing to do is call or is there another place I can email to request these charges be removed, get my money, and my points back. Last year a similar thing happened to my iTunes and all I had to do was email.. I did go
 ahead and change my password in case I was hacked or something.</p>

<h2>            External drive causing xbox one to turn off</h2>
                    I tried turning my xbox one on with the external drive plugged in (what i usually do) and the console would come on but turn off after a few seconds. I browsed through some forums and one person said they unplugged their external drive and it worked. I
 tried this and it does work but if i try and plug my external drive in, even with a different cable and port, it shuts off the xbox. Does anyone know what the problem may be?

            Hi! While I didn't ran into this problem myself, I know others have experienced it in the past. In order to find out if it's due to hardware or possibly the operating system, I'd recommend to do a factory reset with keeping your games and apps (so that
 you don't have to install them again): http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults

<p>Hey Morgan Vincent,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It could be an issue with the external hard drive since the console seems to be working fine when it is not plugged in. You might want to look into "repairing" it by plugging it into any PC, and if that doesn't work try formatting. Hope this helps. Let us
 know if you need further help! &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            If you want a Razer Onza... Get the Pro Edition or maybe I&#39;m just lucky &#61;_&#61;</h2>
                    
<p>Onza is a good controller, not just good, it's just simply a better controller than the MS ones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The design is comfortable in your hands. The buttons are responsive like a mouse click. higher controller sticks for more precise aiming control. The sticks are perfectly centered, so no more supernatural character movement from MS controllers. Extended
 trigger tips for better gas and brake control in racing. The D-pad is great, unless you have really big thumbs. Over all, it's a superior controller than MS ones. With the same price, Tournament edition seems like the perfect choice for people who want a new
 controller.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now my rant about the Onza TE controller...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, why get the Pro edition and not Tournament edition? I'm not trying to save you money. I'm trying to save you from all the hassle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got the tournament edition when it first came out. It worked well except a little click-y feel when I push the left controller stick up, as if the stick got stuck on something and I pushed it thru. I thought it's no big deal and kept using it. After couple
 weeks, the click-y feel got worse and I could hear a click sound coming from it every time I push the stick up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I exchanged it. No big deal. Problem is the next one has other controller stick problem. On the loosest resistance setting, one of the stick feels obviously tighter in certain directions. This is just shocking and unacceptable. I exchanged again and the
 next one has the same problem. It was really frustrating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I gave up and bought the Pro edition. No problem from the get go. Still using it, still no problem and still loving it. Pro edition has all the features from Tournament edition except resistance controls. I will gladly give up that resistance control for
 a problem-free controller any day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe I got lucky and got those one in a million bad Onza TE controllers from Razer. I am just wondering, am I the only one having this problem?</p>

<p>Convince me why paying £15 &nbsp;more for two extra buttons is a good idea?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe I've been extremely lucky with my controllers, but i've never once encountered any issues that would make me want to go out and pay £45 for a 3rd party controller, when i can get an official one for £29.99. &nbsp;Granted, i've replaced a pad in the past,
 but that was down to how frequently i was using it over a prolonged period, not because it was poorly made.

<p>The TE is USD49.99 so that's roughly 35 euro, and the PE is USD39.99 so roughly 28 euro? The official controller, ones I can get, range from USD 29.99-49.99. So getting an Onza is actually a pretty good deal for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For some reason, MS controllers just weren't working for me. One out of 2, there's going to be some problem with the controllers, things like bumper not working or stick not centered...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Onza doesn't just come with 2 extra buttons if you read what I wrote XD</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like I said, maybe I'm just extremely lucky with controllers :P</p>

            Hi Remo, this is a new feature in Windows 10, the apps you had open when you close Windows will open when your start your PC, however there is a bug in the system . . .
<br />
<br />Microsoft say they are aware of this issue and are working on a patch
<br />
<br />Here is a workaround which should work until Microsoft roll out the patch: 
<br />
<br />Right click your Desktop, choose New - Shortcut 
<br />
<br />Set Target to: %WINDIR%\system32\shutdown.exe /s /hybrid /t 0 
<br />
<br />Name it: Shutdown 
<br />
<br />
<br />If you use that shortcut to shut your system down, the apps should not auto-open on startup . . .       
        </p>

<h2>            Windows 10 wifi won&#39;t turn on &#47; stay on</h2>
                    <p>Upgraded my Sony Vaio laptop to Windows 10, but now I have no wifi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've searched through the many, many posts of people with the exact same issue, and the solutions presented haven't worked.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I've tried the registry solution (where you delete a registry file that's supposedly causing the issue), but that registry doesn't exist on my laptop so, no luck.
</p>
<p>- I've tried updating drivers, but Windows can't find a newer version.</p>
<p>- I've tried uninstalling the drivers, then restarting windows and letting it automatically reinstall. No luck.</p>
<p>- I don't have any old drivers to 'roll back', it was Windows 7 anyway, so they're incompatible with 10.</p>
<p>- I've tried resetting network settings through command prompt. No luck.</p>
<p>- The Sony Vaio site doesn't have any alternative network adapter drivers for anything later than windows 7. I've tried installing those drivers, they're not compatible with Win10. No luck.</p>
<p>- Drivers are all updated, and 'are working properly' according to Windows. But no wifi.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The wifi switch (in the software) just will not switch on, it just moves straight back to off. Soooooooo frustrating.<br />
</p>
<p>So, if my laptop is just not suitable for Windows 10, my question is, how do I roll back to Windows 7? I mean, Windows ten checked my specs before upgrading and told me it would all be peachy. Now it's not, so how do I roll back?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really don't care about the new features in Windows 10 if I can't use wifi - it's a laptop, it's supposed to be portable. I can't work from anywhere that doesn't have an Ethernet cable now, which has rendered my laptop useless in a cafe or library!<br />
</p>
<p>Please help :(<br />

            <p>This is the second time I have had the similar problem. The first time they reset my entire computer and I lost EVERYTHING since it didn't back-up to the onedrive correctly. I have tried every possible combination of trouble shooting and testing I have found
 on this page and a few others and everything shows my computer as functioning correctly, lights for wifi are on, driver running properly, however, I can't find wifi networks and the wifi switch will not stay in the on position. The light for the wireless connectivity
 is always lit on the front of my computer though. </p>

<p><span>it works fine after i press the power button to power up my laptop, the monitor showing BIOS &amp; Windows Boot Screen, but after that my monitor just turn off. E</span></p>
<p><span>ven when i'm performing clean boot (disable all startup items and disable other than Microsoft services via msconfig) this problems still remains.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>the only thing i could do it's just press the power button to shut down my laptop improperly</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>then press the power button again to power up, then the problem's gone</span></p>
<p><span><strong><br />

<p>
</p><p>I then went to Global Tec Advice's website to warn them about their possibly dangerous link. I clicked on their Home tab and immediately got the same Norton warning. Is their site a sham, a dangerous sham? What do the professionals think?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the website&nbsp;is dangerous is there a way for Microsoft to report/zap them? Or tell authorities to close it down?</p>

</p><p>If the moderator thinks that this warning is correct advice, could he/she copy the post into Windows 7 and 8 forums too in case people thinking of upgrading look there first?</p>

            That site has all the hallmarks of a scam. Quite possibly someone trying to access your personal data.
<p>I would avoid like the plague. I would only trust 'cloud' storage from a reputable company</p>
<p>(I don't use cloud storage anyway).</p>
<p>
</p><p>[<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">EDIT:</span></em> As Mike said below. Advertisment - for a scam. One of many 'free' offers that lead to pay up if</p>
<p>you want the fully functional program, etc. </p>
<p>Some common examples of similar scams are - Registry 'cleaners', Driver 'updaters', and .dll file 'repair' programs.</p>
<p>btw - Don't hang out for anything definitive from the <em>'Support Engineer</em>'. This is a title given to cut and paste</p>
<p>'call center' types, who unfortunately, often as not post irrelevant cut and paste responses. ]</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Spurious web sites are global and, I believe, difficult to get shut down, at least for any length of time.
</p>
<p>MS really have no authority over internet fraud either.</p>
<p>If you have been defrauded they can be reported to the appropriate federal agency in your country,</p>
<p>but they often shut down before being tracked down.</p>
<p>Similar happens with fraudsters on sites such as e-bay. Hit and run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As always, it's a case of using due care when using the internet, and trusting your AV.</p>
<p>Having said that, AV's do fairly often report false positives. So, again, you have to trust your own instincts,</p>
<p>and prior experience or knowledge if you think the AV is posting a false positive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>eg- About six years ago I was blocked&nbsp; by Avast from a PC gaming site that I had been
</p>
<p>visiting for several years, so I was reasonably confidant that it was safe. </p>
<p>In this case it was taking time for Avast to stop blocking the site after I filed a false positive with them,</p>
<p>so I emailed support at the site suggesting they contact Avast. </p>
<p>Still not sure if it was the chicken or the egg that came first, but Avast stopped blocking within a few days.</p>
<p>- I've also had files from hardware mfg's (DELL monitor) that were flagged as dangerous at one point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>------------------</p>
<p>If you want to do the Win10 upgrade use the Media Creation tool from the genuine MS site -</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">software-download/windows10</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>More details on various options -</p>

<p>
</p><p>Personally - Upgrading can be risky. It's safer to first clone your current Windows to an external HDD.</p>
<p>This is also the most failsafe method of 'rolling back' should you decide Win10 is not what it's cracked up to be.</p>
<p>- There are a number of good open source cloning/imaging software, but I've been using the free version</p>
<p>of<em> AOEMI Partition Manager</em> -</p>

            <p>Yes, I&nbsp; saw that, Mike Hall. Making as advert appear to be an article in some magazine is quite common so&nbsp;that alone wouldn't have put me off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Norton is right, then anyone continuing in ignorance are probably likely to get more than over-priced advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I first though about upgrading to Win10, I saved a lot of stuff but I only listen to advice from places like here, Norton forum, askLeo etc etc.</p>

    <title>Windows Family Safety on Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scott.jung  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Family Safety on Windows 8.1</h2>
                    I think I just recently realized something was wrong.
<div>I was getting reports with no activity, but couldn't be sure there was no activity.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Then my daughter was home during a time limit and asked if she could have more time. &nbsp;My over-ride didn't work. &nbsp;So I went to the website and changed the global setting there. &nbsp;I told her to log out and back in.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I logged in and out, she logged in and out, I logged on to the website and verified my settings.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Finally I figured I would remove the computer and add it back to family safety. &nbsp;Removed - check! &nbsp;Added Back - sorry, the service is unavailable. &nbsp;This has been going on for a bit.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I downloaded the Family Safety Troubleshooter and each time I run it, there is corruption and please restart. &nbsp;The only thing I can think happened was sometime after the 8.0 to 8.1 upgrade!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How do I fix this?</div>
                </div>

            <p>I am having same issue. Tried all solution posted online to no avail. Some details: it worked before 8.1, after upgrading to 8.1, time limit and curfew still work, but both web and PC activities are empty. Tried following: removed all local parent control
 files under appdata. Removed and add back kid account. Removed and added back PC. Disable and enable report. Add PC to trusted PC. Changed kid account type. Nothing helped. Troubleshooting always says fixed corrupted files and ask for reboot, and fixes nothing
 after reboot. The other Kid's account worked fine with another win 8.1 PC, however, that kid account was created after 8.1 update. I am pretty sure that 8.1 update messed up family safety settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>yes, SFC was and is clean, no system file corruption.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer Trung's question:</p>
<p>Login to Microsoft family safety online manage page, you will see a list of kids account, parent account, and managed PC. Under each kid account, you can see something like kid1 on pc1 then a remove button, click it to remove kid1 from pc1. Similarly, you
 can remove PC from monitoring. To add back, go to local account management, select kid account, make sure its type is child then you can click a link of manage this account online to add both kid and PC to family safety management.</p>

</p><p>In my case, time allowance and curfew both work fine, so I should not use familysafetytimelimits.diagcab ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Someone suggested to sync up local settings with online settings, but I did not find a way to do it. I asked my child to login his account, then I login online manage page, tried to flip activity monitor on/off in hope that would trigger resync, but it did
 not help. Still no activity report even when&nbsp;activity monitor for web and PC are set to on and of course with both Web and PC activities. (The online settings are always as expected after login/logout)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The empty report looks like</p>
<p>Web activity</p>
<p>Kid1 didn't visit any websites this week. </p>
<p>PC activity</p>
<p>Kid1 didn't use a PC this week</p>
<p>
</p><p>Notifications:</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">3/5/2014 9:13 AM : TP8 is no longer being managed on the Family Safety website. Activity reporting info<br />
for this PC will no longer be available online</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The notification was sent right after I removed TP8 from monitoring, but I added it back in hope that this would somehow clear up whatever that was corrupted. No dice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't know if this can be related:</p>
<p>The child account used to be administrator until I decided to put it under safety control. I used his account to create mine as admin, then downgrade his account from admin to child. Not sure if this could potentially cause permission issue for safety management.</p>
<p>I image that completely remove his local account and recreate it might help, but I don't want any risk of losing his files and settings&nbsp;during this process. It is also too much hassle that kid needs to go through to be under safety control. Please let me
 know if there is a better way to troubleshoot this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have a nice weekend!</p>

            <p>Hi Gruddy, Thanks for the suggestion. However, the thread did not help and it is not related this reporting issue.(Also like I mentioned already, I&nbsp;even added the PC&nbsp;as trusted PC to Microsoft web management).&nbsp;&nbsp;Please note that this issues is for reporting
 only:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Add child and PC to list - No problem</p>
<p>2. Time limit - No problem, both allowance and curfew are in effect</p>
<p>3. Activity report - Problem! No web or PC activities even though time limit kicks kid out everyday. You would think the program should be smart enough to aware that there is at least PC activities when it reports time is up - Nope, reports that PC is NOT
 used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like I mentioned, I have&nbsp;no problem to add/remove account/PC to management list and&nbsp;activity report works fine for other kid and other PC(win8.1). It is just this kid with this PC (win8.1, updated from win8) has reporting issue after win8.1 update as original
 post suspected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Over the weekend, I tried to&nbsp;remove&nbsp;the PC from monitoring, then change PC name, and then add PC back, still same symptom: No activity &nbsp;(The&nbsp;time limit did not get reset after PC name change&nbsp;either: the usage time was accumulated before and after PC name
 change)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you know where I can check activity report local buffer to see if activity is reported locally at least, then which process/service is responsible to upload the activity to Microsoft, and if Microsoft has corrupted database, how do I trigger it to clean
 up?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you Google a little bit, you will find many anguish parents for not receiving any activity report. Microsoft claimed the issue&nbsp;was solved&nbsp;in&nbsp;win 8.1, it is not(at least for me).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update:</p>
<p><span>Online, it does report something like this under listed device:</span></p>
<p><span>Last activity reported<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>3/17/2014</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>at<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>4:27
 PM</span></p>
<p><span>But check reports under the kid, it is empty. So this does appear that database is corrupted at Microsoft side.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>The tool did not resolve my issue. As it did not work for many other users. It claims found and fixed corrupted file every time. But it did not fix the issue. From online postings, it just tried to delete files under
<span>C:\</span><em>ProgramData</em><span>\Microsoft\Windows\</span><em>Parental Controls
</em></p>
<p>and sync it to online version. I tried to manually delete it too, problem still there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like I mentioned before, time limit works, it just activity report does not work. This troubleshooter appears for time limit issue only.</p>

            <p>I am having a problem with Family Safety too, all of a sudden. The machine had been upgraded to 8.1 when it first came out. I activated family safety after that, and I was getting weekly reports.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, all of a sudden, I get a report that says Notification at the bottom:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>11/7/2014 10:07 PM</span>: <span><span><span>[computername]</span> is no longer being managed on the Family Safety website. Activity reporting info for this PC will no longer be available online.
</span></span></li></ul>
<p>So I look online and, indeed, the data has stopped as of 11-07!</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is going on please?</p>

<p>Yeah, there's prone and it's pathetic.&nbsp; You've got people hidden waist deep in walls and people trying to drop shot you like they're playing COD.<br />
<br />
No tactical layout.&nbsp; It's Battlefield, not COD.&nbsp; No going to run at someone and stab them, killing them with one hit with lightning spped.</p>

<p>No tactical because that would be stupid, considering knifing from the front is a two hit kill. When you prone there is a &nbsp;one second delay until you can shoot; this effectively hinders the person trying to drop-shot..</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Rental servers are fine. People complain about them for no reason. I would consider myself an above average player and I never get kicked by admins. There is minimal/no lag if you play within your region. You run the risk of getting some lag if you go play
 in a region on the opposite side of the planet.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Prone is okay. It is more or less a death sentence. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I would buy it, if you are willing to play the objective.</p>

<p>hey OP, the game is still fin....DICE just twisted up the map rotations on official servers......so finding and playing exactly the way you want without having to worry about player controlled douchebaggary can prove to be a challenge, depending on your
 preferrence ....example: DICE got rid of full map rotations for Rush only and Conquest only...some people expect more for their money, other happily take whatever is given them</p>

<p>Rented servers are good overall... it is a trade off, you get some jerk admins that will kick you for stupid reasons but it adds a lot of variety to servers. You get servers with different maps and gamemodes and ticket counts which is cool and in my opinion
 worth dealing with some stupid admins.</p>

<p>It is random reboot (without BSOD), not the blank os black screen on the link.
<br />
It is true I have seen event log entry with conflicting user profile,<br />

<p>
</p><p>1., my motherboard (asus m5a78l-m/usb3) fell out from Windows 10 supported hardware list,</p>
<p>2., maybe I will be able to use it with installing the new chipset driver pack I have yesterday downloaded for my motherboard,</p>
<p>3., or I have to go back to windows 7, which was stable on my previous machine for years (this machine I bougth with windows 8 installed on autumn of 2016, and upgraded to windows 10 right on the first possibility).</p>

            Yesterday I have installed amd chipset drivers 1730, and it semms to me that error notes in the event list has gone. I have still some warning about one of my HDD-s, but I have repaired with chkdsk /F them, I think it will be OK next startup.

<p>I am very unpleased to say, that reboots have not ended. Just some minutes ago right after startup I got again a reboot, and from the log files I can say, that my son too got a reboot at 2018. ‎02. ‎05. - 14:17:13, and I got again&nbsp; at ‎2018. ‎02. ‎05. -
 14:17:13<br />
I am only a computer user (and pl/sql database programmer), and although I know that there are people capable to debug ntoskrnl errors from dmp files, but I have no plane manufacturing knowledge and even a pilot licence to fly on a boeing 774.<br />
I am frustrated to know that Microsoft's best and newest operation system is so unreliable.<br />
It seems to me, that installing the amd chipset package have not swept away reboots.</p>

<h3> msmythe  say:</h3>
<h2>            LS120 in Windows 10 on An External IDE&#47;USB Adapter</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to retrieve files from a half dozen LS-120 disks from an old computer. &nbsp;I managed to connect the drive to my Windows 10 64-bit system using an external IDE-to-USB adapter (my system doesn't have a spare internal IDE channel available). &nbsp;Windows
 10 recognizes the drive as a USB drive, but the icon is greyed out. &nbsp;When I insert a disk in the LS-120 and double click on the drive icon, I'm prompted to insert a disk, even though there's already one in the drive. &nbsp;I've tried all of the jumper settings
 on the back of the LS-120 and have gotten the same response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any ideas on how I might be able to make this drive work with this configuration? &nbsp;My only other option is to find someone who still uses XP and ask them to install the LS-120. &nbsp;Not likely to find anyone willing to do that, so any help I
 can get would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
The issue might occur due to your driver is old enough for Windows 10. It might be compatibility issue. In order for us to help you, please answer the question:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you tried using different cable to plug-in your harddrive?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We'll look forward to your response.</p>

            The drive attaches to an IDE-to-USB adapter, which connects to the PC using a USB cable attached to the adapter, so there's no way to try connecting using another cable. &nbsp;When I plug it in, Windows recognizes there's a drive connected to a USB port, but
 it doesn't see the media inserted in the drive.

            Do you have Oracle Virtual Box? I'm sure with another version of Windows, it would work.&nbsp; I have many programs that I run through my older virtual PC's.&nbsp; I'm trying to find a drive for the LS-120 disks, as I have 3 from years ago and have no way of seeing
 what's on them.

            In the VB manager click on settings for the XP or whatever earlier system you acquire. Under shared folders you add the drive you want.&nbsp; I had to "google" this to figure out exactly how to do this...I know you need to put the path and name&nbsp; - I have for
 the name F_Drive and the path is F:\ for my external drive that is connected to my desktop. I don't have the updated VB, that may be a bit different.

<p>I've just spent a few moments on the VirtualBox site and looked at the first chapter of the user manual. As I understand it, VirtualBox allows you to run multiple operating systems on the same machine. So in order to do what I want to do, I'd need to install
 VirtualBox, then install a Windows OS old enough to work with the LS120, then access the drive through the old OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, I don't have a copy of Windows XP. I imagine I could find one easily enough, though. I'll give it some thought. Thanks for the suggestion!</p>

<h2>            wifi my home wireless profile not appearing but others appear</h2>
                    I upgraded my HP DV 1123 US from windows 8 pro with Media centre to windows 8.1, since then my home wifi profile name is not shown in the wireless connectivity. I can see my neighbours connections :) and also my android mobile tethered connection ( through which I am able to connect to internet). Gone through many of the forum discussions and  witched of windows defender before  


1. tried wireless on/of, airport mode on/off, restarting  


2. removing IPV6 from adapter, manual setup of wifi profile, fixed ip 


3. deleting all the profiles through netsh 


4. ipconfig winsock  reset  


5. downloading and installing the network adapter driver again from HP website 


6. resetting my adsl modem **** router (DLINK 2750U) with a new name 


7. my widows image in my USD HDD is not being recognized 


no luck. I even tried system restore which gives a file missing and ask me to go for advanced recovery which again fails. I even went back to the original win CD to restore win 8 and it says har

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Are other devices able to connect to your home wireless network?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Are you getting any error message when you are trying to connec to this Wi-Fi profile?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to connect a different device to your home wireless network and check if everything is working fine. Since your computer is able to connect to all other Wi-Fi networks I strongly
 believe that it must be an issue with the router or with this particular network. I suggest you to contact the ISP to reset the wireless router and check if it helps.</span></p>

    <title>Texas Instruments compatible OHCI Driver - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joachim claus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Texas Instruments compatible OHCI Driver</h2>
                    I have a Digidesign (Avid) firewire card installed, which is based on the TI chipset. Consequently W7 install the TI compatible OHCI-driver. having done this, my JVC DV-Tape Deck is recognized when I switch it on, however, neiter Avid Media Composer nor
 MainConcept capturing tool "sees" the device. I have then manually installed a driver which is called "OHCI-conformed 1394-Hostcontroller (old)", and with this driver, the tape deck is properly recognized by both applications.
<br />
<br />
Will such case be considered by Microsoft development team?<br />

<p>Hello Joachim Claus, welcome.<br />
<br />
This situation appears to be aimed more towards the manufacturer of the card itself. If the company is still around when Windows 7 is released, they will most likely push out a Win7 compatible driver.<br />
<br />
Microsoft will provide a very basic ( and I stress the word 'basic' ) driver for pieces of hardware. If the card requires a specific or more 'beefed up' driver to run, for lack of a better term, you would have to wait till the manufacturer releases an update.
 If&nbsp;you got an older generic driver to run the card properly, I would say you are lucky.<br />
<br />
Of course, the development team could try to mimic the older driver in future versions, however, with as many pieces of hardware that are present in today's market, they have to keep changing and updating the generic drivers which causes compatibility problems,
 such as yours.<br />
<br />
This situation is similar in nature with some versions of HP Multifunction printers that use the generic drivers from Microsoft on 64-bit systems. The generic drivers allow you to print but not to scan.<br />
<br />
In short, its up to the manufacturer. Microsoft dev teams will try everything they can to make one driver that works, but there are just too many different pieces of hardware out there to make one 'perfect' non-faulty generic driver.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the run-on, hope this helps,<br />
<br />
Thanks!</p>
