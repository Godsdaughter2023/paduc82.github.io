<p>Hi Matthew,<br />
<br />
I have checked here on my end the issue that you have brought up. The random data strings attached to system services were changed as well after rebooting. It's safe to say that this is working as intended and shadow copies of your services is a security design
 to prevent unauthorized applications/malware from accessing these services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you would like me to provide additional advice, simply respond to this thread. I will get notified and I’ll reply to you as soon as I can.</p>

    <title>How do I create a tile for a PDF &#40;or other&#41; file in Windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tony debates  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I create a tile for a PDF &#40;or other&#41; file in Windows 8.1&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I recently downloaded&nbsp;the owners manual for my camera.&nbsp; It&nbsp;is a PDF file.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way that I -- a slightly better than ignorant Windows 8.1 user -- know how to view&nbsp;this PDF file from the tile view is to&nbsp;use the search function in the upper left hand corner (meaning the magnifying glass icon) to search for the PDF's title, then
 select it, causing it to open.&nbsp; I have to repeat this every time I want to view the PDF.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to create a tile for this PDF on the desktop so that it is always front and center?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or is there a tile for the PDF "library" that I can put on my desktop?&nbsp; (I didn't intentionally save the PDF to a particular location.&nbsp; The computer saved it to "wherever", and I don't really know where that "wherever" is.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Don't forget the "slightly better than ignorant" comment above when explaining how to do this.&nbsp; :) )</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, if your solution applies to creating tiles for other types of files, perhaps you could mention that, too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks as always (to the better than slightly ignorant amongst you to whom I come so often),</p>
<p>Tony</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you downloaded&nbsp;the Manual from the Internet&nbsp;you would have saved it to the default location &gt; Downloads &gt; which you would find under "File Explorer".</p>
<p>
</p><p>File Explorer should be pinned to your TaskBar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not &gt; in search type File Explorer &gt; then on that Window that comes up, click on Downloads &gt; if you see your Manual there &gt; right click on it&nbsp;and run your Mouse Cursor over "Send to" &gt; one option is "Desktop (create shortcut).</p>
<p>
</p><p>You also have the option to Pin to Taskbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers.</p>

            <p>You can just open them using Microsoft Word, it can convert them. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not have Microsoft Works installed on your computer<br />
<br />
If you have a Works document (.wps) that you want to open and you do not have Works installed, you can still use Word to open the file. To do this, first use the Works 6-9 Converter in Word and then open the document directly in Word.
</p>
Step 1: Download the Works 6-9 Converter
<p><br />
<br />
If you have previously installed Works on the same computer on which Word is installed, the Works 6-9 Converter is already installed and you can go on to step 2: "Open the Works document in Word."<br />
<br />
If you have not previously installed Works on your computer, you must download the Works 6-9 Converter in order to open the document in Word. To download the Works 6-9 Converter, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>If it is open, close Microsoft Word.<br />
<br />
In your Web browser, visit the following Microsoft Web site:

</li><li>Click <strong>Download</strong>. The <strong>
File Download</strong> dialog box opens.</li><li>In the <strong>File Download</strong> dialog box, click <strong>
Save file</strong>. </li><li>Double-click the saved file to start the Works 6-9 Converter installer.</li><li>Click <strong>I accept to accept the terms of the License Agreement</strong>, and then follow the instructions to install the Works 6-9 Converter.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong> If you do not accept the terms of the License Agreement, the installation cannot continue.</li><li>Click <strong>Install</strong> to install the file converter on your computer. The Works 6-9 Converter Setup now extracts the Works 6-9 File Converter and installs it on your computer. You can now open the Works file in Word.</li></ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong> If the file does not download or is installed incorrectly, you can go to the "Next Steps" section for more help.</p>
Step 2: Open the Works document in Word
<p><br />
<br />
You can use Word to open a Works document file (.wps), even if the file has not been converted to Word format (.doc) beforehand, by using the Works 6-9 Converter.&nbsp; Follow these steps to open the Works document by using the Works 6-9 Converter:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start Word.</li><li>In Word 2000, Word 2002 or Word 2003, click the <strong>File</strong> menu, and then click
<strong>Open</strong>. In Word 2007 or Word 2010, click <strong>
Microsoft Office Button</strong>, and then click <strong>Open</strong>.</li><li>In the <strong>Open</strong> dialog box, follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>Change the <strong>Look in</strong> box to the location of your Works document.</li><li>In the <strong>Files of type</strong> box, click
<strong>All Files (*.*)</strong>.</li><li>Select the Works document (.wps) that you want to open, and then click
<strong>Open</strong>.</li></ol>
</li><li>If the document opens correctly, click <strong>File</strong>, click
<strong>Save As</strong>, and then change the file type to a Microsoft Word document (.doc).
</li><li>Save the document and you have successfully converted the file to a Word document.</li></ol>

                    The defragger keeps starting up and uses so much resource that it is difficult to run other things. If I stop it through task manager, the resources&nbsp;come back&nbsp;and everything works well for awhile and then it comes back on. I turned off&nbsp;optimize automatically
 but the defragger still comes back on at different times. Rebooting doesn't help.&nbsp; It seems that this started with the lastest update. Any ideas?

<p>Thanks. I did find a way to disable the defragsvc.</p>
<p>1. Run services (services.msc)</p>
<p>2. Highlight "Optimize Drives" and click on properties.</p>
<p>3. There is a drop box that allows you to chose Automatic, Manual, or Disable.&nbsp; I chose Disable and it hasn't come on since. When I want to run it, I'll just enable it and use Norton to run it.&nbsp; By the way, choosing Manual did not work. It still kept coming
 on continuously. I suspect something is broken but not a problem anymore.</p>

                    Is there a way to keep Skype for Business from launching everytime I start up my computer? I want to only launch it when I need to use it.

<p>Hi LoriAnnDL,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To turn off Skype for Business auto-launch, I suggest you try the following steps:<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Sign out of the Skype for Business at first (Click the triangle icon next to the gear icon &gt; Select
<strong>File</strong> &gt; Choose <strong>Sign Out</strong>). </p>
<p>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Go to <strong>Options</strong> page to uncheck <strong>Automatically start the app when I log on to Windows</strong> checkbox in the
<strong>Personal</strong> tab. </p>
<p>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Exit Skype for Business client and restart your PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it doesn’t work, can also try to delete the key: <strong>
lync</strong> from the registry:</p>
<p><strong>HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, please make sure that your Office 365 suite was

            Hello LoriAnnDL
<br />
<br />Open the Skype For Business Desktop app on your Computer. You can do this by clicking on the Skype Shortcut on your Desktop or by clicking on Skype from the list of apps.
<br />
<br />Start Skype App in Windows 10
<br />
<br />2. Sign-in to your Skype Account (in case you are not already signed-in).
<br />
<br />3. Next, click on Tools in the top Menu bar and then click on Options… tab in the drop-down menu and go to Personal
<br />
<br />4. On the Personal screen, uncheck the option for Start Skype when I start Windows and click on Save.

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;Above is what
 you should do as part of normal Computer maintenance.</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
<p><span>Besides using an anti-virus, also scan for Malware/spyware:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></a></span></p>

<p><span>Download the Free Version from the link above.</span></p>
<p><span>Download, install, update and scan once a fortnight..</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to use Malwarebytes after it is installed and Updated:</span></span><span><br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;Open Malwarebytes &gt; Click on the Update Tab&nbsp; across the top&gt; get the latest updates.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;On the <strong><span>Scanner</span></strong> tab, make sure the<strong><span>Perform&nbsp;full scan</span></strong> option is selected and then click on the<strong><span>Scan</span></strong>
 button to start scanning your computer<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;MBAM will now start scanning your computer for malware. This process can take quite a while.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp;When the scan is finished a message box will appear<br />
<br />
5.&nbsp;You should click on the OK button to close the message box and continue with the Malwareremoval process.</span><span><br />
<br />
6</span><span>.&nbsp;You will now be back at the main Scanner screen. At this point you should click on the<strong><span>Show Results</span></strong> button.</span><span><br />
<br />
</span><span>7.&nbsp;A screen displaying all the malware that the program found will be shown<br />
<br />
8.&nbsp;You should now click on the <strong><span>Remove Selected</span></strong> button to remove all the listed malware. MBAM will now delete all of the files and registry keys and add them to the programs quarantine. When removing
 the files, MBAM may require a reboot in order to remove some of them. If it displays a message stating that it needs to reboot, please allow it to do so. Once your computer has rebooted, and you are logged in, please continue with the rest of the steps.<br />
<br />
9.&nbsp;When MBAM has finished removing the malware, it will open the scan log and display it in Notepad. Review the log as desired, and then close the Notepad window.<br />
<br />
10.&nbsp;You can now exit the MBAM program.</span><span><br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Run the Vista System File Checker Tool:</span></span><span><br />

<br />
<br />
</span><span>1. Open a Command Window in Administrator mode:</span></p>
<p><span>* click<strong><span>Start</span></strong><br />
* click <strong><span>All Programs</span></strong>, then<strong><span>Accessories</span></strong><br />
* right click on the <strong><span>Command Prompt </span>
</strong>option,<br />
* on the drop down menu which appears, click on the <strong><span>Run as Administrator</span></strong>option.</span></p>
<p><span>* If you haven’t disabled User Account Control (and you shouldn’t!) you will be asked for authorisation. Click the Continue button if you are the administrator or insert
 the administrator password.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Start the System File Checker</span></p>
<p><span>* In the Command Prompt window, type:<strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong>,<br />
* press Enter.<br />
* You’ll see “the system scan will begin”.</span></p>
<p><span>The scan may take some time and windows will repair/replace any corrupt or missing files. You will be asked to insert your Vista DVD if it’s needed.</span></p>
<p><span>Close the Command Prompt Window when the job is finished.</span></p>
<p><span>One caveat: you need a Windows DVD to enable SFC to make more than minor repairs.</span></p>

If SFC finds serious errors it can not fix, you may have to do a Vista&nbsp;Repair Upgrade Install.<br />

<p>Thanks for the suggestions but main issues are :any windows service&nbsp; such as restore just begets a response that the dependency system or group is unavailable.</p>
<p>f8 has no effect.Can't download anything from internet,spyware etc' and cd will not run the operating system disc.Tried dos E:setup.exe but told not authorised.Same with sfc/scannow and anything else I tried.</p>
<p>Cannot log in as administrator as cmd icon is not there to right click on.</p>
<p>It's weird.I tried Gateway but the site did not recognise my serial number so would not take my query!I will keep trying.</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

    <title>Why do Windows 10 graphics look so bad&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hover cat dave  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why do Windows 10 graphics look so bad&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I just upgraded to Windows 10 (from 7), and the graphics and fonts EVERYWHERE look terrible; I'm on a ThinkPad T61, and the icons and fonts and everything went from nice-looking to pixelated... text is almost unreadable in browsers (see screenshot). My resolution
 stayed at 1440x1050, which looked perfectly fine on Windows 7 (though text was more readable on XP).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why did Microsoft decide to majorly overhaul their interface again? Even the icons are flat and amateurish-looking, the taskbar boxes are all the same color, there's hardly any separators between elements ANYWHERE, everything's just sort of floating around
 everywhere, no raised look or anything,&nbsp;everything's just a big blob.</p>

            <p>I agree that the graphics look much better on Windows 7.&nbsp; But:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fancy graphics require more processing power.</li><li>You don't really&nbsp;appreciate them on small-screen tablet devices</li></ol>
<p>So in order to have a version of Windows that runs on both tablet devices (with small screens and "small" processors) and computers with larger screens Microsoft dumbed-down the graphics.&nbsp; If you read the Feedback there is quite a big demand to bring back
 (as an option) the "aero" look of Windows 7.&nbsp; We'll see if Microsoft listens to its customers this time.&nbsp;

            <p>That is not the case. There is no reason MS could not have included appropriate graphics for each level of device and the code to switch as required. Being that you would only need to install different images for different platforms, it would be very straightforward.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My personal conspiracy theory is that MS don't want users of low powered devices complaining that the screen on their friends PC looks so much better than theirs does on their phone or tablet.</p>

            What's not the case?&nbsp; For whatever reason, Microsoft wants Windows to have a uniform plain&nbsp;bland look across all devices, large and small.&nbsp;&nbsp;That's a complete volte-face from the time of Windows Vista&nbsp;&amp; 7 when they strove for a very&nbsp;sophisticated look.&nbsp;
 If you go to Windows Feedback you will see a lot of people don't like the change.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;

            <p>"<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">So in order to have a version of Windows that runs on both tablet devices (with small screens and "small" processors) and computers with larger screens Microsoft dumbed-down the graphics.
 "</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>They had other choices if that was the reason for the change. They could have implemented different images for different devices so the dumb devices could use simple images and those with more power could use complex images and compositing like Aero Glass
 or a fully 3 dimensional interface for even. Saw some work on this many years ago, but it's gone quiet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think it's also got a lot to do with supporting people with different devices. If they all look the same you don't need to employ smart helpdesk people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be nice if MS could just tell us what the real reasons are and end all the discussion.</p>

            I don't agree with this explanation. I have windows 8 on my personal laptop and despite graphics are made to be the same for tablet devices the win 8 ones look better than the windows 10 that has been installed on my work machine (upgrade from Win 7).
 Both laptops are lenovos and my work machine has a smaller screen. I am slightly astigmatic and am shortsighted, and I really feel horrible about thinking to have to work with a computer with such low graphics because I find it difficult to read things on
 it: I tried to adjust the cleartype settings too many times already and I am getting nowhere. I read so many good reviews on how win 10 is better than 8. Well the graphic part alone puts me off because it will make my daily life a nightmare. Look, I never
 had a problem with graphics with Win 2.3, win 95, win 98, win xp, win vista, win 7, win 8: why the heck do I have to have problems with Windows 10?<br />

            If fancy graphics require more processing power, why does Windows 10 run slower (lower or choppy frame rate) on older computers than Windows 7? If it's less graphics and processing, it should run faster. I also notice Windows 10 uses more RAM than Windows
 7.

            I thought maybe it would grow on me. But to me Windows 10 UI is still ugly and I know its because Microsoft decided it wanted more zing then bling. But some older Linux desktops look way better then Win 10 now. I used to think Mac OS was pretty boring,
 but compared to Win 10 it's looking a lot more appealing. Windows 10 just looks cold, sterile, not appealing at all. Very rigid and blocky sharp corners and faded colors. You have those wonderful and vibrant pictures on lock screen and yet when you get working
 in Windows 10 it's such a let down.&nbsp;

<p>Just more processes running which I think is why Microsoft dumped the visuals and replaced it with more system functions. If you ever used Windows 7 the visuals in Windows 10 are a complete let down.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 8 Xbox Live account has been created automatically as a Child</h2>
                    
<p><span>--
<span>Message</span> <span>translated</span> <span>
<span>Message</span> <span>translated</span> <span>
directly from</span> <span>Spanish</span><span>.</span> <span>
Sorry for</span> <span>the grammatical errors</span><span>. --</span></span></p>
<p><span>Hello , I comment my situation , which is complicated.<br />
<br />
</span><span>I had a Microsoft Hotmail account associated with my Gamertag .
</span><span>I decide to upgrade to Windows 8 and subscribe to Office 365 and for this I create a new Microsoft Outlook account .<br />
<br />
</span><span>The idea was to change my Gamertag Microsoft account to unify everything and dismiss my old Hotmail account .
</span><span>The problem is that when you install Windows 8 and
 to login to the Outlook account , I entered my point games and Xbox Live created a profile in my Outlook account AUTOMATICALLY .
</span><span>Remarked the AUTOMATICALLY because I asked for confirmation or any data .<br />
<br />
</span><span>At this point I could not move my Gamertag to the Outlook account .
</span><span>Since I have many accomplishments , I choose not to complicate my life and do not
 move the profiles to be used as the main Gamertag automatically created .<br />
<br />
</span><span>In making this decision I decide to pay a Gamertag change my Hotmail account so that it
 is free name and can use it in the new account. </span><span>After payment , Gamertag change the old account and try to put that name
 on the new account I agree . </span><span>You are the Gamertags changed and everything works perfectly .
</span><span>At this time I deactivate my Hotmail account .<br />
<br />
</span><span>I decide to log into the console with Microsoft and the new account with the desired name and all right, and
 what is my surprise? </span><span>The system tells me that I have a child account .
</span><span>By creating Xbox
 Live account AUTOMATICALLY no confirmation asked me age or any data , which was presumably would have taken the birth date indicated on the account Microsoft and logically , of age .
</span><span>Well that has not happened .<br />
<br />
</span><span>I
 got in touch with Xbox SAT via chat and phone to try to change this fact and the only answer offered has been that I can not change the date of birth or convert the account to an adult until the system detects that I am old,
</span><span>so I have to create a new account.<br />
<br />
</span><span>Therefore,
 if I want to keep my Gamertag should pay again to change in MAL account from Windows 8 CREATED AUTOMATICALLY WITHOUT CONFIRMATION ORDER to make it free name and to put it in the new account that I created manually from Xbox.com .
</span><span>Note that from Xbox.com ASKED ME IF CONFIRMATION old , so I could enter it correctly .
</span><span>After 30 days of making the console I can login<br />
</span><span>Gamertag account change Microsoft to have the good created in my account and disable Outlook created sub-account
 now .<br />
<br />
</span><span>At this point , I ask the
 Xbox service is to check the age of the Xbox Live account created automatically evil from Windows 8 Adult make note indicating the correct age .
</span><span>Or
 , if this is not possible as I have been given much , I ask that the Xbox service grants me free Gamertag change the wrong account created for Windows 8 so you can put any name and thus freeing
</span><span>and to put it on my Gamertag Xbox Live profile newly created
 manually , in which the first change DECREE still free because everything is as it comes by default.<br />
<br />
</span><span>I understand that I have paid € 9.50 to change my Gamertag from my old account to put it
 to the account created automatically by Windows 8. </span><span>This I have done because I wanted to keep the name and therefore I must pay for it.
</span><span>But now I find that this account was created evil and that is because Windows 8 has not
 asked for confirmation of age to create . </span><span>I therefore feel that
 Microsoft should take this error and I do not have to pay again to release the bad name this account created and use it in the new .
</span><span>The theme of the hassles of changing the account Gamertag Microsoft is another thing,<br />
</span><span>I do not care , these things happen .
</span><span>But think back to pay € 9.50 for the Gamertag change again would be unfair since I
 can not use this account for a Windows error , not mine .<br />
<br />
</span><span>No
 more , excuse the long explanation but I put in a position to meet people because otherwise I may think I am asking for free things for no reason, and in any case I am asking this argument but simply a mistake and I hope you can correct
</span><span>and keep playing both PC , Windows Phone, and Xbox 360 and Xbox One newcomer almost<br />
<br />
</span><span>Thank you.</span></p>

<p>Hello! &nbsp;I'm afraid there is no way to change the age of an account once created- the age will always be determined by the birth date put in during account creation.<br />
<br />
Honestly, if the age is not correct on an account- particularly on a newly created account, your best option will be to create a new one.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I know that. I spoke with support for multiple channels and their response has always been the same . You can not change the age . For this reason I created a new account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is to pay to change the gamertag . When Windows created the account without asking age, I did not know that was childish . For this reason I paid 9.50€ in my old account to change gamertag and then I named this account. Now, I had to create a
 new account because i can't use it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Account was created bad for Windows 8 error , not mine. I did not put the wrong age, Windows did not ask. I request xbox support to leave me one free gamertag change in the child's account (GLooMan16) so I can change the name and put it on the new account
 I created.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did not ask for a gift. But it seems wrong to pay again when it has been a Microsoft error and not mine that was created as a child account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your atention.</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;GLooMan,<br />
<br />
As much as I would like to give you a free name change, that is unfortunately not an option at this point. The account age was set by yourself when the account was created.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hope that clears things up, but let us know if you have anymore questions. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Ok. Just note that when creating the account automatically from windows, I did not put age by myself, windows put it. For this reason I request a free gamertag change, because it was a Microsoft error, not mine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Simply show my disagreement, is seen that Microsoft is not going to take responsibility for their mistake.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take this opportunity to say that does not seem logical need Xbox Live profile to play on Windows 8 and Windows Phone if the platforms are not prepared and you need to use an Xbox 360 to administer it. Xbox Live is the best plataform but need to learn in
 this things.</p>

            Hi Faizel
<br />
<br />Sorry for the inconvenience this is causing.
<br />
<br />I noticed you are on an older version of Windows 10, could you try upgrading to a more recent release?
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-upgrade-to-windows-10-creators-update/617a37da-8fc0-4f33-a3eb-59fe9082f925">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />If that does not help resolve the issue.
<br />
<br />First, try restarting your graphics driver:
<br />Press Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + B
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.” 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />You might need to update the display driver from the manufacturer of your computers website.
<br />
<br />If you have an nVidia, AMD ATI video card or Intel HD graphics installed, you can download the latest drivers from their website. 
<br />
<br />First, determine what type of graphics you have installed. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />
<br />Once you have determined the graphics driver, go the vendors website and search for the driver in the download section:
<br />
<br />Intel - Downloads for Graphics Drivers - Drivers &amp; Software - Intel
<br /><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/...</a>
<br />
<br />nVidia - <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx</a>

<br />AMD ATI - Download Drivers - AMD Support
<br /><a href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/en-us/download</a>
<br />
<br />Some of these sites offer autodetect options. 
<br />
<br />As future Windows 10 feature updates are released it will introduce incompatibility with older devices and PC's. Certain components will not support these changes as observed by some users not seeing transparency anymore or brightness functions missing. Recommendations include, rollback, block the upgrade or consider upgrading components in your system such as graphics, storage, BIOS, motherboard or purchase a new Windows 10 PC. 
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1809 , if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1809 again. See instructions how to block it:

    <title>Dvd Navigator causes DVD drive to occasionally spin fast - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lakatu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dvd Navigator causes DVD drive to occasionally spin fast</h2>
                    
<p>I am having an issue with DVD playback on my new computer using W7 Home Premium. While I am watching a dvd, the drive will suddenly spin extremely fast 8x-16x or so from the 1x normal playback speed. This results in an annoying high pitched noise which is
 very distracting in a home theater.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue occurs when using a player which uses DVD Navigator such as Media Player Classic HomeCinema or Windows Media Center. The issue doesn't occur whenever I use a Cyberlink based player which uses Cyberlink DVD Navigator. If I also use mpeg2 splitter,
 the issue doesn't occur.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem seems to occur with every store bought dvd I have played both single layer and dual layer. Each dvd seems to behave slightly differently. For some it happens only once, others several different times. It also seems to occur at approximately the
 same position for that specific dvd.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So for example, a dvd that is 80 minutes long may have it occur at around 20 minutes and then again at 40 and 60 minutes. If I stop and restart the movie from the beginning it usually happens at about the same place plus or minus a few minutes. Also using
 this example, if I start the video and immediately skip ahead 10 minutes then the dvd will start spinning fast around 20 minutes later or now 30 minutes runtime on the film. Based on this it appears related to buffering. Btw it doesn't happen on my XP or Vista
 computers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have noticed that others are experiencing similar issues. http://thegreenbutton.com/forums/p/95260/497438.aspx I am hesitant to follow the advice given on this website which is to replace the W7 QDVD.DLL with a version found in older Windows such as XP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried replacing the dvd drive and also Windows Update without success. So I know it isn't drive related. Is this a known issue and is there a solution?</p>

<p><span>If any part of the registry path / key doesn’t exist, it will need to be created as it is not created by default.</span></p>
<p><span>Although Vista and 7 are similar, there is always a risk when replacing system files from a different version of Windows.</span></p>

<p>Thanks Praseetha for the help and information.<br />
<br />
Can you tell me are there any major improvements to the Windows 7 version of qdvd.dll that I would lose if I replaced it with the XP version?<br />
<br />
I wonder as an alternative if I might be able to keep the W7 version and make this registry change outlined in&nbsp; http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd388611%28VS.85%29.aspx</p>
<p>Here is an exert from that article discussing caching...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>"DVD_CacheSizeInMB<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note&nbsp; Requires Windows Vista or later.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specifies how much data the DVD Navigator reads in advance, in MB. For this flag, the bEnable parameter of SetOption is interpreted as a DWORD value, rather than a Boolean.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the application sets this flag to a large value (&gt; 50 MB), the DVD drive may spin down after the initial pre-fetch, depending on the hardware.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>You can also set the cache size by creating the following registry key: HKLM\Software\Microsoft\DVDNavigator\CacheSizeInMB. This registry key is intended for diagnostic purposes only. Applications should use the DVD_CacheSizeInMB flag, not the registry
 key</strong> ."</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
<br />
However, I have searched the registry and the folder HKLM\Software\Microsoft\DVDNavigator doesn't exist. Can I create it and if so will the computer recognize it when using DVD Navigator? If I can create this registry key could you please provide detail instructions
 as to how to do so?<br />
<br />
If this workaround won't work and I need to replace the W7 qdvd.dll with an XP version, do you know specifically which folders I need to place the XP version of qdvd.dll?<br />
<br />
Also should I delete the Windows 7 version first and then put the older XP qdvd.dll in those folders or is it better to move the XP qdvd.dll into the folder and have it write over the W7 version?<br />
<br />
More of a curiosity, does a system restore contain copies of dll files? I was under the impression that it was only a backup of the registry.<br />
<br />
Thanks</p>

<p><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time
<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure: <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</a>.&nbsp; Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any
 software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use Windows Update for the updates.<br />
<br />
<span>Go to Device Manager by going to start / search box and type device manager and enter and then double-click on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Check each device
 for a red x, yellow ! or white ?.&nbsp; These identify devices with problems (probably drivers, but also conflicts or something else).&nbsp; Click on each for further details and troubleshooting tips.&nbsp; If you need to get drivers, do so from the computer vendor or device
 manufacturer (NOT from Microsoft Updates).&nbsp; In fact, you should turn off automatic driver updates from Windows Update as follows:
<a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/</a>. Proceed as follows:
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</a>.&nbsp; Once you have the drivers, you can install them through Device Manager as follows:
<a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html</a>.&nbsp;
</span><br />
If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
<a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</a>.&nbsp; To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the
 screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work, and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using <a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</a>&nbsp;along with burning software like:
<a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</a>&nbsp;and, of course, a blank CD.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator.<br />
<br />
Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s)
 using <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</a>.<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive and mostly remove that as a cause.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
<a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</a>&nbsp;along with the upgrade from an earlier version of Windows section of the following:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/918884" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/918884</a>.&nbsp; Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. If the other procedures
 don't work, THIS one is almost certain to work.&nbsp; You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the system cane with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need
 to make a slipstream disk as follows: <a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</a>.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span></p>

    <title>Unable to install Win 10 home on Asus R558UR laptop. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> devesh singhdbz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to install Win 10 home on Asus R558UR laptop.</h2>
                    I bought a new asus R558UR laptop (Free DOS) yesterday. Since I didn't had a Windows so I installed a win7demo version 64-bit. Today i bought a &nbsp;original Windows 10 home copy. But I am unable to install it on this laptop. Everytime I try to install I get
 the BSOD error "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA" and sometimes I get "Memory_Management". Please help. Also there's a catch with this laptop, the driver cd provided by asus with this laptop will only work with
 win10 64-Bit, hence I am even unable to install basic drivers like touchpad or mouse. Please someone help.</span>

<p>Hi Dave,</p>
<p>Thanks for replying. I made a mistake (made the correction) windows 7 Ultimate that I installed earlier was 64-bit. Windows 10 Home that I bought today (it is actually a pen drive sold by Microsoft and a card with the serial key) is both 32 and 64-bit setup
 file ( I select 64-bit for installation).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So to download the driver files from some other system and run them on my new system, I still need USB drivers, as the windows 7 is not detecting any mouse or mousepad or pen drive. Although the keyboard on laptop works, but the mousepad on laptap is not
 working.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 won&#39;t wake up from sleep mode</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 suddenly quit waking up from sleep mode-- the only thing that would do it was pressing the power button for a moment--not too long or it would shut off. This continued for 2 or 3 months then it suddenly started waking up again when I hit space
 bar on the keyboard--which worked for a couple of weeks now it has gone back to the previous condition(requiring me to press power button to wake it).</p>
<p>
</p><p>What the heck is going on and how do I fix it?</p>

            The best advice for computers that won't wake up is to not let them sleep at all, you don't gain a lot by putting them to sleep except for power saving.
