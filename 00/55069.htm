<h2>            Kernel-Power&#58; &#34;The system has rebooted without cleanly shutting down first. This error could be caused if the system stopped responding, crashed, or lost power unexpectedly.&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Original Title:Windows 10 crashing daily on inactivity</p>
<p>I got brand new Alienware laptop with Windows 10 just 5 days back. I never turn off my laptop at nights and a couple of applications keep running so that I can resume work immediately in morning. I have configured all the power options and windows update
 etc to not sleep or reboot. Laptop is plugged to power.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The annoying part is that everyday after few hours of inactivity the laptop crashes and reboots. I checked event viewer and found that the previous system shutdown was unexpected and it was clearly a crash. This has been happening daily since I started to
 use it on daily basis.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From event viewer:</p>
<p>Kernel-Power: "The system has rebooted without cleanly shutting down first. This error could be caused if the system stopped responding, crashed, or lost power unexpectedly."</p>
<p>
</p><p>The laptop has all updated drivers and has up to date windows update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any similar experience anyone facing? Does any workaround exists for it?</p>
<p>

<h3> tomhambleton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error Code 0x80004005 while opening Windows store</h2>
                    <p>On March 9th I submitted the following question:</p>
<p><em><strong>Original title:</strong></em> Error Code 0x80004005 </p>
<p>
</p><p>Unlike the other posts about error code "0x80004005," I&nbsp;completed a <strong>DELL&nbsp;UPDATE</strong> on&nbsp;the PC. Now when I try to get to the Windows Store I get a white screen that says: Check your connection. All fixed? Then a link to "refresh page." Followed
 by "the error code is 0x80004005, in case you need it."&nbsp;On the next line down it says "CV: hNfiAWYemkuK5SvE"&nbsp; Here is a picture of what I see. I do have a connection, and I assume that this may be due to something to do with security? Every time I refresh
 the page, another page comes up exactly the same.&nbsp;I have a feeling I should have never updated, why update something that is not broken?&nbsp;But the little popup reminder keeps coming up, so I eventually got tired of seeing it and updated. And now this has happened.
 Please help. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

<p>_______________________________________________</p>
<p>Then I responded with:</p>
<p>Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry it took me so long to reply to the initial question. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I did <strong>Method 1</strong> and it was&nbsp;unsuccessful. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong> was successful, but now all&nbsp;I can do is look at apps, I cannot download or update anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I&nbsp;am in&nbsp;Windows Store, I am unable to download any apps. This seems like one problem after another. When I click on the button to download, a box comes up asking which account to use. It gives me a choice of two accounts, the first one being my outlook
 account and the second being a generic Microsoft account. I choose my account and there is a flash of the which email to use box and then it disappears and nothing happens. I choose the other account and nothing happens, something is not connecting somewhere.
 I saw on a post below to create a new account, but I do not want to have multiple accounts with different downloads. I tried to set up another account under my family account, but I am having problems getting anything to work.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please Help, so tired of these issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Tom Hambleton</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: </p>
<p>I also tried in account settings to add another account under "Family and other users," but for some reason I am unable to click on the button to add any accounts.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, I try to go to account settings under "Your email and accounts," under heading of "Accounts used by other apps," I try to "Add a Microsoft account." This time the blue thinking wheel comes up and if I let it, will sit in that state until I move the
 mouse, then again nothing happens. So adding an account at these locations does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>AGGHHH.... I need help..... Please anyone help PLEASE...</p>

<p>
</p><p>We also recommend resetting Windows store cache and see if it helps. To do so, kindly follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Windows</strong> + <strong>R</strong> keys to open the Run dialog.
</li><li>Type <strong>WSReset.exe</strong>. </li><li>Click on <strong>OK</strong>. </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows Store and the command prompt will open without any message. The command prompt will automatically close when the Store cache has been reset.
<strong>WSReset.exe</strong> is a troubleshooting tool designed to reset the Windows Store without changing account settings or deleting installed apps.</p>
<p>

</p><p>Keep us posted with the results.</p>

Laptop?</p>
<p>If so most laptops either have a hardware switch on the top of the device or on the side that can be used to turn your wireless hardware on/off. You also might have a function switch combination, ie. &lt;fn&gt;&lt;f2&gt; for example.</p>

                    I see in many places with google search that windows 10 has a problem mirroring to firestick.&nbsp; My older galaxy s5 hooked up and mirrored to device without a hitch in seconds ... I have 2 asus laptops both with windows 10.&nbsp; Both very similar and a little
 over year old running 10 ... When I go to the settings on firestick and select mirror ... It immediately recognizes the computer I'm trying to connect and after few seconds says exiting and the computer says failed to connect ... Has anyone found a reason
 for this ... I've updated drivers in both laptops and neither is working yet ... Any help would be appreciated ... even if there is a thread that has a solution send me to it ... Thanks DMC

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This could be a hardware limitation. According to Amazon's support page, you can mirror your display on most phones or tablets that support Miracast. Some of these devices include:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span style="color: rgba(17, 17, 17, 1)">Android devices running Android OS 4.2 (Jelly Bean) or higher (performance may vary).</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(17, 17, 17, 1)">Kindle Fire HDX 7" (3rd Generation) and Kindle Fire HDX 8.9" (3rd Generation), Fire HDX 8.9 (4th Generation), Fire HD 8 (5th Generation), and Fire HD 10 (5th Generation)</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(17, 17, 17, 1)">Fire phone</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>It's probably the reason why your Android phone connects just fine. You may try the steps in this

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't been able to run any games on Steam lately.</p>
<p>When Steam shows the 'Performing first time setup...' prompt, it fails to install DirectX on all games.</p>
<p>Assetto Corsa Competizione gets a 'The following component(s) are required to run this program: DirectX Runtime' message.</p>
<p>I have CCleaner, but I don't use it until I run the installed games.</p>
<p>I get an 'Error - An internal system error occurred. Please refer to DXError.log and DirectX.log' while trying to install DirectX.</p>
<p><span>I ran 'sfc /scannow' in the command prompt in Admin</span>and restarted then tried reinstalling DirectX again, but no luck yet.</p>
<p>I reset my PC and have done a Fresh Start I couldn't tell you how many times and I still have this problem.</p>
<p>I feel like showing the DXError.log and DirectX.log files would help, but I can't find them anywhere.</p>
<p>Origin and Uplay are running games flawlessly.</p>
<p>Does anybody have a solution to this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            Hi.
<br />
<br />Try installing Directx manually.

<p>Hey.</p>
<p>I've had no luck getting DirectX to install.</p>
<p>I had the error code: S1023 show up when installing the June 2010 version.</p>
<p>I asked Steam for help, but they can't because it's a DirectX issue.</p>
<p>Steam has been able to run games in the past before I reset my PC recently and now DirectX doesn't install.</p>
<p>Perhaps uninstalling CCleaner and reinstalling Steam will help... I'm going to try that now.</p>
<p>Is there any other ways I can resolve the issue?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            What I can recommend is that you completely repair the operating system, but first you must backup your files, although with this method the data is not lost but it is a good idea to backup as a security measure, third-party applications if they are uninstalled, check this link.

            Hi Trillian, thanks for your question. I'm Graeme, a Microsoft Community expert and fellow user.
<br />
<br />The lock screen font size isn't customizable in Windows 10. It's set to that size by design.
<br />
<br />If you'd like to give feedback to Microsoft about this design, you can press Windows Key+F to open Feedback Hub where you can write directly to Microsoft.
<br />
<br />Please let me know if you have any other questions! Thanks!

<h2>            Beep sound while using photoshop - Started since last update</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
Today I woke up and windows 10 installed an update.<br />
<br />
Everything was fine till I started my daily wok on Photoshop CS 6 and now the Alt + Space shortcut (zoom in and out) is giving out this beeping sound, the standart one for Windows.<br />
<br />
I tried changing the sound in the sound panel, but as soon as I go to select the new sound desired for it, it crashes.<br />
<br />
Please help me. I can't test every single possible solution for similar problems on the internet because I have a close deadline for my work. That's why I created this very specific topic.<br />
<br />
Thank you.

            Hello John,<br />
<br />
Thank you for your suggestion.<br />
Unfortunately, it didn't work for me. The default beep continues to play and sound panel continues to crash when I go to change the sound. That said, I hope I can find a solution other than muting the "default beep" anyway.<br />
<br />
I should add that I started another work on Illustrator and the problem happens there too. Not anywhere else I have noticed, tho. Considering that, I had a look at Adobe forums, but it seems that there's no place in the program itself I can change that.<br />
<br />
Glad to follow any other instructions.

<p>Windows 7 is asking to reactivate after changing to a different motherboard on my computer.&nbsp; I tried to activate it by phone and when refered to a real person they said the system was down.&nbsp; I need to get this resolved, but it clearly requires a real person
 and I can't find a number that gets me one.</p>

<p>Is this a full retail version of Windows 7? If so, use phone activation to reactivate:</p>
<p>Activate Windows 7 manually:<br />
1. Click Start, and in the Search box type :&nbsp; slui.exe 4<br />
<br />
2. Press ENTER on your Keyboard<br />
<br />
3. Select your Country.<br />
4. Select the Phone Activation option, and hold on for a real person.</p>
<p>If its an OEM version of Windows 7 or a Upgrade version from which you used a qualifying OEM Vista installation to upgrade to Windows 7, then the license is invalidated because the motherboard the qualifying OS came with is no longer available:</p>
<p>OEM versions of Windows are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:<br />
<br />
- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel<br />
<br />
- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on<br />
<br />
<strong>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</strong>
<br />
<br />
- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</p>

            it says,<br />
"The version of this file is not compatible with the version of windows you are running. Check your computer's system information to see whether you need an x86 (32-bit) or x64 (4-bit) version of the program, and then contact the software publisher."<br />
I've gone to properties and changed the compatibility setting and it doesn't work, no matter which Windows version I try. Is there a program in Windows 7 that will allow me to change what version of Windows I am running on the PC?<br />

            <p>If the program is not compatible, then you may try to install and run the program in compatibility mode.
<br />
Use the following steps:<br />
1)&nbsp;Right click on the Program<br />
2)&nbsp;Click on Properties<br />
3)&nbsp;Click on Compatibility tab <br />
4)&nbsp;Select Run this program in compatibility mode and select Windows Vista or whatever operating system the program was running successfully.</p>

            OP literally said they already tried running it in compatibility mode. Spamming to seem helpful doesn't actually work.

    <title>Sympatico and Windows Live Mail 2011 not working together - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rangerfied72  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sympatico and Windows Live Mail 2011 not working together</h2>
                    <p>When I was at work yesterday I logged on to my account via the web. I had forgotten my password so I had to reset it. When I went home last night and went on my PC, Windows Live Mail wouldn't log into my account. So I updated the password in my settings
 and clicked okay. Once I done that the same window came up and I clicked okay again as my user name and password was already entered. No way would it except it. I even went to the web version and logged in there to make sure I was using the right password.
 When I did, there was no problem getting into the web version of my email.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ended up calling Bell tech support, where the technician took control of my PC. He went through all the different settings and couldn't get it to work. He even had me change my password to a 10 character one as he said with Windows Live Mail it has to
 be maximum 10 characters. Then we went through the &nbsp;whole process again. Still it would not work and accept the password. Both the Bell technician and I deleted my Sympatico account and started fresh by setting it up again. Still no luck with Windows Live
 Mail working. The Bell technician eventually told me that he had done everything within his power to get it to work. He told me that there is nothing wrong with the Sympatico email but has to be a problem with Windows Live Mail and told me to contact Microsoft.
 I told him from what I know Microsoft Tech Support charges. He said he was sorry but there was nothing wrong from their end and it has to do with Windows Live Mail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of this problem just from me changing my password. Something that is recommended anyway. I never had any problem with my Windows Live Mail until now. I don't know what else I am able to do. Is there any suggestions? Is there a problem with sympatico
 emails?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even had an issue on my iPHONE with it not working. Bell Mobility told me there was an issue with Apple phones due to Apple changing some security features and now it doesn't recognize sympatico accounts. Is this something similar with Microsoft? Now I
 don't have access on my phone nor on Windows Live Mail and always have to log in via the Web.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
It looks more like there's a problem with your account, since you're having trouble on two different clients on different platforms. If your account is indeed in the process of being upgraded, then log-in will fail everywhere except through a browser because
 of the temporary two-step procedure. Did the tech you were speaking to mention this?</p>

            <p>Well I have been logging in at the MSN.ca and going through Outlook. However I do know the Bell technician also went through bell.net site as well and it still logged me in on the browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought the password thing was rather incorrect too. Especially when it says 8-16 characters. Why would the program need it to be shorter.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes I got thinking that there must be a problem as well with my account after posting. So I did try downloading Firefox's Thunderbird email client. I went through the steps and no way would it set up my sympatico account either. I tried my bell.net email
 that I have for apply to jobs and that account set up no problem at all in Thunderbird.
</p>
<p>That is when I called Bell back last night and got a different technician. They took over my PC too and tried to fix the problem However they did escalate it higher as they said there doesn't seem to be a problem with the program as my bell.net email works
 fine. But they told me it'd be up to 48 hours before I'd hear from anyone. It's just getting frustrating when you seem to get different answers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They never told me anything about my sympatico account being upgraded. All I thought was all this problem for just forgetting my password. I thought they usually tell people to change their password every so often. I just wouldn't want to go through this
 all the time. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your advice. I do appreciate it. </p>

            <p>Thank you all for your responses. It is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted Bell tonight once again. A lady had called and left a voice mail regarding my email on my cell phone. When I called they still weren't much help. The lady said the ticket was closed as they couldn't find a problem. I told her about the issue
 with Windows Live Mail and she said that maybe it was an issue with my email and to see what the internet department had to say. So they transferred me over to that department. Again a tech went through all the exact same steps as the other two. This one as
 well ended up saying it was Windows Live Mail. I told her I didn't agree completely as it wasn't working on my cell phone either. She recommended to uninstall and reinstall Windows Live Mail too.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I called Bell Mobility back to say that the email still wasn't working on my iPHONE. This technician tried on his demo phone. He got the same results. In a matter of a few moments he had me try to set up the sympatico account on my phone. I expected the
 same problem to happen, but it didn't. The account worked and my email started downloading. I told him that he did something that two of their departments and two escalated tickets didn't resolve. While on the phone with him I was reinstalling Windows Live
 Essentials, which he said I didn't actually need to do. But he said he'd stay on the phone with me while it downloaded. Once it finished all my emails downloaded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>He told me the problem was that when I set up my account online I had a two step verification. This caused a problem when going through to the Microsoft servers. He adjusted that and it fixed the problem. I made sure to pass praise on to his supervisor.
 I know working in a call centre is tough as I've done it and praise isn't always given during escalations. This guy deserved it as he knew exactly what he was doing. If I'd got him the first time I likely wouldn't have had to post the problem on here, nor
 been 3-4 days fighting the issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I really do appreciate everyone's help on here too. I did attempt your suggestions as well. In the future I'll be sure to post again if I don't know of how to do something as you have all posted great responses to my query.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank again. </p>

            <p>Well a new problem actually arose. I went to reply to an email from my phone and it wouldn't send. I tried deleting my account again and reinstalling and nothing. I ended up calling Bell and they couldn't get it figured out. They told me the work around
 was when adding the account set it up through Outlook. This worked and I've not had an issue. However they did give me a reference number and told me someone would be in contact with me as it should still set up as a POP account. So far no call from them and
 it's been about 3 days. </p>

<p>Well in regards to clarifying this, if you read my previous post:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"Well I have been logging in at the<strong> MSN.ca </strong>and going through Outlook. However I do know the Bell technician also went through
<strong>bell.net site</strong> as well and it still logged me in on the browser."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Clearly logging in at <strong>www.msn.ca </strong>and going through Outlook is not the Outlook that comes with Office., nor the app on a phone.
</p>
<p>Plus if you read my post on March 12th you'd also be aware that the problem I was having on the PC with Windows Live Mail (as stated previously) was resolved.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As stated on March 21st the problem was now on my iPHONE when trying to reply to an email that it wasn't sending. It was receiving fine.
</p>
<p>When you go to set up a new account on the iPHONE it gives you a list of email providers. Outlook is one of them and you have the choice of "Other" I use "Other" as it is a sympatico account. This is where you're able to set your incoming and receiving servers.
 This I followed step by step with the Bell tech support. No way would the account work properly. That's when she put me on hold and went to talk to someone else. She came back and told me that the work around was to add a new account on the iPHONE and choose
 "Outlook" this time instead of "Other". She said that the Bell accounts have Microsoft in background. So I went into my settings on the iPHONE and set up a new account. This time I chose "Outlook". I logged in and set it up and now it works. However, she told
 me they'd still escalate the problem as it should work by choosing "Other" and setting the servers.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bell tells me that it's most likely due to new levels of security that Microsoft has put in place and it's having issues with Sympatico accounts.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Never once have I went to the web page on the internet and see that they were upgrading my sympatico account to serve me better as mentioned in an earlier post.
</p>

    <title>Random restore screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christian1029  say:</h3>
<h2>            Random restore screen</h2>
                    I have had my new laptop for less than a week and about two days after i got all of my programs downloaded it began to randomly glitch to screen with two options, 'restart computer' and 'advanced restore options'. Since i had no files on the computer I
 decided to completely factory reset my computer. After doing this I did not re download my programs right away. No restore screen. I got the rest of my programs and still no screen. Then, it randomly did it again. What is happening to my computer. Is it the
 Windows 10 or one of my files or programs? The programs consist of Auto desk Inventor 2018, Steam, and Google Chrome. Please help. I really need this computer to work. Thanks

            Just click on any of the images below the top "rotating" display.&nbsp; There's no file path; you can only access albums via Photos.

<h2>            Mouse Movement starts to lag the whole computer while playing games.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not used my computer for a while and now i noticed that when launching and playing some games, the whole computer lags and only while i move the mouse. This happens not on all games, and only when moving the mouse (i can click all of the mouse buttons
 and move with a keyboard).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to reinstall mouse drivers in device manager, install Steel-series Engine for my mouse, update windows to a newer version, reinstall video card drivers using DDU, use an anti-virus to check for viruses (actually removed a couple), set DPI scaling
 options manually on some games, used selective startup using only Microsoft services via MSCONFIG, removed all auto-startup items and reinstalled some games. Nothing helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Task manager shows no spike in CPU/Ram usage, also alt+tabbing to desktop starts to work fine again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Specs are:</p>
<p>Windows 10 1809 build</p>
<p>Ryzen 7 1700 3GHz CPU</p>
<p>16GB Corsair Vengeance DDR4 Ram (3000 MHz)</p>
<p>MSI GAMING R9 390x 8Gb GPU</p>
<p>Booting from an SSD and All games are installed on a separate SSD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This thing started just recently and checking the Internet, nobody who has the similar or same problem has it fixed or told what fix they used.</p>

<p>So they promise us that we'll see the cards from the 2012 core set in this game. That's 249 cards to work with. Oh wait, they didn't say all the cards from the core set are included. I didn't hear anything about deck building either.</p>
<p>You gotta come with something more exciting than a new game mode which will bore me way too quicky if we have to play it over and over again with the same preconstructed decks.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Meh. It's hard to say for sure, without looking at the rest of the deck lists. &nbsp;But this deck doesn't look very good. &nbsp;It's just a ton of ramp with the hopes of living long enough to get to a bomb. &nbsp;The biggest thing with these types of decks is that it
 doesn't have very many ways to deal with anything. &nbsp;</p>
<p>polymorph is terrible here. &nbsp;"Polymorph my Giant Octopus into a Kraken Hatchling - uck ***$#k!" &nbsp;
</p>
<p>How many times are you going be forced to polymorph one of their creatures because you can't deal with it. &nbsp;I'm assuming there will be creatures that you just MUST deal with in other decks. &nbsp;(cards like: &nbsp;Royal Assassin, Platinum Angel, Vampire Nocturnus
 etc.)</p>
<p>I guess you could bounce with aether mutation and do a lot of chump blocking, &nbsp;But all in all, this probably wont be a "go to" deck. &nbsp;I will be curious to see the unlockables though and how that works. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If there are a few Mystic Snakes in the unlockables, &nbsp;Well then my opinion of this deck will drastically go up instantly :) &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>agreed.</p>
<p>But even that would surprise me. &nbsp;The reasoning that has been stated by both Stainless and WotC is to keep the game balanced for "New" players whom are just learning the game. &nbsp; I agree with them in this regard. &nbsp;As much as I would like to have even a little
 bit of customization, &nbsp;I know that it would give someone like myself a gigantic advantage over most players. &nbsp;So I'm fine with the way things are.</p>

<p>I don't really see what they're updating here, apart from adding new cards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What's gonna happen to all my existing stuff?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Will it build on what was already released like "Pinball FX"?</p>

<p>The statement released by Wizards at PAX was that they wanted a game to reward players for their hardwork from the first game, so I do think we will be able to import all our decks. All MTG is is a card game, so what more could you ask for? 9 new decks to
 unlock (excluding DLC), new game modes and online co-op! Day 1 buy for me!</p>

<p>I doubt they are going to let us import our existing decks. &nbsp;If you look at the screenshots, there appears to be a completely different elf deck called "Guardians of the Wood". &nbsp;It runs Elvish Prominade, Heedless One, and Norwood Ranger. &nbsp;It wouldn't really
 make sense to have 2 of the same decks. </p>
<p>I'm just speculating.</p>

            <p>Come on clever folk - help me out here!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have narrowed the issue down to the Win10 calendar app, running on my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done tests setting up events from all of my connected devices to see what synchronises.....Until a few days ago, everything was synchronising perfectly, but here are my findings:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2flh3.googleusercontent.com%2f-O2jG1CIAleg%2fWL3d5jtWijI%2fAAAAAAAAAC0%2fWd5YJbDfZFY2DNvh5SuaJKWjjvSXK97kQCLcB%2fs1600%2fCapture.PNG" /></p>
<p>It is saying that when I set up an event from the Win10 cal app (on my pc), then it syncs to all devices. Hurray!</p>
<p>If I set up an event and include an invitation to an email address from my Win10 calendar app (as found in the People app) then it ONLY exists in the Win10 calendar app and DOES NOT sync to the main GCal diary, or onwards to my iphone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So - there is a sync issue between Win10 Calendar app and Google Calendar when people are invited to the event.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have powershell removed and reinstalled both Win10 Mail/Cal and People apps.</p>
<p>Help!</p>

            <p>Hi Rey</p>
<p>Thanks, but those seem to have different issues to mine.</p>
<p>I have since discovered that the actual event invitation does sync in GMail, Win10 app and Iphone as it is in the shared SENT box....but not in the Calender of the GCal or Iphone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is preventing Win10 app and GCal from syncing in the case of a guest on an event invite?</p>

            <p>Rey et al - new intel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have reinstalled People and Mail/Cal</p>
<p>I have restarted the three accompanying services - user host, contact data and sync host in services.msc</p>
<p>
</p><p>i made a discovery.</p>
<p>If i invite a person (email address) which is NOT in my contacts, eg *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, then the invite DOES work and DOES show up in Win10 Cal app, GCal and Iphone.</p>
<p>If I invite a known person from my contacts list (in Win10 people app) then it does send the invite to that person BUT it does not sync to the calenders of GCal and Iphone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So - there is an issue in Win10 apps not playing nicely together and properly integrating. It has only started happening in the last few days, so what has changed?</p>

<p>Sadly nothing in that link to help my issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I invite someone who is in my People contacts to an event, then the event shows in my Win10 Cal app but not in my Google Calendar (when I check it on the web).</p>

</p><p>So - the sync between Win10 and GCal apps is not working correctly for me.</p>

<h2>            Why disenfranchise loyal Xbox fans&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have been with Microsoft's Xbox live service for over 10 years. Have 3 Xbox 360 in the house. Have spent thousands of dollars on games and downloaded content. I love my Xbox 360 and I like it better than my PS3 but if I can't unplug the Kinect then Microsoft
 has lost me this cycle. I'm not rushing out to get a PS4 either because I can wait. I would rather have an Xbox One but not until I can disconnect the Kinect. What is going on at Microsoft? I have Nokia 900 that won't upgrade to Windows Phone 8. Windows 8
 on my non touch laptop is a pain to use. I feel like the company that I have supported most has abandoned me. I know I'm not important but I am loyal customer of Microsoft. Hell I'm still rocking a brown first generation Zune.</p>

<p>You must love the Kinect. I see you defending it daily.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Its over the writing is on the wall. DRM, Region lock, 24 hr check ins, No headset, Indie games. the Microsoft 180 goes on and on and on. The Kinect will just be the last brick to fall from Microsofts wall of stupid ideas.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>The Kinect 2.0 is already doomed. Brace yourself because they will remove it sooner or later and then where will the world be with no Kinect Rivals and a more affordable console.</p>

<p>Well you have complete control of the privacy settings in the xbox.&nbsp; YOu can turn the camera and mic off.&nbsp; maybe turn it towards a wall if you don't believe it's off.&nbsp; Also MS has stated there is an activity light when the Kinect is in use.&nbsp;&nbsp; So you'd know
 if it was turned on without your permission.</p>

<p>Geez, people. Can we go ONE DAY without bringing this up? You love it or you don't. Its not going anywhere. ITs an amazing device that has very few (if any, depending on your approach) negatives. Its only making the console better and why people think they
 are ostracized by microsoft because they don't agree with some of their ideas. The only reason Microsoft has had to 180 so many things is that people are afraid of change.
</p>
<p>This is the same agrument that people want to sue McDonalds for making you fat. If you don't like it don't buy it, but just because it doesn't mesh with your own personal ideas, doesn't mean its a bad idea. MILLIONS of Consoles WITH Kinect are already preordered
 MONTHS before release. Its not a bad idea, its people unwilling to accept new things.

<p>You must love the Kinect. I see you defending it daily.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Its over the writing is on the wall. DRM, Region lock, 24 hr check ins, No headset, Indie games. the Microsoft 180 goes on and on and on. The Kinect will just be the last brick to fall from Microsofts wall of stupid ideas.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>The Kinect 2.0 is already doomed. Brace yourself because they will remove it sooner or later and then where will the world be with no Kinect Rivals and a more affordable console.</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>^^ Ignorant post - likely trolling.<br />
<br />
There's no more hardcore DRM or 24 hr. check ins, region free has been confirmed via MS statements, the headset has also been confirmed via an unboxing video, &amp; the Kinect has numerous improvements across the board shown via a Kinect demo video - it's also
 integral to the entire experience &amp; Microsoft has gone on record saying that they will not remove it. It's also been proven that the Xbox One &amp; Kinect would NOT be more affordable if the Kinect were made optional (assuming you still got both) because the developers
 have stated that the Kinect is almost as expensive as the console itself.<br />
<br />
Your entire argument is completely invalid &amp; an attempt to spread lies. Do us all a favor &amp; stop speaking from your

    <title>Choppy and laggy video using LifeCam HD3000 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> trueblue1981  say:</h3>
<h2>            Choppy and laggy video using LifeCam HD3000</h2>
                    Hello all...<br />
<br />
I've recently installed the LifeCam HD3000 on my laptop (after having installation problems). While everything seems fine with the photos, I can't properly record videos.<br />
<br />
If I have the camera at a resolution of 424x240, everything seems fine. But if the resolution is up any higher, the output videos lags completely, and the audio and video become terribly out of sync.. it's 100% unusable at high resolutions.<br />
<br />
Since the install took place, I assume my laptop exceeds, or at least meets, the minimum requirements for the camera/HD video.<br />
<br />
That's using the LifeCam software. I have also tried using software such as PowerDirector 9, but that can only do resolutions upto 720x480.. so it's not quite HD.<br />
<br />
So, if anyone can help me understand why this webcam stutters and lags, over 424x270... I mean, even one resolution OVER that isn't HD, so it shouldn't lag... I would be very grateful.<br />
<br />
Many thanks.<br />

            Have you tried re-installing LifeCam? If there is an option, try to repair the software. Also, if that won't work, you can download Cyberlink YouCam to capture FULL HD videos.
