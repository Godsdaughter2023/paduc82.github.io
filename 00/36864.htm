<p>Hey there Kernen! I understand that you are having trouble playing BF3 on LIVE. Do you get completely disconnected from LIVE when you try to play this game, or are you just unable to connect to the servers? Also, can you confirm that you have the Online
 Pass required by EA to play this game online? It sounds like you might be borrowing this disc from someone. If that is the case, you can buy a Pass from EA or in-game for 800 MSP. Let me know if this helps, thanks!</p>

<p>Firstly, Welcome to Xbox Support Forums. Going back to your question I have found a Battlefield server status
<a href="http://www.ea.com/servers/battlefield3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.ea.com/.../battlefield3</a> and I have also found out why people may get disconnected ... &nbsp;The Most Common Causes are ... Broken UPNP on your router. &nbsp;You should disable it.</p>
<p>- This is post 2009 routers. Some 2009 / 2010 Routers will come under this. Log into your routers backend. Disable UPNP and a default PAT system will kick in. This will make ports forward more stable</p>
<p>Firewall Blocking / etc </p>
<p>- Boot MSconfig in start. Disable ur Firewall and AV if its a windows based one. Disable any other process there that might affect you and reboot.</p>
<p>ECN Packets has been enabled by a Net Speed Tool</p>
<p>To fix this :</p>
<p>1. open a CMD prompt AS ADMINISTRATOR </p>
<p>2. type "netsh" </p>
<p>3. type "int tcp set global ecncapability=disabled" </p>
<p>ECN packets are Refused by EA. These are FAKE packets to fool the connection.</p>
<p>Router Firewall problem </p>
<p>Disable your Routers firewall (To test only)</p>
<p>Or use DMZ this will put the device on the outside of the firewall.</p>
<p>If you are playing on Xbox 360, please enable the following online ports on your connection:</p>
<p>TCP: 53, 88, 3074</p>
<p>UDP: 53, 88, 3074</p>
<p>Try this and see if it works..</p>
<p>Try going to Settings on the dashboard, select System, select your storage device (hard drive or memory unit), select Games And Apps. Once in the Games and Apps folder, check to see if you see any corrupted files saved there. The corrupted files will have
 a yellow circle with an exclamation point inside of it. If there are corrupted files, delete them. Once the corrupt files have been deleted- back up to the storage device (hard drive or memory unit) again. Highlight the storage device. Once it's highlighted
 in green, clear the System Cache. (You'll need to clear the cache twice so after you've done it the first time, just go back and do it once more.)</p>
<p>After the system cache has been cleared, go to Social on the dashboard. Select Sign Out, select Download Profile, enter your Windows Live If and password to redownload and refresh your profile.</p>
<p>Once that's done- power the console off for about a minute. When you power it back on, sign in to your profile and try to load Battlefield 3.</p>
<p>If it loads okay then corrupted files were your problem. Sometimes they can cause frequent disconnections.</p>
<p>Also, if you're connected to Xbox Live and can't connect to EA then you would need to contact EA.

<p>Hopefully the steps above will solve this for you though. Good Luck and keep us updated. &nbsp;:)</p>

<p>Hi there</p>
<p>I am a huge BF3 fan and play it a lot so let me try and help you.</p>
<p>1. Is it a "Lost connection to EA server" error. I get this too and this is due to EA's servers that go offline from time to time. This has been worse of late since the CQ DLC.</p>
<p>2. If its not the above, I suggest that you try connecting via the Server Browser in the multiplayer menu and join a private server instead of anything with "DICE" written on it.</p>
<p>I also suggest that you post on the official BF3 forums as Daniel Matros from the DICE Dev team usually replies to a lot of the server related questions

<h2>            &#34;Change Icon...&#34; yields a Medium-size icon only when I select an ICO file -- why and how do I make it go to Large size&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have valid ICO files (created from PNG files by IrfanView from the Windows Store). If my desktop icon view is set to Large icons (right-click on desktop -&gt; View -&gt; Large icons) and if I right click on a shortcut on my desktop, select Properties -&gt; Shortcut
 tab -&gt; Change Icon... and then select the ICO file as the icon, it selects it fine, but it only appears the size of a Medium Icon and there's a thin (maybe 1-pixel) border around the outside of where the icon border would be if it were a Large icon. I see
 this also happens with some lesser apps with their own native/included icons. My problem occurs regardless of the size of the icon image I have created (or at least making it bigger doesn't seem to help).</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is required of an icon to appear as a full size Windows 10 icon on the desktop, when view is set to Large icons?</p>

            Hi GraniteStateColin,
<br />
<br />Windows 10 icons must be 256 X 256 pixels in size, the best utility to convert an image file like a png ro an ico file is Format factory, you will not get any of those white artifacts around the png file

<div>
<div><em>Hello,</em></div>
<div><em>Good day!</em></div>
<div><em>Thank you for posting here and sorry for the wait. We’re doing everything we can to reply to every customer as quickly as we can. We have received a lot of requests lately that resulted in a delay in our responses. I see that you did not get a code
 in order to setup your laptop. I do apologize for any inconvenience this issue has caused you; let me help you with it. Any answer you will give will be of great help for us in rectifying the issue. I would like to ask some questions for clarification:</em></div>
<div><em>- Did you try checking your other email folders such as spam, deleted items, junk folder etc., for the security code might be sent there?
<span>yes</span></em><br />
<span>yes</span></em><br />
<em>- Did you check the computer clock if its set up correctly? it should be the correct time in your Country (clock and time zone if not set up correctly, error(s) may be encountered)
<span>yes</span></em><br />
<span>yes</span></em><br />
<em>- Please provide the exact message you have encountered when the code was asked from you?
</em><br />
<em><span>I push the Windows button and enter: account</span></em></div>
<div><em><span>I go to Accounts/my account and I see:</span></em></div>
<div><em><span>PWatervoort</span></em></div>
<div><em><span>local account</span></em></div>
<div><em><span>and a text starting with: Sign in with a Microsoft account to synchronize.......</span></em></div>
<div><em><span>I click on the hyperlink(below there is just the possibility to add a picture)</span></em></div>
<div><em><span>I have to enter my PC password</span></em></div>
<div><em><span>and then I have to sign in with my MS-account, so I enter my Hotmail account and password</span></em></div>
<div><em><span>the following text appears: Help us to protect your data, how do you want to receive your code?</span></em></div>
<div><em><span>I can only choose one option: e-mail to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</span></em></div>
<div><em><span>the following text appears: to confirm this is your address, enter the address below and click next to receive the code.</span></em></div>
<div><span><em>So I enter my Hotmail account </em><br />
<em>in the next screen I need to fill in the code which I do not receive</em></span></div>
<div><span><em>I can choose: choose other verification methods, but like I said, I can only select: send to e-mail
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</em></span></div>
<div><em><span>I can also choose: I don't want to do this right now and then the proces is cancelled.</span></em></div>
<div><br />
<em>- Which security proofs (contact email) are you expecting to get the code? <span>
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</span></em><br />
<em>- How many times did you asked for the security code?<span>I didn't count, i tried several times, I also tried setting up a new account, but then when I'm asked to verify the&nbsp;e-mailaddress, it's shows the first e-mailaddress I used and not the
 new one I created.</span></em></div>
<div><em>In the meantime, kindly request another code and this time please do not sign out the account where the code was requested. Instead, press (Ctrl+Shift+P) on your keyboard and this will open an InPrivate window. Using that, sign in to your alternate
 email address to get the code. Then try using the code you have received to the account that was asking for the code.<span>Before I contacted&nbsp;MS,&nbsp;I googled the problem and found this solution, but it didn't work</span>&nbsp;Also, if you have any other
 security proof like mobile number registered on your account, try to have the code sent there, to isolate your issue.<span> I filled in my phonenumber in my MS-account, but if I try to request a code I can only choose to have it send by e-mail.</span></em></div>
<div><em>Please be advised that mobile verification is only available in limited markets at this time.<span>it should be possible with the device I bought</span>&nbsp;It is also possible that the email address that you’ve entered or typed in when you requested
 the reset code is incorrect or not the security info associated to your account.<span>It's not a reset code, it's a code to verify it's my laptop and my account</span>&nbsp;When it comes to requesting for a code, please be informed that if the email address
 that you‘ve typed in did not match the security info on your account, the code will not be sent.
</em><span><em>I 'm sure I entered to correct e-mailaddress, but there is no way to check this, I have to fill in my Hotmail account and it has to&nbsp;match:

<h2>            Pac man CE on Xbox one&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I am having a lot of trouble trying to get the Pac man CE game onto my xbox one Queue. Im hoping someone can help me, because I am so frustrated. :( I never owned the 360, so I dont know if this is part of the problem. I went to the xbox one game store and
 downloaded the demo "to xbox 360" - thats the ONLY choice they give!), and then went to the queue on my xbox one and its not there. I keep trying the same thing but never works. I know Pac Man CE is backwards compatible, so what am I doing wrong? Is it because
 its a demo game? I dont want to pay for the game until I know this works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help will be appreciated. Unfortunately this game is only available digitally, so I cant get a disk.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello AprilFool29, </p>
<p>Game Demos are not backwards compatible. You will not be able to download a 360 demo and play it on your Xbox One. Only paid, full versions of the listed games will be available for purchases and download.
</p>
<p>Hope this clarifies things!</p>

<p>The .mswmm isn't a movie. It's actually just a text file containing the save state of your editing project. Furthermore, the .mswmm file was created in an older version of Movie Maker. Because it is giving you an error, I'm guessing it was created in a version
 prior to WMM 2.x.</p>

 read through various online resources and was able to load it in safe mode. Recovery doesn't work and neither does reset through the recovery options. I'm trying to just get it open, i don't care much about my files because the important ones are backed up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far i have tried to go through safe mode, there's no restore point, reinstall using the windows cd but still fails. However it's interesting that when I'm in safe mode, i can clearly see the files and everything seems to be fine. Is there any way to recover

    <title>Domain Joined Windows 7&#47;8.1 Pro Upgrades to Windows 10&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> goodthings2life&#8482;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Domain Joined Windows 7&#47;8.1 Pro Upgrades to Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>For small businesses with Windows 7 or 8.1 Pro systems that are domain joined, but not volume licensed as Enterprise, will these systems be eligible for the free upgrade to Windows 10 Pro?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, what is the process going to be for these businesses to trigger the install and get their key?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, why on earth not? Seems bonkers to offer free upgrade to everyone not in a business AND Enterprise users as part of Software Assurance but NOT small businesses who are battling cost justifications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've not seen any indications or footnotes that these systems are excluded though, so I'm assuming that it's not an auto-offer to prevent IT departments from freaking out, lol... and also that&nbsp;a tool set will be available for them to perform these deployments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate any guidance that is possible at this time.</p>

            I too am wondering about this. I have many machines connected to a domain, and I would like to upgrade them too. It would really be a pain to take them all out of the domain just to get windows 10, and then have to put them back into the domain.

<p>Incorrect... the GWX app excludes domain joined PC's .....&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will Microsoft provide a way to switch it ON for domain joined PC's or willl we have to remove each computer from the domain to upgrade it first???</p>

</p><p>Yep they the config.xml file there nice and easy to find with a clear option that spells "Change Me ;) " ... but unfortunately the config.xml is digitally signed with the config.cat file and GMX.exe is configured to only validate signatures from Microsoft
 etc etc....&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm pretty confident the only way to get our domain-joined PC's updated to Windows 8 will be to remove them from the domain :(&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Basically all that the gwx app is, is a downloader. The actual update will probably be pushed to the downloaders a week in advance and clients with the app installed and "reserved" will be able to pre-download the update prior to the&nbsp;scheduled release time.
 I believe the object of this was to relieve the&nbsp;expected stress on the update servers. Once the release time comes they will get a message stating that the update is ready for installation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as Domain joined systems are concerned users will still have to have administrative privileges in order to install it. The main reason I would like to allow the download at least is due to the state of our internet connection. I have a 75 mega bit
 connection at the house and only 3 at work which commonly turns in to dialup speeds during the day with almost 1200 tcp connections by lunch time. State of the connection unfortunately is political so nothing I can do about that. My web filter will cache the
 first download at night and the rest of the systems will get the cache. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 146 systems on my network between xp, vista and 7 and would really like to use 10 as a way to get all the systems on the domain on the same operating system. I have been using 10 in the lab and on my workstation for months as well as a test system
 in the office and surprisingly have had no issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I have tried editing the config file myself, unfortunately every time the gwx process runs it refreshes the config file.</p>

            on July 29th Microsoft will release the windows 10 ISO file that you can burn to a disk or use it to make images to domain computers.&nbsp; As long as it is one of the eligible upgrade versions it will work( enterprise versions will require a new license)

            Don't bother. Microsoft use network presence on Windows 7 machines so even if the machine isn't domain joined it still won't get the offer if there is a domain controller on the network.

    <title>Unexplained changes to Windows 10 desktop, app behavior - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brucep312  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unexplained changes to Windows 10 desktop, app behavior</h2>
                    <div>Unexplained changes to my PC:</div>
<div>1. All apps now run full-screen - 'restore down' button in upper right doesn't work to switch app to window</div>
<div>2. Lists in Windows Explorer changed from single-spaced to double-spaced</div>
<div>3. Icon for background screen capture utility (Snagit) now missing from right end of task bar</div>
<div>4. Home screen changes:</div>
<div>&nbsp; a. Icons for items in 'desktop' folder no longer display on desktop</div>
<div>&nbsp; b. Personal folder of often-used apps that I'd set up as added item on start menu now displays full-time on desktop</div>
<div>&nbsp; c. 'Life at a Glance' (MS news feed) and 'Play &amp; Explore' used to be on start menu; now display full-time on desktop</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>==============================================================</div>
<div>*** What caused these changes, and how do I make them go away? ***</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Note: running v1803 of Win 10, so Oct 2018 update not a factor(?)</div>

    <title>Can I upgrade to Windows 10 with a preinstalled windows 7 home. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> charliefarrand  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I upgrade to Windows 10 with a preinstalled windows 7 home.</h2>
                    <p>I have tried several times to install win 10 without success. </p>
<p>It appears to take an age and always stops at 25% with 85% files with failure at "SAFEBOOT RECOVERY etc and then reverts back to old system.</p>
<p>I did try installing once on a clean install but at activation it would not accept the product key but I think I read that that is due to having a preinstalled "multiple licence " copy of windows. I have wasted so much time and am now wondering if I really
 need it! There appears to be so many answers but all appear gobbledegook. Can anyone suggest a solution or what could be causing my problems?</p>

            <p>I did an upgrade to windows 10 from windows 7 home yesterday.&nbsp; Aside from taking 8 hrs to download and install, it worked well.&nbsp; It never asked me for a MS account.&nbsp; It just loaded my local account, not even asking for a password..</p>
<p>I shut off all the one drive and tracking features that I could find, installed pale moon browser..</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does load any faster than windows 7, and takes longer to shut down, but all in all I think that so far it's working.&nbsp; I'll take a few days to play with it before I am completely satisfied with it.&nbsp; If not within 10 days I will do a clean install back
 to windows 7.........</p>

            Signing in using Skype for Windows Desktop works the same when you use a different device. Just enter your Yahoo email address in the sign in box &gt; write your password &gt; Sign in. If the password is correct, it should go through. The reason why you're seeing the "Microsoft account" on the sign in page is because, all Skype accounts are now Microsoft accounts regardless of which domain (email address) you're using.

            If you have credit in this previous account, first make a gift from this account to the new account. This will make sure that your Skype credits are not wasted.

    <title>Windows 10 issues - store, games, start menu - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> iufdrsh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 issues - store, games, start menu</h2>
                    <p>I responded to an existing thread, but seeing as how no useful replies had been in that thread for a while (or since I posted), I thought I'd try starting a new thread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have three computers that have upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10, and while two were relatively pain-free, the third machine has a few issues remaining.&nbsp; That machine has five user accounts on it, one each for my wife and I, and one each for our three
 children.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My account, my wife's account, and our oldest child's account all seem to have come over to Windows 10 relatively cleanly (though I did end up having to create a new profile for my wife because her original one got completely hosed up and couldn't get it
 to work again).&nbsp; But the two younger children (both of whom had Windows 7 Parental Controls enforced) have varying degrees of issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Neither of them can access the Windows Store, Xbox app, Microsoft Solitaire Collection app, or any of the other casual games that I have downloaded onto that machine for them to use.&nbsp; The Store pops up a message saying that the administrator needs to
 repair or reinstall it, while the other two programs named above open and instantly close.&nbsp; They can't even see the other games in their start menus.&nbsp; I've tried using the WSRESET.EXE and a PowerShell command to reset the store, but neither one had any effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) The youngest child also has an issue in that she cannot open the start menu - click on it, and nothing happens.&nbsp; In order for her to sign-out of the machine, we have to &lt;CTRL&gt;&lt;ALT&gt;&lt;DEL&gt; and select "sign out" from that screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;had theorized that my younger children are being messed up somehow by the parental controls from Windows 7 (which can no longer be accessed under Windows 10), but I've seen similar complaints from other people regarding accounts that were not restricted
 by those controls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assistance that can be given would be appreciated.&nbsp; Especially if someone from Microsoft could speak up - I know I'm not the only one with these symptoms.</p>

            <p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Sorry for the delay in response.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for posting your query at Microsoft community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Please follow the steps and check if it helps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Step 1</span></strong><span>: Open an Administrator CMD window.&nbsp; If you can’t find a way, use these steps:
</span></span></span></p>
<ol>
<ul>
<li><span>Press <strong>CTRL + Shift + ESC</strong> to open <strong>Task</strong>
<strong>Manager</strong>. </span></li><li><span>Click File &gt; <strong>Run New Task</strong> </span></li><li><span>Make sure you have a check mark beside “<strong>Create this task with administrative privileges</strong>”
</span></li><li><span>Type <strong>CMD</strong> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></li></ul>
</ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Step 2</span></span></strong><span><span>: Type the following commands in the CMD prompt:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&nbsp; </span><span><span><strong>dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&nbsp; sfc /scannnow</strong> </span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Step 3</span></strong><span>: If EITHER command does not show a good outcome, we need to stop and repair Windows. We have 3 options:
</span></span></span></p>
<ol>
<ol>
<li><strong><span>Go Back</span></strong><span>: If there are other significant issues, Go Back. The plan from there will be to clean up the configuration to prepare for an upgrade.
</span></li><li><strong><span>Reset</span></strong><span>: If possible, remove Antivirus/Secondary Software and perform a Reset (keeping data and settings). You will need to reinstall apps with this option.
</span></li><li><strong><span>In</span></strong><span>-<strong>Place</strong> <strong>Upgrade</strong>: We can try uninstalling the Antivirus/Secondary Software and try an in-place upgrade.
</span></li></ol>
</ol>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 4</span></span></strong><span><span>: If the above commands both completed and show no remaining issues, run these commands:
<br />
powershell</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers |Where-Object {$_.InstallLocation -like "*SystemApps*"} | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Step 5</span></strong><span>: Check to be sure this command ran, showed a blue progress indicator and then returns to the prompt.
</span></span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>If you see a red error, then the command may have been typed or pasted incorrectly, or there may be a larger problem with Windows 10.&nbsp; Try again.
</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Step 6</span></strong><span>: Check to see if the issue is resolved.
</span></span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>If not, restart the PC. In this case try as a new administrator user account.
</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span><span><span>Do let us know if you have any other queries pertaining to Windows in the future. We will be happy to help</span></span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank You</span></p>

            <p>Quick clarification in Step 1 - is the intent that I do this while signed into one of the affected profiles?&nbsp; Or can it be done from any profile?&nbsp; If any profile, it's no big deal to get to the admin command prompt - three of the five accounts have no access
 issues at all.&nbsp; Planning on trying this later tonight, but hoping to hear back a clarification on that one detail.</p>

            <p>Okay - I know I didn't give you much time to respond, but couldn't deal with this before I left for work in the morning and posted that when I had a chance after getting home.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I tried the above steps under both my administrator account (which has none of the issues) and my son's account (which has all of the issues except the start menu not opening).&nbsp; Under both accounts, I had no errors under the DISM scan or the SFC
 scan.&nbsp; The Powershell command ran in both sessions with no issues.&nbsp; Still couldn't open the Store&nbsp;or find the games - restarted the machine both times and no change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So something else will need to be done in order to fix these issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Strangely enough, before I'd even done anything tonight, the start menu on my daughter's account started opening and the Store icon reappeared on my son's taskbar (though not on my daughter's - she has a blank space that identifies itself as the Store when
 you hold the mouse over it).&nbsp; His icon looks a little different than on the accounts that work -&nbsp;the icon is a little smaller, and inside a differently colored box.&nbsp; Don't know if any of that means anything to you, but thought it might be worth mentioning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: So son's account had the Store icon update to match the other accounts (daughter still can't see it, though) and for a while yesterday it would open briefly and immediately close.&nbsp; Today it's back to giving the "repair or reinstall" error.&nbsp; About ready
 to create new accounts for them, move their data to the new accounts and remove the old accounts - but I'm holding out hopes that there's some answer I can try before then.</p>

            <p>Seeing as how almost a week has passed since I stated that the suggested solutions had failed to change anything, we went ahead and created a new profile for my son, moved all his files over to the new profile, and everything seems to be working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, as of this morning, one of the accounts that had been working just fine since the switchover to Windows 10 is now broken - the Edge and Store icons have disappeared from the taskbar (replaced with spaces) and clicking on the Store gives a message
 about needing to be "repaired or reinstalled".&nbsp; The error message is a little different than what we saw on the other broken accounts, but I can't remember the exact wording at the moment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to have to make creating new profiles and moving files into new profiles a regular activity.&nbsp; Any ideas on how to FIX this so it doesn't happen again would be appreciated.</p>

<h2>            This Product Key Can Not Be Used To Activate This Edition of Windows.</h2>
                    <p>I bought a brand new computer that came with Windows 10 already on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16883102075</p>
<p>
</p><p>But upon using the Windows activation key I get "The product key you entered can't be used to activate this edition of Windows. Please try a different key."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Per ABS support apparently Microsoft gave all professional keys to these PCs while it's supposed to be the home edition. They told me I have to wait for a solution they're working out with Microsoft or to contact Microsoft myself. I have to use a trial version
 of 10 and the watermark is really getting on my nerves. :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>But over all, has anyone encountered and/or fixed this yet? X_x</p>

            The last Single Language version of Windows 10 Microsoft released was under version 1703. So, you would have install that version, then upgrade to Windows 10 1803 from that.
<br />
<br />Yes, it will automatically reactivate.
<br />
<br />Step 1: Go to another working computer with Internet access, download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:

<h2>            Windows Installer on Windows 7 access the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE registry</h2>
                    
<p>I am using Windows Installer to modify the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE hive [specifically HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Run entry].&nbsp;</p>
<p>It works fine for Windows XP and below, but with Windows 7 it cannot write the registery value.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have temporarily changed HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE&nbsp; to HKEY_CURRENT_USER, but I would like to get it running properly.</p>
<p>I had the same problem with the program that Windows Installer installs, until I modified the manifest file to give my program access to HKEY_LOCAL_MAHCINE on Windows 7.</p>
<p>Now I need to give Windows Installer the same access to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE on Windows 7.</p>

<p>So long as you don't change consoles, yes. All downloads (with limited exceptions) are tied to both your gamertag and the console it was purchased on. &nbsp;So yes, as long as they are playing on the console that originally purchased the items, it should be fine.</p>
<p>(Avatar items are only available to the account itself, and there may be some map packs with the same issue, but that one I don't know for sure.)</p>
<p>If you later change consoles, you will need to perform a license transfer: <a href="http://www.xbox.com/drm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.xbox.com/drm</a></p>
<p>And, in some cases, if you're logged in as player 2 or something, things will still work. &nbsp;(It's how my girlfriend used to play PaperBoy when I had to change consoles, but before the DRM tool was available.)</p>

</p><p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Disconnect all the external devices (printers, scanner, USB (universal serial bus) drives, etc...) Except mouse and the keyboard and then boot up.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If this corrects the issue then add the devices back one at a time until you discover the piece of hardware causing the issue. Then install the updated driver software for that device.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Method 2: Perform</span></strong><span>&nbsp;<strong>Hardware Clean Boot</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>In the device manager Expand&nbsp;<strong>display adapter</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>right click</strong> on the display adapter and try to disable and try to boot to the desktop.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Note: Devices that can be disabled for doing a Hardware clean boot are:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Display Adapters.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Sound, video and game controllers.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Network Adapters.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>USB Devices and controller (Please don’t disable this if you are using USB keyboard or Mouse or Wireless Keyboard or mouse).</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>DVD/CD-ROM drives.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Modems</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Ports </span></p>
</li></ol>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Method 3: </strong><strong><span>Safe Mode</span></strong></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to boot the computer to Safe Mode and check if the issue occurs or not. In Safe Mode computer starts with minimal set of drivers and files.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer the article to boot to Safe Mode:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/change-startup-settings-in-windows-10#v1h=tab01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/change-startup-settings-in-windows-10#v1h=tab01</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue do not occur in Safe Mode perform a clean boot and check.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 4: Clean boot</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us</span></a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> After clean boot troubleshooting steps, refer to the section "<strong><span>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot</span></strong>" in the provided link to return your computer
 to Normal startup mode.</span></p>

            <p>1. I don't have anything hooked up to my laptop. So method 1 wouldn't help. since nothing is hooked up to the computer, except for the power cord that is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I don't think method 2 will help, because the problem seems to be with WINDOWS 10 Insider Preview, Build 10525. Because twice so far, when after I get the BSD, and the computer restarts, it come back doing some scan, and then it says OS NOT FOUND. And
 if I press and hold the power button, it just comes back and does that scan thing again and again says OS NOT FOUND. But if I do Ctrl+Alt+Del it restarts and so far it will restart just fine. This did not happen until I updated Windows 10 Insider Preview to
 build 10525.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Method 3 didn't help either, I tried this 2 days ago. And while I was in Safe Mode for a while, the BSD happened. So Safe Mode didn't help either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And 4. Method 4 didn't work either, again I tried this 2 or 3 days ago. And so didn't fix anything. So I have tried all these before I even made this post.</p>

<h2>            Lost driver for USB mouse.</h2>
                    <p>Lost use of my mouse a few days ago. Tried all the troubleshooting, tried to get support help, they told me to do all the troubleshooting. Uninstalled driver, reinstalled driver. Tried to do a driver update. It's not the USB port. It's the latest Windows
 update, I think it messed up the driver and now no one can help me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And guess what, Warranty just expired so Microsoft says, "Buy more warranty."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Support told me to come here and ask the community, is that to say that even Microsoft can't help me?</p>
<p>Lots of Microsoft issues and they never resolve any of it.&nbsp;</p>

            Didn't help. Why does Microsoft push updates that ruin people's computers? Microsoft can't even help?

            Microsoft pushes updates. Updates mess up computer systems so that basic functions can't even be used. Microsoft basically shrugs and says, "here you find a fix for the problem we created." Thanks, microsoft, for nothing. Not rushing out to buy any other
 Microsoft products that's for sure, since they fail to support the products currently in use.&nbsp;

<p>Thank you for your feedback. Were you able to perform the methods provided by <strong>
Ramesh.Kumar</strong> on this <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/lost-usb-ports/31280148-008d-49c9-84a4-eb4b8a159516">

</p><p>Important updates provide significant benefits, such as better protection from security or privacy threats. They also improve the reliability of your computer and software. If your software connects to an online service, important updates may be installed,
 if required, to maintain your access to the online service. Recommended updates address non-critical problems and help enhance your computing experience. You might also be offered new optional Office and Microsoft software. New software will not be installed
 automatically.<br />
<br />
However, you can delay Windows 10 updates. Just a piece of reminder that we do not recommend using a computer without the latest updates, because they're often key to keeping your Windows 10 PC running properly. However, there will be times when you may want
 to manually apply new updates, when you want to install them during a particular time, or because you want to wait until you're sure the update will not cause issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to delay Windows 10 updates, may we ask what is the version of your Windows 10? to check, simply type in Cortana "winver" (without the quotes).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>
