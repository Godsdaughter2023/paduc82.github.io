<h2>            How do I upgrade from Word 97 to Word 2000 or whatever Word Program that has the table styles that I want&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I had what I believe was Word 2000 or Word 2003 on my computer. Or possibly Word 97. I am not sure because my ex-husband installed it years ago on my computer.</p>
<p>Recently I had to get a new computer. I have alkl my documents tied up in the previous version of Word I used to use. I am used to the tables and how they looked, etc.</p>
<p>I bought a Word 97 the other day on Ebay, thinking it would be like my previous version of Word, but the tables dont include the kind I used to have. There were 3 styles of tables, 2 of them had the wide gray borders, that looked 3-D -sort of like when you
 just create a table using html with big borders; and one looked like collapsed borders.</p>
<p>I cant afford to just go buying all different versions. I really cant afford to buy it at all. Can you help me please? First of all I want to figure out what version I used to have. It had a blue W on it, on the desktop icon. Secondly, is there a free or
 cheap copy I can get since its so old now?</p>

            <p>To find out the version of Word: Start Word on&nbsp;your old computer. On the Help menu, click About. It will tell you which version it is.</p>
<p>Note that getting an older version from Microsoft isn't possible. You'll have to purchase it privately, which (as you have noticed) is risky.</p>

<p>This is to be expected with these Insider builds. Perhaps if you left more details, as Build 18875 will clean install, it also will upgrade from current release 17763, just not from RTM 18362.&nbsp;</p>

            Go into the regular control panel (WIN X) the picture the control panel. Then go to speech Recognition then go set up microphone and pick the kind of microphone you have. This might help you solve it.

    <title>Visio Linked Data Not Updating in Data Graphic After One Day - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mattjamesst  say:</h3>
<h2>            Visio Linked Data Not Updating in Data Graphic After One Day</h2>
                    <p>Hi.... &nbsp;I've created a Visio organization chart that is linked to an Excel spreadsheet. &nbsp;I then have linked the external data to different shapes in my organization chart and display them using a data graphic (type: value label). &nbsp;I have a unique key field
 in my external data. It is an alphanumeric string made up of a concatenation of the values of a couple excel cells in the row plus the row # so it should be very unique.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything updates smoothly and perfectly upon initial creation. &nbsp;Even after hours of both files being closed and my PC being rebooted, I can make changes to the Excel and everything updates swimmingly in the visio. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a weekend however (I've done this twice, once with the files on my PC and once with the files on a shared drive), I refresh the data. The data refreshes successfully in the External Data window in Visio. &nbsp;However, the data graphic is not updated. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I've included a screen capture below. &nbsp;Sorry I've had to redact some of the detail in the org chart. &nbsp;Anyway,
 it just shows the Monday morning successful refresh of the external data, not carrying over to the data graphic. &nbsp;I don't have any conflicts either. &nbsp;The conflicts window doesn't appear after the refresh. &nbsp;</p>

                    If I delete emails from the Webmail page of my ISP, the emails disappear from Outlook as well, even though 'Mail to keep offline' is set to 'all'. My webmail inbox is now full but if I clear emails from there I lose them completely. This didn't happen
 in Windows Live Mail. I need to be able to refer back to emails so this causing me a real headache.&nbsp;

            You're using IMAP? The 'set to all' setting applies to how much you sync, not that it is stored offline. If you want to keep the mail but delete it from the server, move the mail to a local pst file, either manually, or using Archive (Mailbox Cleanup) to do when you want to or Autoarchive to do it on a regular schedule. See <a href="https://www.slipstick.com/outlook/archive-outlook/using-outlooks-autoarchive-feature/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.slipstick.com/outlook/archive-outlo...</a> if you need instructions to use autoarchive.

                    Hi<br />
I need the drivers for a PC to allow it to transfer data with a Nokia 6300 via a data cable connection. For preference they need to work with both Windows 98 and Win Xp, or only one of them at a pinch.<br />

Does anyone know where on the web I can download this softwear?<br />

            Hi thanks for the help.<br />
<br />
I didn't know about Nokia Suit which I guess it is a comprehensive PC managing system for the phone.<br />
<br />
I'm looking at the information page for Nokia PC suite; this is the basic version of the new Nokia Suite.<br />
<br />
It says it requires at least 300MB free space, which is a lot to set aside on an older computer, and it also requires Win Xp Professional or Home Sp 2 or later. It doesn't say what computing power is optimum. My Xp is service pack 1.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking it would be better if the basic drivers were available as a stand alone package for basic connectivity through a data cable as I feel introducing all the extras may undermine my own PC.<br />
<br />
I've been looking over past discussions on this site about this issue and I've found this:<br />
Problem With Nokia 6300 USB DATA CABLE OPTION Not Functioning<br />
"Hey guys there is a solution with you problem and it works fine for me now. After all the comments &amp; suggestions i read i finally got the best solution for all of you. This can be very simple. Try to install the Nokia PC Suite v7.0.2 in your pc after that
 try to search &amp; find the Nokia USB connectivity cable driver v6.8.2 in the web if u get it. Then uninstall the usb connectivity cable driver v7.0.2 in the CONTROL PANEL ADD/REMOVE after that install the "usb connectivity cable driver v6.8.2 in ur PC then try
 to plug in your Nokia 6300 it will install automatically ur phone. PRESTO your unit can be now Recognized of your PC."<br />
<br />
Will usb connectivity cable driver v6.8.2 work for the 6300 model and can I achieve a adta exchange through a USB data cable with this programme setup alone?<br />
<br />
I've also found this:-<br />
How do I connect Nokia 6300 to the PC?<br />
"You dont even have to download the suite as your fone once connected will show as another harddrive, thus allowing you to drag and drop appropiate music etc to your fone or use free websites such as
www.zedge.com"<br />
<br />
Is this true and if so might it work for my computer on Win Xp Sp1, or even Win98 SE?<br />
<br />
At the moment I'm unable to try anything out as all I have is the phone.

<p>You never specified what data you want to access, but you don't need any drivers to use 6300 as a Windows USB Mass Storage device with any miniUSB/USB cable. If you want to access contacts or messages you would need to utilise software such as PC Suite.</p>

<p>You have three options:</p>

<p>The Nokia Suite requires the most resources and add several feature for Symbian devices. The Nokia PC Suite is fine for many devices up to those released in the beginning of the year 2012, I recommend that for Series 40 phones like your Nokia 6300. The cable
 driver is included in these suites already. However, the suites contain an old version. Therefore, installing the driver after installing the suite gives you the latest version(s). Did that help?</p>

<h2>            malware&#63; or virus&#63; or hacker&#63;</h2>
                    <p>first off to fully explain how all of this happened is for another time, the short version is this,middle of march 2018, due to some odd conversations with a couple of women, I decided to use my brain and check my gmail settings,on my timeline I easily see
 someone?? was in complete control of me email address for god only knows how long?,had pics from Chicago, ohio and other places,so I downloaded the archive, realizing it was my fault because I did not even know of the security stuff, anyway, two days later
 my phone was lit up like a Christmas tree,i rushed to work realizing a lot of info was on my phone. the one and only time I used my personal e mail to trry and verify phoneon my work laptop, I caught 3 viruses on it.ok now the good stuff, I have 5 home pc's2
 laptops,3 destops,. first I will state, I KNOW MOST OF YOU ON HERE ARE MUCH MORE EDUCATED WITH MS DOS SYSTEMS ETC, WINDOWS ETC, But I have been around since the first pcs and have dealt with viruses before, the how I got infected is irrelevant, media transfer
 I feel on 2 the others thru the wireless router my son assured me was secure&nbsp; lol.here is why I am here. I have observed all 5-6 pcs getting taken over, there is charachteristics that don't make sensefirst pc, was kindof successful with command prompt, if
 I had known what I was doing, after that prompts that were available to use on the other pcs, had been modified or removed,, yes I know , remote user making changes,at that time most likely,but after the first pc I noticed many odd things that cannot be explained
 as1 pc has no network card installed, another has no driver etc and not useable,i saw on almost all the rest building software devices showing up in device manager, from what looked to be windows components, like sprint spooleres, I observed 2 pc transmitting
 at 28 mbps, yes possible with hackers etc, I understand, Iduring my research I noticed I had 1-win8.1&nbsp; 1-win 8 1-win7home, the rest win 10 home..i found the windows 10 pcs received a windows update which was a server update and was installed which now makes
 it remoteable. I am sure the server update did not come from Microsoft.long and short,from all I have watched, this seems to have copy cat virus, win log on virus,cyc virus, admin virus, rats, and Stuxnet virus actions,when attempting to install new hard drives
 and reformatting infected ones found the strange shiti used a hirens boot cd with all the extras, no software was able to indentify device string, just the hard drive by itself has the capability to make it look asthough the harddrive , isn't even there, when
 your taring right at it.I KNOW YOU THINK I AM CRAZYBUT IT GETS BETTER, LIKE I SAID THE ONLY THING THAT I COULD GET TO EVEN RUN WAS DARINS BOOT AND NUKE, AND IT DIDNT DO NOTHING TO IT, THERE IS A BUTTLOAD OF HDD UTILIES AND WIPERS, ERASERS ETC,I BOUGHT A HOTSWAP
 IN THE BEGING, BELIEVEING AS LONG AS THE HDD IS SECONDARY, I COULD VIEW CONTENTS ETC,AS ASOON AS THE HARD DRIVE GOT POWER IT SPUN UP AND THE LIGHT STAYED ON SOLID INSTEAD OF BLINKING, CAME OUT OF THAT HOT SWAP AND TOOK OVER MY LAPTOP, BY TAKING EVERY RIGHT
 AWAY, IT TOOK ABOUT 7 MIN FROM START TO FINISHI HAVE WITNESSED IT BURNING A FILE ONTO A REPAIR DISC I HAD,I HAVE SEEN IT LIE TO YOU MANY TIMES, THE REASON I SAY THAT IS I USED SOME OPENBSOURCE SOFTWARE TO HELP LOLK, I INSTALLED &nbsp;&nbsp; TREESIZE &nbsp;&nbsp; AND OUTPOST SECURITY
 SUITE FOR WIN 7, THE TREESIZE SHOWED ME SOMETHING CRAZY AS HELL, FOUND THERE WAS A PARTITION APPROX 15 GB IN SIZE, CANNOT BE SEEN WITH ANY WINDOWS SOFTWARE DOESNT SHOW UP, ALSO WHEN INSPECTING IT CLOSER FOUND IT HAD EVERY WINDOWS LISCENCE FROM I ASSUME 7 AND
 UP, IT SHOWS UP AS NT\USER.DATAUTHENTIC OWNER. ONCE I GOT OUR WIRELESS BACK UNDER A LIL CONTROL, { I HAVENT}, EVERY ASPECT OF CONNECTIONS AND I MEAN EVERY ASPECT OF THINGS I DIDNT EVEN KNOW OF, THEY HAD ENABLEDI SEEMD TO OLD ON BETTER WITH THE ANDROID AND
 CAN TELL PHONES NOT HIS THING,BUT ON A PC, HE RIVALS THE PEOPLE I SAW ON YOUTUBE, AND THE VIRUS?? WHATEVER IT IS, IF YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO LOOK FOR, YOU WILL NEVER SEE IT, ODD THING IS, HAVE NEVER BEEN THREATENED, NEVER ASKED FOR MONEY,THEY HAD ALL THE TIME
 AND CHANCE TO DO THAT, THEY DID THE SAME TO MY PARENTS.THEY ALKSO TOOK MY FACEBOOK ACCOUNT BECAUSE I MADE THE STATEMENT THAT I WAS GOING TO POST THIS EVIDENCE, THEN ALL HELL BROKE LOOSE,THE HARD DRIVES ACT ALIVE!!!!!!!!!!!SCARY AS HELL,MUCH MORE TO THIS STORY,
 BUT HAVE ONLY BEEN ONLINE 2 TIMES YESTERDAY AND RIGHT NOW IN ALOMOST 3 MONTHS, YES HE IS ON THIS PC TOO, AND IF I DO SOMETHING IT DOESNT LIKE, SO FAR HAVE NOT BEEN ABVLE TO SEND A SINGLE EMAIL AT ALL TOO, YES I HAVE I BELIEVE TWO SERVER NAMES, SEVERAL PH NUMBERS.IP

            <p>Execute step 1 first and if problem is not resolved, execute step 2.</p>
<p>
<strong>Step 1</strong> - Please look into C:\Users\User_Name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel (replace user name with your user name) and see if is contains few files / folders. Move those files to some other location (i.e create a backup of those files / folders
 and delete all files / folders from here). Hence, make Excel folder blank.<br />
<br />
Now open the file and see if the problem disappears or not.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Note - to find Excel path, you need to find XLSTART path. Excel folder contains XLSTART folder in itself.<br />
<br />
1. Open Excel<br />
2. ALT+F11<br />
3. If Immediate Window is not visible, type CTRL+G. Same can be also be accessed through View &gt; Immediate Window<br />
4. Type "? application.StartupPath" without quotes and press enter<br />
5. You will have your path below.
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong> -</p>
<p>1. File &gt; Options &gt; Add-ins &gt; Manage - Excel Addins - Go</p>
<p>2. Now, if Analysis Tool Pack is not selected (both - VBA also as in picture), select and OK.<br />
3. If it is selected, deselect it and OK.&nbsp;<br />
3.1. Now, execute step 2 again to load it.</p>

            Hi M_Lupas,<br />
<br />
I understand you could not open an email in Outlook 2016 after a Windows update and got the error message attached. Since you’ve tried many steps, I’d like to confirm if you’ve also tried reinstalling the Outlook client (Office suite) like suggested in the
 error message. If not, please reinstall it referring to <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Download-and-install-or-reinstall-Office-365-Office-2016-or-Office-2013-on-your-PC-or-Mac-4414eaaf-0478-48be-9c42-23adc4716658?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this article</a>. Also, I suggest you start Outlook in safe mode (Just choose Start &gt; Run and type
<strong>Outlook /safe</strong>, and choose OK.) to see if there is any improvement.
<br />
<br />
If the issue persists, I’d like to further investigate the issue with the following details:<br />
1. The detailed version of the Outlook 2016 client. (In FILE&gt; Office Account&gt; Update Options)<br />
2. Are you having issue opening a specific email or all the emails in your Office 365 account? Also, is the email in your own mailbox or in a secondary mailbox like a shared mailbox or a public folder?<br />
3. Could you reproduce the issue if you configure a personal account like a Gmail account or Hotmail account in Outlook?<br />
4. Regarding the registry key you added, did you refer to the steps in the article below?<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3062702" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3062702</a><br />
5. Try the SaRA tool to see if it can help fix the issue. (Remember to select other problems when using the tool.) Below is the download link for your reference:<br />

<p>Hi Stephanie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not possible to customize the default icons or to install new icons in Office 2016. However, you can copy &amp; paste the icons or insert them as an object.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also check the following related thread, read the comments provided my members, check if you can use.

<p><span>Hi Speed,</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div><span>Since when are the favorites missing from Internet Explorer?</span></div>
</li><li>
<div><span>Did you make any changes to the computer before this issue started?</span></div>
</li></ul>
<p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you found the Favorites folder and it contains the items, the folder needs to be pointed back to Internet Explorer. Before moving on,
 it is imperative to mention that you should not edit the Windows registry unless you are comfortable doing so.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Sometimes this problem is caused by two Windows registry entries that have become corrupted. To fix the problem, you have to use Registry
 Editor to delete the corrupted Registry entries. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully.
 For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, follow the steps as in the KB Article:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756/</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Check the following registry entry for favorites and modify it accordingly. Normally it should have only one entry on the right side,
 it sould say Default and data should be "none".</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To check the registry entry, follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on Start.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In
 the Start search box type regedit and press enter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>The
 Registry Editor will open. Find<span>Favorites</span> under the following Registry keys:</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Navigate
 to the following location:</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Current
 Version\Explorer\Shell folders</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Current
 Version\Explorer\User Shell folders</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>HKEY_USERS\.default\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Current
 Version\Explorer\Shell folders</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>HKEY_USERS\.default\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Current
 Version\Explorer\User Shell folders</span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Once
 you find Favorites under the first key right click it and select<span>Modify</span>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Edit String dialog will open. The<span>Value Data</span>fieldshould contain the correct location
 of your Favorites folder. If it does not, enter the right location to restore your missing Favorites folder to Internet Explorer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The location for Vista and Windows 7 is:<span>C:\Users\&lt;Current User&gt;\Roaming\Favorites\</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may also access the link below and follow the steps to reorganize the favorites and check if it helps you fix the issue.</span></p>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>One interpretation of what you have written is that the location of your&nbsp; Shell:Favorites&nbsp; has changed to something other than what you think it should be.&nbsp;&nbsp; Depending on your OS, which you neglected to disclose, you could restore that association either
 via a new UI procedure or via regedit.exe.</div>

    <title>How do I revert to Windows Mobile 6.5 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> arthurchristie  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I revert to Windows Mobile 6.5</h2>
                    <p>When Windows Phones came out I was using Windows Mobile 6.5 and despite the odd crash I was delighted with it. I had a couple of apps, Memory-Map and Tide Plotter which were great when sailing, I could use the Marine Charts on Memory Map as back up to my
 paper or electronic charts and&nbsp;most of the areas I am sailing in have no network coverage so the ability to have the Charts (and Ordnance Survey Maps) on my phone along with all tidal data required was brilliant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, with Windows Phone 8, I have to be within Network coverage for any of the apps to work. I have attempted to find out why Memory-Map and Bellfield Software, both of whom have initially indicated that they will write apps for Windows Phone, are now indicating
 that they will not support Windows Phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The latest conversation I had with Memory-Map sales indicated that they would not support Windows Phone because Microsoft kept rewriting the OS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I loved the ability to have Office Documents on my phone before I retired but now I'm afraid I am very close to abandoning Windows Phone for IOS or Android both of which will give me what I had with Windows Mobile 6.5</p>

            There is no way to replace the windows phone OS with the windows mobile OS. You can probably still find working windows mobile 6.5 devices on eBay, Craigslist and other stores that are scattered on the internet.

            <p>That does help, so which would you advise, Android or iPhone because if Microsoft cannot reassure me that they can work with Memory-Map, Navionics, Jeppesen (C-Map), etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no option but to change to a Phone&nbsp;OS that can.&nbsp;</p>

            From what you've said, Arthur, it's Memory-Map etc. who are refusing to develop for the current Windows Phone.&nbsp; The reason you've stated from them is short-sighted (in my opinion).&nbsp; Yes, the OS is being updated, but Microsoft have made it easy for Developers
 to update their code from one system to the other.&nbsp;

            <p>What they are saying is that they are reluctant to develop for an operating system which necessitates code updates on a regular basis.
</p>
<p>I personally, have no knowledge of the relevant code but have to conclude that if there are so many companies willing to write for Android and iPhone but not for Microsoft,despite having declared an intention prior to making such&nbsp;a policy decision, then,
 something within their working relationship with or treatment by Microsoft, has influenced their decision.
</p>
<p>If this is the case then,&nbsp;in my opinion,&nbsp;it's Microsoft who are displaying signs of Myopia.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Microsoft update their OS roughly every 18 months.&nbsp; Android and Apple also produce major updates on the same kind of schedule.&nbsp; It's not really a valid argument as far as I can see.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lack of companies creating apps for Windows Phone is basically because Windows Phone 7 and 8 are relative newcomers to the market (it took Microsoft a long time before it felt it could produce a mobile phone system after Windows Mobile 6.5).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's down to relative newness and an uncertainty about the number of users (since most people flocked to Apple, and the people who wanted iPhones without the Apple logo flocked to Android).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The market share for Windows Phone is growing steadily, however.&nbsp; We're all hoping that app developers see this and start investing more resources into supporting the product and giving their customers freedom of choice.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As it stands, it's only your dependence on certain applications that's encouraging you to consider other OS providers.&nbsp; That shouldn't be the case.</p>

            <p>Totally agree that it's not a valid argument, which makes me suspect that something else is going on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft, allegedly,&nbsp;threw money at Nokia to support WP exclusively&nbsp;but there are already murmurings that Nokia may diversify into Android because of the lack of Application support for WP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I certainly would have expected Microsoft to have approached companies providing Windows Mobile functionality in the past and moved heaven and earth to maintain their support in WP. This doesn't seem to have happened which gives me no encouragement for the
 future with WP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To me a mobile phone is a means of communication, a smart phone can also&nbsp;get information&nbsp;on-line. If it cannot do anything when outside Network coverage, it's not a phone and it's not very smart and won't even warm your hands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That shouldn't be the case</p>

            <p>Thanks for your time. This is probably another question but relates to my problem which&nbsp;prompted the original question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a possibility that software companies believe that Microsoft will eventually enable cross platform functionality where Windows OS software is also Windows Phone OS compatible. This would explain the reluctance to write for WP7 or WP8 that seems
 to exist and also their reticence when dealing with inquiries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this is going to happen are you aware of the timescale involved and which version I am waiting for</p>

            <p>OK I'll try to explain this again. I purchased a New Lenovo PC, type 90B7, December 2, 2016.</p>
<p>Did you get that? A NEW PC. It has Win 10 as an operating system.</p>
<p>It is NOT a Win 10 UPGRADE.</p>
<p>I did not upgrade this Computer to Win. 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It already had Cyberlink Power DVD Player installed. Some body downloaded that program other than me.</p>
<p>Salesmen said it would play CDs and DVDs. It did not work. The driver is missing or corrupt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lenovo couldn't fix it, Cyberlink couldn't fix it, Best Buy couldn't fix it and Win 10 could not fix it. Win 10 said there is no DVD player that is compatible with their system. Best Buy said to buy a&nbsp;accessory DVD Player for $50.00</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They knew it all the time. Windows 10 technicians spent hours on two different chat lines. They couldn't even fix their own Win 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its the DVD driver that is not compatable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if this PC is under Warranty why don't you fix it?.</p>
<p>This all sounds like a conspiracy to commit a Fraud.</p>

<h2>            x3-02 chat application</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>
<p>I am complaining from the chat application which is installed by default in the cell.</p>
<p>I used it first with many communities and it was working. Once I couldn't see any of them except for the ovi account. And I searched a lot in the options to find a way to get them back but I couldn't find anything.</p>
<p>Can anyone help me in this issue???</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>Welcome to the Nokia discussion boards!&nbsp;</p>

<p><span><span>Have you asked the operator to send through the relevant connection settings for your device? This should just be a simple text which asks you to automatically configure and setup these settings once they have been sent through.</span></span></p>

            Hi i think this might help you to rectify the problem by this method first of all backup and rest your mobile by the key *#7780# or *#7370# (hard reset) and while you restoring the backup file don't backup the settings and select other thing like contacts,notes,file,calender
 if you want but don't restore the settings.Try this one and reply me if it works.

            sorry dude, our problem isn't about wifi but about 2g/3g connectivity. Our mobile (i.e s60v5, for example c5-03, 5233 etc) doesn't connect to internet and says connection is not available.moreover, n8 is a symbian^3 os mobile.

<p>
</p><p>1. Clear the Chrome cache.</p>
<p>From the 3 horizontal bars&gt; Settings&gt; (near the bottom) Show advanced settings&gt; Privacy&gt; Clear browsing data&gt; delete Cached images and files. No need, at this time, to clear history, cookies or anything else.</p>

            &nbsp;If it IS an app, Colin's suggestion should get you around the problem.&nbsp; Another possibility is that you have corrupt update files, so you can try this.&nbsp; Delete the contents of the
<em><strong>C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Downloads</strong></em>&nbsp;folder and then do a Disk Cleanup using the option to clean up system files.

    <title>Can&#39;t activate Lumia handset as SMS not accessible - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thomaschippendale  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t activate Lumia handset as SMS not accessible</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We've a fleet of Lumia 550 handsets to deploy to users. Our users have Active Directory accounts and use a federated ID with AD and Office 365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When setting up the phone, we choose to sign in with our organisational accounts. When we do so, we get the following process:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;- First, we are prompted to 'Help us protect your account'. The only options are to cancel, which cancels the setup. Or 'Set it up now'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;- If 'Set it up now' is chosen, the next page is 'Verify your Identity'. The user must enter their mobile number, and may verify their identity using a Phone Call or Text Message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;- This is where things go wrong! When the user enters their mobile phone number, they are meant to receive a text message to verify their identity. Or receive a phone call to verify their identity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;- Because the Lumia is not yet activated / set up, it is not possible to receive text messages or phone calls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The one workaround we tried is just entering a wrong phone number - one of our own in the IT department, instead of the user's own mobile number. But then, this IT phone number is linked to the user's Microsoft account, which isn't correct. There then isn't
 an easy way for us to reset this remotely and many of our users have trouble with resets at the best of times, so I am very reluctant to set the entire fleet of accounts to have the wrong verification phone number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the intended method for activating a Lumia 550, since phone and text activation messages cannot be received?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thomas</p>
<p>

    <title>Emerging text from a specific location on a slide in PowerPoint - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wilmbren  say:</h3>
<h2>            Emerging text from a specific location on a slide in PowerPoint</h2>
                    This is a difficult topic to search for so I apologize if this is already answered elsewhere.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am trying to get a text box that is not visible already on the slide, to emerge upon clicking.&nbsp;</div>
<div>For example, the slide contains a list of words, I want to be able to click and the definition of that word emerges and fills the screen, and it is obvious that the definition originated from that specific word. And then upon clicking again, the definition
 disappears and the original slide with all of the words resumes. Then sequentially, clicking would cycle through the rest of the words and their underlying definitions.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help with this matter would be greatly appreciated.</div>
                </div>

            <p>You can do this by creating Custom Shows. While there are others (e.g., using Tool Tips in Hyperlinks), this technique simulates a pop up but it's really seamless navigation between 2 slides. Follow these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Create the Launch slide, e.g. your list of words.</li><li>Duplicate that slide. Without moving&nbsp;any of the text that you copied over from Step One, add the text box with the definition in such a way that "it is obvious that the definition originated from that specific word"
</li><li>Hide the new slide (right click on the thumbnail in the navigation pane on the left, choose Hide Slide - you can tell if a slide is hidden because the thumbnail number has a gray line over it) Hiding the slide is very important.</li><li>Create a Custom show from your new slide (so remember the slide number): go to Slide Show &gt; Custom Slide Show &gt; &nbsp;Custom Shows</li><li>In the Custom Show Dialog, Click on New</li><li>Give the Custom Show a name, like "Word" definition</li><li>In the Slides in presentation well at the left, select the new slide that you create in Step 2 (if it's hidden -- which it should be -- the slide number will have parentheses around it).</li><li>After you've selected the slide, hit Add to move it to the Right well</li><li>Click OK &gt; Close</li><li>Return to your original Launch slide (the one in Step One)</li><li>With the Text box that you want to hyperlink <em>from</em> (there are a few ways to do this, this is just one way) selected, go to Insert &gt; Action &gt; Hy
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now when you click on the word on the launch page, the definition will appear to "pop up." When you've finished reading the definition, advance the slide and it will return to the Launch slide.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

            <p>To use ScreenTips (I think it's called ToolTips in older versions), follow these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>On "slide 1" Select the text that you want to define</li><li>Right click, Choose Hyperlink</li><li>In the insert Hyperlink dialog box, click on the ScreenTip button</li><li>Type in the definition&nbsp;in the Screen Tip Dialog, then hit OK (just once)</li><li>Stay in the Hyperlink dialog and from the menu at the left, choose <strong>Place in this document</strong></li><li>From the Slide well choose the <strong>same</strong> slide (in this case "slide 1") as the text that your are defining can be found (you don't want to leave this slide if you accidentally push on the hyperlink).</li><li>Hit OK.</li></ol>
<p>Now when you hover over the hyperlinked word a ScreenTip, the definition will pop up. If you accidentally click on the link you won't go anywhere because of the hyperlink you set in Step 6.</p>
