<h2>            Windows 10 Search is different how do I search my computer&#63;</h2>
                    I have tried to find files on my Windows 10 computer using the search button next to the start button. It seems to always do an internet search. I want to find a file on my computer. If I select "my stuff" it doesn't find the file even though I know it
 is there. Anyone else having search my computer problems?&nbsp; ... or am I using the new search feature incorrectly?

<p>Hi Rakeyay, yes, that is how you open the search feature. However, when I use it I only get results on the web even though I know that the filename I typed is located on my computer. I laboriously went through folders in File Explorer and found the file:
 WINWORD.EXE. When I type that filename in the search field it doesn't find it?????</p>

            Oh yes I understand now! When you start typing something, on the left-hand side of the start menu there's a home icon and under that there's a little cog(settings). When you press that cog you get two on/off switches, turn the second one off as that's
 the one that's making it search online as well.

            This did not work for me and Microsoft just installed Windows&nbsp;10 on this computer last Friday. There IS a gear symbol about five&nbsp;inches UP and to the left of the Windows icon and when you select that I don't see anything about setting up the search for
 my computer only. It opens a window that shows such things as "Hey Cortana" , Lock Screen, Microphone, and other such things, which have nothing to do with only searching for files on my computer.

<h2>            PROBLEM CAUSING WINDOWS TO STOP WORKING</h2>
                    <p>Hello-I am using windows 8.1 and internet explorer as my browser. All works well apart from when I try to use the Betfair site where after a bit a message appears as above additionally telling me windows will close the programme and notify me if a solution
 is available. I contacted Betfair and they just say try using another browser like Google Chrome to access the Betfair site. I wonder whether something to do with the scripts on this page/&nbsp;However when I try and download chrome it does this ok but as soon
 as the google chrome opening page appears once more I get the same message and the page closes!!</p>
<p>I have tried downloading the offline version of chrome but get the same message.Also tried disabling add ons &nbsp;including security software but still the same message appears. Also tried the IE trouble-shooter but no joy with that.</p>
<p>Does anybody have any ideas to solve the problem</p>

            What is the error message before windows closes the application? If you have installed any software recently try uninstalling them as some freeware come bundled with spyware which affects the browser. Happened to me in the past. Do check in your "installed
 programs" list in control panel to make sure of it.

            <p>I have an issue with this same thing. Is there a proper answer to it, somewhere(Santhosh S23 - the above is not an answer to this problem)?</p>
<p>This issue does not have anything to do with the settings - I hope.</p>
<p>It seems, that a standard functionality of IE10 is to display the URL along with the possible title or text attribute found inside the &lt;a&gt;, when the user holds finger or mouse on top of a link for long time. We checked this with the developer tools found
 on IE10 - and the URL only exists on href.</p>
<p>I am looking for a piece of Microsoft specific CSS that would enable me not to render the URL information on those tooltips.
</p>
<p>As this sort of functionality does exist only on Win8 IE10, the solution to disable it should also be found from Microsoft, I believe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below is an example that comes up when I hold my finger over a heading (inside the gray box):</p>

<h2>            Are the new consoles made to last&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi!</p>
<p>OK, so I bought a new Xbox 360. It comes with three games for digital download (Gears of War 2, Fable III, Halo something). Now, I downloaded them, they play great. But I like to think things to the future. My NES has been working perfectly the last 25 years
 and I'm pretty sure it will work fine for another 25 years. Same for my SNES, Sega Genesis, PS1...you get the point. However, I'm pretty sure 25 years from now the HDD on my Xbox 360 won't be working. So, what are my options to make this console last like
 all the others, when Microsoft stops selling HDD replacements for it? what about the games I downloaded? I paid for them, but don't have any physical media to reinstall them if the HDD fails (And I'm sure in 25 years the Microsoft Store won't let me download
 them again). My point is: can the Xbox 360 (and Original Xbox, for that matter) be made to work perfectly for many years like any other console? or it will come a day when all the Xbox will simply not work because their hard drives are broken, with nowhere-to-be-found
 replacements? and what about my games? will my money be lost when Microsoft discontinues the support for the Xbox 360 store? or can they be backed up somehow? (please, do not suggest the cloud, someday its support will also be dropped, it's a matter of *when*,
 not *if*).</p>
<p>Thanks!!</p>

<p>The issue here isn't solely on the side of hardware. &nbsp;You have to remember the Xbox Live service might eventually be ramped down over time, which would mean your ability to download the games could be gone all together, meaning any games you don't have downloaded
 could be gone.<br />
<br />
Back before disc drives systems lasted ages because well the carts aren't easily broken, scratched or damaged. &nbsp;Now in a digital age the support must come from the company. &nbsp;Over time your collection might not work because of changes to live or live requirements
 that the xbox 360 might not be able to support down the line.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, you might not be able to play your digital games, or other games if your harddrive fails without doing some ebay searching or local yard sales.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yep. that's exactly what I had figured. So, basically we are not buying new consoles anymore. We are renting them, until the manufacturing company decides they are no longer making any profit from them, so they pull the plug and render them useless. I think
 I won't buy more consoles :). However, is there any way to replace the hard drive in the xbox (the most fragile part) with something more durable? maybe a usb drive or a solid-state hard disc? (expensive, yes but over time it will go down in price).</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>I wouldn't worry about it. If you hdd fails your purchases are still tied to your gamertag so you can get them again, provided they're still available on the server. M$ stated that they're taking over the online portion because of the fact that when servers
 get shut down games are no longer supported for multiplayer etc (EA). They're committed to being around for a long time so I wouldn't sweat it</p>

            <span>Manage Startup:<br />
<br />
(for XP) Start&gt;Run&gt;msconfig [enter]<br />
<br />
This brings up the System Configuration Utility. Look on the Startup tab and find the probable culprit. Uncheck the box next to its name, Apply and OK out. You don't need to restart immediately, but the next time you do you'll get a dialog saying you've used
 the Utility. Just tick the box that says in effect, "don't bother me about this again".<br />

<p>Hi TraciMorgan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Flashes on your screen when performing a task can be caused generally by a possible failing hardware or it could be something running on the background that we'll need to identify. For us to better understand what troubleshooting to perform, we would like
 to know the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Is the issue happening on any programs or is it happening on specific programs?</li><li>Have you tested if the issue is happening when a <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13951/windows-create-user-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">new user profile is created</a></strong>?</li><li>Is the flashing happening only when downloading or is it also on any tasks you perform?</li><li>Is this happening when using other browsers?</li></ul>
<p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Here is the information to repair the
<strong>Windows Explorer</strong> Jump List.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Open
<b><span style="font-weight: bold">Windows Explorer</span></b> and <b><span style="font-weight: bold">Copy/Paste</span></b> the following path into the&nbsp;<b><span style="font-weight: bold">Address Bar</span></b>&nbsp; and press&nbsp;
<b><span style="font-weight: bold">Enter</span></b>.<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-weight: bold"><span>%AppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Recent\AutomaticDestinations</span></span></b></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Set the View to Details or List in that folder and&nbsp;look for the following&nbsp;file.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-weight: bold"><span>1b4dd67f29cb1962.automaticDestinations-ms</span></span></b></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-weight: bold"><span>Right click</span></span></b><span> that file and select
<b><span style="font-weight: bold">Delete</span></b>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This is the file that stores the Windows Explorer Jump List information and it is probably corrupted.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Start working with Windows Explorer and the Jump List should rebuild itself.</span></span></p>
<p><span>You will need to replace all of the Pinned Icons.</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know the results.</span></p>
<p><span><br />

    <title>Windows 10 update broke my computer&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> roanpatrick  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 update broke my computer&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello. I'm quite unhappy with my entire experience. I have had to contact support multiple times because my computer "wasn't on the list" of computers able to run the latest updates. I find this incredibly ironic, as it has 8gb of ram, lots of disk space,
 &nbsp;and a very nice processor (~2.6ghz). I have had my agents help me as much as they could, and that wasn't the bad part, they did great! For a day... Somehow, even after they went and did the whole thing about delaying updates for 8 months or so, The Windows
 10 update installer app downloaded. It has hogged me for the past week, with me having to abort multiple updates, not wanting to lose my pc again. I am a student, and can not afford a new one, but just recently I gave up and let it update. It quit out halfway
 through, as usual, and went back to the same condition it was at. Nothing works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not like last time, I had to get a Windows 10 system on a usb, and repair my boot loader last time. This time, Windows simply won't do anything. It's currently telling me the only option left is a hard reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have physically tried everything besides a hard reset. I refuse. Why should I lose my personal belongings, when it's out of my control? This is not an issue with anything except Windows. What can be done about this? I am very disappointed in the fact this
 has ruined my computer, I really hope you can do something about this.</p>

<p>One of the possible reasons why your PC fails to boot into normal mode are broken components on the boot configuration data of your system. To isolate your concern, we suggest that you perform the following steps to trigger Safe Mode through the Windows
 Recovery Environment (WinRE) option. To do this, follow the steps below:<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Improper shutdown process<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></li><li>Turn on your computer. When the Windows logo is visible, unplug the power source of your computer. Perform this step three times.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></li><li>On the fourth time that you turn on your computer, just simply wait for the Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE) window to appear.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></li><li>On the Choose an option screen, select Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced options &gt; Startup Settings and click Restart.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></li><li>Once your computer restarts, you will see a list of options. Press the F4 key to start your computer in Safe Mode.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>We also recommend that you perform a system restore after booting in safe mode. This option takes your PC back to an earlier point in time. Restoring won’t affect your personal files, but it will remove apps, drivers, and updates installed after the restore
 point was made. To do this, follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In the Search box, type Control Panel and press Enter.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></li><li>On the upper-right window, under View by, click Category and select Large icons.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></li><li>Search Control Panel for Recovery.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></li><li>Select Recovery &gt; Open System Restore &gt; Next.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></li><li>Choose the restore point related to the problematic app, driver, or update, and then select Next &gt; Finish.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if the solution above works for you.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I have been avoiding updating my PC's to the latest version of windows 10 because it always seems to break some driver, or cause some startup issues on all of my computers, all of which are extremely different. I have a 2 in 1 that looses auto rotate
 every update, a regular laptop that ends up with bugged drivers, and now finally my desktop took the biggest hit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After deciding to do some good PC maintenance, I updated my graphics drivers, my audio drivers and my USB drivers among other things (restarting to apply changes after every installation) I finally decided to take the plunge and run windows update.
 I left the update running while I went off to lunch and everything seemed fine. However, when I got back my PC was still in the middle of a restart. I thought nothing of it at first because sometimes the updates are quite large and require several restarts
 to complete, but after an hour I was curious how far along it had gotten and turned on my monitor to find it had not signal. In addition, it was restarting every 20 seconds or so. Only after an hour of trying to get into the BIOS menu to boot from a backup
 drive, I realized that none of my peripherals were active either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I have a back-lit mechanical keyboard which was lit up, so I had assumed that it was connected and was working up until that point. So in summary, the USB ports had power but couldn't send or receive data. After a simple windows update my computer was
 unable to even post, had some kind of issue with the USB drivers, was incapable of video output, and was restarting every 20 seconds. The latest 2018 windows update turned my $700 desktop workstation into a steaming potato.</p>

</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am an electrical and computer engineering major in college and am a PC enthusiast. I tried every trick I know from trying to access the BIOS, to booting from a backup drive, to draining and replacing the CMOS. I tested the RAM, the power supply, the
 graphics card, and the hard drive. I tried every method I could find to boot into safe mode and every method of windows installation but none of it worked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am deeply disappointed in the multi-billion dollar company that could, in a single update, turn my computer into a glorified desk ornament. I now have to either invest in new tools and adapters in an effort to somehow slvage my hard drive, or pay a repair
 shop an exorbent amount of money because I lack the tools necessary to fix this mess myself.</p>

            I honestly couldn't care less about my own computer. I'm not a selfish person, and the entire reason wasn't to honestly help myself fix my computer. I can get another one somehow, most likely a Mac from now on... I just want Microsoft to try and disable
 updates. I understand there are important security updates, but why do these proceed to break our computers? Just put it in a part of the Windows website for us people who don't want to update, and we are more than willing to have some extra hard drive space
 taken up to ensure security from hacks and ransomware, and these horrid Windows updates. Just let us disable them already. I'm incredibly displeased in this company, and I would like everyone to know that I've given up. I advise you to just move on to Mac,
 which is a shame because Windows is a superior OS in my opinion, but it doesn't have incompetent customer service and forced updates that break your computers. I also encourage people to fight Microsoft. There have already been lawsuits th

            I agree with you. I am an IT professional and I do important work on my computer. I cant afford to be down over an update that was very obviously not thoroughly tested. I would like to choose if and when I will except an update. The safest thing has always
 been to wait until the update is stable before you accept it. Microsoft has taken that away from us. My OS completely crashed and all restore points are not showing when i try to restore. I will love valuable data and time when the smoke finally clears. This
 laptop is less than 6 months old. Very sad.

<p>I'm typing this on my phone, because yesterday my laptop running win10 had been nagging me to update. I delayed it for a couple of hours because I was going out and thought I'd let it do its thing while I was out...Well it sure has done its thing. I've just
 come to open the lid and met with which keyboard I wish..then a circular mental test to try and boot it up.. Nothing. This is a 6 month old HP laptop that was running sweet until today.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi VQQ I called ms. Waited 25 minutes before talking to someone. Went through the usual stuff about which OS did laptop come with from new (new 6 months ago with win10). Had me do a hard reboot, (taking battery out three times when turned on, to try and
 force it to self repair or give safemode option)..didn't work. Having their '2nd tier' techie call me back tomorrow between 9-11am. That is all so far. He even implied that the bios might need to be updated before the win 10 update. .I stopped him right there
 and said ms never mention anything if the sort before updates., so telling me that now is somewhat irrelevant.

<p>Update. I was on the phone to India yesterday for about an hour. Was told 2nd tier techie would call me when I chose two hour window...So I said between 9 and 11am.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Almost midday came and went with no call. I called them and was on hold for 25 minutes until agent #1 answered. I had to phonetically spell my name THREE times before he understood, it isn't difficult! A quick unproductive chat later and he said he was upgrading
 my call to the people who should have but hadn't called me earlier. On hikd another 30 or so minutes to be told by agent #2 that the people who shoukd have called me between 9 and 11 would do so in 30 minutes. Promise..That was 30 minutes ago. Still no call.
 Before hanging up he thanked me for&nbsp; choosing microsoft. Imagine the hollow laugh I let out. He did admit though that the recent update has inundated them with problems which is why they're late returning calls.. Who knew eh?&nbsp;</p>

            The Dell 745 is technically not supported under Windows 7 so there are no drivers listed for it. However I have found the Windows 7 combo cabs available here
<a href="http://en.community.dell.com/techcenter/enterprise-client/w/wiki/2065.dell-driver-cab-files-for-enterprise-client-os-deployment.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://en.community.dell.com/techcenter/enterprise-client/w/wiki/2065.dell-driver-cab-files-for-enterprise-client-os-deployment.aspx</a>&nbsp;about half way down the page has resolved a lack of Windows 7 drivers for both older Dell and for that matter non Dell hardware
 on occasions. Scroll down to about half way down the page. Although the specific OptiPlex model is not listed pointing the driver update wizard to the cab file seems to work.

<h2>            No sleep mode after December update in Windows 10</h2>
                    As per the title I do not have a sleep mode option when I have finished on my computer. This seemed to occur after the latest Windows update early December. I have looked and tried various options that has been mentioned on line but no success. I am not
 very computer literate but will try anything to get my sleep mode back

 or restart options. What do I do now, await your response. Thanks

<p>My main question is this.&nbsp; Why do these 'updates' cause so many problems by changing settings, (picture sizes, fonts, eliminating the sleep mode, etc.) I have friends who have Apple and as I complain about this update problem they cannot stop laughing!&nbsp;
 Windows 10 was supposed to make computers more simple to operate but is a nightmare to a lot of us compared to Windows XP which users were FORCED to switch to the highly celebrated Windows 10 after it wasn't supported anymore and simultaneously deleted windows
 media support for running YouTube music videos and clips and other music streaming sites. (How clever!)</p>
<p>&nbsp; My computer runs just fine until the updates screw up my settings!&nbsp; The November updates has really done a number on my desktop.&nbsp; No sleep mode setting any more and I have tried to restore it to an earlier date with no luck.&nbsp; Even when I restore to last
 months settings when I had the sleep mode option!</p>
<p>The pictures and screen quality now looks stretched and I only have 2 resolutions choices now, 100% and 125% where as before the updates I had 6 choices!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; All I have ever had is Windows, but the #10 has got me thinking!&nbsp; Is there a tutorial for fixing this issues?</p>

<p>Microsoft seems to have made the calculation that what people want is more and more features and "improvements" to their OS.&nbsp; To carry out this plan, they are giving us 2 to 4 new versions of the O/S per year.&nbsp; That seems to me like a CRAZY calculation.&nbsp;
 What people want first and foremost is a stable O/S, that does what they are FAMILIAR with it doing.&nbsp; They don't want to have to deal with repairs and making the O/S work right after every update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To create all these changes constantly, and reset the settings back to what MS decides is default just pisses people off all the time.&nbsp; &nbsp;Are people really more interested in jazzy new innovations that most will probably not use, or are they interested in
 having a reliable computer?&nbsp; It may take a while, but it looks like MS is on the road to losing their user base.</p>

            I couldn't agree more.&nbsp; After I lost the sleep mode after the Nov. update, I spent about an hour on the phone with Microsoft and they finally got the sleep mode back.&nbsp; Then about 2 weeks later, Microsoft had another update and the sleep mode was again
 gone.&nbsp; I called Microsoft back and they said my computer is too old and the drivers are not being updated.&nbsp; Seems the only way I can the sleep mode back is to throw away a perfectly good computer and buy a new one.&nbsp; Guess what Microsoft, can you spell Apple?&nbsp;
 This is ridiculous, and the most ludicrous thing is that you can't even turn off or prevent the updates from taking place in Windows 10.

Sleep Mode on my PC came back! Two days ago I was going to put the computer in Hibernate from the start menu (best alternative since sleep was gone) and the Sleep button was back where it used to be among the other choices. I looked at the Power settings and
 the Sleep setting options were were back. I went to System Restore to create a restore point while Sleep was still there and also looked at previous restore points. All restore points prior to the Creators Update were gone, but more importantly, there was
 a Windows critical update listed from three days ago (12/17/2017) which I suspect contained a fix for the Sleep problems many people have experienced since the Creators Update was installed on their computers.&nbsp;</div>

<p>I have the exact same experience.&nbsp; checked and Windows did an update on the 18th of Dec. and the sleep mode came back.&nbsp; I'm so HAPPY, since I called in to Microsoft previously and they told me there wasn't anything they could do.&nbsp; I had also lost the ability
 to dim my monitor and now that function is also working.</p>
<p>Now if they can ALSO fix the right click to "send to email recipient".&nbsp; This problem also disappeared after the previous update to the last one.&nbsp;

    <title>Photo Gallery Shrink to Fit&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> smythe87  say:</h3>
<h2>            Photo Gallery Shrink to Fit&#63;</h2>
                    When the Photo Gallery fits photos to the screen, does this do saving, compressing to the actual image? I've been researching jpg degradation, and found that when editing and saving jpgs from jpgs, that applies additional compression. Does the "fit-to-screen"
 shrinking produce any compression?

===============================================<br />
If you are referring to Viewing...the answer is no...the photos would <br />
not be affected. As you have read...the loss occurs when the file <br />
is re-saved.<br />
<br />
And yes...the JPG format is a lossy format and every time a file <br />
is re-saved...some loss can occur. However, with the high resolution <br />
images of today...it's doubtful that you would ever see the difference.<br />
<br />
Converting to the TIFF format would eliminate the loss but unless<br />
you have the hard drive space to accommodate very large files it<br />
may not be practical.<br />

Understood that viewing does not affect jpgs, but specifically, regarding the way some photo galleries (including Windows) shrinks an image to fit the screen, that shrinking doesn't do anything to the images, does it?<br />

<div>=================================<br />
"Understood that viewing does not affect jpgs"<br />
<br />
Bingo! And viewing is what we are discussing.<br />
<br />
I am simply a volunteer and am not an expert <br />
on digital image compression. <br />
<br />
It is my understanding that editing a digital <br />
photo in some way...and subsequently re-<br />
saving the file...thus creating a 'New Version' <br />
of the file using the particular compression <br />
algorithm employed in the editing software <br />
is when the loss occurs.<br />
<br />
Maybe the following article would offer some ideas:<br />

<br />
FWIW...in some software...just rotating a photo <br />
can be lossy.<br />

<a href="http://graphicssoft.about.com/cs/digitalimaging/f/rotatequality.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://graphicssoft.about.com/cs/digitalimaging/f/rotatequality.htm</a><br />
<br />
Once again, with the High Resolution&nbsp;cameras <br />
of today...10, 15 megapixels and more...I don't </div>
<div>think you would ever visually see the difference.<br />
<br />
Personally I do all my editing on copies and </div>
<div>back-up the unedited originals on two external </div>
<div>hard drives. It's good insurance. </div>

    <title>Do most of you keep your games in the original game case or use - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Do most of you keep your games in the original game case or use something else &#40;a la do you throw away your cases&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I was just wondering do most of you guys, or girls LOL keep your games cases or do you throw them out? Reason is I have a 200 Case Logic dvd case that I keep my 360, PS3, Wii and Wii-U games in. I throw away all my games cases. Well since I bought the Xbox
 One and PS4 I have the Vaultz Metal Locking Case to keep them in. I have been holding on to my games cases for them 2 consoles but I am very good at keeping my games new and scratch free. I am asking if most people still keep their games in the original case
 or do they use something else?</p>

<p>I try to make room. When I first got my 360 and PS3 I kept the cases but I got tacky and I ran out of room quick. So I went with the 200 dvd case and that even filled up so I was wondering since I got the case for the One and PS4 games should I keep the
 cases? Called GS and BB and they still would take trade in on them games without the case so I will probably toss them out. Trashman run today that is why I was asking :)</p>

<p>I try to make room. When I first got my 360 and PS3 I kept the cases but I got tacky and I ran out of room quick. So I went with the 200 dvd case and that even filled up so I was wondering since I got the case for the One and PS4 games should I keep the
 cases? Called GS and BB and they still would take trade in on them games without the case so I will probably toss them out. Trashman run today that is why I was asking :)</p>
<p>[/quote]Yeah, they'll take the discs and put them in cases with crappy covers lol. I don't like them personally and I wouldn't buy one cause I'm too picky. I'd pay an extra 10 bucks to get the same pre-owned game, but with a cover. I'm that picky. :P<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>P.S Shouldn't the cases be recycled? Gotta keep it green, brah!</p>

<p>i am absolutely a hoarder. every case, every paper sleeve, every piece of paper included with the game is kept as well as i can...i think a couple games even have the receipts still with them. i have two bookcases for ps3 and 360, alphabetical and series
 chronological. i've gone as far as buy games simply because they'll move other games down a shelf to be with the other games in their series...i've stopped buying ps3 games because it'll force me onto a new shelf and make me buy more games to fill it out.
 as it is, i only have room left for maybe 4-5 360 games. i also try to keep franchises platform exclusive, but i have multiple versions on each console for one reason or other.</p>

<p>When I had all my dvd's, blu-rays's and hd-dvd's, I had them on a stand in alphabetical order but the stand only held 160 max if they were all single disc box. That is not including blu-ray and hd-dvd's which are smaller and season dvd's which are bigger.
 Too cheap to buy another stand I just started to sit dvd's on top of it in 3 rows and it almost touched my ceiling downstairs. So I sold like 200 of them. I still have them in the cases the ones I kept but just enough to fill the case up. Have not bought a
 physical copy of a movie in yrs. My games were on the bottom rack of my floating tv stand in alphabetical order. After the bottom stand got full I bought the dvd case and never looked back. I do not like the clutter and it just took up a lot of space. The
 dvd case was cool cause it had the front sleeve big enough to put the manual in it which why I liked it. The Vualtz case is not like that, just a cd case to hold disc. Its cool thought cause out of all the games I bought only 2K and Injustice came with manuals.
 Have not opened Skylanders yet.</p>

            <p>The difference between the two versions arises from specific business orientated features, primarily network related. Home editions cannot join a Domain, a centralized security and administration function mostly used in medium and large businesses. In addition
 Home versions do not allow inbound Remote Desktop Protocol connections.</p>

</p><p>However unlike free/low cost 3rd party software licenses the Windows EULA does not place any specific restrictions on commercial use nor does preclude business ownership. There are specific channels open to not for profit bodies to obtain licenses but they

            <p>Hi Reza,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would recommend not upgrading from any third party resource that provides any media creation utility. These resources might have corrupted iso files that may lead to further problems in the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can upgrade your current PC to the <strong>"official"</strong> Windows 10 versionby going to the Windows 10 Software Download page to download the Media Creation Tool. The Media Creation Tool can be used to create a USB or DVD media to upgrade
 your current PC to Windows 10 or install Windows 10 on a different PC.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the instructions on Windows 10 Software Download page: </span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10</span></span></a><span>
</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Note:</strong></span></p>
<span>When upgrading to Windows 10 using media, you must run setup.exe from within your Genuine and Qualified version of Windows 7 or Windows 8. If you want to boot from media, you must have upgraded to Windows 10 previously. Boot from Windows 10 media directly
 without upgrading to Windows 10 previously is not supported and will have activation issues.&nbsp;</span>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Do let us know if you need any further assistance, we'll be glad to assist you.</p>

    <title>Glitch-like sound through Xbox One Controller on Windows 10 &#40;Via - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davidfmm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Glitch-like sound through Xbox One Controller on Windows 10 &#40;Via wireless adapter&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm currently using <em>Xbox One Wireless Adapter+Xbox One Wireless Controller</em> combo on my Windows 10 PC. This Controller has a 3.5mm jack for headphones.<br />
The <strong>problem</strong> is that everytime I connect&nbsp;headphones to the turned on controller, and when&nbsp;I turn on/off the controller with the headphones attached to it
<u>I hear a brief glitch-like sound</u> only from the right channel, that sounds like static from an&nbsp;old tv. This is mildly annoying but what really
<strong>concerns me</strong> is that this sound could damage my headphones over time.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I replicated this issue everytime I plugged any <u>headphones</u> in the controller (from different brands) and is not replicated when connecting them directly to the PC.<br />
I tried connecting the wireless <u>adapter</u> to different USB ports on my PC, removing all devices that could produce interference and place the controller right in front of the wireless adapter and the issue persist.<br />
I <u>updated</u> the controller using the Xbox Accessories app for Windows 10 before attempting to use the headphones jack.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'd really appreciate if someone could provide help or feedback about this issue.<br />
Thank you,</p><p>David.</p>
<p><br />

<p>Hi 000girl,</p>
<p>I take it that you are Australian? For the English language you have two option, United States or United Kingdom. Which you choose will depend upon the layout of your keyboard. Take a look at your keyboard. Is the @ and ' key situated on the ASDFGHJKL:@~
 line of keys? If so choose United Kingdom. If the @ key is situated on the 'number' keys choose United States.</p>
