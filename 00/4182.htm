    <title>Hotmail Account Retrieval - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> abcedfg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hotmail Account Retrieval</h2>
                    <p>I lost my @hotmail account around 12 years ago and never really knew or bothered to retrieve my account back because I was still a kid. I therefore made a new @msn account (with the same username) and recently I was curious about my old account and tried
 signing in. I realized that there was a verification procedure involved. Since the phone number that was registered was no longer there and I answered my security questions wrong too many times, I could only fill out the form. The form did not work either
 because I got a response that simply said Microsoft was not able to help me out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore, I went ahead and called customer service and they were extremely unhelpful. They told me that there was no live-support technician and I could post an answer on this forum. I have read other similar support threads on this forum and they just
 request the user to fill out the verification form which I have already done so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I asked the "floor manager" that they should hire a live-support technician and he said that they only hire technicians for services that they receive revenue from. Because hotmail is free, they don't hire a live-support technician. I think this clearly
 shows how much Microsoft cares about making money and cutting costs over their customers. Hotmail is a free service but millions of people use it and therefore, it is a substantial part of the business. As a result, I think it wouldn't hurt to hire at least
 one live-support agent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me out with this issue if possible since I am determined to get my old account back. Please don't tell me that you guys can't do anything about it or tell me to fill out a support form (which is clearly useless).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            I also wanted to add that with regards to account retrieval information, I have the original phone number the account was registered to along with a good idea of all my msn messenger usernames I have used in the past. I feel that the account retrieval
 request form questions are way too difficult for me to remember but I don't mind responding to those again through "live" chat or support.

 but there are several apps that are on the phone that I use in my engineeering job, but cannot seem to get for the later generation smart phones. As such I would like to keep using the device and upgrade the phone for a long as possible. Can anyone guide me

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thanks for responding. No, this was not helpful. The compatibility thing did not make any difference. Whenever I try to open the file, Publisher 2013 says&nbsp;"Publisher has detected a problem in the file you are trying to open. To protect your computer, Publisher
 will not open the file."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried other things as well. Nothing worked. Not having any other options, had to revert back to an older backup and lost about 7 days worth of hard work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS Publisher in Office 2013 seems to be neither stable enough nor trustworthy enough for serious work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit.1: Is there a MS Team working on better new release of MS-Publisher? Can we expect a more stable and debugged release of MS Publisher sometime soon? Having intensely worked hands-on with MS-Publisher 2007 and 2013 releases for some time with pretty
 large, complex and colourful design jobs for the last several months, I know a thing or two. I have made a list of must-haves for the next release of MS-Publisher, which will help the MS-Loyal design fraternity who hate to go through the rather unfriendly
 learning curve of Adobe packages (not to mention their cost).&nbsp;</p>

            I have solved this problem by carrying out 'Internet Explorer Reset'.&nbsp; 1) Open I.E.&nbsp; 2) Click the Tools Button (Cog Wheel). 3) Select Internet Options &nbsp;4)select 'Advanced' tab 5)Click 'Reset'. When I.E. finishes applying default settings, click 'Close'
 and then 'O.K.'&nbsp; Then restart your computer.&nbsp;Next&nbsp;download &nbsp;the task Bar that you want.&nbsp; I did this some months ago and have still got my chosen 'Google' with no sign of 'Yahoo' returning,&nbsp;so far!

<h2>            N97mini how to delete a wlan connection</h2>
                    For some reason my N97 decided that my old wlan connection at home was no good anymore and created a new (01) one. So I have Siewerdt12 and SIewerdt12(01). How do I delete the superfluous one.<br />
<br />
What I have tried is Menu-&gt;Settings-&gt;Connectivity-&gt;WLAN select the culprit and do Options (no delete there), backspace (nothing happend). I also deleted all files from the C: drive (there must be a file describing all WLAN connections).<br />
<br />
Does someone know what does work, apart from a hard-reset?

I don't think you can, because it's standard, and it's general for every bluetooth device from nokia connecting to a phone.<br />

Just try to accept it, because, as you said, you love the way the devices are working together.. :D

    <title>6500 slide screen brightness - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikeeboy---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            6500 slide screen brightness</h2>
                    I had my 6500 slide in bright sunshine for the first time yesterday and I could barely see a thing. Is this to do with screen brightness? Is there anyway I can change it?<br />
<br />
Cheers

            I think it's because of the dark background on the Black.nth theme that makes it difficult to see the screen.<br />
<br />
You could try a different theme that has a lighter background like Nokia.nth, Silver.nth or Waves.nth to see if that helps.

            I believe that Word Starter lacks the <strong>View </strong>tab. But the <strong>

</p><p><span>Based on my research, unfortunately you cannot setup policies to change session time on Teams. However, we would very grateful if you could vote the idea via

<h3> brightquark  say:</h3>
<h2>            N97 Problem - Bluetooth remote control profile &#40;AVRCP&#41; not working with car audio system</h2>
                    
<p>I was disappointed to find that my new N97 does not permit remote control from the console of my car audio system. This feature previously worked excellently with my older N95 and allowed me to play music tracks on my phone - skip, ffwd, reverse, play, pause
 etc without touching the phone at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At present my new N97 pairs with the car audio system and audio is played through it, however the player must be controlled from the phone, for skiping or seeking track, this is not possible whilst driving and therefore quite inconvienent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a JVC KD-AVX44 Car Audio system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anyone has had success (or simular failure) utilising this feature with the N97? It would be appreciated if this problem could be resolved. As I have encountered no information on this problem after searching on Google, I have not yet been able to rule
 out if it is the Audio system at fault. Therefore I would also like to know wether anyone has managed to get the AVRCP profile (remote control) working with other systems from this phone?</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also have this problem. I have the JVC KD-BT22. With my N95 8GB and a SE phone works fine, but the N97 wont change track, play or pause.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think this profile has been left out. I can't find a list of N97 Bluetooth profiles anywhere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope they can fix this as I want it to replace my iPod Touch as my music source in my car.</p>

<p>I am having the same problem with the JVC KD-AVX44 going from the N95 to the N97. I can play music but not control it. I can answer calls though which is something. I have emailed JVC Australia to see if a firmware update will occur to include the N97 Bluetooth
 compatibility however the response was that it was unlikely and advise to contact Nokia if the problem could be resolved with their device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So now I'm looking if there is any way to tweak the N97 AVRCP to behave like the N95 by using some sort of app. I imagine this will be very difficult because nowhere have I read of even attempting to do this.</p>

            My N97 works perfectly with my BH-503 headphones, so I don't think the AVRCP is not "turned on" I just think the profile must act differently. I've read elsewhere of people having problems with non-Nokia bluetooth products when they have changed from a
 previously working Nokia phone(eg N95) to the N97.

<p>I am having a similar issue.&nbsp; I used to have an E75 and it was able to sync with my Audi's audio&nbsp;system.&nbsp; I could read my phonebook, missed called and so on.&nbsp; Now with the new N97 I cannot.&nbsp; It is not making much sense since the E75 came out several month
 before the N97 and they have very similar systems.&nbsp; When speaking with Nokia Customer service he explained to me that the E75 had object push protocol and the N97 does not.&nbsp; I am not sure if this is similar or the same as object push profile but I would also
 like some help with this issue.</p>

<p>I have a Pioneer FH-P800BT in my car and It works perfectly with the N97, even better than with my N95.&nbsp; I can fully control the music player via bluetooth and even the phone book transfers flawlessly.&nbsp; I could not use auto connect with the N95 because the
 BT audio had to be connected before the HF phone or it would just plain drop the BT connection, the N97 does not do this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only flaw I am finding is that I can no longer change tracks while using OVI Maps 3.01, but it did work with the Maps beta.&nbsp; I only with I could see the track and artist on the screen of my 800BT via Bluetooth but I can do it if I hook it up to the USB
 port (and it charges the phone too!!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not having the same luck connecting to a TOIMTOM, the phone works but the contacts won't transfer, so I transferred all my contacts to my BlackBerry 8830, used that to transfer contacts to my TOMTOM and voila, I had all my contacts in TOMTOM.</p>

<p>I have now upgraded the phone to the latest V20 firmware and have some interesting results. Whilst still far from perfect remote control seems to now work with the KD-AVX44 car stereo. Most surprisingly I can now also get the song name which is currently
 playing on the car display which is a bonus, something the N95 never did. It did however lose connection on initialisation and sometimes during a track skip but at least developments are moving in the right direction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reliability is still poor, and overall (all the other problems I'm still having with this phone - frequent lockups etc) I am ready to go back to my N95</p>

<h3> robertmichiels  say:</h3>
<h2>            Change Midsize Business to Pro Plus</h2>
                    
<p>We have 28 Midsize Business Licenses but want to upgrade to 53 ProPlus licenses. We already bought the ProPlus licenses because our reseller told us that's possible. The contacted Microsoft to verify this. I already called Microsoft&nbsp; support how to do this,
 since Midsize Business renewal does not give me this option.</p>
<p>I was told to renew to Business Premium. I have to enter creditcard information to do that. Ofcourse I do not want ot pay anything because I already bought the licenses I need. Then I was told I have to renew and give CC information anyway, and when the
 upgrade is finished, I can cancel the order and do not have to pay for Business Premium, but I can upgrade tot our new Pro Plus licenses. I find this hard to believe because if I do not upgrade to ProPlus I have Business Premium for free???</p>

<p>Can anybody confirm I have to renew to Business Premium, enter CC info and then there is a cancel option? I'm a bit reluctant to just try this because if I do have to pay extra then, I will be in trouble...</p>

If you cancel the subscription within the first 30 days, you can apply for a refund if you have paid for the first month via credit card.</p>

    <title>Using free ovi maps on X6 after downloading from ovi suite - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Using free ovi maps on X6 after downloading from ovi suite</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all, and thanks in advance to any and all respondees.</p>
<p>I have just downloaded the UK map from ovi suite to my Nokia X6 after much tribulation. However, I am not sure how to start using the map to navigate for free. When I enter "maps" on my X6 I see a symbol in the top right corner of my screen indicating that
 I am connecting to the internet. The reason I downloaded the map in the first instance was to avoid data charges. Might anybody be able to advise me how I can use the map without connecting to the internet and incurring data charges? I am in the UK and with
 the 3 network. Many thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Welcome to the forum!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As well as OVI Maps application needing to be "Offline" you need to disable Assisted GPS positioning method in Menu &gt; Applications &gt; Location &gt; Positioning &gt; Positioning methods ( forgive me if any menu strokes incorrect as X6 not available); be warned this
 can mean takes considerably longer to lock on to position!</p>

            aspergerguy, thank you for your reply. I had already ensured Ovi Maps was "offline". I hadn't, however, disabled "assisted GPS". I will try that now and reply shortly. Thank you.

<h2>            MSE File EppOobe.etl keeps reappearing after manual uninstall and deletion causes BSOD</h2>
                    <p>Hello. &nbsp;From many days of research on this (Microsoft) support site, I discovered the cause of my month long BSOD was this particular file as part of Microsoft Security Essentials. &nbsp;I have Windows 7 home edition. &nbsp;I followed links to on this site to instructions
 to manually uninstall it using regedit as it didn't appear in the programs and features for uninstalling. &nbsp;After following the manual uninstall instructions, I found further advice on this website to delete the support folder under&nbsp;C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Microsoft
 Security Client\Support as the error created by this file was still appearing. I had 36 hours reprieve. STart up yesterday was perfect, no problem. But, start up this morning my computer reboots unexpectedly (no BSOD dump file) again shortly after start up
 (usually five - ten minutes after I'm working at my computer and usually when I click a link on chrome as I'm reading news) and this file (only this one) has recreated itself and the error is back. &nbsp;This is the exact error:</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This procedure appears to solve the issue.</p>
<p>It MUST be done Exactly by the Steps.</p>
<p>1. DISABLE the Microsoft Antimalware Service</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (To disable: Go to start, then run, and enter <strong>services.msc</strong>.&nbsp; Find the Microsoft Antimalware Service in the list.&nbsp; Change the startup type to disabled.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. REBOOT the machine</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. DELETE the EppOobe.etl File<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Path to file: (Use start&gt; run): </p>
<p>C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Microsoft Security Client\Support\EppOobe.etl</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. REBOOT the machine</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. RE-ENABLE the Microsoft Antimalware Service (use step 1 above, set startup type to automatic.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. REBOOT the machine</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. Frequently CHECK the Administrative Events Log under Custom Views to ensure the error does not reappear.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>NOTE: Just Deleting the EppOobe.etl file and Rebooting will NOT work.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>From http://www.howtogeek.com/forum/topic/microsoft-security-client-oobe-stopped-due-to-the-following-error-0xc000000d</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. Good luck.</p>
