<h2>            Activation of Windows 7 Ultimate</h2>
                    I have the original Product Key that came with my software, however this evening I tried to fire up my IBM workstation after several months being down and I received a message stating that I had to reactivate.&nbsp; I retrieved my Product Key, entered it, and
 then received a message that my software may be counterfeit.&nbsp; I don't understand why.&nbsp; I used it for several years, having activated the software using the exact same Product Key.&nbsp; Please send me a response on how to proceed.&nbsp; Thanks.

<h2>            Password Protection on wakeup does not work in windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Password protection on wakeup will not work on my computer.&nbsp; I come back to my computer after a few hours, hit a button on the keyboard and there is no request for&nbsp;a password.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>No matter how many times I have turned the feature off and on, it still does not require a password.&nbsp;&nbsp; Only on boot up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running windows 10 upgraded from windows 7 pro on an i5.&nbsp; I have administrator privileges.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any Suggestions?&nbsp; (clean install is not an option.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be clear, I have included a screenshot of the setting in windows 10.</p>

            I think the Microsoft Support Engineer is just giving you a bunch of things to try that neither explain the "problem" and/or will not help you at all.<br />
<br />
Depending on your installation, you may have many copies of xpsp2res.dll on your system and you should have one in your system32 folder, one in the dllcache folder and perhaps many others (I have 27) under the system32 folder in various folders under the MUI
 folder and various folders under there.&nbsp; You really can't have two files with the same name in the system32 folder.<br />
<br />
The MUI folder means "multilingual user interface" and the file contains XP messages and icons and the files contain language specific XP messages.<br />
<br />
If you use the built in Windows search, you will probably find many.&nbsp; Right click each one, choose Properties and look at the Version and and then Language.&nbsp; If you are configured for English, the one in system32 should say English and the others in the various
 MUI folders will show some other language in the Properties/Language (German, Russian, etc.).<br />
<br />
You will also find that you may have dozens of xpsp1res.dll file (for Service Pack 1) and dozens of xpsp3res.dll files for Service Pack 3, You may even have an xpsp4res.dll file,in your system32 folder (even though there is no SP4 yet).<br />
<br />
It all depend on your installation, about which we know nothing since the MS Answers does not problem for any system information when a new question is asked.<br />
<br />
I really do not see how the Microsoft Support Engineer "advice" to run disk cleanup or the Microsoft Safety Scanner is going to help you at all.&nbsp; It is not even a good guess, but it does have the requisite links to KB articles.<br />
<br />
If you think your system might be compromised with malicious software, I would do this:<br />
<br />
<div>Download, install, update and do a full scan with these free malware detection programs:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Malwarebytes (MBAM): &nbsp;<a href="http://malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://malwarebytes.org/</a></div>

<h2>            Need to reinstall original Windows 8&#47;8.1 but install is not detecting the product key</h2>
                    <p>So sometime ago I decided to install Windows 10 on my Samsung ATIV Smart PC 500T for the lulz and check it out, also doing research for work while at it. After a few builds (Build 10162 F'd up my system) all my drivers refused to install, including touchscreen,
 digitizer support, and WiFi drivers, leading me to downgrade back to the original OS. (Looks like Samsung didn't wanna give support to my old tablet).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the problem: I've tried both ISO's for Windows 8 and 8.1 and they both ask me to enter the product key. This device is an OEM. Product keys should be saved in the BIOS. It came with Windows 8 originally. But for some weird reason it won't accept any
 of the discs and I'm at a total loss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there still a way to retrieve my Win8 keys from the BIOS? What else can I do to reinstall Windows 8/8.1 with my original key?</p>

                    I tried to install linux to a USB drive but it installed GRUB on my main drive and now I can't boot windows.&nbsp; I had a bootmanager setup with windows 8.1 and windows 7.&nbsp; The partitions are still there.&nbsp; I tried a recovery CD with no help.&nbsp; I tried resetting
 the boot config and the mbr from the recovery, no help.&nbsp; diskpart shows the partitions there along with a system partition and 3 recovery partitions.&nbsp; By the way, the recovery CD only sees windows 7, not 8.1.&nbsp; Anything I can do other than buy a fresh copy
 and reinstall from scratch? &nbsp;

            It is a Lenovo twist.&nbsp; Originally contained Windows 8.&nbsp; I shrunk the partition and added another partition to install windows 7 and I had dual boot through boot manager working.&nbsp; Lastly I upgraded to windows 8.1<br />

            <p>From your booted Linux system, use the following command in a terminal:</p>
<p>sudo update-grub</p>
<p>This should detect Windows 8.1 and add it or fix it.</p>
<p>If nothing happens, boot from the Windows 8.1 CD and go to recovery console:</p>
<p>bootrec / fixmbr</p>
<p>Then</p>
<p>bootrec / fixboot</p>
<p>As you are in the recovery mode, use Windows 8.1 fix boot errors tool. (Forgot the exact name of the tool) and reboot.</p>
<p>Now you would have Windows but not Linux.</p>
<p>Try reinstalling Linux - put MBR partition into sda (as opposed to sdb like before) or try&nbsp;<code>sudo update-grub</code>&nbsp;from the live CD.</p>

bootrec /FixMbr and bootrec /FixBoot did not work either but I noticed a bootrec /Rebuildbcd<br />
That did work!&nbsp; I now have windows back but not Linux. <br />
<br />
Thank You!<br />
<br />
What do you think of this as a plan - physically remove the internal hard drive before doing the linux install and then install linux to the USB?<br />

<p>My D:/ drive (RECOVERY) is completely full.&nbsp; Can I safely save everything on the drive to a disc and delete it off of there?&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, I will be in the middle of doing some on my computer and&nbsp;for no apparent reason my screen goes blue and it
 says it's "dumping" everything,&nbsp;I assume to the D:/ drive.&nbsp;</p>

            What is the brand of Machine, make model, etc?<br />
<br />
Are you able to say what type of files are being written to the Recovery Partition?&nbsp; Are they files from Backups or similar?<br />
<br />
The only files that should remain on such a drive are the files required for recovering your system back to the Factory Release state.&nbsp; You may find that information in the manual or may have to contact the Manufacturer's Support.<br />
<br />
Any other files can be removed from that drive and saved elsewhere, if they are worth saving, or they can be deleted.&nbsp; You may find that running the Disk Cleanup program will offer you some choices about the files on that drive.&nbsp; You can read about that program
 by typing the name in the Help and Support program's search box, you can also launch it from there.<br />
<br />
You can similar post to yours here, perhaps there are a few clues to be found there?<br />

<br />
<br />
If you are seeing Blue Screens, try and note the Error Number.&nbsp; The more details you supply results in a quicker and more detailed response.<br />
<br />
Control Panel/ System/ Advanced System Settings/ Start Up and Recovery/ Settings has an option for you to turn off Automatic restarts in order for you to get the relevant error number and message.

<p>Hi rdrosche</p>
<p>Check to make sure that System Restore is not turned on for that recovery drive. This is the most common reason for this situation.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Go to Start and click Control Panel.</strong> </li><li><strong>On the left side Tasks Menu, select Classic View.</strong> </li><li><strong>Double click System to open.</strong> </li><li><strong>On the Tasks menu, select System Protection.</strong> </li><li><strong>Make sure the System Protection Tab is selected.</strong></li></ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>In the Automatic Restore Points section, remove the check mark from the Recovery Drive letter.</strong>
</li><li><strong>Click Apply.</strong> </li><li><strong>Click Turn System Protection Off in the warning dialog.</strong> </li><li><strong>Click OK.</strong> </li><li><strong>Reboot the computer.</strong></li></ul>
<p>This should delete all of the restore points on the Recovery drive, free up a lot of space, and prevent this from happening again.<br />
<br />
</p>
The Recovery Drive is <strong>critically important</strong>. In case of a disaster, the files on that drive are the only way you have to reinstall Vista.<br />
<br />
Dell&nbsp;has a procedure that allows you to create a Recovery DVD from the files on the Recovery Drive. After you perform this procedure, this will allow you to delete the&nbsp;files on that drive and then use that space for your own files.<br />
<br />
Consult the documentation that came with the computer or call Dell Technical Support for this procedure.<br />

<h2>            Recording and Real-Time Playback Lag</h2>
                    I am using a dynamic microphone connected to an asus laptop, recording with Audacity free sound software. Whenever I record, or even enable "listen to this device" on my laptop and speak into the microphone, there is about a half a second delay in the
 playback and recording. When i try to match up my voice to audio in audacity, playing back it sounds like its completely displaced. Not sure if its a driver problem, but i went into my sound and updated my RealTek driver to current and still problem persists.
 Running windows 7. Any help appreciated

<p>Cubase 4LE works perfectly in W7 (32 and 64 bit versions).</p>
<p>The EMU cards work in Games (I used to have the 1616M).</p>
<p>However, there are cheaper, and as good, sound devices around with dedicated W7 drivers (32 and 64 bit versions). Shop around, checking out the availability of drivers first of all.</p>
<p>With the Realtek, you could try Asio4All (Google for it) which is a "wrapper" for the WDM protocol to simulate Asio.</p>
<p>I would not advise you to use two sound devices unless you know how to set them up correctly. (Most people don't need 2). Those that do normally have a cheapo for Gaming, Windows sounds etc and an expensive one for a DAW for recording purposes.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

    <title>Low Disk Space on recovery partition - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sdwegman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Low Disk Space on recovery partition</h2>
                    My grandfather had put this computer together, and it appears to have two drives (PRESARIO_RP (D:) and Local Disk (C:) ), it seems I do not boot to or use PRESARIO in any way, though it has the RECOVERY software on it.&nbsp; I've been doing the math, my computer
 says it's only about 2 GB (there is also a couple minor folders on it), but the capacity should be 11.2 GB.&nbsp; I constantly get an error message saying it's running out of space, and when I pull up it's properties it says I only have 2.04 MG left on the drive.&nbsp;
 Any thoughts?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>COMPAQ PRESARIO&nbsp;is a Brand name of HP (Hewlitt Packard) Computers</p>
<p>If the D: capacity is 11.2GB it is definitely the Recovery Partition which you have already mentioned (PRESARIO_RP (D:).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are getting that Low&nbsp;Disl Space&nbsp;message about the D: partition, please read this which applies to COMPAQ Computers:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>"Error: Low Disk Space. You are running out of disk space on Recovery (D:)"</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c01508532&amp;lc=en&amp;cc=us&amp;dlc=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c01508532&amp;lc=en&amp;cc=us&amp;dlc=en</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your Recovery&nbsp;Partition&nbsp;was imaged on your Hard Drive during the Manufacture of your Computer by the Manufacturer&nbsp;for&nbsp;these reasons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.To reinstall Vista from in case of a System crash, by pressing particular Key or Keys at Boot.</p>
<p>F10 or&nbsp;F11 or Alt + F10 are a couple of sequences different Manufacturers use.</p>
<p>You will have to ask your manufacturer for the correct sequence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. To make Recovery Disks from in case your Hard Drive fails, so that you can then reinstall the Operating System on to&nbsp;a new Hard Drive.</p>
<p>Also ask them how to&nbsp;make the Disks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Your D: Recovery Drive is not to be used for backups, defragged, etc.</strong></p>
<p>Backups should be kept on an External Hard Drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To&nbsp;fix any problems that have occurred with the D: Recovery Partition, you will have to contact your Computer Manufacturer to remove whatever has been added to it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

5. Do you get any more information on the error in the details section?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>You may check in a clean boot state if you can identify the program or services causing the issue.<strong>To perform the clean boot follow
 the step 1 mentioned in the below article and then try checking in this clean boot state</strong> -</span></span></p>

    <title>Deleting on online-only file - warning - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eric-c  say:</h3>
<h2>            Deleting on online-only file - warning</h2>
                    <p>Starting about a week ago I notice that sometimes I try to delete a folder on my desktop and nothing happens. It does not disappear. It does not move to the recycle bin. It does not give an error message. I have to reboot my computer and then try to delete
 it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>And this time when I try to delete it I get a warning "Deleting an online-only file permanently removes it from your PC without sending it to the Recycle Bin. Are you sure you want to continue?"&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What? Who said this file is "online-only"? Since when? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Many months ago when I decided to start using OneDrive, I moved my Desktop folder, my Documents folder and my Pictures folder into the OneDrive folder. I did this to ensure that no matter what I saved on my desktop or in my Documents folder, it would get
 copied up to OneDrive without me having to remember to move or copy it into the 'OneDrive' folder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my questions are:</p>
<p>- Why is this happening all of a sudden?<br />
- Why is this file 'online-only'? Who told it to be online-only? The icon looks the same whether it's online-only or also on my local computer drive? How can I tell if there are other 'online-only' files on my computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe my previous attempt to delete the folder really DID delete the folder, but what I am seeing is the online version. If I delete a folder on my desktop, I think this change should be synced on One Drive, no?</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<p>But what if I want to delete the files permanently? I have on-demand turned on.</p>

            Actually, the problem seems to be that OneDrive sees even "always available" green-checkmarked files as "online only." I am getting the "won't be permanently deleted" warning even on "always available" files.

<p>
</p><p><span>Why is the message shown when you try to delete files that are NOT "online only"?&nbsp; The message appears regardless of the file status, even if they are "always available" or "locally available".&nbsp; I want to use the On-Demand
 feature, but this message is very annoying and hinders productivity when I need to delete files.&nbsp; The files still end up in the Recycle Bin, so the message is useless.&nbsp; This definitely looks like a bug and hope MS will fix, the message should appear only when
 someone tries to delete an actual "Online Only" file!</span></p>

<h3> johnem51  say:</h3>
<h2>            Jane Greenoffs Cross Stitch designer programe will not open and run under Windows 7.</h2>
                    I have tried to run this program as an administrator, it tries to load and then fails. No faults displayed . I have tried to run this in XP SP3 and XPSP2 compatability. Same results. I uninstalled and then re-installed just in case. No difference. I am
 fortunately dual booting and can therefore run this program under native XP. Any suggestions please or have I got to resort to running a virtual XP and then install into that?

<div>Hi johnem51,</div>
<div>&nbsp;<br />
Currently there is no information on Jane Greenoff's Cross Stitch designer program's compatibility with Windows 7.<br />
It may not be compatible as of now.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You may probably have to continue in Windows XP or resort to running virtual XP till the time the manufacturer releases the program that is compatible with Windows 7.</div>

<p>I downloaded Directory Monitor 2.13.0.0 and set it to watch my C drive then of course had to filter out the directory the program is installed in.</p>
<p>Once I started the program, I was immediately drawn to a PNG file written to my Temp folder...then puzzled by the fact that it was immediately deleted.</p>

<br />Perform the procedure to repair the system files:
<br />Follow these instructions: press the Windows + X keys and select Command Prompt (Administrator) or Windows PowerShell (Administrator), in the window that will open, you must type the commands in their respective order:
<br />• DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth
<br />• DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />• DISM.exe /online /cleanup-image /startcomponentcleanup
<br />•  sfc /scannow 
<br />
<br />Each of these actions can take a few minutes, so it is important to execute one at a time. When finished, you must restart the PC.
<br />
<br />Let me know if the information has been useful to solve your Problem.

            What I can recommend is that you completely repair the operating system, but first you must backup your files, although with this method the data is not lost but it is a good idea to backup as a security measure, third-party applications if they are uninstalled, check this link.

<h2>            Wired Xbox One controller randomly disconnects from PC</h2>
                    I have a Wired Xbox one controller connected to my Windows 10 PC and it will disconnect (Xbox logo wont light up) and stop working for a couple seconds. As you can imagine this is pretty annoying and has cost me a couple games. Disconnects about every
 5 minutes. I have updated the drivers and it still disconnects. If I'm in game it will either continue the last action i put into the controller or just stop immediately. Any feedback is appreciated.

            Hi  poongavanam
<br />
<br />Those Windows licences are not legit, they are a scam .  .
<br />
<br />What they are selling is Volume Licences to Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Those licences will initially activate and then after a month or so will deactivate. This is because they are meant to be used in a commercial environment where the company server will re-arm the Windows activation on a regular basis.
<br />
<br />As a private owner, you will not be able to do that - honestly, don't waste your money !

            Most of the time, these keys are volume key or at the worst counterfeit keys. They stop working after some time and you land into troubles.
<br />
<br />I would recommend that you should buy from a trusted source which will ensure peace of mind.
<br />
<br />If something is too good to be true, just ignore this.

            Microsoft warns about those here:
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/howtotell/Shop.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/howtotell/Shop....</a>
<br />
<br />With the exception of Product Key Cards (PKC’s) distributed with COA’s, Microsoft does not distribute products keys as standalone products. If you see a listing on an auction site, online classified ad, or other online page advertising product keys for sale, it’s a good indication that the keys are likely stolen or counterfeit. If you were to purchase and use a stolen or counterfeit product key to activate Windows installed on your PC, the key may not work for activation, may already be in use on another PC, or it might be blocked from use later by Microsoft when the key is reported stolen.

    <title>Screen brightness not changing with brightness setting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nxbt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Screen brightness not changing with brightness setting</h2>
                    <p>I recently got a new laptop with Windows 10 and have been using it plugged in for the past few days. I recently noticed that when changing the brightness setting through function keys, by the battery icon on the system tray, or from the settings menu that
 the screen brightness wouldn't change. I've tried restarting, updating my display adapter driver, reverting the driver, and disabling then enabling the generic PnP monitor driver with no luck.<br />
<br />
The brightness setting itself does change and persist, just not the brightness of the monitor itself. I was able to once have the brightness change when I reverted to an older display driver, but the brightness only changed when the driver was installed and
 further tampering with the brightness setting didn't change the brightness.<br />
</p>
<p>The laptop is an ROG Strix model GL502vmk. The graphics card is gtx 1060. I am unsure of when the problem started but suspect that it began the computer arrived as I can't recall ever successfully changing the brightness.</p>

<p>Team Viewer's mirror driver usually does this to me, but I've always been able to fix it by removing the monitor from Device Manager on the systems I support.&nbsp; Perhaps remove it, then go to the PC manufacturer's website and install their own driver and see
 if it takes over.</p>

<h2>            xbox game pass for pc and microsoft store</h2>
                    the xbox game pass for is awesome and microsoft is awesome for giving us that. but the microsoft store
<strong>[Mode removed- Inappropriate]</strong> really bad, if your not willing to fix the store then at least provide another way for us to buy, download, and manage our games. knowing what i know about the microsoft, i will never purchase a game from there
 ever.&nbsp; origin steam upaly gog epic all have functioning stores, im not saying they dont have problems but its never anything like this. the microsoft store is so bad i would never even open it if not for the game pass.&nbsp; honestly i dont care if the store ever
 gets fixed, i just want all games and dlcs completely removed and launched on a properly functioning platform. also all of these xbox apps are way to confusing, 1 app that handles everything is what we need.&nbsp;

<p>hi yea im on pc and ive been having a ton of problems lately. my biggest complaint about the store is sometimes when i open it, i get a white screen with an error code and a option to give feedback. so i leave the feedback and thats it, the store is dead
 for hours. leaving me unable to launch, search, or download anything based on the store. also this store is weird with installed apps, it often request that i install apps that are already installed, sometimes i have to go to installed apps, other times i
 have to search the store and open the game page just to get it to launch. the most frustrating problem ive had was with crackdown 3, i would launch and game and it would crash instantly. so i tried a few things like force closing the store and reopening it,
 checking for updates, rebooting my pc nothing worked.&nbsp; after about 20 ctd's i decided to try the multiplayer and it worked, i then tried launching the campaign from the multiplayer and i got a message saying make sure the game is installed. so i uninstall
 the crackdown campaign and tried to reinstall it, on the game store page in place of the install game button there was a small message that said not sold separately. so i went to the my libary and looked under all the tabs and the game was still showing as
 installed but the launch button did nothing. its been fixed already, but it was pretty annoying. not only did i not get to play the game but i wasted about 40 minutes trying to get it to work and filling out feed back forms. i recently discovered an app xbox
 beta i think its called, seems to be literally what i was asking for, i haven't had a problem with it yet. it seems to be a proper game platform. the only problem with it is not all of my games from the microsoft store are showing up in the app.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

            You don't have to use the MS store, you can use the Xbox app which looks really good and is a proper launcher for games.

                    <p><span><span><em>Original title: </em></span></span><em>the start of windows 10</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Hi all! I have an Asus K56CB laptop and I have recently upgraded to windows 10. I encountered the following problem: the laptop no longer starts from the first press of the power button, only the second pressing (at first pressing it tries to
 boot, the Asus logo appears, but it shuts down immediately). At second pressing it boots, it starts, but takes a few minutes till it turns on. In safe mode it doesn’t do this. After it starts, the notebook works flawlessly. I would like to know if anyone has
 a similar problem and what can be done. Could it be from a Windows 10 update? I would appreciate your tips on this. Thanks in advance.</span></span></p>

            Thank you for your help, Isha, but I followed all the steps&nbsp;and the problem still exist. I am sure that I have no problem with the hard disk but I think the problem is windows 10. Before windows 10, I had windows 8.1 who worked perfectly. Thank you again

 not the Windows 10 updated.<br />

    <title>Disable the touchpad in Microsoft All-in-One Media Keyboard - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jotenko  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disable the touchpad in Microsoft All-in-One Media Keyboard</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to disable the touchpad of this wireless keyboard (Microsoft All-in-One Media Keyboard)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I mean, sometimes you want to use this keyboard with a mouse on the side, and you keep tapping the touchpad accidentally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already downloaded the Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center to no use. I don't find that option available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought this would be a basic setting to any device equipped with a touchpad! I really don't get how these small things aren't adressed when a product is designed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will someone help me?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hi Joten,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be glad to help you with the issue you have in disabling touchpad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can change touchpad settings to turn the touchpad on and off, reverse scrolling direction, turn gestures on and off, and more.</p>
<p>Here’s how to change touchpad settings:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Step 1:</strong> </td>
<td>
<p>Attach the Cover to your Surface or the keyboard to your Surface Book. <br />
(If you have a Wireless Adapter for Typing Covers, attach the Cover directly to your Surface.)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Step 2:</strong></td>
<td>Go to Start <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fcompass-ssl.surface.com%2fassets%2f09%2fb9%2f09b9d014-d7cc-4be4-84a8-5f185cf6a772.png%3fn%3dwindows-10-windows-icon-20.png" />, and select
<strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Devices</strong> &gt; <strong>Mouse &amp; touchpad</strong>.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Step 3:</strong> </td>
<td>Adjust your settings under <strong>Touchpad</strong>. <br />
You can make some or all of these adjustments, depending on which model Surface and Typing Cover you have:
<ul>
<li>Turn the touchpad on or off </li><li>Have the touchpad turn off when you’re using a mouse </li><li>Turn off the gestures for swiping from the left or right edge </li><li>Change the scrolling direction </li><li>Turn off the right-click button </li><li>Turn off the double-tap and drag (tap and a half) gesture. </li><li>Set a delay to ignore accidental touches or turn off taps while retaining all other touchpad functions, as shown here:
<p>
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fcompass-ssl.surface.com%2fassets%2f24%2fc6%2f24c619ae-779c-4d6d-a095-68433b51f7a7.png%3fn%3dwindows-10-touchpad-delay-setting-325.png" /></p></li></ul>
</td>

<h2>            I need help my Xbox One is broken</h2>
                    
<p>I was trying to get into a multiplayer game in Dragon Age, it connected to a game but would not load the start. &nbsp;I waited more than 5 minutes, it was hung up. &nbsp;The only way to quit was to go to the home page and start another game.</p>

<p>Now, the only game I can run is Destiny. &nbsp;Far Cry 4 won't load, Dragon Age freezes, Sunset Overdrive will get to the sign in page and then gets hung up. &nbsp;Dead Rising 3 will not load either.</p>
<p>I also cannot uninstall any game on my drive. &nbsp;The option is greyed out, and when I select it, it does nothing.</p>
<p>What happened? &nbsp;Is my hard drive bad? &nbsp;Not sure what to do but nothing except Destiny runs, help please.</p>

<p>Hi sokrox, Please could you try power cycling your Xbox One. To do this simply press and hold the power button on the front of the console for a good 10 seconds. Even when the console switches off keep that button pressed. Once 10 seconds is up leave your
 console off for 5 minutes. Power it back on and see if that has fixed your issue.</p>
<p>Hope that's helped.</p>

    <title>Using Joyce Emulator for Amstrad on Windows Vista 32 bit operating - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sarnia1066  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using Joyce Emulator for Amstrad on Windows Vista 32 bit operating system</h2>
                    <p>Following on from advice received earlier on this forum , </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&nbsp;have succesfully downloaded the Amstrad Emulator JOYCE v2.2.4 and am trying to add the boot disc for Micro Design 3 programme.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On each occasion , I get either the error message " Disc rejected by driver " or "You need to format the disc in drive A before you can use it."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I have no real knowledge of using emulators , has anyone any idea what the problem is and is there a way around it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This device seems to be preety old, Some questions before we got to any sort of troubleshooting here:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you using Floppy drive to install the software/run the software?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the error message is related to Floppy drive then the issue could be with corrupted data on the Floppy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try redownloading the Software and copy it to CD and then try to install the&nbsp; Amstrad Emulator JOYCE v2.2.4.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many websites provides free download for Amstrad Emulator JOYCE&nbsp; Products.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have a&nbsp;good day ! Enjoy the Life !</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 will not install, possibly cause EgisUpdate&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having difficulty upgrading to Windows 10. &nbsp;The download completes and I begin the upgrade, the upgrade reaches the stage of copying the files to 90 percent ish, then the computer reboots. &nbsp;Then the screen says restoring previous version of Windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When restored, the windows update screen appears informing me the update had failed:</p>
<p><br />
WindowsUpdate_C1900101-20004 Windows has encountered an unknown error.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interesting in the background a window appears saying egisupdate. I have never seen this screen before! This states:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cannot get the latest updates from Egis server, please retry later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have reinstalled the windows security updates twice (from Windows update, as these appear as options) and tried the reinstalling windows 10 but the same thing occurs, cannot upgrade to windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run a full scan using Kaspersky, this comes up with no threats.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have viewed add/remove programs to remove EgisUpdate but this does not appear on the listings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe the EgisUpdate is stopping the upgrade from working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running an Acer Aspire M3802 desktop with windows 7. With upgraded RAM and graphics card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated, thanks in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            <p>The specification for your computer states that it has MyWinLocker bundled with it. This appears to be an Egis product.
</p>
<p>I'm not convinced this is the reason for your failure. It might just have been running in the background.&nbsp;</p>
