<h2>            audible error msg during startup</h2>
                    During Startup, I hear an audible error message.&nbsp; How can I troubleshoot to discover what is causing this.&nbsp; The sound occurs shortly after the Windows logo music. &nbsp;

            There is no visible error message.&nbsp; Just the audible sound that something did or did not happen.&nbsp; Thank you for your suggestion.&nbsp; Think I will try the clean boot option and see if it resolves the problem or at least tell me what is happening.<br />

<p>&nbsp;Was the audio tone just a beep sound that you heard.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would try as you suggested and boot into a Clean Boot to see if you can duplicate this.&nbsp; Please let us know status.</p>

<h2>            windows live id sign-in assistant 6.5 windows 8</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>I have installed the latest Microsoft Flight and it ask me to sign in the Game For Windows Marketplace for additionnal content. When I try to open it, I am then told that I need to install the Windows Live ID Sign In Assistant 6.5 for it to work. I click
 on the proposed link but when I try to run the installer, nothing happen, the setup window close by itself and I'm leave with no error message whatsoever. I have tryed both installer 32 and 64 bits (I'm running Windows 8 CP&nbsp;64 bits french) with no success.</p>
<p>I have also tryed the compatibility option on the msi installer with no change. I was wondering if their is a solution to install this module succesfully. I have Windows Live Essentials 2011 (messenger only) installed twice but the addons dosn't appear in
 IE10 desktop. I'm not sure where to go from now on.<br />
<br />
Thanks. </p>

<h2>            Windows Update broke Runas &#47;Netonly, builds 1703 and 1709</h2>
                    <p>After installing the outstanding patches from the last few of months, suddenly the
<strong>runas /netonly</strong> command no longer works.</p>
<p>I was using it to connect SQL SSMS to another domain:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>runas /netonly /user:DOMAIN2\user ssms.exe</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I get the error:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Login failed. The login is from an untrusted domain and cannot be used with Windows authentication. (Microsoft SQL Server, Error: 18452)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried connecting via IP, hostname and FQDN. Even added corresponding entries in the hosts file.</p>
<p>Ping is working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm getting the same behaviour on Windows build <strong>1703 </strong>and <strong>
1709</strong>.</p>
<p>As I mentioned this was working before on these computers.</p>

<p>Hi Lev,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might have been caused by a misconfiguration on the privacy settings of your computer or your server's domain. To troubleshoot this error, you can use this article as a reference on
<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/34155.sql-server-troubleshooting-login-is-from-an-untrusted-domain-and-cannot-be-used-with-windows-authentication-microsoft-sql-server-error-18452.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>SQL Server Troubleshooting: Login is from an untrusted domain and cannot be used with Windows authentication. (Microsoft SQL Server, Error: 18452)</strong></a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since that you are connected to a domain, there are advanced troubleshooting that needs to be performed as this would also be a different approach to the usual troubleshooting of Windows. If the issue persists, we suggest that you post your question in our

    <title>CHKDSK on every boot, crashed and beeps - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> slayerzzaasswwqq  say:</h3>
<h2>            CHKDSK on every boot, crashed and beeps</h2>
                    <p>I usually put my computer to sleep at night. Sometimes it turns on by itself, which wakes me up. Ill usually get up, groggily hold the power button to shut it off, then go to bed. This happened two nights ago. I went to start my computer last night, and
 receive this:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>one of your disks need to be checked for consistency</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard">I begin the CHKDSK, but every time, it crashes. The screen goes black, then my computer starts beeping. The CHKDSK doesn't crash at a specific point either, it can crash at
 any point.... 1% complete or 44% complete, and anywhere in between. I found that if I leave it off for a long time, it goes longer without crashing. I've also noticed that it pauses at 32% and slows down significantly until around 35%. Not sure how to solve
 this, I'm not too savvy with computers. However I can try any suggestions.</p>

            <p>Hi Tommy,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I can imagine the inconvenience you are experiencing and will certainly help you in the right direction to fix the issue. However, I would appreciate if you could answer a few questions to narrow down the issue in order to provide
 you with better assistance.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Are you getting any specific error code/message along with the red X while installing updates?</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Did you make any significant changes prior to the issue?</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Do you have any security software installed?</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>As per the description which you have posted in your post seems that you are unable to install the updates, this problem may occur if one or more of the following conditions are true:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>The Windows Update database is corrupted.</span></li><li><span>Antivirus software is configured to scan the %Windir%\SoftwareDistribution folder.</span></li><li><span>The Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) service does not receive a content link header.</span></li><li><span>A required system file is registered incorrectly.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try the below methods and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p>I would suggest you to run the troubleshooter from the link mentioned below and if it doesn't help try other steps mentioned in the same article.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2509997" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">You can't install updates in Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008, or Windows Server 2008 R2
</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Registry disclaimer</span></strong><strong>: </strong>This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure
 that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article

<p>
</p><p><strong>Important</strong>: </p>
<p>While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to check if you are able to access Windows Update services and also make sure that the following services are started. If it is not started follow the below mentioned steps:&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a. Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong>, type "<strong>services.msc</strong>" (without quotes) in start run box and&nbsp;press
<strong>Enter</strong>.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>b. Locate <strong>Windows Update</strong> service.</span></p>
<p><span>c. <strong>Right click </strong>on the Windows Update service and select
<strong>Properties</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>d. In <strong>Start-up type</strong>, select <strong>Automatic</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>e. Click <strong>Start</strong> under <strong>Service status</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>f. Click <strong>OK</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>g. <strong>Repeat the steps c</strong> to f for the following <strong>services</strong> also:
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Background Intelligent Transfer Service &amp; Cryptographic Service.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>After performing these steps try to install updates and see if you get success in installing updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this would help. <span>If issue still persists post </span>back with current status of your computer and result of the proposed suggestion, we will be happy to assist you.</span></p>

            <p>Your PC is<b>&nbsp;probably</b>&nbsp;infected with the newest variant of Sirefef AKA Zero Access. &nbsp;One of the "symptoms" being reported in this and other forums is that all downloads are identified as being a virus and the malware (programmed to morph numerous times
 daily to help prevent detection) is disabling various antimalware programs as well as preventing the installation or use of some malware removal tools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suggest you use HitmanPro Kickstart which should remove this malware and repair the changes it has made to the computer:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.surfright.nl/en/kickstart" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.surfright.nl/en/kickstart</span></a>&nbsp;
 &nbsp; You must use an uninfected computer to download it to a flash drive and then follow the specific directions on how to run the program on the infected computer.<b>&nbsp;</b>Hitman Pro Kickstart is available as a<b>&nbsp;30 day trial version.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

The instructions in this thread and your previous thread <b>should</b> enable you to fix your computer:

<div><br />
<div>If you prefer to seek assistance from a "real person" you can take your computer to a reputable repair shop of your choosing or you can seek assistance from Answerdesk. &nbsp;Go to&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/</span></a>&nbsp;
 and select the link that says - I think my computer is infected. Options will vary by region, but phone support leads you to Microsoft Answer Desk (<a href="http://www.answerdesk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.answerdesk.com/</span></a>)<b> in the
 US at this time.</b>&nbsp; After an initial free consultation, a $99.00&nbsp;<b>fee</b>&nbsp;<font>will
<b>probably</b> be charged depending on the details of the case.</font></div>
<div><font><span><br />
</span></font></div>
<div><font><span>MSE did not cause your problem and we read reports on a regular basis about persons using other antimalware products who encounter the same issues that you have.&nbsp;</span></font></div>

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would suggest you to try re installing the driver, as there is driver available for windows 7.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-in/d/sidewinder-x6-keyboard" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-in/d/sidewinder-x6-keyboard</span></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would suggest you to place your computer in clean boot and then try to install driver from the mentioned link.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Clean Boot:</strong></div>
<div><br />
Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</div>
<div><br />
<a href="http://https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to perform a clean boot in Windows&nbsp;</a></div>
<div><br />
<strong>Note: </strong>Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</div>
<div><br />
Hope this helps.</div>

<h2>            iPod nano 2nd Gen and windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Greetings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I have an iPod Nano 2nd Generation, and it won't sync with iTunes or Winamp. I've tried uninstalling the unknown driver and reinstalling an Apple one, I've tried disc mode, and I've tried using a different computer. I always get the same alert "USB not
 recognized. The last USB device you connected to your computer has malfunctioned, and Windows does not recognize it." I never had this problem before and I really need help ASAP.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better assist you with regard to syncing your iPod to your iTunes or Winamp, we suggest that you get in touch with your device manufacturer as they need to do some configurations on their end to have the synchronization working.</p>

    <title>System sounds filtration not working during skype calls - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> abdullah5490  say:</h3>
<h2>            System sounds filtration not working during skype calls</h2>
                    <div>Hello. I am a very oldest skype user since the version 3.8 was came out, and using skype as my primary voice communication tool on the internet. but now after upgrading to skype modern for windows desktop, i am too much irritated with few problems. beside
 all of them, one problem is really disturbing me and preventing my daily usage at skype. I am here to discuss that with you to get some clew, or to seak attention of skype developers.</div>
<div>Prior to describing my problem, let me tell about my usage environment briefly. I am using an HP elitebook820G2 notebook. It has single audio 3.5MM port, which is used for both output/input via Combined audio connector, same as we use on our mobile phones.
 I always use the handfree of my mobile phone with this notebook for skype calls.</div>
<div>Now, the problem is, the latest skype series (v8.xx) does not have system sound filtration during call. Which means, when i am on a call, the other side will also listen the sound playback of my system through skype call. The worst thing is, even the sound
 and screen sharing remain turned off, still everything from my PC is being broadcasted on phone call to other party. This is not only my issue, I have experimented on different windows laptops having single combined audio jack on skype call, and the results
 are same.</div>
<div>After analysing all of above, I can easily say that this is the lack of a technical feature in skype modern. Because this type of problem was never happened with old skype for desktop versions. If we need to send our system's sound/playback, we can turn
 on "sound sharing" there, and when we want to stop broadcasting the system playback, we can turn "sound sharing" off, and that works perfectly. But in skype8, the sound sharing feature is present, but even if it is not turned on yet, the sound playback is
 still not being filtered by the program, and everything is going out to other party while on call.</div>
<div>This is a biggest privacy leak and anoying bug in skype8 which needs an immediate attention. Due to this problem, the users of combined audio jacks are really getting disturbed with the behaviour.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Technically speaking, in the old skype, that filters the system sounds being heard, from broadcasting out to the ongoing call, and only send the sound coming from microphone. When we turn on "sound sharing", only then it disable the filter and let the
 other party listen to the system playback along with the microphone voice as well. But in the skype8, that filtration mechenism is not implemented, due to what everything is being heard, is also being broadcasted on call to other party along with microphone
 voice.</div>
<div>I did reporting to skype support via twitter, but they never took it serously. I did try explaining the problem on skype user voice portal, but that is also remain unnoticed. and at final step, i came here to discuss this matter with fellow users, and
 raise my voice with more power and loudness along with the support of all of you. If I became unsuccessful here once again, then no option would remain for me except uninstalling skype and go away.</div>
<div>If there is no solution, then please suggest any possibility of using older version of skype (v7.41) instead. Because i was more than happy with that version, and there was no problem like this under that product.</div>
<div>Thanks and regards.</div>
                </div>

<p>The only game i've purchased is Assassin Creed 1 for £14.99. &nbsp;Around my way most retailers are either selling it for £19.99 or include it in their 2 for £30 deals. &nbsp;Waste of time going out my way to purchase it as the game has little or no resale value anyway.
 &nbsp;Would never ever pay over £14.99 for any digital game.</p>

<p>I don't know, I kind of like having the plastic case and disc along with my purchase, and I imagine that would take a lot of hard drive space as well. It is however a very good feature to have if you don't have many game stores around you or otherwise don't
 have access to a store that sells games. Under the right circumstances, it can be an amazing service, but I think it's really only meant for that. If you're in a situation like the one I described.</p>

    <title>Poor or NO signal strength....... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bernie2269  say:</h3>
<h2>            Poor or NO signal strength.......</h2>
                    I have Windows 7 and wanted to set up a wireless connection. I checked Microsoft's compatibilty page and purchased a Linksys RangePlus Wireless Network USB Adapter Model# WUSB100. After two days of waht was supposed to be an easy installation and set up,
 I finally connected to the internet. However, the connection comes and goes and I never get over 1 bar of signal strength. i sit with my laptop right next to my PC which is hooked up to the router and still get no more than 1 bar. It's very slow and runs at
 the speed of dial-up. Very frustrating to say the least. I don't know if it matters, but my internet company is Charter with 1Mbs of speed, which is pretty fast on my PC. Any tips or info would be appreciated. Thanks in advance!

<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi bernie2269,</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for visiting Microsoft Answers.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows</span></span><span>
 provides a built-in troubleshooter that can automatically find and fix some common connection problems.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; Open the Internet Connections troubleshooter by clicking the
</span></span><span><span><strong>Start</strong></span></span><span><span>
 button, and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
</span></span><span><span><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; troubleshooter</strong></span></span><span><span>,
 and then click </span></span><span><span><strong>Troubleshooting</strong></span></span><span><span>.
 Under </span></span><span><span><strong>Network and Internet</strong></span></span><span><span>,
 click </span></span><span><span><strong>Connect to the Internet</strong></span></span><span><span>.</span></span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; If the computer has any security software installed, try disabling it and check if the wireless connection works with good
 signal quality.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; Note: Since some anti-virus programs will cause unexpected application conflicts, please temporarily disable any anti-virus,
 Firewall,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or anti-spam programs on your computer. Make sure you re-enable it back after troubleshooting.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two things you can try in this situation:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. If any devices like phone is near your computer, turn them off temporarily or move them farther away.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Change the router or access point settings to use a different wireless channel, or set the channel to be selected automatically
 if it is set to<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;a fixed channel number. Sometimes one wireless channel is clearer than others. In the United States and Canada, you can use channels 1, 6,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; and 11. Check the information that came with your access point or router for instructions about setting the wireless signal channel.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You can change the location of your CPU and then check if it works. You can also try to insert a wireless USB adapter onto your CPU and check<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;if it helps.</span></p>

    <title>Windows Explorer stops working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nyreemark  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Explorer stops working</h2>
                    I keep getting the same error box &amp; message over and over again. Sometimes once in a day sometimes a couple of times.<br />
It then says its checking for solutions to fix the problem. Then it says Windows Explorer is restarting. It takes a&nbsp; minute or so and it does restart. However whatever folder I had open at the time are closed, and also my desktop icons have usually moved. Can
 anyone help me fix this problem?<br />
I have also noticed that my Chrome and google pages are not working as they were before. Pictures not appearing correctly etc etc and some pages showing complete errors that cant connect or find the server. Any suggestions or help would be greatly appreciated.
 Thanks Nyree

Hi ElderN, <br />
Firstly thank you so much for replying AND a big fat absolutely YES to the question "Did I<span>&nbsp;apply Windows updates on or about November 14th and would you say the problems started after that or did you have the problems
 before November 14th?" ............... yes yes yes and I thought about that yesterday when I was looking at trying to do a fix to a previous system restore point.
<br />
Can you tell me why you asked that? Is there issues with recent updates??? <br />
<br />
Please help if you can, and NO I dont seem to be able to 'make' windows explorer "crash on demand" so to speak. My system make and model do you mean my PC and or the oprating system I'm running too?
<br />
Thanks so much again and look forward to your reply. <br />
Nyree</span>

<p>System make and model would be something like Dell, HP, ASUS...</p>
<p>
</p><p>See if you can do something that will make Explorer crash every time like:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Copy/Paste</p>
<p>Drag/Drop</p>
<p>If you have an external attached drive Copy/Paste to the external drive</p>
<p>If you have an external attached drive Drag/Drop to the external drive<br />
Right click things - files, images, videos, etc.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Then do this and we can see what you have:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the system is a Dell what is the Service Tag Number?<br />
<br />
If the system is an HP what is the serial number?<br />
<br />
Click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
msinfo32<br />
<br />
Click OK, and when the System Summary info appears, click Edit, Select All (Ctrl-A), Copy (Ctrl-C) and then paste (Ctrl-V) the information back here in your next reply.<br />
<br />
There will be some personal information (like System Name and User Name), and whatever appears to be private information to you, just delete it from the pasted information.

<p>Hi again,</p>
<p>
</p><p>No matter what I do I cant seem to force the computer to come up with the error Windows Explorer has stopped responding. However it might be worth noting that it has not happened for 2 days now.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have done what you suggested for the msinfo32 and copied data is below for you.<br />
I have an ASUS N series Laptop N53s</p>
<p>Does that help you??<br />
<br />
I am still having the other main issue with Google Chrome and my Facebook account and pages not displaying images correctly,. They appears as blank boxes with test written in them describing what might be in the picture. I have screenshotted what its doing
 so am I able to show you that somehow?<br />
Thanks</p>

<p>That does help and reveals you have an ASUS computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many ASUS computers come with a software product called MyWinLocker from EgisTec and it adds a Shell Extension to Windows Explorer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After Microsoft patched some security hole in Explorer applied through a Windows Update (<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4038777/windows-7-update-kb4038777" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">KB4038777</a>)&nbsp;those old versions of MyWinLocker
 would cause Explorer to crash during certain operations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of those certain operations would be copy/paste to an externally attached (usually USB attached) storage device and/or drag/drop&nbsp;to an externally attached (usually USB attached) storage device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if you have such an externally attached USB drive can see if you can recreate the Explorer issue by performing some operations like that (especially drag/drop operations).&nbsp; Then apply the solution and see if the problem is resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution is to uninstall from your system anything and everything to do with MyWinLocker and then see if the problem is resolved which it usually is.&nbsp; &nbsp;Most folks with the problem don't even know what MyWinLocker is, are not using it but if you do need
 it you can install a fresh version later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These wild goose chase ideas like SFC, Safe Mode, Clean Boot etc. will not help but they will waste your time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Read through these instructions that tell you how to find an afflicted Explorer Shell Extension and what to do for your ASUS system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you mean you are seeing something like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=e6a2532b-70b2-43f8-94ed-7d30cca20a08" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/df24035a-2ab4-455a-b1dc-167bc259024b" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If that is the case, read this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps you have an afflicted Explorer Shell Extension.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Explorer Extensions make up the list/menu of things you see when you right click something. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>An afflicted Explorer Shell extension can cause Explorer to crash - especially when using copy/paste and/or drag/drop and often to/from an external USB attached drive or device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Several recent incidents involving ASUS and Acer systems and MyWinLocker from EgisTec (which is already known to include some troublesome Explorer shell extensions) which may have come preinstalled on your system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>** Note:&nbsp; You may see this issue after the installation of Windows Update&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4038777/windows-7-update-kb4038777" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">KB4038777.</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if your system is not from ASUS and Acer it may have MyWinLocker installed and since there have been many reports of it contributing to Explorer crashes it seems a good place to start looking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you look in your Installed Programs and find MyWinLocker or anything from EgisTec and you don't know what it is or why it is there consider just uninstalling it, rebooting and then see how things work.&nbsp; You can always reinstall it again later if needed,
 right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have determined that MyWinLocker or any other EgisTec programs are involved follow the general purpose instructions below so you will be able to see all the Explorer shell extensions and figure out which one is afflicted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After using The following program suggestion if you see any extensions from EgisTec, PSD Security Software, eDataSecurity, DragDropProtect (they will be some of the pink extensions) start with those first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If none of those things are present, continue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When Windows Explorer (not Internet Explorer) is misbehaving (especially when right clicking), start to suspect third party Explorer extension add-ons.&nbsp; You may also see Data Execution Prevention (DEP) errors.&nbsp; DEP errors are reported when Windows feels
 threatened by a program and Windows will shut down the threatening program.&nbsp; Windows should never feel threatened by Windows Explorer (or Internet Explorer) unless some add-on is the cause.<br />
<br />
Those would be Explorer extensions that do not belong to Microsoft.&nbsp; That means extensions that you added.&nbsp; Explorer extensions are usually okay and installing some applications will install Explorer extensions for you, give you a choice and sometimes they
 can be added without your knowledge when you install new software.<br />
<br />
Explorer extensions are sometimes added as a new right click option you see on folders and files (like scan this file, open this file, play this song).<br />
<br />
If there is a particular thing you do when Exploring that you know will cause the problem, that will help zero in on the problem and help you know for sure when you have found and fixed it.<br />
<br />
If you can make it happen anytime you want, make an adjustment and then there is no message the next time you do whatever it is you do, you have found and fixed it.<br />
<br />
First you need a way to see what Explorer add-ons you have installed now and a way to disable them (not uninstall them) so you can figure out which one is causing the problem.&nbsp; You may have lots of non Microsoft extensions installed you don't even know about.<br />
<br />
Download ShellExView from here to see which Explorer extensions you have loaded:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/shexview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/shexview.html</a><br />
<br />
ShellExView doesn't install anything on your computer, it just runs and displays.<br />
<br />
After you launch ShellExView (double click shexview.exe) and acknowledge the security warning, adjust the column widths so you can see everything clearly.&nbsp; Under Options, choose to "Mark Non-Microsoft Extensions" and the non Microsoft extensions will be in
 light pink, but on some systems that is a hard color to see, so click View, Choose Columns and move up or move down the Microsoft column so it is closer to the top (Move Up) so you can see it on your screen without having to scroll left and right.<br />
<br />
Next, click the column header called Microsoft (it may be way out on the right side of the screen) to sort the display (by clicking the Microsoft column header) so all the non Microsoft extensions are at the top and easy to see.&nbsp; They will say "No" and be marked
 in pink since they are not Microsoft extensions, something like this:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/27add777-1ed6-4486-93a6-4dc10f1ae3d6" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>The non Microsoft extensions would be things you have added (non Microsoft) and are what you need to be suspecting.<br />
<br />
If you see extensions that do not have anything listed under Description, Product Name, Version, Company or have peculiar names that looks like they might be just random numbers and&nbsp; letters, you might want to look at those first.<br />
<br />
You can also Google the name of a suspicious add-on and see if there are any hits regarding Explorer crashes or DEP errors and what other people have done about it.<br />
<br />
You might Google something like:<br />
<br />
&lt;my-suspicious-add-on&gt;&nbsp; windows explorer crashing<br />
<br />
You have to fill in the name of your suspicious add on.<br />
<br />
See what kind of search results hits you get and look for solutions or situations that sound like yours.<br />
<br />
I am not a trial and error advocate, but I can't think of another way to do this...<br />
<br />
Right click and disable the non Microsoft extensions one at a time (or perhaps in little groups of 3-5) keeping a list so you can enable them again later if desired. The result of the change is immediate and no reboot is required.&nbsp; Test your (right click) failure
 condition.&nbsp; If Explorer starts to act normally, you will know that some extension you just disabled in that group of 3-5 is the culprit so you can start to enable them one at a time until explorer fails again.</p>
<p><br />
One user reported that there was a need to restart Explorer after each adjustment so to do that press Ctrl-E from within ShellExView.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you recognize any extensions that may have been added or downloaded recently, start with those first.<br />
<br />
Disabling an extension does not uninstall the extension - it is just disabled.&nbsp; You can always enable it again later, so keep track of things by writing them down.<br />
<br />
Disable them one at a time or in little groups (to make things go faster) until your right click does not generate an error, then reboot and test again to be sure.&nbsp;&nbsp; That last extension you disabled would be the suspicious one.<br />
<br />
You can also just disable all the non Microsoft extensions, reboot, test your failure condition and enable them one at a time until you find the one that generates the failure condition.<br />
<br />
If you have a lot of extensions, you could disable them is little groups, 3-5 at a time instead of 1 at a time until your system starts to behave. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it does behave, you will know that the problem is one of the extensions in that little group and you can enable those in the group one at a time until the problem comes back, then the problem will be with the last extension you enabled.<br />
<br />
The hope is that you will find the one extension that causes the problem and then you can figure out what to do about it - either uninstall it or see if you can get an update from the maker of the extension from their web page.<br />
<br />
I don't have your issue but I can when you disable/enable the extensions, the extension is immediately disabled, so disabling an extension does not seem to require a reboot but if you think you found the problem, I would reboot and retest anyway to really be
 sure the problem is gone.<br />
<br />
If you post up a list of your non Microsoft extensions, maybe someone will recognize it as a potential problem.<br />
<br />
If you find the offending extension that is the problem, please let us know what it is so I can add it to my list!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Along with your other msinfo32 information do this next so we can see your video river information:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>For video device and driver information, expand the Components, click Display, click Edit, Select All, Copy and then paste the information back here.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>When folks are making web pages with images it is good coding practice to include in the HTML along with the image some text that will be displayed in the event that the image can't be displayed for some reason (the image might be missing, corrupted, etc.)
 so instead of just showing an empty hole where the image should be the text associated with the image will display instead.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's called an alt attribute and you can read about it here:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_img_alt.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_img_alt.asp</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>For example your posts in the community have an default green circular image associated with your MS Answers login/account and since you have not added an image to your account profile MS Answers just displays a default image that looks like this (for you):</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7e44b8a3-0d34-4d34-ba06-dd3e7d5ce035" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7e44b8a3-0d34-4d34-ba06-dd3e7d5ce035" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you look a the HTML that displays that green circular image image in browsers you will see it has an alt text attribute in the HTML code:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8f7e94f3-9802-47d9-8ad2-3255732e2834" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8f7e94f3-9802-47d9-8ad2-3255732e2834" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So if while browsing you are seeing the alt text behind the image instead of the image it sounds like on the WWW site that is displaying that image the image on the WWW site is either missing, somehow corrupted, the browser doesn't understand how to display
 the image - or maybe there is some other reason.</p>

                    <div>Hi</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I got my laptop last week and and yesterday the sound stopped working. The laptop is a ASUS G53SX: i7-2670QM 2,2 ghz. 8 GB RAM. GTX 560M.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried to update/re-install the drivers without any luck. I have also tried system recovery and still no sound. The latest software that I have installed is Adobe Production premium 5.5 and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have checked the playback settings and the only device showing is Sony-tv 1. I also checked for deactivated and disconnected devices but still only Sony-tv. &nbsp;</div>
<div>Please help &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Once you connect the external speaker, the internal speaker on the computer will stop working automatically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;You may also check for the computer speaker in the playback decive and set it as default to get sound from the speaker on the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;To configure the right device follow the steps below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;Open Control Panel and select Sound.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Sound dialog appears click the Playback tab.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;Verify if the speakers and the right sound card listed under playback devices.</p>
<p>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;If so, right click on the sound device and click on default playback device.</p>
<p>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;If they are not listed, Right click on the blank space and click on show disabled device.</p>
<p>f.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the speaker gets listed, right click on the speaker and click on default playback device.</p>

<p>Have you made any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</p>

    <title>How do I delete messages from deleted folder&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> don snowden  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I delete messages from deleted folder&#63;</h2>
                    Hello,  In Hotmail, through latest Mozilla Firefox, using Windows 8, where can I find commands to manage my e-mail files? I don't find them on the bottom blue band. I can't permanently delete files or select an option to delete the entire folder. I can't label a junk mail e-mail as junk e-mail now that one occasionally slips through the screening. I can't set a time limit for deleted messages staying in the deleted folder or the junk folder so those messages get removed automatically.  I basically can't find anything for doing the basic controls of the mailbox that I was used to doing in the old Hotmail. And I can't what or where to look for in the main search or settings for Window, which are confusing as **** anyway. Hope you have some answers because I'm getting tired of wrestling with this.  Ciao 4 now,  Don Snowden

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no&nbsp;option to empty the deleted mail folder in the Mail App. But, instead we can instantly delete all the mail from the deleted folder by selecting all the deleted emails and then deleting them permanently.</p>
<p><span><span>A.<span> </span></span></span>Open the Mail App and click on “Deleted”.</p>
<p><span><span>B.<span> </span></span></span>Click on the first mail in the folder and press “Ctrl” + “A” keys on the keyboard to select all the emails in the folder.</p>
<p><span><span>C.<span> </span></span></span>Click on “Delete” icon on the right side of the window.</p>
<p>Now, all the emails in the deleted folder will be deleted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For moving an email to a different folder, try these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>A.<span> </span></span></span>Right-click on the email that you would like to move.</p>
<p><span><span>B.<span> </span></span></span>Select “Move”.</p>
<p><span><span>C.<span> </span></span></span>Now, when the screen dims out, from the left side of the window, you can select the folder to which you would like to move the selected email.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>(There will be no additional menus or keys appearing when the screen dims out. Instead, you will be able to select the destination folder at the left side of the window.)</b></p>

            Hello Abdul R,<br />
<br />
The Control +A function doesn't work for selecting all messages.<br />
If I delete, I have to do every e-mail individually.<br />
The old interface, still available if you do Outlook.com, had the boxes you could check and then do a single delete to remove all the ones you checked.<br />
<br />
Re moving, I know and use the series of actions you detail.<br />
You used to be able to simply designate the message as junk or set that e-mail address as junk and it would go straight to the junk folder from then on.<br />
<br />
Not having those available in this app are both steps backward, IMO. <br />
<br />
Ciao 4 now,<br />

            If button works in another account this may mean current account is damaged. The simplest solution is to work in another account. Otherwise you may look at differences between Current User settings in registry and it is not easy job unfortunately.

            The fact that it works in Safe Mode tells me it's a service or app in the background causing the issue. Could you try clean booting?
