<h2>            PowerPoint VBA to take a sound from an animation and use it in other animation</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I would like to take&nbsp; the informations about an animation I have on a shape on a slide and apply it to another shape on another slide. I want to use VBA to do this so I can use variables to decide what animation to apply on what shape depending on the situation
 in a game. Here is an exemple :</p>
<p>Sub CopyPasteAnimation()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; n = Int((5 - 2 + 1) * Rnd + 2)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; theEffectID = ActivePresentation.Slides(7).TimeLine.MainSequence.Item(n - 1).EffectType<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; theTrigger = ActivePresentation.Slides(7).TimeLine.MainSequence.Item(n - 1).Timing.TriggerType<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set theShape = ActivePresentation.Slides(2).Shapes(n)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set theEffect = ActivePresentation.Slides(2).TimeLine.MainSequence.AddEffect(Shape:=theShape, effectid:=theEffectID, trigger:=theTrigger)<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>This code is doing everything I want, except for the sound. I would like to take the information about the sound that goes with the animation and apply it to the new animation.</p>
<p>Thanks' for your help.</p>
<p>Christine./</p>

<p>I had a chance to look into this a little more and here is what I ended up with:</p>
<p>I was correct about assigning the name directly in EffectInformation. However, this assumes that the name of the sound effect will come up on the sound effect list. You can't assign an any other kind of sound effect this way, so I was wrong in that respect.
 You can use that method for ActionSettings, but not for animations it appears.</p>
<p>To play a sound that has been embedded into the presentation the only way I was able to get it to work was to create a new animation from the sound shape itself and then have that animation animate with the desired pair. This way will work 100% of the time
 and allow you to keep all audio files in the presentation itself. This is how I do the majority of my activities where sound is required, and I would recommend you do the same to save yourself a major headache. Try:</p>
<p>Sub getsound()</p>
<p>Dim sound As Shape, partneranim As Effect</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Set sound = ActivePresentation.Slides(1).Shapes("bag.wav")</p>
<p>Set partneranim = ActivePresentation.Slides(1).TimeLine.MainSequence(effectforaudiotoplaywith)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With ActivePresentation.Slides(1).TimeLine.MainSequence.AddEffect(sound, msoAnimEffectMediaPlay)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; .Timing.TriggerType = msoAnimTriggerWithPrevious</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; .MoveAfter partneranim</p>
<p>End With</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>End Sub</p>

<p>Hi Luis,<br />
<br />
To narrow down the issue, could you confirm the following information?<br />
<br />
1. To determine software and add-ins conflicts, please <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
start your Mac in safe mode</a> and then perform the same steps as before to check if there is any improvement.<br />
</p>
<p>2. Go to <strong>System Preferences</strong> &gt;<strong> Security &amp; Privacy</strong> &gt;
<strong>Privacy </strong>&gt; <strong>Accessibility</strong> &gt; <strong>Uncheck</strong> all the applications listed there (You may need to click the "<em>Lock</em>" button at the lower left, input your local admin account to proceed). Restart Word and check whether
 the issue persists.<br />
</p>
<p>3. In which scenario will you encounter the slow performance issue? Can you share more details? For example, selecting one menu.</p>

<h2>            Scheduler on Windows 10 mobile</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>Is there a way to run apps or turn on and off a setting on a schedule or at a defined time band, for eg. I want to turn on the battery saver mode everyday at 9pm and turn it off at 6am. Is there a customization or setting or app to make his possible? This
 should be able to have dynamic customization possible, for eg. wifi on during weekdays daytime and off on weekend daytime and off on night time(define a time band). How can this be achieved? if MS can integrate an app or a setting to the OS to accomplish this
 it would be great.</p>

    <title>View-only file sharing in OneDrive for Business is not really - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mhdesign  say:</h3>
<h2>            View-only file sharing in OneDrive for Business is not really view-only</h2>
                    <p>I run a visual design firm, and I've started using OneDrive for Business to share view-only drafts of PowerPoint presentations with my clients. Here's how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li>I upload a draft of a PowerPoint file to OneDrive for Business</li><li>I then click on the Share button to generate a link to that file</li><li>I set the link to "Anyone with the link can view", and I disable "Allow editing"</li><li>I send the link to the client, with the expectation that they can view the file using PowerPoint Online, but not edit it or download it</li></ol>
<p>When the user on the other end clicks on the link, the file opens in PowerPoint Online, with a little band across the top that says "Read Only. You don't have permission to edit this file." Perfect, just what I want.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if the end user simply clicks on the File tab, they are given the option to download a fully editable version of the file to their computer! This completely defeats the purpose of sharing something as view-only.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate any suggestions on how to disable this. I really like the ability to share files via a link that opens in PowerPoint Online, because it shows all the animations, transitions, etc., correctly for clients to preview. But I don't want them
 downloading editable files until the project is complete.</p>

<p>Hi MHDesign,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to explain that with the Anyone with the link can view guest link, it's not feasible to disable the download operation. We understand user may have the requirement to share items with Any one with the link can view guest link, but don't want to
 let other users download the file. It is suggested you submit the feedback via <a href="https://onedrive.uservoice.com/forums/262982-onedrive?category_id=86090" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
OneDrive for Business Uservoice</a> (or directly vote this <a href="https://onedrive.uservoice.com/forums/262982-onedrive/suggestions/7105024-prevent-shared-files-from-being-downloaded" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
similar feedback</a>). This is the best way to let the related team hear your voice. Your feedback will help us perfect our products and services.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a workaround, you may need to change the sharing method and create a custom permission level which don't allow other users to download a copy of that file. Share items with that customer permission level. To learn more about this workaround, please check
 the steps mentioned in Ran's post in <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_onedrivefb-mso_other-mso_o365b/file-download-restriction-in-onedrive-for-business/031a5a6a-0a06-4425-be88-c48ba315ac07">

    <title>Appointments in alternative calendars are not shown as &#34;busy&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chris kr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Appointments in alternative calendars are not shown as &#34;busy&#34; to coworkers</h2>
                    <p>I use multiple different "folders" in my Office 365 Calendar with the same account because I work for different companies and want to keep the appiontments apart.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, my co-workers only see my calendar as "busy" when they try to schedule a meeting with me as long as I have an appointment scheduled in the main calendar (or calendar folder that was set up by default).</p>
<p>If I use one of the alternative calendars to schedule a meeting, my schedule appears as "free" in my co-workers scheduler tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What could cause the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            Thanks for the response. I do also use the online version of outlook though (in the browser) and even creating sub-calendars (or alternative calendars) doesn't do the trick and an event created in those calendars online still shows up as "free" when my
 co-workers use the scheduling feature.

<p>Hi Chris Kr, </p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Based on your description, I have done a test in my<span>&nbsp; </span>OWA, I used account A created an alternative calendar, then share this alternative calendar to another Office 365 account B in the same organization and B accepted it, then I use account
 B scheduled a new meeting which in the same time period as A in his main calendar, when I search and add the account A, it still shows "free",
</span><span>since in Outlook for Mac, there is a limitation that it only pay attention to the main calendar about this feature like Cortig mentioned, moreover, not only this limitation exist in Outlook desktop client for Mac, but also it exist in Outlook for
 Web.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>@Cortig, Thanks for your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meantime, if you have any questions about Outlook for Mac, I still suggest you go to

            <p>
<span>Yes, the options are checked (except for one mentioned later in this reply) and the missed words are input into the auto correct...It does not appear to miss words that are actual misspelled
 words nor does it highlight a misspelling that has been put into the custom dictionary, an example being :<span>&nbsp;
</span>myst for mist. <span>&nbsp;</span>It <i>is</i> missing, for instance, a word that<i> I have designated should be capitalized.
<span>&nbsp;</span></i>I have also added these words to the custom dictionary, and I do not have the "suggest from main dictionary only" option checked.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Besides which, I know it is using the custom dictionary because it will catch some of the mistakes...(yes, of the same word in the same document, which is why this is so weird)<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span>The same thing is happening with the contractions.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It might catch for example, <i>I’ll</i> in the <i>first instance</i> of it, and again in the
<i>next instance</i> of it, but <i>then</i> it might <i>
miss a couple instances</i> and then <i>find it again later in the document,</i> or i<i>t might never find that contraction again within that document.
</i><span>&nbsp;</span>I cannot put the contractions into the auto correct because
<i>I do not necessarily want All contractions within a document corrected.
</i><span>&nbsp;</span>Changing contractions is something I do on an individual basis based on sound of the sentence, character who is speaking, etc.; some
<i>characters</i> are <i>Never</i> supposed to <i>use a contraction</i>, while
<i>some Always use contractions</i>, so as you see, for me this is a rather important function.
<span>&nbsp;</span>If I have an entire chapter from a non-contraction user speaking, and it misses some of them (I am usually pretty good at not using them, but occasionally some do slip though) then I have a character who is "<i>out of character</i>"
 so to speak. <span>&nbsp;</span>After rereading the above, I have to conclude that this is mostly a capitalization/contraction problem, which is actually a grammar/punctuation problem rather than a spelling problem per se.
<span>&nbsp;</span>However, since the two functions are within the same application, I suppose that is a moot point.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span>This is frustrating as I often have words that need capitalization in a consistent manner.
<span>&nbsp;</span>I have also noticed it continuing to tell me a word is wrong, even after I have input my preference in capitalization into both auto correct and the custom dictionary, which I find rather odd; however, I suspect it is because the word
 is not normally capitalized since it is the only one I have that problem with.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I typically simply ignore instance.<span>&nbsp; </span>I wish they would include an “ignore for this document only” choice.<span>&nbsp;
</span>That would open many avenues of use of common words that someone might always want to capitalize in a particular document.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span>I realize that compared to it actually missing a word that is misspelled these problems might seem minor.
<span>&nbsp;</span>I agree that the most important function of the program (catching words that are not spelled correctly) "appears" to be working fine (although there appear to be words that I would expect to find in a dictionary that it does not recognize).
<span>&nbsp;</span>It is still a frustrating problem for me, as I cannot trust it to catch things that are quite important for me.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have no idea if anyone else is noticing this problem.<span>&nbsp; </span>
I would surmise that only someone "writing" as in articles or stories, as I do, where unusual capitalizations are required would even notice it; however, they might notice the inconsistent recognition of contractions.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span>I&nbsp;suppose I am wondering if this is a flaw (bug) within the program, or if there is something that I am missing in using the program.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have also tried removing the words that it is missing from both the dictionary and the auto correct and then adding them back into them.<span>&nbsp;
</span>That does not appear to have any bearing on what the program does.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It continues to only catch the words part of the time.<span>&nbsp; </span>
I have noticed that when it comes to the contractions, it will mark one, and then if you correct it, it will highlight the next one, but only for some of them.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have had it to highlight the same contraction three times in a row, and then stop highlighting any, even the exact same contraction a few sentences or even in the next sentence.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It will also skip some contractions while it goes on to highlight one two sentences away or some variation of that scenario.<span>&nbsp;
</span>As you can see this is an odd and inconsistent problem.<span>&nbsp; </span>
Even with the capitalization problem, as I believe I already stated, it might pick up one and then not catch one that directly follows it or even the next instance of the same word.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
<span>I honestly do not believe that reinstalling would make a difference, as I had the same issue with Office 2003.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I realize now that I should have tried to get it fixed before; however, at the time that I had that version, I had only recently begun to use it more often and knew I would shortly be switching to 2010 where I assumed, evidentially incorrectly, I would
 find that it was fixed.<span>&nbsp; </span>Now, it is a problem that is becoming increasingly frustrating, and I would appreciate any information anyone has about this.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Is Microsoft even aware of the problem and working on a fix for it or does anyone know?<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>

            It's not clear to me how&nbsp; you're dealing with these spellings, capitalizations,&nbsp;and contractions. You can set the grammar options to highlight contractions (this is not a spelling issue), and you can add words to an exclusion dictionary (see
<span><a href="http://sbarnhill.mvps.org/WordFAQs/ExcludeWordFromDic.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://sbarnhill.mvps.org/WordFAQs/ExcludeWordFromDic.htm</a>), but I don't think that you can define specific exclusions as part of a paragraph
 style (which would make it possible to limit the use to specific characters).</span>

 is not that it does not catch any of them, it is that it is very hit and miss, mostly miss. It misses many more than it catches. Please reread my last post as I went into detail about this problem.
</p>
<p>I do not know what you mean about the exclusion option as that has nothing to do with the missed contractions and capitalizations. This is a problem of the program MISSING contractions and Capitlizations. It will catch one or two and then miss several in
 the contractions and the same with the words I have specified to be capitalized. It will catch one and then in the next sentence ignore the same mistake on the exact same word. I don't know any better way to explain it. It is missing more than half of the
 contractions in a document and ignoring some of the preset Capitalizations. </p>
<p>Thanks, </p>

            <p>I guess you're going to have to explain it in words of one syllable. When you say it is missing contractions, what is it you're expecting Word to do with the contractions when it finds them? And what is it that you
 have done that makes you expect Word to "catch" them? As I said, the only way I know of to do this is in the Grammar settings (File | Options | Proofing |&nbsp;Grammar Settings: Style).</p>
<p>How have you designated words that should be capitalized? If you're using AutoCorrect to do this (as it appears you are), what is the form of the AutoCorrect entries?</p>
<p>Also, I think you would be well served to investigate the use of the exclusion dictionary, which will highlight words as misspelled to make it easier for you to spot them. You can add "myst" to the custom dictionary,
 but this will not make "mist" wrong. You can add an AutoCorrect entry to convert "mist" to "myst," but note that if the entry is lowercase, then Word will match the case that is entered: that is, if&nbsp;you type "mist," you'll get "myst"; if you type "Mist," you'll
 get "Myst"; and if you type "MIST," you'll get "MYST."</p>

            <p>Okay, I will try again. <span>&nbsp;</span>I will try to answer your question by answering each one individually.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>I guess you're going to have to explain it in words of one syllable. <span>
&nbsp;</span>When you say it is missing contractions, what is it you're expecting Word to do with the contractions when it finds them?
</i></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I expect word to <b>underline (i.e. “catch”) them</b>. <span>&nbsp;</span>I have the grammar section set for
<b>Everything Except</b> <b>first person recognition. <span>&nbsp;</span>T</b>hat particular setting is not needed.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Perhaps I am expecting more than the application is capable of giving.
<span>&nbsp;</span>However, when it says that word will check for contractions, then I expect it to find them and underline them...then it is up to me to make a decision to keep them or change them.
<span>&nbsp;</span>I will give you a <b>Sample Sentence </b>and<b> attempt to explain</b> what
<b>Word Is doing</b>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Sample Sentence:</i></p>
<p><i>“Well, as you can see, I’m not asleep; I’ve been waiting for you. <span>&nbsp;</span>Do you think
<u>you’re </u>about ready to come to bed, now? <span>&nbsp;</span>I’m tired of sitting in bed all alone.”
</i></p>
<p>End of Sample Sentence&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you can see, the <b>above section has Four Contractions: </b>I'm, I've, You're and then I'm again.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Of those <b>four contractions Word Underlined ONE of them: You're. <span>
&nbsp;</span></b>The other three it ignored. <span>&nbsp;</span><i>(I underlined the one it “caught.”)
<span>&nbsp;</span>In addition, just in case you wonder, yes, I have seen it underline all of those contractions at one time or another, so it is not that it is not recognizing them at all.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Only most of the time.&nbsp; </i></p>
<p><b>I have the box checked in the grammar section to check for contractions </b>
as I said. <span>&nbsp;</span>Is this something that Word cannot do? <span>&nbsp;</span>Because the way I understood it, It could do this.
<span>&nbsp;</span>If not, then it should be noted somewhere that its underlining of contractions is sporadic at best and not to trust it to do so.
</p>
<p>To go farther: For Instance: Word <b>might</b> catch the word<b> I'M i</b>n a sentence.
<span>&nbsp;</span><b>In the following sentence</b> it might<b> IGNORE it</b>. <span>&nbsp;</span>No underlining.
<span>&nbsp;</span>When I say "<b>Catch" </b>I am meaning that Word <b>recognized </b>
the word and<b> FLAGGED </b>it <b>as a contraction. <span>&nbsp;</span></b>I really do not know how to explain it any better than that.
<span>&nbsp;</span>It simply <b>"misses" i.e. does not underline,</b> <b>many, many contractions in a document while "catching" i.e. underlining, some of them.
<span>&nbsp;</span></b><i>I have seen it underline every contraction in a paragraph and
<b>then in the following paragraph ignore every contraction </b>even though they are the ones it Flagged in the preceding paragraph.
<span>&nbsp;</span>I have seen it ignore a contraction that it underlined three words previously.
<span>&nbsp;</span>I</i> have also seen it highlight a contraction and if you correct that one it will highlight the next one, etc.…<b>and then suddenly, even though you correct the one underlined, it STOPS highlighting them.
</b><span>&nbsp;</span><b>I have experimented with this and seen it happen.</b><span>&nbsp;
</span>I have also seen, <b>while it is doing the underlining as you fix it thing,</b> skip over some, and go on to one farther on in the sentence or paragraph.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This just seems like Weird behavior to me. <span>&nbsp;</span>That really is the only way I can explain what I am having and seeing happen within the program.
<span>&nbsp;</span>If there was some way to copy a document with the underlining intact that would be the only other way to explain as it would actually show you what I am meaning.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>And what is it that you have done that makes you expect Word to "catch" them?
<span>&nbsp;</span>As I said, the only way I know of to do this is in the Grammar settings (File | Options | Proofing | Grammar Settings: Style).<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></i></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i><span>&nbsp;</span></i></b></p>
<p><span>That<b> is </b>what I have done.<span>&nbsp; </span>In the<b> grammar settings that you quote above, I have the box checked for it too “catch” them</b>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have <b>EVERY BOX in the grammar section marked</b> as I stated, EXCEPT for the “check for First Person.”<span>&nbsp;
</span>Not having that checked should have nothing to do with Word underlining contractions.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>Is Word incapable “catching” and indicating contractions even when that box is checked?<span>&nbsp;
</span>Because I could see it missing one now and then, but to miss as many as it does seems a little odd for a program that you can set to accomplish a function.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>How have you designated words that should be capitalized? <span>&nbsp;</span>If you're using AutoCorrect to do this (as it appears you are), what is the form of the AutoCorrect entries?<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></i></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before I start to answer the above I would like to say that I have noted before that this is NOT A SPELLING PROBLEM.<span>&nbsp;
</span>WORD UNDERLINES MISSPELLED WORDS JUST FINE, IN BOTH THE CUSTOM AND THE REGULAR DICTIONARY.<span>&nbsp;
</span><i>As far as I am aware</i>, it does not miss misspelled words.<span>&nbsp; </span>
</p>
<p>I use both the <b>auto correct </b>and the <b>custom dictionary.</b><span>&nbsp; </span>
As for the form, I have put it in:<span>&nbsp; </span>I will use a SAMPLE WORD: <span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>for instance,…this is a word that is entered into the custom dictionary:
<b><i>Igisadonis.<span>&nbsp; </span></i></b>It is capitalized.<span>&nbsp; </span>I have entered it into the custom dictionary as a capitalized word.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have entered it into the auto correct feature as the following:<span>&nbsp; </span>
igisadonis in the side for “wrong” and then:<span>&nbsp; </span>Igisadonis in the side for the “correct” way to use it.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Usually, it auto corrects it, sometimes not.<span>&nbsp; </span>Sometimes it will mark it as spelled wrong…sometimes not...and sometimes it just ignores it completely when it is wrong, that is.
<span>&nbsp;</span>(It always ignores it if it is correct, which is fine) <span>&nbsp;</span>I do not really care if it corrects it as I type it, or if it flags it as misspelled.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Either is fine.<span>&nbsp; </span>What I find odd is when it completely ignores it.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Also, I think you would be well served to investigate the use of the exclusion dictionary, which will highlight words as misspelled to make it easier for you to spot them. You can add "myst" to the custom dictionary, but this will not make "mist" wrong.
 You can add an AutoCorrect entry to convert "mist" to "myst," but note that if the entry is lowercase, then Word will match the case that is entered: that is, if you type "mist," you'll get "myst"; if you type "Mist," you'll get "Myst"; and if you type "MIST,"
 you'll get "MYST."<span>&nbsp; </span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will look into this dictionary.<span>&nbsp; </span>Thank you.</p>
<p>Word appears to underline misspelled words.<span>&nbsp; </span>It does not underline a word that I have changed the spelling on if it is in the custom dictionary.<span>&nbsp;
</span>As far as I can tell anyway.<span>&nbsp; </span>If it does, then it is not very often.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The problem appears to be that it sometimes ignores a word that I have designated as needing to be capitalized, as I explained above.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This problem does not appear as often as the contraction problem, but then, there are fewer words that need capitalization than there are contractions.
<span>&nbsp;</span>I do know that it works correctly to recognize the words.<span>&nbsp; </span>
If the word to be capitalized is in a document where it is not capitalized, then if I paste it into word, it
<b>Usually</b> underlines it. <span>&nbsp;</span>I have noticed that it occasionally does not underline it as wrong.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I do not know why it is so inconsistent; however, I do not understand the same thing about the contractions.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have seen it change it from not capitalized to capitalized as I am typing.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It tried to do it in the above instance, and when I changed it back to a non-capitalized word, it underlined it as “wrong”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Which it should do.<span>&nbsp; </span>Why it does not always do so, I do not know.<span>&nbsp;
</span>That is what I am trying to find out.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is my belief that this is a rarer problem as I have only noticed it a few times, as I said.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>If Word is not capable of doing these things, I just want to know that it can’t do it.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Then I won’t be expecting it to and thus my frustration with it will go away.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Frustration is more likely with something that you don’t know can’t do what you expect it to do.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you know it can’t do it, then the majority of the frustration dissipates.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You might wish it could do it, but if you know it can’t then you can accept that it can’t.
<span>&nbsp;</span>If Word should be capable of doing these things then Microsoft needs to know about this otherwise they cannot do anything to “fix” it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I hope this makes the problem clearer.<span>&nbsp; </span>If it doesn’t <span>&nbsp;</span>then I really do not know what else to say as I really do not believe that I can explain it any better, short of sending a document
<span>&nbsp;</span>with the problem, which as far as I know would not be possible as the underling etc. would not show up.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Okay, I think I now see what you're doing. As for catching the contractions, I have no explanation except that you're perhaps just overwhelming Word. I do know that if you have "Check spelling as you type" enabled and there are too many words Word doesn't
 recognize, it will give an error message that "There are too many misspellings in this document" and turn "Check spelling as you type" off. So it's possible it's just overloaded and overtired here. Not a very good explanation and certainly not an excuse, but
 I can't think of any other.</p>
<p>As for the made-up words that you've put in the dictionary, note that the custom dictionary is very literal. You must add a word in every conceivable form, lowercase, capitalized, singular, plural, etc. Here's why that's important in your case. If you want
 Word to AutoCorrect a lowercase form of a word to initial caps, you must put <strong>
both</strong> versions in the custom dictionary. The reason is that Word will do only one thing at a time. If it has marked a word as misspelled, it will not AutoCorrect it; this means that, if Word encounters "igisadonis" and considers it misspelled it won't
 (or at least may not) correct it to "Igisadonis."</p>
<p>I'm not sure if any of that helps. My suspicion is that you're just expecting too much of Word.</p>

            <p>I'm in the process of revising all my Word articles, and that is one that really required no revision except to add "and 2010" to the instructions for Word 2007. AFAICT, there is no change for Word 2010. Note that you don't have to create the exclusion dictionary
 for Word 2007/2010 because it already exists; you just have to locate it.</p>
<p>But you make a good point that there are no specific instructions for Word 7. That's because Word 7 didn't exist when those instructions were written, so I will have to research that.&nbsp;(I&nbsp;seem to have an exclusion dictionary
 set up on my Windows 7 laptop, so I'll have to take a look and figure out how I did it. My guess is that the path would be very similar to the one for Vista.)</p>
<p>Incidentally, I did not write those instructions; someone at Microsoft did. I had already written an article on the use of the exclusion dictionary in Word 2003 and earlier, and I was not looking forward to updating
 it for Word 2007 because of the change in method. Then I found the MS article and just added a link to it. At some point I discovered, to my horror, that the Help file in Word 2007 was sending users to my article and had taken the original MS article down!
 So Word 2007 Help was no help at all! Luckily I was able to find the previous article using the WayBack Machine and pop that text into my article!</p>

 that I did find were the correct one.&nbsp; At least, I did not find the one it said to look for.&nbsp; I may try to instructions for Vista.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Okay, I went back and tried to follow the instructions, but it was too confusing for me to follow.&nbsp; I found a file called&nbsp;
</p>
<p>ExcludeDictionaryEN0409.lex&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>which I thought was the right file but it won't allow me to move it using Office.&nbsp; When I tried to move it, Office told me that only files ending in .dic could be in there.&nbsp; I got so confused with all of the different instructions that I am not even sure
 if that was what I was supposed to do.&nbsp; Can you give me some more explicit instructions?&nbsp; I assume that is the correct file, although it was not where any of the instructions said it would be.&nbsp; I just had to keep looking around until I finally hit on it.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 However, I have given some thought to this... Would contractions even be in the dictionary?&nbsp; I would not think they would be, in which case would it even do any good to put them in there?&nbsp; It doesn't seem to me that it would.&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, I would appreciate any
 instructions and/or opinions about using it.&nbsp; </p>

            <p>This occurs when your RAM or graphics rendering runs out of steam. This not related to MSP.</p>
<p>Get a better computer, or more RAM, or a better graphics card, or shut down some of the numerous applications that you have running.</p>
<p>Or just ignore it and switch from one view to another and back again so that the graphics rendering catches up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, much more serious than a minor graphics rendering issue is that you are linking summaries as predecessor/successor, which is generally considered poor scheduling practice and many problems will arise as a consequence. Do not link summaries.</p>
<p>You also have resources assigned to summaries and again same problem and same suggestion/recommendation. Do not assign resources to summaries, and also do not assign costs (fixed cost) to summaries.</p>

<p>If it happens with those projects that are larger and more complex but not with the simpler ones then I'd go with Trevor's assessment. But, if the problem is not related to the size or complexity of the project then it very likely could be corruption of
 some of your files. Try saving as XML and then re-open in Project. Note, you will lose any custom formatting with this process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To expand on Trevor's comments about links and resources on summary lines, you might want to take a look at the following Wiki article. http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/29569.project-linking-andor-assigning-resources-to-summary-tasks.aspx</p>

    <title>Tracking&#58; Baseline Bar Not Accurate to Pre-Baseline Duration - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Tracking&#58; Baseline Bar Not Accurate to Pre-Baseline Duration</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a task that is 12 hours, assigned to the 24 Hours calendar. No resources are assigned to it. When I set the baseline and view the Tracking Gantt, the baseline bar shows a duration of 1-1/2 days, as if the 12 hours is now based on the Standard calendar.
 This happens immediately - I have not entered actuals or made any changes to calendar assignments - no changes whatsoever. I set the baseline, switch to the Tracking Gantt, and then I see the baseline bar has changed its length. The tracking bar is still at
 the 12 straight hours. Why would this happen - shouldn't they be the same to one another?&nbsp; I have another bar in the Project that is doing the same thing, and it's the only other task that is set to a duration of hours instead of days. This task is set to
 4 hours and the baseline bar shows the task as 8 hours (the tracking bar showsas 4).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a problem with entering durations as hours instead of days? I don't recall this being an issue in Project 2007/2003.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for any suggestions/advice -</p>
<p>Heather</p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am puzzled by this and have tried many ways all ending in failure and frustration. I have 2 columns</p>
<p>
</p><p>N3:N27 that contain dates and O3:O27 that contain YES NO responses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to count the number of YES within a specific month i.e 4 in Jan&nbsp; 6 in Feb etc. and then go on to work out the percentage of the yes's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone advise please?</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>=SUMPRODUCT((MONTH(N3:N27)=<strong>1</strong>)*(N3:N27&lt;&gt;"")*(O3:O27="Yes"))</p>

<p>File -&gt; Info -&gt; View Sync Status -&gt; "Sync automatically whenever where are changes" is enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even so, my notebooks do not sync in the background even while Onenote is open.&nbsp; I have to select the notebook before the sync starts, which then requires me to wait several minutes before I can read my note that I wrote last night on a different device.&nbsp;
 Bear in mind that onenote has been running in the background all day and did not feel the need to sync it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if you think that this is acceptable behavior, but I can assure you that it isn't.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>GNU/Linux - Ubuntu allows users to insert characters with multiple diacritics by depressing two deadkeys one after the other, no matter which way, before depressing the character key.&nbsp; One example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&lt;CIRCUMFLEX&gt; &lt;GRAVE&gt; &lt;e&gt; displays [ề], which is U+1EC1</p>
<p>
</p><p>&lt;GRAVE&gt; &lt;CIRCUMFLEX&gt; &lt;e&gt; displays [ề], which is the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows does not allow users to insert these characters unless by entering their Unicode, or by searching and clicking in Windows Charmap or Microsoft Office dialog, or by similar ways that are but useless and counterproductive complications when repeated
 all day long.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Users who wish to achieve enhancement by creating completed keyboard layouts (MSKLC), must use unusual ways to add Unicode characters with more than one diacritic.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Being a Unicode Consortium Member, Microsoft must implement on Windows 10, a new keyboard standard including multiple deadkey use and an option allowing users to get AltGr to be no longer a shortcut of Ctrl+Alt (see another post*).</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no longer to wait, since other operating systems have done this job long before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 must include as a standard tool, a new MSKLC version, supporting multiple deadkeys and more-than-four-digit Unicodes, in order to enable Windows users to create keyboard layouts containing even latest Unicode characters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft is in debt by not supporting languages that use multiple diacritics, unless combining diacritics are used.&nbsp; To avoid the problems going along, Unicode has encoded complete characters.&nbsp; These characters must be normally available on word processor
 keyboards, that is, on Windows keyboards, not only in desktop publishing solutions (if ever).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be so kind to submit this post with internal ways to the attention of Microsoft Windows 10 Development Leading Manager.&nbsp; Microsoft is asked to perform some essential enhancements that would be easy to implement.&nbsp; Lack of these features and some other
 induces enormous time waste among users, and financial issues are involved on corporate level.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you for advice.&nbsp; Unfortunately I do not&nbsp;have two or three computers.&nbsp; So I never will try Windows 10 technical preview.&nbsp; Please note this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Remember, trying out an early build like this can be risky. That's why we recommend that you don't install the preview on your primary home or business PC. Unexpected PC crashes could damage or even delete your files, so you should back up everything.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 [...]</p>
</li><li>
<p>After you install <span>Windows&nbsp;Technical&nbsp;Preview</span>, you won’t be able to use the recovery partition on your PC to go back to your previous version of Windows.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/preview-iso</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would you please ask Microsoft for a way to post enhancement suggestions simply?&nbsp; I believe Microsoft should be eager to get all sort of feedback.&nbsp; I have got over one thousand five hundred paragraphs of Microsoft desiderata, among which surely hundreds
 about Windows.&nbsp; Why should I have to buy a new computer to send them to Microsoft?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further, I note that almost all Microsoft Forum Support Engineers or Volunteers do not have any way to send suggestions to Microsoft.&nbsp; There is no doubt they are best informed about users preferences and desiderata.&nbsp; Thanks to Microsoft Forums, I have learned
 a lot, and I will be glad to keep posting.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>But I ask Microsoft to keep listening to its users!&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Forum posts like this one, must be </strong><strong>forwarded straight to
<br />
Microsoft Windows Development Manager.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Marcel Schneider</p>

<p>Instead of or in addition to the Shift-Lock - levels implement levels for the Scroll and or Num-lock keys!!!</p>
<p>(Reason-1: The Shift-Lock-key can be activated accidentally too easily and touch-typing a phrase in a different char-set before seeing the accident has copst me precious minutes!)</p>

            <p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your follow-up.</p>
<p>As I learned them in the meantime, here are the short answers. (Quotations are bracketed with « ».)</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>The real issue is to generate multiple code units by dead key. On Windows—as opposed to Mac OS X (XML layout definitions, as in CLDR) and Linux (XKB)—this feature is not available.</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>The Windows keyboard APIs stay frozen since the middle of the 1990ies. Any changes would face «significant, perhaps insurmountable headwinds.» The upside is full backwards compatibility with Windows 10 through Windows 2000.</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Many people are reported considering dead keys as «confusing,» and the dead key feature is meant to be available for backcompat only, «not for new layouts.» Having said that, I admit that dead keys stay thriving, and many users are asking for MSKLC to support
 chained dead keys.</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>For the next MSKLC version (1.5), Microsoft has the specifications written up by its author, Michael Kaplan, but «no resources» to do the job.</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>The MSKLC is proprietary software with no source code publicly available. Sadly you arenʼt allowed to fork it. Otherwise Michael Kaplan would have done this a long time ago, as he was eager to update (and debug) it again.<br />
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>The most performative solution is to use the cross-platform keyboarding software Keyman. Its publisher Tavultesoft is a Microsoft Partner. Beyond supporting dead-key-generated sequences, Keyman allows to enhance user experience in ways that no current OS
 of any brand does provide natively.</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>When sticking with the Windows keyboarding resources is required, the most efficient way to make the most of them is to use the “Keyboard Table Generation Tool (Unicode)” (KbdUTool.exe) included in MSKLC, as Michael Kaplan shows on his blog “Sorting it all out 2”
 (siao2.com redirected to the archive).<br />
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Iʼve learned that many people do hate the Shift Lock or Caps Lock toggle key. But it seems very important and useful to me, so I donʼt remap it. Hitting it accidentally happens to me too, but I keep activated the on-screen notification feature provided
 by my manufacturer Asustek. MS Office includes a feature that turns ShiftLock/CapsLock off when the user starts typing a lowercase letter followed by a capital, and swaps the case.</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Windows provides one additional toggle: Kana Lock (VK_KANA). But I suggest not to place it on either the Scroll Lock or Num Lock keys, but rather on key E00 (ISO/IEC 9995) above Tab.<br />
</li></ul>
<p>Further I suggest using KBDKANA instead of AltGr; the Ctrl+Alt levels on peripheric keys only; and the two Oyayubi modifiers (one added to each toggle) for additional script support; as well as the KBDGRPSELTAP group selector (that Iʼve placed on key B00
 for an extended numpad emulation). Above all Iʼve implemented chained dead keys, including a Compose key emulation (see the related KbdEdit help page). Additional customisations may be performed using the “Scan Code Mapper for Keyboards.”*<br />
<br />
Iʼm now finishing an enhanced French keyboard layout produced using KbdUTool, Excel, and Notepad++, while the installers are generated by MSKLC. When itʼs debugged and correctly documented, it is available for free at dispoclavier.com. After this I have some
 other urgent jobs and then Iʼd like to come back here and post more in this thread.<br />
<br />
I hope that answers your questions. If you have any more, Iʼll be glad to keep replying.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
Marcel<br />

<h2>            How to disable popup, &#38;quot&#59;Data charges may apply. Continue&#63;&#38;quot&#59;</h2>
                    
<p>I've got a Nokia 6350 on AT&amp;T.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've downloaded a few 3rd party (non-Ovi, non-ATT) apps that access the internet. &nbsp;I have unlimited data, so I'm fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, these 3rd party apps are unusable. &nbsp;I get a popup every 5 to 10 seconds. &nbsp;It says:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>You are accessing the network. &nbsp;Data charges may apply. &nbsp;Continue?</em></p>
<p><em>This application is not from a trusted supplier.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have contacted AT&amp;T and been transferred to 2nd level technical support. &nbsp;They were unable to find a solution and explained that I needed to contact Nokia support.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that it may have something to do with certificates. &nbsp;However, I don't experience this sort of thing when browsing the web in general.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An example application that has this problem is Google Maps. &nbsp;I've noticed that there is no certificate included with this app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ideas?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>I tried turning off Service Messages as suggested.&nbsp; It did not affect this popup.</p>

<p>The thing is, that your 6350 is AT&amp;T branded. The firmware is specially designed for AT&amp;T. "They were unable to find a solution and explained that I needed to contact Nokia support" is an easy way to get rid of you. All they want is you to buy a new device.
 You can always contact Nokia, but I think they will send you straight back to AT&amp;T.&nbsp; I don't think there's much you can do about this pop-up, but next time you contact AT&amp;T, ask for a supervisor.</p>

    <title>Inbox and Sweep Rules Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richmny  say:</h3>
<h2>            Inbox and Sweep Rules Issue</h2>
                    <p>With the recent update to Outlook.com I have had difficulty setting up rules for messages which
<em>include </em>certain words in the Subject. &nbsp;My understanding is that the condition will be satisfied if all of the words are present somewhere in the text of the subject line. &nbsp;However, these types of rules, which worked fine before the update, do not work
 anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way I can get a rule like this to work is to match an exact phrase within the subject text or the subject text in its entirety, which is not always possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, I have a number of rules to pin and categorize incoming messages that are eBills so that I will not overlook them. &nbsp;In particular, I've been having difficulty getting the rule to work for my American Express credit card statement which has the
 following text in the subject line for the latest bill.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>Important Notice: Your December 2016 Statement</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>Clearly I cannot match the subject line exactly because the month and year are variables that will change each month.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I initially setup a rule where the subject includes the words&nbsp;<em><strong>Important Your Statement</strong></em> to generalize it, however this does not work. &nbsp;The only way I can get this rule to work is to use an exact phrase within the subject such
 as '<em><strong>Important Notice:</strong>'.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking for some insights from the community on this issue I'm having.<br />
</p>

            <p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your suggestion, I tried it and it does work, but only because it matched one of the phrases in the list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Coded the way you suggested, this rule generates the following condition:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>and the message includes specific words in the subject 'Statement' or 'Your' or 'Important'</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not what I want, I only want the condition to be met if the subject contains
<em>all </em>of those keywords.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The way you are supposed to achieve that is to code those keywords on one line so that the condition will only be met if the subject contains
<em>Statement </em>AND <em>Your </em>AND <em>Important</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what is not working in the updated Outlook.com</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<p>

            It would be an office problem since win 10 has nothing to do with Office tools. Make sure
<strong>not </strong>to use the Mail App for Office's Outlook. It needs to be used on the Desktop. The mail app is better used for imap mail like Hotmail, Yahoo, Gmail etc.

            Hi and thanks for your reply.&nbsp; I went into Control Panel; Programs; Office and did a Repair of the Office 2013 Programs.&nbsp; Upon doing such the "greyed out" area of the Repair within the Scanpst.exe became normal print and I am now capable of Repairing.&nbsp;
 However, the repairs never repairs the problems.&nbsp; After running the Repair, and I again analyze the same files, errors again are found, and the repairs never do repair all.

            <p>Are you stating that I should continuously keep running and repairing the data files until they are all repaired?&nbsp; When I was using Office 2010, I didn't have to do that..</p>
