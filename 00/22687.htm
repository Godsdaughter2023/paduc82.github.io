<h2>            Excel 2016 -Locking Cells</h2>
                    I cannot lock individual cells in Microsoft Excel 2016.&nbsp; OP System is Windows 10.&nbsp; Do I have attributes that need to be reset?&nbsp; Is my process incorrect?&nbsp; I have difficulty understanding why the cells are initially set to Lock and you can enter data and
 calculate results.&nbsp; Then you have to unlock the cells/page and go through a series of manipulations to lock the cells.&nbsp; Is there a reasonable process that someone could explain?

            <p>By default, <strong>all </strong>cells in an Excel worksheet are locked, but this only becomes effective when the worksheet is protected. As long as the worksheet is unprotected, it doesn't matter whether the cells are locked or unlocked.</p>
<p>The procedure is as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 1: unlock cells</p>
<ul>
<li>While the worksheet is still unlocked, select the cells that the user should be able to edit. You can use Ctrl to select non-adjacent ranges if necessary.</li><li>Press <strong>Ctrl+1</strong> to activate the <strong>Format Cells </strong>dialog.</li><li>Activate the <strong>Protection</strong> tab.</li><li>Clear the <strong>Locked</strong> check box.</li><li>Click OK.</li></ul>
<p>Step 2: protect worksheet</p>
<ul>
<li>Activate the <strong>Review </strong>tab of the ribbon.</li><li>Click <strong>Protect Sheet</strong>.</li><li>You can tick/clear check boxes to specify what the user should be able to do.</li><li>At the very least, leave the check box <strong>Select unlocked cells </strong>
ticked; otherwise the user won't be able to select the cells you specified in Step 1.</li><li>If you want to protect the worksheet with a password, enter it in the box. <em>
Do not forget this password </em>- you will need it if you ever want to unprotect the sheet to change its design.</li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong>. If you specified a password, you will have to enter it again as confirmation.</li></ul>

            <p>Yes, after installing update KB2909921, my Yahoo! Homepage would NOT load. I spent several hours, trying to figure out the problem (I'm not a techie), before I stumbled upon the update...I happened to see it, in parenthses, in my About Internet Explorer
 (under Help, in the toobar).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled it, and Yahoo! Homepage loaded beautifully! I hope Microsoft techies read these forum articles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck! I'm still trying to figure out what to do with the update, as it continues to be offered in my new updates window.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, in the Updates Window, in the Choose How Windows can install updates area, select Check for updates but let me choose whether to download and install them. Then, each time updates are offered, you can install them one-by-one...then, if you have
 problems, you know which one caused the problem(s), and you can immediately uninstall it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>

<p>Answers to 5-20-14 inquiries:</p>
<p>1. I chose to intentionally install MSE</p>
<p>
</p><p>2b&amp;c</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">Antimalware Client Version: 4.5.216.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>3. McAfee as stated before.<span>&nbsp; </span>I have the complete info in a word 2007 document Looks like I may have downloaded MSE before uninstalling McAfee but I can't really tell.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The MSE client folder was created at 8:04 PM 7/29/12, but the McAfee notes I have show 10:19PM on the same day.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It could be that I started to install <span>&nbsp;</span>MSE and was directed to uninstall McAfee before continuing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. No</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. See #3.<span>&nbsp; </span>We are talking about two years ago.<span>&nbsp; </span>I do not remember the sequence of events in this questions.<span>&nbsp;
</span>However, there has been no other anti-virus application installed before Windows updates
</p>
<p>The service tag on my computer lists a manufacture date of 20120613.<span>&nbsp; </span>
Updates listed in the installed updates with a date of 6/15/2012.<span>&nbsp; </span>Security update KB2621440 is date4d 7/29/2012 (when I believe i first brought up the computer after purchase).<span>&nbsp;
</span>These are obviously before the advent of IE 11.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>
</p><p>6. I was running IE 10 prior to the installation of ie11 on 12/15/13. Version unknown</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. I don't believe that I have ever installed "all IE11" updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>
As I said before, when install an update to IE 11&nbsp;I have encountered a problem and had to uninstall them. My options are as follows and No I have not tried disabling those items.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried and removed "my problem sties" from compatibility view.<span>&nbsp; It had no effect except in some cases not letting me see the sites.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am quite frustrated at this point in time.<span>&nbsp; </span>I am currently running IE 11
<span>&nbsp;</span>- version KB2841134 and it is not great.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Your note says that I should not be connected to the internet or any local networks.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Are you telling me that I should switch browsers??</p>

<p>A1. No, IE11 RTM wouldn't be "great" with the McAfee "leftovers" still present - and the fact&nbsp;that&nbsp;Microsoft Security Essentials&nbsp;may not be&nbsp;installed or working properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A2. The <em>computer </em>is missing numerous, critical security updates. The <em>
computer </em>should not be connected to the internet in it's curreent state, no matter what browser you're using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>
</p><p>Roll up your sleeves &amp; try running the following multi-step fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ACTIONS</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>[You will want to print these instructions for offline reference. IMPORTANT =&gt; DON'T SKIP ANY STEP &amp; perform all Steps in one, uninterrupted session! If a Step says to reboot,
<em>reboot!</em>]</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>1a. Right-click on the following link, select SAVE TARGET AS... &amp; download the Norton Removal Tool, saving it to your desktop:
<p>
</p><p>1b. Right-click on the following link, select SAVE TARGET AS... &amp; download the McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool, saving it to your desktop, too:
<a href="http://download.mcafee.com/products/licensed/cust_support_patches/MCPR.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>2. Close all open applications (i.e., anything with an icon on the taskbar).</p>
<p>
</p><p>3a. Right-click on the file you saved in Step #1a above and select <strong>Run as Administrator
</strong>to run the Norton utility. Don't TOUCH your keyboard until the run completes, then reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3b. Right-click on the file you saved in Step #1b above and select <strong>Run as Administrator</strong> to run the McAfee utility. Don't TOUCH your keyboard until the run completes, then reboot again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Download/run the appropriate scripts from the following Trusted Source (my colleague IE MVP Kai Schätzl):
<a href="http://iefaq.info/index.php?action=artikel&amp;cat=42&amp;id=133&amp;artlang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Note =&gt; The scripts are good for IE9, IE10 &amp; IE11, too!</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Tip: The file named <strong>ie8-rereg.all.zip</strong> contains both of the scripts below (plus a third one you will NOT use).</p>
<p>
</p><p>5a. Close all open applications (i.e., anything with an icon on the taskbar) then double-click on the file named
<strong>ie8-rereg.<em>32on64</em>.cmd</strong> to run the script.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5b. Close all open applications (i.e., anything with an icon on the taskbar) then double-click on the file named
<strong>ie8-rereg.<em>64on64</em>.cmd</strong> to run that script <em>then reboot.</em></p>

<em>and then AGGRESSIVE modes</em>. [3]</p>
<p>
</p><p>10. Reboot one last time then run a manual check for updates &amp; install any/all security updates offered (e.g., KB2929437; KB2953522; KB2964444); follow all prompts.</p>

            Hi! Have you tried rebooting your phone? To isolate the issue, can you connect other devices to your Lumia 635 or to your M620 without any issue? You may try clearing the list of paired devices and try pairing again. We'll wait for your reply. ^___^

<p>Whilst 2007 is compatible it went out of support Nov 2017 and at that point MS removed the Office backup download.</p>
<p>2003 is not fully compatible with Win10, and there are no MS download links.</p>
<p>If you had previously purchased 2007 you should have the install media, cd, and its key, or if a digital download the installation file.</p>

<h3> richmny  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Security Essentials Scheduled Scan Never Runs</h2>
                    
<p>I recently installed Microsoft Security Essentials Version 1.0.1611.0 and have not been able to get a scheduled scan to run.&nbsp; I scheduled a weekly scan with all the default options on the settings tabs, but the scan never runs, even after my PC has been
 left idle for long periods of time.&nbsp; The only observation I have noted is that the task created by the program in Task Scheduler shows a status of Queued when the time and idle conditions have been met.</p>
<p>It seems to be related to the idle constraint on the conditions tab in Task Scheduler, with this condition unchecked the task does run as expected.<br />
<br />
OS Version:&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows 7 RC</p>

            In response to Jeff Toole, I was referring to scheduled tasks in general, in some cases I would not want a scheduled task to be missed and would want it to run the next time the computer starts.&nbsp; In the case of the scan, I have to agree that I would not
 like that behavior for it.&nbsp; In any case, thanks for the info regarding the registry setting to do that, it's good to know for future reference.<br />
<br />
I did try what you suggested regarding setting up my own job in task scheduler with an idle condition with the Disk Cleanup program.&nbsp; The task ran but unsuccessfully with the following result:<br />
<br />
<strong><a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itprogeneral/thread/2216239e-9ad2-4b93-be6e-be85cd458c5e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">The Task Scheduler service has asked the task to run. (0x41325)</a><br />
</strong><br />
I posted this problem in the Windows 7 Misc forum, click the above link to view it.&nbsp; The task does run successfully if I run it manually or remove the idle condition.&nbsp; This task didn't exhibit the behavior of being queued indefinitely as with MSE, but has a
 different problem with the idle condition, I don't know what that return code means.<br />
<br />
I tried the same test with Notepad, as you suggested and got the same result as I did with Disk Cleanup.&nbsp; There now seems to be a problem with scheduled tasks that use the idle condition.

<p><span>There is an option to enable exactly what you have described.&nbsp; It has been turned off by default because most people do not like that behavior (they start their computer and have
 to wait 20-30 minutes to use it because we are scanning).&nbsp; If you want to enable it, you can edit the registry:<br />
<br />
Key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Microsoft Antimalware\Scan<br />
Value Name: DisableCatchupQuickScan<br />
Value Type: DWORD<br />
Value: 0<br />
<br />
Key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Microsoft Antimalware\Scan<br />
Value Name: DisableCatchupFullScan<br />
Value Type: DWORD<br />
Value: 0<br />
<br />
You may need to take control of the Microsoft Antimalware Key in order to add these values.&nbsp; There is always some risk when you make changes to the registry. &nbsp;You can back-up your registry before making these changes to mitigate some of that risk.<br />
<br />
As to your last question, I don't see any reports regarding the idle mechanism in our database, but we don't own that functionality so any reports would probably be in another database.&nbsp; You can create your own task in the task scheduler, set it to only run
 on idle, and have it launch a program that you don't normally use (lik enotepad, solitare, or calculator).&nbsp; Use your computer&nbsp;as you would normally, and see if the program ever gets launched.</span></p>

    <title>Receiving unexplained emails from own account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> imogensemail  say:</h3>
<h2>            Receiving unexplained emails from own account</h2>
                    For the second time in around a month, I've received an email which says it's from my own account (it shows up just as something I've knowingly sent myself does). The title is '8/26/2013 4:35:38 AM Document' (the previous similar email just had a different
 date/time); I've never sent myself an email with that subject. I've not opened this one as I'm concerned about where it's come from, and am determined to find out what it is before I open it. I opened the previous one (somewhat absent-mindedly) - it was a
 blank message with an attachment, which I didn't download or open, but I could see from the little preview image it's nothing like any documents of mine. I've not experienced any other hacking-like issues, no-one else has received unexplained emails from my
 account, this is the only unusual thing that's happened, but I want to know what's going on largely for peace of mind. Any explanations welcome!

            Is there any phone number or email address I can contact microsoft support on? I've looked at the general page for hacking which you link to but for genuine peace of mind I want to be able to talk to someone about my specific situation (as I said, there've
 been no other signs of hacking, it's just odd emails sent to my account seemingly from my account) and get specific answers back, rather than the general help pages. Haven't been able to find any way to contact microsoft support directly, would really appreciate
 it if anyone can help me out with info.<br />

<h2>            Picture messages</h2>
                    When I first bought my Nokia (Nokia lumia 520) i was able to receive picture messages fine but now suddenly it won't let me open/view and I keep getting sent the messages without the people actually sending them. Is there any way I can fix this?

            Couple of things to check for MMS to work correctly, make sure you have an active mobile data connection (3 G or 4 G). And also make sure the date and time are set correctly on the phone.<br />
<br />
If the problem persists you can try a soft reset by holding the volume down and power buttons together until the phone vibrates and restarts.<br />
You should also check that you have the latest system application updates. The easiest way to do this is by installing an application from the store such as Sysapp pusher.

    <title>How do I file a complaint to Microsoft about service received on my - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bachpirate  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I file a complaint to Microsoft about service received on my Microsoft 2 Band&#63;</h2>
                    I am really really disappointed in the service I have received from Microsoft on my Microsoft 2 band. I have been a loyal Microsoft customer for a very long time. I have owned every Xbox console, pay for box live, use Microsoft's operating system, had
 a Microsoft band 1 (which also broke), and even owned a Microsoft phone! I was very excited about the Microsoft Band 2 but after normal wear and tear the rubber on the band had broken. I sent it in to Microsoft under warranty with a picture and they stated
 it would be covered. I also sent my charger for my band per their instructions. I received no confirmation it had been received or any communication on the process until one day a package showed up from Microsoft. I was so pumped to finally have my band back
 but my excitement did not last long. I opened the package and my slightly broken but still operating Microsoft band was now almost completely detached and no longer turned on. On top of that they didn't send back my charger that they had requested I send.....
 I have no idea how to even go about complaining about this issue but really want their customer service to know they are going to lose a long time loyal customer over this. My band tore while I was sleeping and from these forums has been a common problem.
 I attached pictures of what the band looked like when I sent it in and what the band looked like when I got it back from Microsoft. The most infuriating part is that I bought it off Amazon. With the initial damage Amazon would have replaced it but after sending
 it in to Microsoft they destroyed it and sent it back to me in way worse shape then I sent it. What do I do to help make this right????<br />
<br />
What I got back from Microsoft!!!<br />

<h2>            adjust cell to text size</h2>
                    
<p><span>I have tried everything I know to try and adjust a cell to show the text inputted, but differently to usual I cannot seem to do this no matter what I try.&nbsp;
 I have formatted the cell to wrap text and tried adjusted the row height to automatic and done this manually, but it always stops showing the text in the same place.&nbsp; The text is displayed correctly in the formula bar but not in the worksheet itself.&nbsp; I have
 also tried to place the text within different alignments within the cell but again with no luck.&nbsp; The worksheet is not locked to stop me from making any changes, as far as I can see.&nbsp; Any ideas would be gratefully received!</span></p>

<p>First, Excel displays only approximately 1024 characters in a cell.&nbsp;&nbsp; The only way to overcome this is to put in hard returns (alt+Enter) in your text and possibly reduce the font size.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have less than approximately&nbsp;1024 characters, then</p>
<p>Make the row height and column width larger than you want/need&nbsp; (note that row height is limited to 409)</p>
<p>then go to format and select row and then column (or vice versa) and tell it to autofit.&nbsp; or use the divider at the column/row border (where the cursor goes into a two headed arrow divided by a vertical line) and double click.</p>

If you have wrapped the text and it is still not showing up in the cell, it may be that the row size is not expanded enough to show all of the text. Place the mouse in the row heading area and when you see the cross between the rows either double click it or
 move it down to expand the row.</td>

    <title>Desktop app only&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> osakawebbie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Desktop app only&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I prefer the "Skype for Windows" or "Skype for Desktop" or whatever the thing is called that
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">isn't</span> Skype UWP. So I made sure to have a shortcut pinned to the Start area for the Desktop app so that I open it without getting confused. And I have the Desktop app start at bootup - I immediately close the window,
 but the icon stays in the status tray, so I know it's running back there somewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But when I answer a call, sometimes I end up in the UWP app - I'm not sure if the incoming call popups for both versions are appearing and I'm clicking on the wrong one, or if it's random as to which popup appears, or what.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I have no desire to use the UWP one, just now I decided to try logging out of it so that it would not know who I am. But that had another mysterious effect: The icon in the status tray, which I thought was generated by the Desktop app, disappeared!
 Skype Desktop still runs and considers me logged in, but there is no icon in the tray (even when the window is open!), so I assume I'll have no visible way of knowing that I've missed a call or received a chat message. Does anyone know what's going on with
 that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And at the moment, the Desktop app is having trouble updating. UWP is on version 8.46.0.60, but Desktop is only on 8.36.0.52. In Settings -&gt; Help &amp; Feedback, under the version number it says "Update failed" with a "Retry" button, but retrying does not help.
 [In case it matters, I'm on Win10 v. 1803 (I'm not sure why my PC never got 1809 or 1903, but it runs okay, so I'm not eager to rock the boat).]</p>
<p>
</p><p>In short, what I want is to use only the Desktop app, keep it reasonably updated, have an icon in the status tray that will show an indicator of a missed call, and not have UWP popping up when I don't ask for it. Can someone help me get to that point?</p>

                    <p>I have a user who is running Windows 7 Enterprise, 32 bit, and using Outlook 2007 Client.&nbsp; Lately he is receiving an intermittent message when closing Outlook, do you want to save changes, Yes, No, Cancel.&nbsp; We are trying to determine the source, but have
 not had any success. We checked the blocked sender list, Adobe Add-In, attachments, delegates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any other ideas we could check?</p>

            <p>He does use the Adobe addin to create pdf's from emails and the archiving feature as well. All the other add ins are disabled but this - and the only reason I didn't disable this is because, like I said, is because he uses it from Outlook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there is any other way to get the same functionality by disabling this, I will give it a try. I called Adobe support and the tech told me there was no other way to create a pdf or use the archiving feature within Outlook with the add-in disabled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have also removed Office 2007 and reinstalled it and also removed and reinstalled Adobe X Pro.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another thing I want to add is he does have delegates. The one delegate has Editor functionality for his calendar, contacts and inbox. She does accept invites and adds contacts to his mailbox from her Outlook client. She is also on Outlook 2007. She works
 in online mode and he works in cached.&nbsp; I went as far as to have her add contacts, accept invites from her client through his inbox and have not been able to recreate the message. He also uses the block sender feature - that is why he is in cached mode and
 not in online.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am kind of at a loss right now. :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I welcome any comment, suggestion, etc. He is a VIP, and kind of frustrated right now as you can appreciate. I have asked his admin for anything he may have been working on prior to closing Outlook and receiving the message.&nbsp;

            I don't think the delegate is causing this.&nbsp; What is the exact message? If it refers to the email template, I'm pretty sure it's Acrobat.

            <p>The message is do you want to save changes, Yes, No, Cancel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It doesn't matter which option he clicks, he will get it again at some point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have not been present to see if he is opening an attachment, adding someone to blocked sender list, etc.&nbsp; The message is there when he closes Outlook. You don't see it until he closes it. It does not appear after an action - if it does, like I said, you
 won't see it until you close all the Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is very frustrating, because there are days it isn't there and I am not sure if he has other applications open or not. I have asked for specific actions, etc, but to no avail.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I agree, I do not believe the delegate is causing it - I have tested with meeting invites, and have not seen it - I have yet to reproduce the message on his laptop.</p>

            <p>Based on that simple message (and the fact that its not coming up every time), it sounds like it could be due to opening attachments from an open email.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is the main Outlook window the only window open when he closes it and gets that message?

            <p>Yes, by the time I am called to go up and close Outlook, that is the only app that is open. I tend to agree with you that he could be opening or closing emails that have attachments.&nbsp; That idea was rejected by the user; that is why I am doing my "due diligence"
 and asking these questions. :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is also the reason why I am asking for more information from the user i.e., opening and closing emails, Word, Excel, Adobe, etc.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If by chance the message is generated by opening and closing attachments through email, what would be the logical "fix" for this? Saving the attachment and then opening it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            if opening the attachment is causing it, it's because he is opening the message, then the attachment, editing the attachment.&nbsp;If he does not want to edit a file and save changes back to the attachment on the message (users love it, admins hate it :)),
 opening the attachment from the reading pane will solve the problem because it will open the attachment as read-only.

<p><span>Hi CHABRA,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
This is a very common question, and the answer is usually one of these two scenarios:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did&nbsp;you&nbsp;install Office from a&nbsp;disc that&nbsp;you purchased?&nbsp; If so, go to Control Panel&gt; Programs&gt; &nbsp;Programs and Features if its Windows vista or Windows 7 operating system&nbsp;,if it’s a Windows&nbsp;XP operating system you will have to go to Add or Remove programs
 and see if there is another copy of Office installed besides the suite you are trying to install.&nbsp;Some pre-installed Trial Office 2007 suites can conflict with the product key validation process.&nbsp; If you see a duplicate copy of Office installed {(Office 2002/2003
 or Office System 2007(Note: you can see Office system on the very top of the list)} uninstall it and try to run your new Office program again.&nbsp; Chances are your product key will work now.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are using the 25-digit product key that you found on a sticker on the bottom of your laptop or on the back of your desktop, then you are using the wrong key.&nbsp; This key is the product key for the Windows operating system, and NOT for the Office
 Suite.&nbsp; The correct product key for the Office suite will be in one of these locations:<br />
a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Office 2007 box (if you bought Office from a retail store)<br />
b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In an e-mail from the online website where you purchased Office from.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Note: check if you are typing the key correctly, sometimes the letter "B" and the number "8" looks alike.</strong><br />
&nbsp; <br />
Try installing office again.<br />
&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regards,</span></p>
<p><span>Deepa Raj<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Microsoft has a knowledge base article that goes into more detail around the invalid product key scenario.&nbsp; It is located at
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/836178" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/836178</span></a> ,and would be a good place to go if these instructions above do not resolve your issue.</span></p>

<p>hi stevenmckenzie,</p>
<p>generally, there are two ways to check attendees and information about the appointment.</p>
<p>1.in a meeting room which is assigned full access.</p>
<p>(1) import your meeting room mailbox in ‘open another mailbox’ and open it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=f04bf9ed-57fc-4f6d-9307-851c5758d956" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3df04bf9ed-57fc-4f6d-9307-851c5758d956" /></a></p>
<p>(2) when you enter the meeting room mailbox, you can choose calendar and see the item in the calendar.</p>
<p>(3) double-click the item and you can check attendees and information about the appointment.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=a07d790f-705c-4f24-a2c8-a800fa2de68d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3da07d790f-705c-4f24-a2c8-a800fa2de68d" /></a></p>
<p>2. when users accept the meetings, they can open the item on their own calendar to check the attendees as well.</p>
<p>may i know whether you check the attendees and information with my methods above?</p>
<p>if your scenario is different from mine, can you provide more detailed information?<br />
such as screenshots about your scenario?</p>
<p>to upload a screenshot, click <strong>use rich formatting</strong> just under the textbox, then click this icon<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d34eb1e43-b5ee-478f-b2e9-b47c62699afc" />
 to insert images.</p>

<p>hi stevenmckenzie,</p>
<p>thanks for your update.</p>
<p>to do further trouble shooting, please help us collect the information below:<br />
1. do other users who have full access to the room mailbox have the same issue?<br />
2. about “the calendar still doesn't show all the information”, do you mean you still cannot view the attendee or other information when you double click the meeting in room mailbox’s calendar? if yes, please send us a screenshot of it.<br />
3. please do a test to remove your full access to the room mailbox and add it again, then check if you can view the attendees in room mailbox’s calendar as below steps and send the screenshot of the result after below steps via workspace:<br />
a.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj984289(v=exchg.160).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">connect to exchange online using powershell</a><br />
b. run the following cmdlet to remove the full permission to the room mailbox.<br />
<strong>remove-mailboxpermission -identity "mailboxidparameter" -user "username" -accessrights fullaccess</strong>
<br />
c. run the following cmdlet to access full permission to the room mailbox.<br />
<strong>add-mailboxpermission -identity "mailboxidparameter" -user "username" -accessrights fullaccess</strong>
<br />
d. run the cmdlet below to check if you have full access permission to room mailbox.<br />
<strong>get-mailboxpermission –identity “*** Email address is removed for privacy ***” | ft user,accessrights</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=7c224948-8346-4f91-887d-4d5fa35b2630" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d7c224948-8346-4f91-887d-4d5fa35b2630" /></a><br />

<p>Hi TimP4,<br />
<br />
For us to address your concern kindly answer the following questions:<br />
<br />
• Which build and version of Office 2016 are you using?&nbsp;<br />
• For clarification, is Office 2016 a part of an Office 365 subscription? If yes, is it Office 365 for Business?<br />
• Is your computer connected to a domain?<br />
• Did you make any changes before this issue happened?<br />
<br />
In the meantime, you may try <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/create-an-outlook-profile-f544c1ba-3352-4b3b-be0b-8d42a540459d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">creating a new Outlook profile</a></strong> and check if it resolves the
 issue.<br />

<p>I can't find out what build Outlook is on, Word has product ID&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought Office 365 on a valid recurring basis so it should be the latest version of outlook.&nbsp; No it was not Office 365 home or university or whatever - just office 365</p>

<p>Hi, &nbsp; I did set up a new account profile, which is how I found all my archives and records of sent mail had gone.&nbsp; However even the new profile hit the licensing check problem within 2 days so it was deleted and I now have another profile, again without
 any sent mail history. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can Microsoft please check their license records because it looks like my record has been corrupted in some way on the Microsoft License server</p>
