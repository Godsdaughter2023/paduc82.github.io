</p><p>I also cannot find this application after it ran, but would not update <em><strong>MS Word</strong></em> because it needed to be closed first....</p>
<p>It <strong>WAS CLOSED</strong> though, and opening it and closing it again would not work, so I need to reboot, and then run it again, but I cannot find it in FINDER, nor in System Preferences??</p>

            <p>Just thoughts to offer based on a very common misconception...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most likely, Word actually was not <strong><em>Quit</em></strong>. My guess is that you simply may have&nbsp;<strong><em>Closed</em></strong> the
<em>document windows </em>that had been open. Closing windows does not Quit a program. In fact,
<em>Microsoft AutoUpdate </em>does not check for updates automatically unless an Office program is running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the simplest ways to confirm that a program isn't running is to see whether there is a mark beneath its Dock icon. Another is to use
<strong>Command+Tab </strong>to see whether the program is indicated in the popup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of the ways to effectively Quit a program are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click the program's name in the main menu &amp; select the <strong>Quit</strong> command [e.g.,
<strong>Word&gt; Quit Word</strong>]</li><li>Use the equivalent keyboard shortcut: <strong>Command+Q</strong></li><li>Right-Click the program's Dock icon &amp; select the <strong>Quit</strong> command</li><li>Use <strong>ï£¿&gt; Force Quit</strong> to force the program to Quit if necessary</li></ul>

    <title>keep getting kicked out of Office account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> baffledguy  say:</h3>
<h2>            keep getting kicked out of Office account</h2>
                    <p>I have an Office 365 account for work. Multiple times across several months while I am writing an email I get this stupid popup telling me my session has expired and I have to sign out.&nbsp; What kind of software design would kick someone off in the middle of
 actively using it by saying a session has expired? &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have not determined any pattern to it.&nbsp; Every time I re-log in I click on "keep me signed in" (or whatever that choice says).&nbsp; Sometimes if I just click on the "renew" circle near the address box at the top of the screen it will put me back into my email.&nbsp;
 Sometimes not.&nbsp; Either way it is totally annoying when it happens.&nbsp; Is this common?&nbsp; Might there be some way I can prevent it from happening? &nbsp;</p>
&nbsp;As a bit of extra information I almost always am using Edge when this happens.&nbsp;

<h2>            Exchange 2013&#92;O365 Hybrid</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was able to successfully create a hybrid environment with my on prem exchange server&nbsp;2013 to office 365. I migrated a test account from our on prem exchange to office 365. If i send this test account mail from an account thats still on the on prem exchange
 server it works with no problem. If I send it mail from an outside domain it works great as well. Where im running into an issue is sending mail from office 365 to an on prem account. It will not work. It works fine sending from O365 to an outside domain but
 not to a on prem account.&nbsp; The NDR returns with "<span style="color: rgba(128, 128, 128, 1)">Remote Server returned '550 5.4.310 DNS domain does not exist'".&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When I validated the connector in O365 I get the following:&nbsp;
 "450 4.4.317 Cannot connect to remote server [Message=InfoDomainNonexistent]"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

            Hi Thom,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the information in Private Message. I noticed that the SmartHosts in your OutboundConnector is
<em>Exch2013.domain.local</em>. However, Office 365 cannot resolve it to a valid server address since it is a .local domain. In this situation, I suggest you update your SmartHosts with a public domain
<em>Exch2013.domain.com</em> and make sure you have created a correct A record to resolve it. Please let us know your update after the changes.<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />
Alex

    <title>Nokia 5233 Storage Question. You need to know this. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rferreira---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia 5233 Storage Question. You need to know this.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I'm not new to Discussions. PLEASE NOTE BEFORE READING THIS THREAD: I've digged EVERYwhere you can think of, so please have in mind that I come here because I really need to know this, I don't want to double-post anything or start a spam war or something.
 Thank you.<br />
<br />
I was facing problems with my device, Nokia 5233. Sometimes the phone asks for too much time to do a simple task, and I have tried to defragment the memory card to see if it helps, but in the end it made no difference at all.<br />
After that, I was recording a video and it went just fine. The problem happened later on, when I decided to view the video and it was lagging the image. I mean, the image was freezing sometimes but the audio was OK. I recorded another video after that and it
 had the same symptoms. NOTE: THE MEMORY CARD WAS WITH 1GB+ OF STORAGE REMAINING AVAILABLE TO BE USED.<br />
This is about the stock memory card that comes with the cellphone, 2GB storage capacity, Micro SD card.<br />
After I was told that this is a symptom of the memory card, I wonder if this is supposed to happen with the card that comes with the cellphone. I was **bleep** because I REALLY f***ing need those videos and this turned out to be a real nightmare because when
 I tried to back up my data using Nokia's software, I ended up with a corrupted file, it was supposed to be a BACKUP and the software just MOVED my SMS messages from the cellphone to my computer and I now can't move it back to the cellphone. But here, my deal
 is the memory, I changed it to another, higher capacity card, a Kingston Micro SDHC 4GB memory card. And still, I'm facing another issue:<br />
<br />
I want to know what is the REAL extended memory capacity for Nokia 5233<br />
I ask this because after googling about it for a few hours, I've found so many different opinions...First a guy said it's best not to upgrade the amount of memory at all, because of my device's limitation, second I read somewhere else I can upgrade the amount
 of memory up to 8GB and the phone "will still recognize it" and then just when I thought I was done with it, I have talked to Nokia Care on Twitter about it and they said I can be facing 'compatibility issue' with it.<br />
According to his statement, "Unsupported memory cards may just work for small sizes of data, but might give issues wt bigger amounts, depending on the mmc".<br />
<br />
That explains the issue with my cellphone's default video recorder/player. But then, again, Is that supposed to happen with a stock memory card?! I guess it's NOT, is it?<br />
AND THEN, AGAIN, NOTE: THE MEMORY CARD WAS WITH 1GB+ OF STORAGE REMAINING AVAILABLE TO BE USED.<br />
So, AFTER recording a 71MB video file, I was viewing it again, kinda hoping it was happening again because this time, it is a 4GB of memory.<br />
<br />
I now decided to dig a little bit using Wikipedia, and then I found what I was afraid of:<br />
"Devices that use SD cards identify the card by requesting a 128-bit identification string from the card. For standard-capacity SD cards, 12 of the bits are used to identify the number of memory clusters (ranging from 1 to 4,096) and 3 of the bits are used
 to identify the number of blocks per cluster (which decode to 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, or 512 blocks per cluster).</p>
<p>In older 1.x implementations the standard capacity block was exactly 512 bytes. This gives 4,096 Ã 512 Ã 512 = 1
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
gigabyte</a> of storage memory. A later revision of the 1.x standard allowed a 4-bit field to indicate 1,024 or 2,048 bytes per block instead, theoretically yielding up to 4 gigabytes of memory storage. However the specification specifies 2 gigabytes as the
 maximum capacity.</p>
<p>Host devices designed before this change may incorrectly identify such cards, usually by misidentifying a card with less capacity than is the case by assuming 512 bytes per block rather than 1,024 or 2,048.</p>
<p>For the new SDHC (2.0) implementation, 32 bits of the identification string are used to indicate the memory size in increments of 512 bytes. The SDCA currently allows only 26 of the 32 bits to be used, giving a maximum size of 32&nbsp;GB. All SD cards with a
 capacity larger than 4&nbsp;GB must use the 2.0 implementation at minimum. Two bits that were formerly reserved and fixed at 0, now called the "CSD Structure", are being used for identifying the type of card, 0 is standard capacity; 1 is high (SDHC) and extended
 (SDXC) capacity; 2 and 3 are reserved. Older host devices are not aware of this new field thus cannot correctly identify SDHC or SDXC cards."</p>
<p>Source: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_sd_hc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_sd_hc</a></p>
<p>So in other words, it can be that my device does not recognize my Kingston SDHC 4GB Micro DS Card correctly. Oh I mean the STOCK, 2GB Micro SD card. And POSSIBLY my Kingston SDHC card.<br />
Is that correct?<br />
What is the storage limitation for Nokia 5233?<br />
<br />
Please answer this guys, I hope we can share the knowledge to anyone else who's planning to upgrade the memory for their Symbian-based smartphones.</p>

            I don't mean the card class, I just meant the card type. Nokia is SUPPOSED to work out with majority of the cards out there, specially Symbian devices, so you can take the card off of your previous Symbian-based cellphone and then USE IT on another Symbian-based
 device, regardless if it is SD or SDHC.<br />
<br />
Look, I just want to know these:<br />
What is the storage limitation for Nokia 5233?<br />
Is Nokia 5233 supposed to work with SDHC or not?<br />
Simple as that.<br />

<p>Maximum Memory Card Size: 16 GB</p>

<p>You can find this information here:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>so in short, yes it does support SDHC otherwise it would not be able to handle 16GB cards&nbsp;</p>

<p>And all Nokia cards higher than 4 GB are SDHC cards, so it supports both SD as well as SDHC cards.</p>

                    <p>I tried to send an email to a group.&nbsp; I got an error message in red:&nbsp; "Please use the following format for email addresses: . . ." but I know of no way to look at my group list and see which email is spelled wrong, missing a letter or has any other problem.
 I'm really frustrated since this is an important email.</p>

Did you by chance copy paste the addresses from another program like Office?<br />
<br />
The correct format is *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and can only contain letters and numbers.&nbsp; SPecial characters arent allowed.<br />

            Your missing the point.&nbsp; I understand&nbsp;what a correct format is.&nbsp; The group list has worked before but now it doesn't.&nbsp; Nor does it help me&nbsp;see any way that I can find the emails that don't have the correct format and fix them other than going thru the
 entire list one by one and seeing if that's one of the broken addresses. And like several other changes to Outlook, there was no warning, no method to meet a new standard, and no help at fixing this after the change.&nbsp; I won't stay with Outlook if this can't
 be fixed.

            Thank you very much&nbsp;for&nbsp;your response re this (brand new) occurrence. I wasn't able to view the email again because I've already sent it using a different program than Outlook and can't risk sending it twice to anyone.&nbsp; When I did send it, Outlook didn't
 specify or show me any particular emails, just a list of "~.org" or even "~" sorts of examples.&nbsp; (If it showed me specific emails it would help.)&nbsp;It's clearly a new Outlook feature, and it's very frustrating that Outlook also used to have multiple ways of
 doing other things they've changed without warning or ways to cope with the result.&nbsp; I used to be able to bring up a specific person&nbsp;with their&nbsp;info, and have an option to sign them up for&nbsp;two or three or five groups at once.&nbsp; I'd made it 3/4 the way through
 my list of contacts doing so&nbsp;when that option was dropped.&nbsp; Now I have to open each of the groups, bring up and add that person, then close the group, bring up a different group and add the person -- which takes ten times as long (no exaggeration), and doesn't
 allow me to easily think about that person, weigh which groups they should be in and just&nbsp;uncheck them from one or two groups&nbsp;if I change my mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Again, both of these changes were&nbsp;made by Outlook&nbsp;without warning, or suggestion of a way to deal with the impact of the change.&nbsp;You also can't check&nbsp;the email of any group member by hovering over the their picture/name in the list (in pairs) of members of
 a group, or move from a group to any other list of info&nbsp;without leaving the group, to cite&nbsp;another&nbsp;function that would help. The whole process of groups has been screwed up -- probably by a well-meaning tech person -- and needs some actual users to have input
 on the various ways&nbsp;they have&nbsp;actually used it previously/need to use it.&nbsp; I've mentioned a few.&nbsp; I hope the above&nbsp;is clear enough to for you to provide some help for me (and if possible, a re-examination of the impact of some changes that have been made and
 the frustrating problems they've created). Thank you very much&nbsp;in advance for your help.

            I am having exactly the same problem ie it will not send out to the group that I have been sending too. It mentions specific email addresses, but they are in the correct format. If I delete them from the group, it then comes up with another email address....and
 another email address that it says is the wrong format but they are in the right format!

<h2>            Hotmail spam&#47;extortion attempt</h2>
                    About every other day for the last two weeks I'm getting an e-mail demanding various amounts of bit-coin, stating that the sender knows my password (not true) and that they'll send copies of my search history for porn sites (doesn't exist) to my mail list.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Can I report this to MSN and how would I do that?&nbsp; The sender name changes every time, also.&nbsp; I mark as junk, but they're relentless.

</p><p>To address this concern, we suggest that you run first the Windows Update troubleshooter provided on this link:

            <p>Did that. It couldn't find the problem. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Update 1/29: </p>
<p>After rebooting, the Windows Update Troubleshooter found that&nbsp;BITS had already started:</p>
<p>"Problem with BITS service : The requested service has already been started. More help is available by typing NET HELPMSG 2182. "</p>
<p>
</p><p>This fixed the problem on three out of the four machines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the remaining machine, the Windows Update Troubleshooter detected that "Service registration is missing or corrupt" and that the action taken was to "Reset service registration."</p>
<p>
</p><p>After boot, is BITS supposed to be running (either automatic or automatic (delayed start)) or not (just set to 'manual')?</p>
<p>Does accessing MSN turn on BITS causing a subsequent Windows Update to fail?</p>

    <title>MSOffice 2013 ribbon bar disappeared - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jimcollinscz  say:</h3>
<h2>            MSOffice 2013 ribbon bar disappeared</h2>
                    <p>I had been using MS Office 2013, purchased under the HUP, for several weeks after installing it on my new laptop and suddenly the ribbon bar and all options except for sign in and a question mark, neither of which work, are shown at the top of any of the
 Office 2013 products.&nbsp; I have to use ALT f4 to close out the programs and keyboard shortcuts to perform any functions.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have researched through many threads but don't see an answer that matches my issue.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have tried many of the "tricks" I have been able to glean from Google and MS threads but to no avail.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm using a Dell Inspiron 14 model 7437 Windows 8.1 and have performed all updates to MS and Adobe products.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks for any guidance provided.</p>
<p><br />

            Try booting the computer, if you have not already done that since the problem started.
<br />
<br />
If you have previously booted, try booting Windows into safe mode:<br />

There are a number of addins that cause undesirable interactions with Office applications.&nbsp; Abbyy Fine Reader is one that has been commonly causing other unexpected errors.&nbsp; Another is a Bluetooth addin.
<br />
<br />
Although your description does not sound exactly like it, maybe you have simply "minimized" the ribbon.&nbsp; You can try using the &lt;CTL&gt;&lt;F1&gt; shortcut to toggle the ribbon min/max display.<br />

<p>Hi Palcouk,</p>
<p>
</p><p>No. However, I used a yahoo email to open Windows 10 and the Microsoft Account. Then I was confused about the differences between Mail, outlook.com, and Office365.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did open Mail, but the email I was using from Yahoo did not seem to work right on the mail account, or the outlook.com... so I deleted it from Mail, and created an outlook email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>AFter that I downloaded Office 365, and the loop thing started with Outlook. It always asked for my microsoft account email, and I use the password that goes with that...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps I may need to re-add my yahoo address and possibly use a special app password? I may need to use a special app password to use for my outlook email too on 365?<br />
</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>I wonder what would happen if I use the desktop mail app setting to delete 365's Outlook, and then re-install it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for so much info, more than you want to know probably.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for anything you think will help me!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Few issues after 24hrs of N8 usage...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) My Screen Saver stopped working... screen stays lit indefinitely, even when locked... after multiple restarts and lots of frustration it came back, but this issue has already happened twice - surely a bug</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) Power-Saving mode doesn't really make sense unless it is customisable... I am on a 3G only network, power-saving enables GSM-only... see the flaw?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I can confirm that rebooting and keeping off any keys after pin code will make screen saver work again. I can only trace it to using side slider at the same time as the screen is about to auto lock after user defined time but it is difficult to replicate.</p>

<p>Yep, just had the problem with Skype locking the phone so had to soft reset and afterwards no clock screen saver. Can confirm though that I got it back by doing a soft reset again (hold down power button for 8 secs) and then not touching the phone until
 screen saver was activated. Thanks for the heads-up.</p>

<p>Regarding ISSUE #1 (the screensaver failure), I have a PERFECT solution!!!</p>
<p>However, I am not sure if this will work for you, because I have SPB Mobile Shell, but it is worth a try!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1) Make sure you have the widget for the <u>MUSIC PLAYER</u> on one of your main operating page.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2) Turn <u>OFF</u> your phone regularly. (<em>NO NEED</em> to hard rest by hold over 8 secs)</strong></p>
<p><strong>3) Turn <u>ON</u> your phone.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4) Once the phone loaded up, immediate <u>play any song</u> through your music player. (Need to be done before your phone auto-locks)</strong></p>
<p><strong>5) <u>Lock your phone</u> with your side-lock button; your screensaver should come back.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both my g/f &amp; I owns a Nokia N8, and we both experienced the screensaver failure problem. My N8 was easy to fix by many people's solution of just simply reset, and it automatically fixed the problem. But My g/f's N8 was stubborn, and wouldn't turn the screensaver
 back on by this simple reset method. Later I discovered the above method, and it worked every time! I think somehow the music player is triggering the screensaver and forces it to stay on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, although we somehow surpass this &nbsp;issue, but Nokia still need to fix this problem. Nokia N8 is a great phone, it shouldn't have such a simple mistake in it. This makes the perfect phone imperfect!!! Anyway, please let me know if this method works for
 you guys, thanks.</p>

<p>Oh man! Your solution deserved to be put into the N8 Hall of Honor! It works and make this phone perfect again.<br />
However, for step 4 playing the song, I found that I need to switch back to Home Screen then go Step 5.<br />
<br />
I do not have SPB Mobile Shell.<br />
<br />
Both me and my wife owns N8 and only hers is facing this problem and soft restore is painful because we customized the N8 quite a bit and reconfiguring is just too cumbersome.<br />
<br />
PS. I actually don't think the real bug is in the screensaver but some low level network access stopping the switching to the low power screen off mode.</p>

<p>lol thank you very much for your comment.</p>
<p>Yeah, you may be right about the low level access issue. But I still think Nokia should fix this problem as soon as possible if they want to compete with iPhone 4G. Especially this is Nokia's most expensive phone! It should not contains this simple issue.</p>

            Which version of Windows are you running?
<br />
<br />If its Windows 10, try the following:
<br />
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Microphone
<br />Toggle on Allow apps to access your Microphone
<br />
<br />Scroll down and make sure Skype is toggled on
<br />
<br />If you are not running Windows 10, click the three dots in Skype
<br />Click Settings
<br />Click Audio &amp; Video
<br />Scroll down and make sure the sliders for your speaker and microphone are increased 
<br />
<br />If that does not work, try uninstall and reinstall Skype to see if it resolves the problem.

<p>Just guessing you mean the wifi password when you are using internet sharing or mobile hotspot</p>
<p>Use the edit icon at the bottom of the internet sharing page or 'edit' at the bottom of the mobile hotspot page</p>

<h2>            N80 date&#47;time reset after update&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    I've upgraded my unbranded N80 to the latest firmware and now everytime I take the battery out it resets the time/date!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
Also when the phone is locked using the lock code I can't access camera which is a bit silly.<br />
<br />
Anyone know why it resets time? It never used to do that?

When the battery is removed there will be no powewr to save the time.<br />
Locking the phone is supposed to stop all keys from working. It is a bit silly for it to only lock a few keys. Besides you could access the gallery that way so the lock would be even more pointless.

Actually it used to save the time before and now it does not.<br />
<br />
Also the lock means I have to type in the code every time I want to take a picture. Which means I have to slide it open and so slide mechanisms gonna get loose!!!!

            I have V4 (01) and upon removing the battery and putting it back in (admittedly for only a short time - 1 min or so) the time and date is saved.<br />
<br />
However, I am sure that for extended periods of time without the battery, the internal back up battery or whatever is in there will drain and hence the time and date will not be saved.<br />
<br />
How long are you taking the battery out for?<br />
<br />
Regarding being unable to access the camera without unlocking the phone, well, yes, that's how it's supposed to be! It would kinda defy the whole point of key lock and you would no doubt get a load pictures of the inside of your pocket, every time you put it
 in there.

            The phone lock is optional - on V3 at least - so if it really bugs you, you could just disable it. Go to<br />
<br />
Tools .. Settings .. Security .. Phone and Sim<br />
<br />
Then set Autolock Period to none.<br />
<br />
If you do that, you're probably going to want to get a 3rd party key locker - if you look in the smart phone section there are lots of suggestions.<br />
<br />
Alternatively of course, you could just change the Autolock Period to a longer period, 5 or 10 minutes maybe. Should give you time to fire off a couple of pictures.

I'm very competent with phones. I simply take out the battery remove the simcard insert another one, and then replace. About 30 sec max.

            Something sounds squiffy there then... you never know what else could be wrong, and you know sods law!!<br />
<br />
Reading elsewhere in the forum, someone else stated that the backup battery should keep time &amp; date for at least 5-15 mins.<br />
<br />
Sounds like a trip to NSC for a diagnosic test or a call to your insurance for a replacement.

Funny thing is that it's the Nokia Software Update that caused this.<br />
<br />
I downloaded it so that I do no have to pay the NSC a visit and now it's backfired!

            From what I have been reading here, there have been a few other reports of this issue.<br />
<br />
I fully agree with you WRT backfiring. What a pain in the backside that you might need to visit NSC to have something rectified that began following update via NSU.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://discussions.europe.nokia.com/discussions/board/message?board.id=smartphones&amp;message.id=5091" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://discussions.europe.nokia.com/discussions/board/message?board.id=smartphones&amp;message.id=5091</a><br />
<br />
This link is on a similar and same issue, where one other user claims that the NSC advised that it's actually a bug within the fimware... if that is true, then why is everyone with V4 not affected?<br />
<br />
Is yours a 58.01 unbranded or an (01), (02) etc unbranded? I have read one person claiming to have<br />
<br />
V 4.0623.0.42<br />
20-09-2006<br />
RM-92<br />
Nokia N80 (58.01)<br />
<br />
Which is newer than the V4.0623.0.41 that the rest of us seem to have. He said he did an FOTA update from V4.0623.0.41. I have (01) and this update is not available for me.

<br />
Is this O2? Or is it sim free??? I doubt that shoudl make a difference as the sim free are same as O2 are they not? (Since O2 do not lock their phone - and mine is the black version)

            I have a black N80 (58.01) that I have updated today. It is generic sim free and was bought from expansys. O2 have never released a black N80, so sounds like yours is generic.<br />
<br />
I have V 4.0623.0.42 firmware. It was 0.41, but on the phone there was an option, so I updated it again.<br />
<br />
I don't have the problems you have been experiencing, maybe you should try the OTA update?<br />

<h2>            Reinstall Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2013</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2013 uninstalled itself from my laptop (Win10), and I can't seem to find a download link (previous threads on here don't have valid hyperlinks anymore).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It started when powerpoint was not responding, after which I ran the troubleshoot. Troubleshoot then stopped, due to:&nbsp;<br />
<span style="color: rgba(4, 142, 176, 1)">Error code 1056-4</span></p>
<p>..after which my whole microsoft office uninstalled. Now I still have the product key, but I cannot seem to find a download link. Any help?<br />
</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

    <title>Outlook 2016 and Hostway hosted exchange - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nachocowboy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 and Hostway hosted exchange</h2>
                    <p>Recently,&nbsp; I replaced two desktops in our organization.&nbsp; Went from Windows 7 to 10. The first one went pretty smooth.&nbsp; I installed the desktop editions of Office 365 on both systems.&nbsp; Initially I had a few problems getting autodiscover to work on the 1st
 system.&nbsp; I did the usual registry hacks and it worked out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 2nd system, however,&nbsp; is being very stubborn.&nbsp; Again, I did the registry tweaks "exclude....https, spc, srv, explicito365endpoint, etc..."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded Priasoft AutoDiscover XML Tool after it still didn't work,&nbsp; and I get a valid, working XML log from it.&nbsp; It sees the autodiscover settings for the hostway exchange server at east.exch129.serverdata.net</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, regardless of what I do,&nbsp; Outlook continues to give me the "something went wrong" error.&nbsp; I've tried different user accounts as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've created a local XML file and associated registry entry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Doesn't make sense.&nbsp; Everything from a connectivity standpoint is functioning and the autodiscover settings on our mx record are correct and point to the right place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It almost seems like outlook is looking for office 365 for some reason.&nbsp; I have 365 only for the desktop software and no email hosting through them.&nbsp; Both computers have their own 365 account login - but again,&nbsp; not for email at all.&nbsp; Just the desktop applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been though Google for about 12 hours today,&nbsp; trying everything. </p>
<p>
</p><p>These computers are pointed to a 2012R2 DC.&nbsp; I changed the DNS setting on the adapter to 8.8.8.8 just to remove any possible issues from the domain controller - same thing...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help??</p>

<br />It almost seems like outlook is looking for office 365 for some reason.  I have 365 only for the desktop software and no email hosting through them.  
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />It is. But if you set ExcludeExplicitO365Endpoint, that should take care of it.
<br />
<br />Did you set that value in both locations and reboot? (all of the values you set should be in both)
<br />HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\office\16.0\outlook\autodiscover
<br />HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\office\16.0\outlook\autodiscover

<br />
<br />You could try a local autodiscover xml - instructions are at <a href="https://www.slipstick.com/outlook/exchange-account-set-up-missing-in-outlook-2016/#autodiscover" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.slipstick.com/outlook/exchange-acco...</a>

<br />If the key doesn't exist, you need to add it - and policy keys never exist.

<br />Ctrl+right click on the outlook icon in the notification tray then click test configuration. Untick the guess smart options and run it - can that find the account? Try it with guesssmart enabled.

            <p>Hi Vijay,</p>
<p>Thank you soooo much for your reply. I have a button on my Outlook ribbon that says work offline. I selected it, and have not been able to get back online for two weeks ! I was drafting a reply and it disappeared after a few minutes... I teach myself how
 to use a computer. This is my 2nd Dell, and I have nobody to show me what I am doing wrong, just the Customer Support people at MS and Dell. I am a Senior Citizen, do not speak computerese, and many of the words I don't understand&nbsp;.&nbsp;I only have a cell phone,
 no landline. It is &lt;Removed PII&gt;. </p>
<p>Re &nbsp;your questions</p>
<p>I. I got the Inspiron in March 2014 , and it came with Win. 8.0. I have been using e-mail since then.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; About a month ago, I downloaded 8.1, and don't think I completed the directions for installing&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I purchased System Mechanic from Iolo and just fought my way through updating their info on my account with them. This is the only new software change I have added. I only have the new Laptop, an HP Officejet wireless, and a router from Fairpoint Communications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I am instructed to toggle the Work Offline button on the ribbon, but nothing happens when I press the button to enable me to go online. , the emails download without pictures and the status bar says&nbsp; all programs&nbsp;are Offline. Like a toggle switch, something
 is either on or off; I cannot Off the" Work Offline" button.&nbsp; I am able to send a message, however it becomes a "Draft" and sits in a separate folder until I select the Send/Receive button. Then synchronized messages come into my Inbox, and the messages in
 the&nbsp; Send/Receive file appear to go out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3&nbsp; I am not using anybody's email for messages, but have a Google mail account where I can receive mail. I go on the web by inputting the web address using IE 12.&nbsp; I rely on my email for paperless bills,
</p>
<p>some of my banking, info to/from Soc. Sec., Maine govt. services, and my Doctors. Thank you.............</p>

    <title>Font in Outlook Office 365 Suddenly Small - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rsford31  say:</h3>
<h2>            Font in Outlook Office 365 Suddenly Small</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Yesterday the font size in Outlook was readable. Today, for whatever reason, it's smaller. I compared the font with my colleague's Outlook. The font is set as the same size as mine but it is visually appearing smaller. This includes the overall look of the
 font and not just in new messages or replies. I checked the zoom level and it's set at 100. It's just bizarre. In addition, the font in my Skype for Business messages have changed. My font is the same size as previous; however, the replies back from users
 I'm conversing with is larger than my font.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas as to how this changed?</p>

<p><span>Hello rsford31,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>From your description, may I confirm whether all text in your Outlook has changed? As you mentioned, your Skype for Businessâs text has changed either, is everyoneâs font bigger than you? Please check if your
 other apps have the same problem. It seems your Windows font has changed. You can select the
<strong>Start</strong> button &gt; <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Ease of Access</strong> &gt;
<strong>Display</strong>. Change the settings under <strong>Make text bigger</strong>.</span></p>
<p>

https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/4028566/windows-10-change-the-size-of-text</a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you tried the above method but your Outlook font still small than usual, you can click
<strong>View</strong> &gt; <strong>View Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Advanced View settings</strong> &gt;
<strong>Reset Current View </strong>and then restart Outlook see if it can help.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the problem persists, please provide us your Outlook version for further checking. See
<strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Office Account</strong>.</span></p>
<p>

                    <p>Hi, not so much a question, but I had a problem today with Office 365 Outlook error 0x8004210A (send/receive error) . This issue appears to be resolved by performing a Shut Down and leaving the machine off for ten minutes, then restarting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There were several things that did not work:</p>
<p>1) Restarting the machine (multiple times, the same error persisted)</p>
<p>2) I was unable to change the port settings (the support instructions literally did not match what was on the screen in front of me);</p>
<p>3) Deleting and then re-creating the email account was not advisable, since per the Microsoft technician this step would have resulted in all of the inbox being deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running Windows 7 Ultimate on an old Lenovo (gasoline-powered, with a pull chain).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have four email addresses coming into Outlook; only the email address for comcast.net could not receive. I spent considerable time on the phone with Comcast (or whoever they are now...) and I am comfortable that Comcast was not the proximate cause. (But
 they might have been. Who knows.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, if you have the problem above, you might wish to simply turn off the machine and then turn it back on after a few minutes.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

<h2>            Office 2013 is not inserting ChemDraw OLE Object from our software</h2>
                    <p>We are inserting ChemDraw as OLE object in MS Word from our software. The following scenarios it is working and for 6th it is not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Office 2010 installed machine - Working</p>
<p>2. Office 2010 + Visual Studio 2013 - Working</p>
<p>3. Office 2016 installed machine - Working</p>
<p>4. Office 2016 + Visual Studio 2013 - Working</p>
<p>5. Office 2013 + Visual Studio 2013 - Working</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)"><strong>6.&nbsp;Office 2013 installed machine - Not Working</strong></span></p>
<p>I mean while installing Office 2010 and 2016 it installing one supporting file, that is missing in 2013. But while installing Visual Studio the same one is coming again and started working. So can you please
 let me know the file/sub installer available in Office 2010, Office 2016 and Visual Studio 2013, and it not available in Office 2013</p>

                    Up until Thursday 4th May when I used emoji's in Hotmail they were in colour. Since Thursday they have only been available in Black and white and poor quality drawings. As usual getting an answer out of Microsoft is like getting blood out of a stone. Can
 anyone give a logical explanation about this change? Thank you

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you delete some friends from Facebook, they will be removed from your Hotmail contacts within 24 hours. You cannot delete Facebook friends from Hotmail without deleting them on Facebook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
