<h2>            PDF documents opening in Word</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having an issue with PDF documents opening in Word. I know this is a so called "feature" however I find it incredibly irritating. When I receive a PDF document in an email or online, it pops up with a screen saying "word will now convert your PDF into
 an editable word document. This may take a while." at the bottom of the message there is no "no" button, just OK, cancel or help. When opening reports or certificates everything is formatted incorrectly and in the wrong place. My question is:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to change the default setting so that PDF documents open in a PDF viewer (Adobe reader for example)? Im sure there is a&nbsp;fantastic&nbsp;hidden benefit in having it in Word, however I am more than happy to stick&nbsp;with PDF documents opening as PDF
 files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thankyou in advance :) </p>

    <title>Mailchimp Email Not Visible on 1 of my Hotmail.com Accounts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> professor0243  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mailchimp Email Not Visible on 1 of my Hotmail.com Accounts</h2>
                    I have two Hotmail accounts.&nbsp; Account A is the main one that I have been using for years.&nbsp; I just established an Account B for testing purposes with Mailchimp.<br />
<br />
Mail from Mailchimp does not go into Account A for me to view even in the Junk Mail folder. I know it is delivered to the account, based on the Mailchimp reports, but I just can't see the emails.<br />
<br />
In Account A, I have gone into the Gear Icon for View all Outlook settings&gt;Mail&gt;Layout&gt;Junk email and cleaned out the Blocked Senders and Domains of all my previous blocked senders or domains (there used to be hundreds of them).&nbsp; I have also cleared the Safe
 Senders and Domains of any addresses and or emails.<br />
<br />
With these changes, I still cannot get Mailchimp emails to Account A even in my Junk Mail Folder.&nbsp; The newly established Account B can easily receive Mailchimp emails. Also my wife's Hotmail Account can receive Mailchimp emails<br />
<br />
Account A is the main email account I use in Hotmail and my Microsoft account login account is tied to this address as well as other Websites that I use for confirmation and recovery purposes.<br />
<br />
I can't figure out why Account A blocks me from seeing my Mailchimp emails when the other accounts have no problems at all.&nbsp; I hope someone has a solution to this problem.&nbsp; I am not sure whether I can safely delete Account A and then immediately add it back
 it.

<h3> gkamieneski  say:</h3>
<h2>            Access Percent Fields, Table vs. Form</h2>
                    <p>I need a field on a form where a user enters a whole 2 digit number that is to be stored in a table as hundredths of a percent. I.e., if the user is asked for the amount, they enter 35 and that gets stored in the table field as .35%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I accomplish this with expressions for events? Right now entering the number 35 in the field on the form, stores 3500.00% in my table field.</p>
<p>

            Aha!&nbsp; You have the text box's Text Format property set to "Rich Text".&nbsp; That never occurred to me, and it makes no sense in this context.&nbsp; Change it to "Plain Text", and it should work.&nbsp; It does for me, in your sample database.

<h2>            Contacts are not loading in &#34;To&#34; when sending emails</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Outlook Will Not Send Email to Contacts<br />
<br />
The&nbsp;<strong>OUTLOOK</strong> switch was forced on me...I did not ask for it.&nbsp; I have spent three days on the Outlook website and so-called "help" center trying to figure out what's wrong to no avail.&nbsp; They don't even provide a phone number or chat line for
 customers to talk to a "live" person.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I had Hotmail, I was able to type the first few letters of the name and a list would appear that gave me a choice of the person I wanted to email.&nbsp; Outlook does not have this feature.&nbsp; If I want to send out 10 emails about the same subject, it won't
 even let you select multiple contacts. The People list does not show the person's email address.&nbsp; I have contacts with more than one email address and need to verify that it's being sent to the right address.&nbsp;&nbsp; As a mattter of fact, the "to" button does not
 work on my Outlook.&nbsp; It does not pull up any contacts at all.&nbsp; When I go to "People" my contacts are there but there is no option to send an email to those contacts.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone have a clue to how this works?&nbsp; Please send a reply as soon as possible because I have important emails to send to multiple contacts with the same subject.&nbsp; If nobody can help me, I'll be switching to another provider even after being a Hotmail
 user for over 12 years,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; Switching to Outlook was the<strong> WORSE</strong> thing that Microsoft could have done without considering its customers!!</p>

            <p>Thanks for your response.&nbsp; I just discovered that you had answered my question.&nbsp; I just posted another question on the forum site today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have IE7 on a Vista Home Premium PC.&nbsp; I've had this browser for 4 years.&nbsp; My technician that installed my PC advised me against IE8 because there were too many problems and told me to keep 7 as long as I could.&nbsp; I've read some reviews of IE 9 and it seems
 to be worse than IE8.&nbsp; The 10 version is not compatible with Vista operating systems.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm waiting for my technician to get with me now but he has had a death in the family and hasn't been able to come yet.&nbsp; I don't want to download any browser without talking to him first since it may damage my computer if it's not compatible.&nbsp; I've tried
 Firefox a couple of times but it seems to run slower than Explorer and I don't understand very well how it operates.&nbsp; I've been so frustrated with this forced email system I've had to go to the public library at times just to send my emails.&nbsp; Their Outllook
 systems are working properly.&nbsp; I don't know what type of browers they have installed but they definitely don't have Vista on their computers.&nbsp; The problem may be that Outlook is not compatible with Vista.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My big problem now is that the contact list has disappeared completely and won't pull up at all.&nbsp; This started 2 days ago.&nbsp; At least in April the contacts were showing but I had to send emails manually by goingn to the People page and copying the email addresses.&nbsp;
 The Outlook program will not let me put in a person's name without giving me an error message.&nbsp; I have over 350 contacts in my address and 8 groups.&nbsp; I hope I haven't lost the information forever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you read my most recent post maybe you can help me figure this one out.</p>

            Hi Norman,<br />
<br />
Seems you refer to the "Recent" tab on the upper left corner of the OneDrive for Business page (https://contoso-my.sharepoint.com).<br />
<br />
If so, there's no ribbon to clear the listed files, but you can choose not to show the Recent file list, you can click the "Files" tab which can list all your files.<br />
<br />
You can also share your valuable feedback via <a href="https://onedrive.uservoice.com/forums/913528" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Uservoice</a>. Many features came directly from our customer's feedback.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<p>Hi Beeblebrox,</p>
<p>The specific error could be caused by several factors. To narrow it down, please perform the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the account reported in the error was used when configuring the ADFS service, you may need to change the service account in the ADFS service.
</li><li>ADFS service requires ‚ÄúLog on as batch‚Äù and ‚ÄúLog on as service‚Äù, please make sure the GPO settings in your organization are not blocking the account from using specific services.
</li></ol>
<p>If the issue persists after you try the steps above, please provide the following information and we will dig the issue further.</p>
<ol>
<li>Which version of ADFS are you using, ADFS 2.0 or ADFS 3.0? </li><li>Do you mean that both the internal and external sign processes are working fine without issues?
</li><li>Perform the ‚ÄúOffice 365 Single Sign-On Test‚Äù via: <a href="https://testconnectivity.microsoft.com/?tabid=o365" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://testconnectivity.microsoft.com/?tabid=o365</a>, then expand&nbsp; the entire test logs and provide them back to us.

<p>we are running adfs 2.0 at the moment. i did forget to mention that i ensured that policy settings for "log on as batch" and "log on as service" were set for the adfs service account. all functionality is working and i did verify with the "sign-on test"
 tool.</p>
<p>however, i believe i found the location of the offending account. but i'd like to get a verified explanation. the account referenced in the error belongs to a terminated windos sysadmin. his account exists but is disabled. this account is not being used
 for any services or in any obvious locations.</p>
<p>being that this error seems to be rooted in the windows internal database, i installed ssms express and connected over the named pipes connection: \\.\pipe\mssql$microsoft##ssee\sql\query</p>
<p>his account was not referenced in database or server security. but then i found it listed as the owner under the properties of the databases:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=9b9f68c8-0063-462e-85f4-409c03668be4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d9b9f68c8-0063-462e-85f4-409c03668be4" /></a></p>
<p>since there is seemingly no negative effect other than horrible log errors, i'm willing to leave this as we're going to be upgrading to 3.0 soon enough.</p>
<p>however, i'm curious when this username would have been set like this. i assume it would have been at the time of installation and that this admin had the option of setting a different account but didn't. however, it is terrible that the database is referencing
 the owner for any purpose at all. is there perhaps something going on that is not apparent but could lead to problems with this account disabled as it is?</p>

<p>Hi Beeblebrox,</p>
<p>Glad to see you have found the root cause.</p>
<p>I assume the account is added when configuring the ADFS service in the first place. If ADFS service is working fine, it should have no affects.</p>
<p>Also, you can check the event log viewer on the ADFS server, see if any specific error logs may related to the account apart from the event ID 28005 like ‚ÄúUnknown user name or bad password‚Äù. If so, you may want to check the corresponding services and change
 the log on account. Here is an similar thread for your reference:

    <title>Saving One Note to Word saves only low quality images - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnnydillinger  say:</h3>
<h2>            Saving One Note to Word saves only low quality images</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I fell in love with One Note the first time I used it simply because the many features in word can somehow get in the way. With One Note I can simply focus on the content and the general layout.</p>
<p>Most of the things that I type on One Note are college related materials and I usually include lots of illustrations that are from excel, visio, mathematica etc... that are all in high quality format. However, whenever I save a One Note page or section to
 Word, all that remains of my high quality images are indiscernible blurs. Its really frustrating because &nbsp;the image quality has been terrible downgraded in the saving process. Although I can simply copy and paste the images one after the other from One Note
 to Word, that is not a solution when there are more than a 100 illustrations.</p>
<p>I am using Office 2010. What is there that I can do to retain the same image quality during One Note to Word conversion. Please help.</p>

            Most of the images are copied directly from visio. When I save the one note document to PDF, the images look great. You can zoom in as much as you want and they look good. That's because they are vector images. However, when you save them to word, they
 become very bad. Do you want a sample ?

            <p>This is not about Microsoft Word, it is about the way One Note saves its image into different formats. Please take a look at the attached image below.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7323d85b-c261-4e00-8242-89cb4ffcdb92" /></p>
<p>Note that the plot above was generated by Mathematica and was edited in Visio.</p>
<p>When the images are pasted from Visio, the images behave like vector images meaning that they can be resized to any size. When I save the One Note document to PDF, the images are still in vector format meaning I can zoom in as much as I like with image quality
 remaining the same. However, when I save to word, all the images are converted to jpeg quality. In fact, even though the images had transparent backgrounds, in Word, the background color of the images have the same color as the background colour of the One
 Note page from which they come. In other words, when One Note saves to Word, it doesn't transfer the image files in their original format, it instead takes a snapshot of the image file as it appears on the One Note document. I can still copy manually the original
 image files to word after the One Note document has been saved to Word. However, this is a very tedious endeavour when there a lot of images !! So, my question is, Why is One Note taking snapshots of images instead of just copying them as they are when are
 saved to Word?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I did that. That has nothing to do with the way One Note saves to word. Why don't you try what I'm saying on your computer if you have One Note installed.</p>

            <p>I really hope someone has the answer on this, as it it solve my other problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use OneNote extensively, and draft my procedures / training documents from OneNote, than polish up the formatting in MS Word. &nbsp; When I save my OneNote to MS Word, the image seems to have been saved in MS Word, but when someone else opens the MS word document
 they can't see the image.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It looks like OneNote or MS Word just saved a link to the image that is still in my OneNote workbook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on which setting this would be?</p>

<h2>            Does Windows Phone have an app similar to Apple&#39;s and Android&#39;s on cities&#39; traffic schedules</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&nbsp;am visiting a&nbsp;big city and when I'm at a bus stop, I see people take out their iphones or androids and press an app that can tell them how many bus stops away the bus is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;looked in&nbsp;the Microsoft Store to&nbsp;find a similar Windows' app, but didn't see it. Does one exist?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded different traffic apps thinking they might do the job, but they ended up all being about something else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thanks, I just looked it up and unless I'm misunderstanding the app, it shows you routes, but not times, that is where the bus is at the moment so you'll know how long you'll have to wait at the bus stop.
</p>
<p>

            <p>HERE Transit knows the time-tables for buses and trains in my area, and is able to display when I need to start walking from the current location, to arrive at the bus stop or train station in time for the scheduled departure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We got a local app in Denmark that can notify about train delays and rerouting
<em>almost</em> real-time, but the functionality you request would require every bus and train to upload its exact&nbsp;GPS location at all times and make the data available to the app developers. - We are not there, yet, in my country.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's trivial math to calculate the approximate location of a bus from the time-table and put a dot on the map to show where it is expected to be right now, and I'm almost sure that's what other apps may do. It will appear to work perfectly fine when the
 transport is on time, but is useless&nbsp;when the bus or train is delayed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please double-check the functionality in the apps others use?</p>

<h2>            Connection between PC and PDA stopped for no reason</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I've previously posted a issue about my pc always stop the connection between my PDA when I'm trying to sync or transfer a file. Windows mobile device shows that it is disconnected although the start menu bar still shows it is connected. This happen when I'm
 using usb port. Bluetooth connection doesn't have this kind of problem. But no one can help me to solve this problem.<br />
<br />
Currently, I found that everytime the connection stopped, my AVG firewall shows that an application called "filterdevice" is blocked. Is there anyone can explain to me what is this? Is it the main reason for why the connection stopped? And if it is, how can
 I solve it?<br />

<h2>            How do I enter multiple lines in a cell&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm working with Excel online, using our Office 365 license. This is in collaboration with other co-workers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I'd like to be able to do is enter data, in multiple lines, in a cell in the spreadsheet. How I thought this would work, by tying one thing in, then hold the Shift key down and press the Enter key, doesn't work. Instead the cursor jumps to the cell
 immediately about it. Not what I want at all! I'd like to enter something like: <em>
apple, pear, banana</em> as:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">apple</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">pear</p>

            Alt+Enter is used in Excel to insert a new line in a cell. However, I‚Äôm not sure if Excel online supports it. It may.

            Hi KSM,
<br />This was an Outlook pst  file? Is it in Documents\Outlook Files ? 
<br />Do you receive an error message about a missing data file when you open outlook? 
<br />
<br />If the data file was in  the old location under C:\Users\%usrname%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Outlook, look for a folder called windows.old and see if it's under it. If so, move it to Documents or anywhere but the old location.

<p>
</p><p>Please try to go to mail web version to check if you can see your personal folder there. If you still cannot see the folder there, you can sync back to client.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you cannot see the personal folder, regarding this folder, I would like to collect some information as following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. After the update and restart, if the Outlook profile you opened has changed?</p>
<p>2. May I know if you are using Office 365 for Business account?</p>
<p>3. How did you configure your account in Outlook (Exchange, IMAP or POP type)?</p>
<p>4. For the personal folder you mentioned, if it's just a regular mail folder in your Outlook client?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it's a just regular mail folder, you can try to <a href="https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/create-an-outlook-profile-f544c1ba-3352-4b3b-be0b-8d42a540459d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

Denise Bernardino.</a>&nbsp;Are your still experiencing that issue? Does your phone respond when connecting it to the charger? Did you previously download any app that may lead to this state? Try restarting your phone in safe mode. This allows you to see if a recently
 installed application is preventing your phone from starting properly. You may&nbsp;follow below procedures:
</p>
</p><ul>
<li>Power on your phone</li><li>When you hear&nbsp;the startup tone,&nbsp;and the Nokia logo starts flashing, press and hold the volume down button until the phone starts up.</li><li>If the phone is&nbsp;started in safe mode, you'll see the Safe text &nbsp;in the bottom left corner of the screen.</li><li>Once you've removed the offending applications,&nbsp;power your phone and back on to restart it in normal mode.</li></ul>
<p>Hope this helps.&nbsp;</p>

<p>this is a problem I've only just had as well, I' have been trying to update the phone software only to find it fails every time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- ! -</p>
<p>Something's gone wrong</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>---------</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ther was a problem. Please restart Nokia Ovi Store and try again <em>(this part is stupid becuase it don't fix a thing)</em>. If the problem persists, uninstall Nokia Ovi Suite and download the latest version of the application from
<u>Nokia Website</u> <em>(this part is also retarded as I have the latest version).</em></p>
<p>Error Code : 12017</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There has got to be something wrong with the software as it isn't allowing the update to happen and Nokia Software Updater is exactly the same<em><br />

                    I contacted xbox live to switch my account which was under my hotmail account to my sons. &nbsp;They walked me through the process by adding his email and making him the primary alias on the account and then adding all his profile details. I left my email on
 there as a back up security. When we finished the call I then went to my IPhone to check my hotmail email and it told me I had the wrong password. I put in what is now my sons new password and it then asked me if I wanted my hotmail email to go into a separate
 folder, I said yes as I didn't want to loose them. I then realized there was something wrong. Called xbox back, they told me that they had never heard of this and the girl a spoke with was being advised from over her shoulder, as I was talking to her. &nbsp;She
 told me to remove my email from my sons account and to give it 24 hours for the servers to line up and I should up and if this didn't work to call back and that they could do an account recovery, which apparently by the

    <title>Error when making calls from Skype on iphone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> seemagic771  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error when making calls from Skype on iphone</h2>
                    I have purchased an unlimited UK landline calling plan and a UK Skype number.&nbsp; I can make a call from my landline phone to the UK, but when I try to use Skype to make the same call using the same number I can a message that pops up and tells me to purchase
 skype credit when calling outside my subscription area.&nbsp; I have re-registered both my landline and mobile numbers.&nbsp; I still cannot make a call using Skype from my iphone.&nbsp; The skype app is the most current version.&nbsp; So can someone please tell me what is wrong?&nbsp;
 And why is there no online support for this?

</p><p>As per reading your post, you've just said that <strong>"tells me to purchase skype credit when calling outside my subscription area"
</strong>it could be possible that you are calling a number that is supported by the subscription.</p>

<h2>            Office 365 Outlook Reply &#47; Reply All &#47; Forward</h2>
                    <p>In Office 365 Outlook no longer are there simple buttons to choose Reply, Reply all, or Forward. There is a single button, which you can set to Reply or Reply all, and then you have to use a pull-down menu for the other choices. In other words, it takes
 two steps instead of one to get either of the two options you have not preset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course the pull-down menu has lots of other choices, but these three are the common and essential ones. We shouldn't have to use two clicks to choose them. It was a very bad idea to move them to the pull-down menu. Microsoft, please restore the buttons,
 so that each of the three is available with one click.</p>

<p>Hi, got my 920 Friday and it froze writing sms. Hard reset put it right!! Hope it don't happen again!! But my question is, can apps for the phone be downloaded to desktop and then added to phone? Or can the apps be added through desktop so WiFi is not required?
 Just that wifi is slow!!</p>

            Smaller apps can be downloaded from the Store directly to your device using cellular data, but for any apps / games that are over 20MB in size, you can only achieve this via Wi-Fi.

            Hi James
<br />
<br />Those check boxes will always loose their state when Explorer is closed . . .
<br />
<br />Open that folder in File Explorer, set View to Details, then on the View ribbon, choose 'Add Columns' - Comments. You can then right click a video file and set Comments to 'Finished', or even a rating for the film . ..

            A good method for that would be rating stuff on IMDB when you watch something. This way you can see your rating next time you look it up.

            Normally what I do is, create a folder called Watched in my video directory then drag and drop the video into that folder after watching.

            It all depends on how you have your email accounts setup on the phone.
<div><br />
<div>
<ul>
<li><b>POP mail</b> downloads the message from the server to the device and it no longer resides on your server</li><li><b>IMAP mail</b> leaves the email on the server until a delete request is made and then it is moved to the deleted email folder.</li><li><b>Exchange email</b> will do the same as IMAP, but has the ability to store emails/remove from the server and store locally in folders.</li></ul>
<div>How email is&nbsp;handled&nbsp;by your mail server may be configured by your mail provider. So you may want to check account settings with your provider.</div>
<div><br />
<div>To check your email settings on your device go to settings-&gt;system-&gt;email &amp; accounts-&gt; select an email account</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps.</div>

 Gupta10, thank you for your reply. If I understand your comments, you are suggesting I reset I.E. If I do this, it will reset all my settings right? Obviously, a big thing. But, if that's what it takes, so be it. Secondly, you mention the other option of checking
 my internet connection? When I follow the directions given, I finally come up upon the link of connection, where I have 3 options. Broadband, broadband2 and broadband3. I don't know which one to click on. Would it be best to contact my internet provider to
 see what I need to do? I'm not a computer expert by any means, and I'm trying to to get myself into deeper trouble here. Please understand that, Mayank. So, to reintegrate, is it possible my problem with I.E. is my internet connection? If so, I will contact
 my provider first, and let them sort this out. If my problem is something else Mayank, and it revolves around windows or I.E. please let me know your opinion. I do appreciate your help, thank you.</a><br />

            Hi Mayank, Thank you for your reply. After doing some research I have more to add, that may help you in determining what is wrong with my I.E. browser. First, I can actually log into a few sites, so I do have an internet connection. So that solves that
 problem. Secondly, I have noticed the sites I can log into, won't allow me to sign in to, or the pictures or graphs within that site will not display, they are just blank. I also don't have any of my saved data within those sites any longer. Never saw that
 before either, until this problem. Also, I used to be able to work off line before. I could use google earth off line, now I can't. I just keep getting the message google "couldn't contact the authentication server". Also get the message when I try and load
 a location "could not connect to the server. Also have problems with java not being able to either uninstall or install off line either. Don't know if either one of these issues concerning google or java has anything to do with my I.E. probl

            Mayank, thank you for your reply. I did try some of your inquiries, updates and add ons, to no avail. There are a couple of things I did not mention which I should. First, I do not have any web site problems when I use a different browser (firefox) , so
 I would think my connection is OK? Second, while I'm not sure, I believe my I.E. problem, as well as my google earth issue, showed up the same time I did a system restore. I did this to resolve a problem I was having, and usually when I do a restore it is
 to get ride of a computer problem I can't resolve. And, it always works. At least in the past it has. I have been told it is not wise to do a system restore to an earlier time to always solve computer problems, but again, it always seems to work for me. Is
 it possible the restore may have caused a problem with my I.E. browser and not my firefox browser? Knowing these 2 things I mentioned, does it give you more info to go on? Hopefully, this additional info can help you in analyzing my problem. Again, thank you
 for your help, and patience, Mayank.&nbsp; <br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you connected to a domain network?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to perform clean boot and check, using this Microsoft Article because may be a third party application is causing this issue.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>NOTE: </strong>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update
 or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily
 lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is
 connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps.

<p>Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section ‚Äú<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting‚Äù</strong> to boot the computer in normal mode.</p>

            <p>Hi Mayank, thank you your reply. Not really sure what a domain network connection is, but my internet connection is from the communications company, Wave Broadband. And, looking at the connection settings, they are show as: broadband, broadband 2 and broadband
 3. I contacted that provider, (Wave Broadband) and they told me they were not to blame for the problem because, I in fact do get the internet, and the problem is else where, and to contact microsoft to resolve the problem, which obviously I am.
</p>
<p>&nbsp; I asked about the issue of doing a restore, and if that may caused the problem. Can you respond to that, Mayank? Yes, it is after the fact, but at least I'll know in the future about such things, Mayank.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; In doing a clean boot, will that affect my over all system settings I currently have, Mayank? Again, I don't want to make the problem bigger than it already is, and losing my current data will in deed do that.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you currently suggesting I do the clean boot, instead of the I.E. reset, Mayank? Again, please understand, I'm not a computer savvy user, and I certainly appreciate your patience with that, Mayank. I also understand your help is very much appreciated
 for me to resolve this problem. Just want to make sure I don't get too far over my head, and cause more problems, that will in turn cause more problems. Mayank. Again, thank you very much Mayank.
