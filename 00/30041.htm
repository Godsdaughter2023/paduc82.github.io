<h2>            Windows update errors - WindowsUpdate_800F0826&#34; &#34;WindowsUpdate_dt000&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I am having ongoing issues with Windows Updates, mostly Security updates, Windows 7 updates &amp;&nbsp;Internet Explorer updates, they constantly fail &amp; my p.c goes into a loop of booting up &amp; trying to install these updates until it eventually goes to the login
 screen.</p>
<p>When I then check the status of these updates they've nearly always failed &amp; there will be another load of similar/same updates waiting to be done, for example its just said I have 35 updates to be installed &amp; all look the same as before.</p>
<p>The most common error I see when checking details is - WindowsUpdate_800F0826" "WindowsUpdate_dt000".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone had similar issues &amp; if so how did they manage to get these fixed, appreciate any help.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Windows Update error 800f0826 is displayed when an update for Windows has failed to install and is preventing you from installing additional updates. Error 800f0826 does not identify the update that has caused the problem. The update that has caused the
 problem will display a different error. This problem affects updates for Windows only and does not prevent you from installing or automatically receiving updates for other Microsoft programs, such as the Microsoft Office System.</p>
<p><strong>To prevent error 800f0826, you need to identify the update that's causing the problem (it will display a different error message), fix the problem, and then try installing updates again.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You'll need to find the update that is causing the problem. See the above article for steps to take to find which update is causing the problem and what the particular error code is.</p>

<p>The easiest way to do what you want is known as a <em>factory restore</em>. As the name says, that will restore your computer to exactly as it was when it left the factory, as if you had never touched it. Your lucky grand-daughter will get what is, for all
 intents and purposes, a new computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every computer manufacturer publishes instructions for doing this on their website. Just be sure to follow the directions for your model of computer. Cost is zero and Windows 10 will automatically activate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the factory restore completes, Windows will automatically update to the latest version. Then you can install any software you'd like to give to your grand-daughter - or perhaps let her do that! Best wishes to you and to the lucky girl.</p>

<h2>            Error in multiuser sync module initialization.  System Error.  Code&#58; 5</h2>
                    
<p>I have been having problems with Windows Media Center crashing and some helpful MS support engineers figured out that I probably have a corrupted profile, so they suggested that I create a new User Account/profile.&nbsp; I did that today and followed the directions
 at: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/Windows7/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile to copy and eventually replace my corrupted user profile.</p>
<p>However, when I tried to log on to the new profile I received the message in the Title above.&nbsp; There is another user profile on this machine that was created shortly after I got the machine and seems to be working fine.&nbsp; Media Center ran fine under that
 profile which is why the support engineers decided the problem was a corrupt profile.&nbsp; Apparently I have other problems too.</p>
<p>I'm running Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit.&nbsp; Any help will be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Carl</p>

<p><span><span>Hi&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Carl</span>,
</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span> Users have fixed similar issue by restarting the computer. Restart the computer and then check
 if you can logon to the new user account without any issues. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong><span><span>Put the computer in clean boot and then check to see
 if the issue persists<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Follow&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Step 1</strong> in the link below,
<br />
<strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span></a></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If everything works fine after a clean boot, you can infer that some third party services are causing the problem.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Proceed with the remaining steps to pin-point out the third party service.<br />
After you figure out the problem causing program, you may have to update or install a higher version of the program, if you seldom use that software you can consider uninstalling it.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Important:</span></strong><span> - Remember to put the computer back to normal startup follow&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>step

                    <p>Hey everyone,</p><p>If you&nbsp;want to know how to do game sharing on Win 10, I have found a way to get it to work. I am sharing the game with my bro and his account is the one that bought the game(gears 4) and it works perfectly for me on my pc and xbox via game sharing. A lot of people wanted to know how to make the windows copy of games work if they game share with someone so if you follow this method then it should work well for you as well :)&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>

<h2>            &#91;Fixed&#93; Cannot update to 8.1 0xc1900101-0x40017 &#40;BSOD&#41; driver_power_state_failure</h2>
                    Hello
<div><br />
</div>
<div>when going through the install process, the installation gets to around 83-85% followed by a black screen. After leaving the pc in a the black screen state a bsod* appears with the message Driver_power_state_failure followed by a restart.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After the restart the pc will try to boot and will get stuck at the boot screen with the circle spinning. It never gets past this state and needs another restart.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Once this restart happens it again sticks at the booting logo with another restarted needed with then displays a message under the boot logo along the lines of "recovering to windows 8 etc etc"</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After the 2nd reboot w8 recovers with a message of how windows 8 couldn't be installed with fault code - 0xc1900101 - 0c40017</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have removed all connections to the pc except the Ethernet and monitors (2 monitors) . I have checked as many drivers as possible and as far as I can check they are all up to date, and have also removed my anti virus for now. Excluding the regular hardware
 in my machine, I have 1 sound card and 2 capture cards. &nbsp;Hardware is i7 4770k nvidia 770gtx 1 x ssd (OS) 1 x hdd. I also have onboard graphic chip enabled for use of&nbsp;intel quick sync</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried on many occasion now to install the 8.1 update to no avail, including all the steps mentioned above.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><b>EDIT</b></div>
<div><b><i>I have fixed my issue but I fear it is only going to apply to me unless you have a steelseries piece of hardware with steelseries engine 2 aka their driver software.</i></b>

 received. In each case the original date and time was preserve. Fortunately because Windows live has an unread box I was able to delete all those en bloc.<br />
<br />
My ISP deny it could have been anything to do with them. Are they right? Is there anywhere else those emails could have been sitting for days and weeks before suddenly appearing?<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for bringing up this issue to our attention.&nbsp; There are cases where in the duplication of messages is caused by the configuration of e-mail clients. As initial troubleshooting, I recommend you to reconfigure your account in Windows Live Mail. To
 do this, please refer to the link below:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, please try to temporarily disable any anti-virus application and Firewall application installed in your computer.</p>

            Hi Eugene<br />
I was of course aware of how to add an account. The last time I changed the configuration of Windows live mail in any way was over a year ago, and when I did so all the emails not saved in my documents folder were deleted. This was very inconvenient. I shall
 have to think about it.<br />
<br />
I had assumed that all the duplicates were being held on some remote server and were downloaded. I now infer that in fact copies of emails stored on my computer were copied and&nbsp; the copies put in my inbox. Is this correct?<br />
<br />
The other possibility is that occasionally my graphics driver crashes, and when it does colours in Windows live Mail are reversed and I have to close it and reopen. Could this be the cause?<br />
<br />

            <p>Can you&nbsp;access your ISP account with a browser?</p>
<p>How many emails are in your Inbox on the server?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a pop3 account's emails are downloaded and a copy left on the server, a log of what emails have been downloaded is kept.&nbsp; It seems that the account log becomes corrupted when a crash occurs.&nbsp; That explains the duplicates.&nbsp; To get triplicates, the download
 process is interrupted before all online emails are downloaded.&nbsp; The download log does not add the downloaded emails until all online emails are downloaded.&nbsp; When the download process starts again, previously downloaded emails are downloaded again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It sounds like your computer crashes are corrupting the log file.</p>

==============================<br />
Here's what I have on the subject...maybe one <br />
of the suggestions will work for you...<br />
<br />
Good luck...<br />
<br />
Windows Photo Gallery...<br />
Cannot save edited photos...<br />
possible solutions...<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
1) I've seen reports that this issue may be related<br />
to Kodak Easy Share software. Installing 'Kodak<br />
Easy Share Version 8 for Windows' from the<br />
following link may be the fix.<br />
<br />
Kodak Easy Share Software Version 8<br />
<a href="http://www.kodak.com/eknec/PageQuerier.jhtml?pq-path=130&amp;pq-locale=en_US&amp;_requestid=5320" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.kodak.com/eknec/PageQuerier.jhtml?pq-path=130&amp;pq-locale=en_US&amp;_requestid=5320</a><br />
(FWIW...it's a good idea to create a system<br />
restore point before installing software or updates)<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
2) I've seen reports that the following steps may clear<br />
up the issue...Right click the Photo Gallery icon and<br />
choose 'Run as administrator'.<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
3) I copied the following info from a tech forum on<br />
the net....I do not know if it works but maybe it's<br />
worth a try:<br />
<br />
A. Open Task Manager by right-clicking on the<br />
taskbar on the bottom of your screen and choosing<br />
Task Manager from the menu.<br />
<br />
B. Click on the Processes Tab along the top of the<br />
Task Manager screen.<br />
<br />
C. In the Processes Tab, find the button in the lower<br />
left of the screen that says "Show processes from<br />
all users" and click it. Click "Continue" at the UAC<br />
prompt that comes up.<br />
<br />
D. The screen should go dark for a moment, then<br />
return with many more processes listed. Click on<br />
the column "Command Line" to sort the list and<br />
look for:<br />
<br />
"C:\Program Files\Windows Media Player\wmpnetwk.exe"<br />
<br />
The description in the next column over will read:<br />
<br />
Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service<br />
<br />
F. Click to select this process. Then click the "End<br />
Process" button in the lower right of the screen.<br />
Confirm&nbsp; "End Process" as necessary.<br />
<br />
You should now be able to save your changes to<br />
your pictures normally. The bad news is that this<br />
has to be done each time you start or restart Vista.<br />
And I don't know how to prevent the situation from<br />
loading in the first place.<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
4) Posted by : artologik<br />
The solution came to me when I could not recreate<br />
the problem on a different laptop with Vista Home.<br />
Comparing everything that I could, I noticed that the<br />
%PATH% environment variable was different between<br />
the 2 machines.<br />
<br />
I guess WLPG relies on DLLs that must be found<br />
on the system path; when not found, it must revert<br />
back to "basic or incomplete" libraries that it finds<br />
on default or user specific paths. The solution for<br />
me was to ensure the overall system path pointed<br />
to the proper folders in the proper order.<br />
<br />
To solve, do this:<br />
<br />
A. Right-click the COMPUTER icon on the<br />
desktop and choose PROPERTIES<br />
<br />
B. Choose ADVANCED SYSTEM SETTINGS<br />
<br />
C. If prompted by UAC to authorize, go ahead<br />
and ALLOW<br />
<br />
D. Click ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES....<br />
<br />
E. In the bottom half, under SYSTEM VARIABLES,<br />
locate the PATH variable and highlight it<br />
<br />
F. Click the EDIT button<br />
<br />
G. Make sure that whatever is there starts with<br />
%SystemRoot%\system32;%SystemRoot%;<br />
<br />
H. Make sure a semi-colon separates&nbsp; each entry.<br />
<br />
I. Click OK three times<br />
<br />
J. Restart computer<br />
<br />
K. Et voilà.<br />

<ol>
<li>Open <strong>Microsoft </strong><strong>Edge</strong>, click on <strong>More actions(...)</strong> at the right top corner.</li><li>Click on <strong>View advanced settings</strong>, under <strong>Search in the address bar with
</strong>click on down arrow.</li><li>Choose <strong>&lt;add new&gt;</strong>, try to add the default website.</li></ol>

            There is a lot to like about Edge. One thing that would make it easier would be to give an active cursor in the address bar right away. Currently,&nbsp;I have to click three times before I can get into the address bar to type a URL.

            <p>replying with its a computer manufacturer issue and go there to dl the newest updates is not an answer, it was working fine until he/she upgraded to win 10, I have a similar issue as will with sound and I have downloaded the newest (less than 3 day old)
 sound drivers and my system is less than a month old, along with a bios flash, reflash, cmos clear, and everything else only two things I have not fully tried yet is to see if I have the same issues in Win 7 64bit ult (which if I don't I will stay with Win
 7 because I had it running sooooo good and stable and didn't have to worry about privacy intrusion or data collecting issues like we have to now) and the other thing is putting in a sound card instead of relying on the onboard (which is supposed to be fantastic
 and one of the reasons I bought the board I did), I have also chatted with three reps from he company that makes my board, so its not a manufacturer issue if he/she is not the only one with the issue, my issue is the same if I'm doing something like lets say
 watching Netflix, and if I'm say in teamspeak with my gaming community (look for us, UTF Underground Tree Fort we have a public channel), my teamspeak mic and sound will be automatically muted, I have tried every setting known to man in ts3 as well as different
 driver combinations ad wiping windows to reinstall while formatting my hdd, so I have narrowed my issues down to two possible things 1 is MS 10 64bit pro is stealing my data in the background which is killing my bandwith and making my sound suffer, or 2 it
 is an actual issue with the onboard sound card (which I will know for sure here in a bit as I took the sound card off my old system and put it in my new just to test a theory to which am downloading the driver to) O I also want to mention that I went to the
 true manufacturer of the onboard sound controller to aquire the drivers from them as they may be more updated and stable than those of my mobos manufacturers site. at any rate and to cut this short I would REALLLLLLLLLLLLY like to see some actual tech support
 instead of being caught in the infamous loop of o its the manufacturer, nope its not us its microsofts os, nope its not us try the manufacturer, have you tried calling your hardwares manufactueres tech support, and so on</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for allowing me to politely rant my frustrations I will move on now, o and by the by if someone finds a fix for the sound issues in win 10 64bit pro and a crosshair v rog formula z , as well as realtech sound controller I would love to hear from you
 email me at *** Email address is removed for privacy *** name the subject "fix for your sound issue"</p>

            <p>I built my own computer for gaming so there really is no manufacturer of my computer, everything I have is up to date. If you want I can list my hardware specs just let me know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use a Logitech G930 to speak and listen while gaming. It was working flawlessly with the Xbox app up until around the 23rd of September.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reformatted my computer and only installed what i need for my sound, headset and Xbox app to stream. It still does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm concerned that it is an update for the Xbox app or the console that has changed this to make it not work.</p>

            i have same issues.<br />
<br />
Windows 10 (for sure..cause Xbox App is only for 10 available)<br />
<br />
Drivers and everything is updated, i did clean install on my computer.&nbsp;<br />
Live-Update / Migration was a pain.... so i decided to create new clean computer with Windows 10<br />
<br />
to explain the issues deeper:<br />
<br />
no problems in Skype with Micro from Webcam, no issue with Microphone from my Gaming Headset.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Only issues if i use the Headset within the Xbox App to open Party with other gamers in the game.&nbsp;<br />
Tried to put the headset directly to game-controller also to put it directly in the Mic-In (front / rear) of my PC&nbsp;<br />
So for sure i think there is a problem in recognize the Mic with the Xbox App.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Are there any solutions / suggestions from Microsoft for that?<br />
<br />
If u need further informations... don t hestitate to contact me, we can work together on that to analyze and solve the problem... &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Drivers are all updated with original drivers from manufacter of hardware..to be sure to get the optimized drivers and not optional standard drivers from Windows... &nbsp;(which working mostly fine...but i wanted to be sure..and problem is also not solved with researching
 of newer drivers and installing them....)&nbsp;

<p>
<span>Hi Tammer_d,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span>Welcome to Microsoft Vista Answers Forum!</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Steps I would suggest are:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Run Internet explorer with no add-ons. Though you have not installed add-ons it<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>might have installed by itself as a part of malicious program. Steps to temporarily disable add-ons</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>i.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on Start</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>ii.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click All programs</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>iii.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select Accessories
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>iv.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click System tools</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>v.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>And then select Internet Explorer(no add-ons)</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>If the browser works fine after these steps, add-on may be causing the error.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Steps to determine which add-on may be causing the error</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>i.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Open Internet explorer.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>ii.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the Tools button, click Manage add-ons, and then click Enable or disable Add-ons.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>iii.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the show list, click Add-ons that have been used by Internet Explorer to display all add-ons.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>iv.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the Add-ons you want to enable, and then select Enable.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>v.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Repeat step iv for every add-on you want to enable. When you have finished click OK.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Optimize Internet Explorer. The below link will help you do Internet explorer optimization:
</span></p>

</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If these steps doesn't&nbsp;resolve the issue,&nbsp;you need to contact Horde for support as this issue is happening only with horde webmail.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Hope this information is helpful.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Let me know if this worked.</span></p>
<p>
<span>All the best!</span></p>

            No, Windows sees all of them, that's why Task Manager says 8 next to "logical processors". &nbsp;So it's using them all.

            <p>That's how it was designed, read more about it here (they built this new design for Windows 8 and brought it forward).</p>
<p>https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2013/06/06/windows-8-task-manager-in-depth/</p>
<p>
</p><p>The relevant section for you is the paragraph that begins with "Another capability of the performance graphs in the Windows 8 Task Manager is the ability to select multiple views for CPU utilization", but they have an even more in-depth description and reasons
 behind their builds here too: https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/b8/2011/10/13/the-windows-8-task-manager/</p>
<p>
</p><p>Logical processors is how many processors your system is reporting to the OS, so
<strong>8</strong> in your case, and you have a quad-core processor since it shows 4 cores.</p>

<p>
</p><p>CPU-Z, AMD Overdrive both identify FX 832E having 8 cores.&nbsp; The top of the task manager says "CPU AMD FX-8320E Eight-Core Processor", thoug this can be just free text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>AMD also market this as 8-core Processor.&nbsp; Are they cheating?</p>
<p>

            The FX Series processors were designed to put 2 cores into a module, windows is only recognizing the modules as cores, thus 4 cores (4*2=8) being recognized.

            Hi Florence.  Go through your files that you want to Share or Restrict and either at the Folder level or within the folder on the individual files you can right click and choose Properties, then the Sharing tab to enable Sharing on the folder or file to whom you want it shared.  
<br />
<br />There is more here:

<p>Thanks a million Greg.&nbsp; I tried to go back and then right click on each folder that I did not want to give access to under everyone.&nbsp; There was not a way to do all the folders I did not want at once so had to do them one at the time and then when I finished
 I tried to open an application and it told me that the application was no long there.&nbsp; So I panicked and went back and gave again access to all the folder as I did not know what folder under my profile that windows was not allowing me to deny access to everyone.&nbsp;
 Let me explain.&nbsp; For example, under my profile I have tons of folders like Appdata or application data and cookies and desktop etc.. etc... as well as documents and music and downloads etc... and so I did not care to give the other computer access under "everyone"
 to all these folders but only to document and music folders, but that was not working.&nbsp; So I am assuming now that under the group "everyone" and the primary profile on the computer, windows will not work properly if you don't give access for all the other
 folders like appdata and application data etc...&nbsp; as well as documents and music folder.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I wanted was give access to the document and music and download folders only.&nbsp; Now that I have gone through giving security access full control to all the folders and sharing all the folders under the everyone group, I am a little scared and not sure
 how to go back and remove all that or even the group everyone without affecting how the computer works.&nbsp; And then just give access to a few folders under my primary profile.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I remove access to everyone will that affect my computer the way it did when I denied access to the appdata and 3D folder and cookies etc....&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How would I remove the group "everyone" without messing everything up?</p>
<p>

            Hi again Flo -
<br />
<br />If you do not want Everyone on the PC to have access to the folder, but instead to restrict it to another User or Users only, then in the File Sharing box for that folder, right click Everyone to restrict it as desired, then add and/or highlight the User on the PC by typing in their name until it is detected and able to be highlighted, choose how you want it shared with them.  
<br />
<br />This is clearly and in detail illustrated in the tutorial I gave in my first post:  <a href="https://pureinfotech.com/setup-network-file-sharing-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://pureinfotech.com/setup-network-file-sha...</a>
<br />
<br />Any problems are dealt with in the Troubleshooting thread also linked.
<br />
<br />There is a tracking Discussion thread now about Sharing issues in Version 1803 where the author Paulo is answering many inquiries with the very latest that is working and not.  I have elevated this thread by MVP channels to get action on the problems being encountered with the removal of automated Homegroups from 1803.  Please interact with Paulo here if you need guided help as he is the reining expert on this now and helping many daily:  <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-files/homegroup-removed-how-to-get-network-sharing-work/01277332-2916-4a68-853a-116696b20743">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p><span>Hey RacerLady,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I believe this is the error message you’re receiving: “Your user profile was not loaded correctly! You have been logged on with a temporary profile.
 Changes you make to this profile will be lost when you log off. Please see the event log for details or contact your administrator”.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This problem usually occurs if the current user's profile was accidentally deleted from the system or got corrupted. If this is the error message,
 then follow these steps to fix the problem.</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Disk Cleanup does not help in these circumstances.</p>
<p>The D: Recovery Drive / Partition was put on your Hard Drive by your Computer Manufacturer to make Recovery Disks from in case of Hard Drive failure or to use the D: Partition in case of System failure to reinstall the operating system.</p>
<p>You will have to contact the Manufacturer for assistance with this problem.</p>
<p>After they have fixed it, ask them how to make Recovery Disks from it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

            This is probably a question for the Access, Word or Outlook experts rather than System Repair and Recovery. The following process should help you find out a little more.<br />
<ol>
<li>Get a copy of clipbrd.exe from a WinXP PC. </li><li>Run it. </li><li>Mark some text in some file and press Ctrl+C (or Edit/Copy). The text should appear in the clipbrd application. Do this until you fully understand how it works.</li><li>Perform your problem copy/paste process and watch what happens in the clipbrd application. Do you see every line or just four of them?</li></ol>
I suspect that you are not picking up all the lines from MS Access, in which case the experts in an Access forum might have an answer.

<h2>            Why bluetooth mouse keeps on disconnecting in windows 8&#63;</h2>
                    When I start win8, my bluetooth mouse works perfectly but after awhile, in stop working. I turn the power of the mouse off and turn it on again to make it work again. But after awhile, it stop working again, so I turn the mouse off and on again to make
 it work. When the mouse stop working, the light of the mouse is still on therefore I know the mouse is still working but the notebook stops responding to the mouse. The touch pad doesn't have any problem. I don't have this problem in win7.

            I found a fix. What I did was get into the Device Manager and expanded the Bluetooth menu. I right clicked on each item and selected Properties until I found the one that had a Power Management. Mine happened to be Bluetooth Module. Once I got into the
 Power Management setting I unchecked 'Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power'.<br />
<br />
I didn't reinstall any software and everything is working fine now.<br />
