<h2>            Windows Keeps Saying My Mic is Turned Off</h2>
                    When I run Microsoft Fix It, the problem it detects with my Microphone is that it isn't enabled. However, the odd part is my microphone is enabled in Windows and selected as the default device.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>From the time my microphone worked to the time it didn't was one night. I didn't do anything that night or mess with any sound options to possibly disable my mic in windows.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My microphone does however work on other computers, just not mine anymore. My microphone sound is enabled, has its recording volume set to max and isn't muted. I'm really at my wits end here and any help regarding this topic is highly appreciated.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
The audio device you selected is currently turned off in Windows.<br />
This is the only problem the Microsoft Fix it recognizes even after I enabled my mic.</td>
</tr>

    <title>How do I display more power options on the taskbar&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I display more power options on the taskbar&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>The power options applet in the Windows 7 notification area only shows 2 power options by default.&nbsp; Somehow, no matter how many times I choose different options or create new ones, it conspires to show my most recent selection and some other option I'm not
 interested in.&nbsp; It does not, for example, show the two most recently used options.</p>
<p>Is there any way around this?&nbsp; Either to choose which two options are displayed or to increase the number of options displayed?</p>

<p>McWatt,</p>
<p>This is by design and there isn't an option in the OS to show more than 2 power schemes at a time on the task bar. If you'd like to suggest this feature changed in the future, I'd recommend leaving your feedback here:</p>

<p>You have a different email that you are trying to add to this old account and when you go to add it, it gives you that error message.</p>

</p><p>(The new account) Is it already a MS account? Do you use it for anything else to do with MS like Windows 10, Xbox, Office?</p>

<h2>            Driver power state failure</h2>
                    <p>I installed COMODO antivirus and i was asked to restart my laptop. After doing that, my laptop could only be used for a few minutes after switching it on. Everything seems working as usual, but after a few minutes, all input devices including the touchpad,
 keyboard, USB ports stop working. I could not access to my laptop after that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to restart my laptop a few times, and it shows me the blue screen with driver power state failure.</p>
<p>Besides, I found that my laptop couldn't launch window 8. I have to restart it for many times in order to access to the operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried the system file checker by typing sfc /scannow in command prompt, but i got an empty txt file on desktop when i followed the instruction in order to view details of the system file checker process.</p>
<p>Could anyone please help me to solve this problem? It's urgent. Any help is appreciated!</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
</strong></span><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>1. </strong>Navigate to the %systemroot%\Minidump folder.<br />
<br />
<em>-- %systemroot% is the environment variable for your Windows directory. For example, C:\Windows.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Copy any and all .DMP files in the Minidump folder to your Desktop, create a new folder on the Desktop to put these .DMP files in, and then zip the folder. You can then either use a 3rd party tool such as 7-Zip/Winrar, or you can use Windows'
 default method of zipping folders.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compress-uncompress-files-zip-files#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Compress and uncompress files (zip files).</a><br />
<br />
 the system to crash once again to generate a crash dump.</strong></span><br />
<br />
<strong>3. </strong>Upload the .ZIP containing the .DMP files to Onedrive or a hosting site of your choice and paste in your reply.<br />
<br />
Preferred sites: Onedrive, Mediafire, Dropbox, etc. Nothing with wait-timers, download managers, etc.<br />
<br />
<strong>4 (optional):</strong> The type of .DMP files located in the Minidump folder are known as Small Memory Dumps. In %systemroot% there will be what is known as a Kernel Memory Dump (if your system is set to generate). It is labeled MEMORY.DMP. The difference
 between Small Memory Dumps and Kernel Memory Dumps in the simplest definition is a Kernel Memory Dump contains
<em><strong>much </strong></em>more information at the time of the crash, therefore allowing further debugging of your issue. If your upload speed permits it, and you aren't going against any strict bandwidth and/or usage caps, etc, the Kernel Memory Dump is
 the best choice. Do note that Kernel Memory Dumps are <em><strong>much larger </strong>
</em>in size due to containing much more info, which is why I mentioned upload speed, etc.<br />

<strong>1.</strong> Start &gt; type %systemroot% which should show the Windows folder, click on it. Once inside that folder, ensure there is a Minidump folder created. If not, CTRL-SHIFT-N to make a New Folder and name it Minidump.<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Performance &gt; Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; Ensure there's a check-mark for 'Automatically manage paging file size for all drives'.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Ensure Small Memory Dump is selected and ensure the path is %systemroot%\Minidump.<br />
<br />
<strong>4.</strong> Double check that the WERS is ENABLED:<br />
<br />
Start &gt; Search &gt; type services.msc &gt; Under the name tab, find Windows Error Reporting Service &gt; If the status of the service is not Started then right click it and select Start. Also ensure that under Startup Type it is set to Automatic rather than Manual.
 You can do this by right clicking it, selecting properties, and under General selecting startup type to 'Automatic', and then click Apply.

</p><p>Despite the Bluetooth driver being labeled as the cause of the crash, it's not. The cause of the crash is the fact that you're trying to use a 3rd party firewall with another firewall (COMODO + McAfee). You can't have both, so uninstall COMODO.</p>

            <p>Uninstall McAfee then as that may be the culprit. If you still however crash after McAfee is removed as well, then the driver itself is the problem and you'll need to update it or disable Bluetooth.</p>

<h2>            Secureboot isn&#39;t configured correctly. Build 9600</h2>
                    <p>Old title: yahoo &amp; google problems since upgrading to 8.1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since I upgraded to 8. October 19th, not only do I have that watermark "Secureboot isn't configured correctly. Build 9600", but I can't access Yahoo. The page comes through as a blank. When I try Google's website for a search, all the search results appear
 in a narrow one inch border on the left of the screen, with a big blank page on the right. I never had these problems before I upgraded to 8.1. I've already tried some of the suggestions on the boards, liike clearing the cache, but nothing works. I'm no computer
 expert so am reluctant to try some of the involved suggestions with the computer operating system. Is there a way to downgrade back to Windows 8? My computer is an HP Pavilion and less than a year old. Thanks for any info.</p>

            <p>I have fixed the Google and Yahoo not displaying problem by changing the "Microsoft compatibility" tool on Internet Explorer. But I still have the watermark on my desktop, and even though you tried to explain to me how to fix it, I'm not a computer expert
 so have no idea how to do what you said I need to do. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have an HP Pavilion Desktop PC, and never had any problems until I upgraded to 8.1. Since so many users seem to have this problem, perhaps Microsoft could say something like this on the front page of the 8.1 website: "Are you experiencing a watermark
 on the lower right of your screen? Click here and we'll walk you through the solution."</p>

            <p>I've got a 2013 Asus laptop with no Windows 8.1 upgrade problems to date except the "watermark."&nbsp; As Asus has yet to release a BIOS that exposes the SecureBoot option for my model, I can wait along with a myriad of others who have reported this "opportunity."
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What I don't get and don't see anybody asking is:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- Why did this particular message appear as a peculiar desktop "watermark?"</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- Unlike&nbsp;a true watermark, why does it overwrite the system tray area, obscuring things like the clock, e.g.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- Shouldn't this be messaged in a more reasonable place, like say Control Panel-&gt; System and Security -&gt; Action Center ??</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Maybe I'm missing the big picture here.</p>

<h2>            Dying Light&#58; The Following</h2>
                    
<p>I purchased the expansion to the dying light game today (dying light: the following) but the game description has not made clear it was an expansion so I thought I could play it (also I do not have dying light), after I tried to go on and it would not let
 me so I double checked it looked like a game in itself but obviously not so I have not been able to play. I also looked to see if I could buy the game but I have to download the enhanced edition to play which costs £50, I would not like to spend a further
 £50 for the full game so therefore would like my money back as it was not made clear it was an expansion.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I purchased a copy of World of Subways Vol 3. It will let you run the program and it will load, but when you got to new game and select mission and it will let you choose, but when you go to start game, this is where it all goes wrong and a message comes
 up saying WOS3.exe has stopped working and then shuts down the program and goes back to desk top.</p>
<p>"Is there anything I can do to make this program run"?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am running windows 7&nbsp; 32bit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have done a search on IE and i have found alot of people with the same problem as i have.</p>

            Try uninstalling the presently installed driver using "Uninstall or change a program".
<p>
</p><p>Then install the previous driver that worked without issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can download previous versions of drivers form NVIDIA - use the "Beta and Older Drivers" link in the following link:</p>

<p>Sadly no, but in 30 years there will be a lot. People that grew up with gaming and helped make it popular will grow old with it.
</p>
<p>I started playing when I was 4. I am now 40. If I am still alive in my 70's I'm sure I will be gaming if I am able. I'm sure there are millions more just like me.</p>

<p>IMO, "gaming" hit its first critical mass around 1980-81 when many of the big Atari games hit the arcades. &nbsp;Up until then, gaming was a niche activity, as a lot of homes still didn't have computers. &nbsp;Pinball had been big since the 70's, but ask anyone who
 grew up in the 80's and they'll tell you that's when people started blowing paper route money like it was going out of style. &nbsp;Once these big titles started migrating into the home on Atari consoles, it exploded.</p>
<p>Like the "baby boomers", those first gen gamers represent the tip of the spear as far as aging gamers now. &nbsp;They're probably between the ages of 40 and 55 right now (although there are still examples of players much older, since some of them might have had
 some experience on early computer games long before the 80's). &nbsp;In 20 years you'll probably start seeing game consoles starting to appear in retirement homes! &nbsp;Probably a good thing, since games at least engage the mind a lot more than passive entertainment
 like TV shows.</p>

<p>My mom is in her 70's. She plays World of Warcraft and has a Steam account with probably 200 plus games (adventure, hidden object, match 3, etc). Facebook turned her into a gamer, she started with Farmville, Words with Friends and moved on to the non-browser
 based games.</p>
<p>I don't see most of that generation making the jump to the console because of the controller. The keyboard and mouse is familiar to them but the controller is very alien.</p>

<p>Consoles have been around since before you were born.</p>
<p>Just like you aren't keen to embrace console controls because you grew up playing your video games on the PC... Those of "that generation" who grew up playing on consoles are going to prefer the control pads they grew up with rather than swap to keyboard
 and mouse.</p>

<p>Thank you for your post. We understand you see an error code after sign in, correct? Are you able to into Windows?<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Please try a 2-button shutdown:<br />
</p>
<ol>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press and hold the power button on your Surface for&nbsp;<strong><span>30</span></strong>&nbsp;seconds.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Remove all accessories, including the cover, USB drive , SD card etc.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press and hold the <strong><span>Volume-up</span></strong>&nbsp;button and the
<strong><span>Power</span></strong>&nbsp;button on your Surface at the same time for at least&nbsp;<strong><span>15&nbsp;</span></strong>seconds, and then release both.The screen may flash the Surface logo, but continue holding the buttons down for at least&nbsp;<strong><span>15&nbsp;</span></strong>seconds.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">After you release the buttons, wait&nbsp;<strong><span>10</span></strong>&nbsp;seconds.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press and release the&nbsp;<strong><span>power</span></strong>&nbsp;button on your Surface to turn it back on.</span></li></ol>
<p><br />
</p>
</ol>
<p>If you can go into Windows after a 2 button shutdown, make sure you have all updates installed.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Let us know how it goes. </p>

            I get the exact same error, and that's after I cancel out of the Super Optimizer that pops up when I first restart it.&nbsp; I've done the volume up/power key restart at least 4 times, and it makes no difference what so ever.&nbsp; Why!?!?!?&nbsp; It was working fine
 the first two days after I bought it.&nbsp; Again, I get this error after it prompts me to restart and update.&nbsp; This sounds like it's an issue that microsoft needs to fix ASAP<br />

            It happened until I let it sit untouched for about an hour, while the update went on in the background.&nbsp; Doesn't windows test their updates before they release them?&nbsp; Thus, working out any possible issues like this BEFORE they happen?&nbsp; I just spent 1200
 on a surface pro 3 and didn't even make it 3 days before I was severely frustrated with the system.&nbsp; I expressed my frustrations to my boyfriend, and his response was "that would never happen with apple, because they always test their updates before they release
 them."&nbsp; Honestly.&nbsp; I much prefer windows, but maybe they should take a page or two from the apple books.<br />

<p>You are currently in a Windows 7 forum. I would ask the experts in a WinXP newsgroup about the System Restore issue.</p>
<p>If you prefer to run Windows 7 then you need to install Windows from scratch. Make sure you back up your personal files beforehand.<br />

<h2>            I am having many problems with my computer and I want to revert it back to factory settings.</h2>
                    <p>I installed a PC TuneUp from AVG which has resulted in many many problems including the removal of my CD drive.&nbsp; Everything has slowed down immensley and the only way I can see to get my computer back to normal is to revert to factory settings.&nbsp; I need to
 save my existing files and data but don't know how and what to buy to do this.&nbsp;&nbsp;My computer model is a Dell 3000 Dimension purchased in 2005.&nbsp; I am not very technical so any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<div><span>Hi</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<span><font>Thank you for your prompt reply.&nbsp; I think the information will be very useful in trying to sort out the problems.&nbsp; Will I need to save all my files before commencing rebooting?&nbsp; The answers to your initial questions are as
 follows:</font></span></div>
<div>
&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>1. Windows XP</span></div>
<div><span>2. I am not very technically minded and do not understand about booting to desktop.</span></div>
<div><span>3. There are several major problems -</span></div>
<div><span>- slow internet - in some instances it takes a long time to change between different websites and also in some cases I have to shut down either by using task master or when not available just clicking on the X</span></div>
<div><span>- problems transferring emails from my yahoo server page to&nbsp; my microsoft outlook - this takes two attempts with the first attempt bringing up an error message</span></div>
<div>
<span><font>- the desktop page has been turned from blue background&nbsp;to white background and the icons and wording beneath are blurred</font></span></div>
<div>
<span><font>4. the tuneup has removed my CD drive - is there any way I can reinstall my CD drive so that I can transfer files from the computer to CD disc for saving</font></span></div>
<div>
&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<span><font>I have already uninstalled the AVG PC TuenUp product from my computer but all the problems still occur.&nbsp; These problems only started after installation of the AVG PC TuneUp product.</font></span></div>

<div><span>Hi</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>Sorry for sending again but not sure if you have received this as my computer is, as I said before, not functioning correctly.&nbsp; My main concern is if I reboot, do I need to save my data first and how as I have no CD Drive working at the moment.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span><font>Thank you for your prompt reply.&nbsp; I think the information will be very useful in trying to sort out the problems.&nbsp; Will I need to save all my files before commencing rebooting?&nbsp; The answers to your initial questions are as follows:</font></span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>1. Windows XP</span></div>
<div><span>2. I am not very technically minded and do not understand about booting to desktop.</span></div>
<div><span>3. There are several major problems -</span></div>
<div><span>- slow internet - in some instances it takes a long time to change between different websites and also in some cases I have to shut down either by using task master or when not available just clicking on the X</span></div>
<div><span>- problems transferring emails from my yahoo server page to&nbsp; my microsoft outlook - this takes two attempts with the first attempt bringing up an error message</span></div>
<div><span><font>- the desktop page has been turned from blue background&nbsp;to white background and the icons and wording beneath are blurred</font></span></div>
<div><span><font>4. the tuneup has removed my CD drive - is there any way I can reinstall my CD drive so that I can transfer files from the computer to CD disc for saving</font></span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span><font>I have already uninstalled the AVG PC TuenUp product from my computer but all the problems still occur.&nbsp; These problems only started after installation of the AVG PC TuneUp product.</font></span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span><font>Regards</font></span></div>

Many thanks for your reply which is very helpful.&nbsp; Can you help me more by advising how&nbsp; I make&nbsp; a back up of the data before I revert back to factory settings as I do not have a CD driver at the moment.&nbsp; If I revert back to factory settings will this reinstall
 my CD driver?</p>

Hi again, sorry to be a nuisance.&nbsp; I am no further on restoring my computer as I need to save my data and emails before reverting to factory settings and I do not know how.&nbsp; You kindly responded suggesting a thumb drive but when I have asked people they do
 not know what this is.&nbsp; So I need to know in simple terms how when I revert to factory settings can I save my emails and folders and get my CD drive working again.</p>

    <title>Lost admin privileges on my account and cannot access built in admin - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> velvetsunshine  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lost admin privileges on my account and cannot access built in admin account.</h2>
                    <p>Hello!! I have had this issues for a while now and&nbsp;its really starting to grate on me, I have tried EVERYTHING and nothing works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, I somehow lost admin privileges on my account, every time I try and do something that needs an admin and the box comes up that says 'do you want to allow this app to make changes to your device', it says to continue&nbsp; enter admin account and username,
 however there is no where to enter this and there's&nbsp;no yes box, just a no box. So basically anything that needs an admin, I can't do, that includes doing a system restore, entering cmd in admin, and anything else.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore to this, I have tried to enable the built-in admin account through safe mode, this however requires a password, I have tried a host of password combos and even leaving it blank and not entering nothing, but it always says password is incorrect.
 I thought the builtin/hidden admin account did not have a password, however mine somehow does so I am completely lost on what to do!!</p>
<p>So frustrating.&nbsp;</p>

            You will probably not like my suggestion but really it is the only option.
<br />You will need to do a clean install from a bootable media tool.
<br />So sorry, but once you lose admin access with lost passwords there is no way around it.  No back door etc. 
<br />See link below by Greg on how to do a clean install of Windows.

    <title>Is it possible my xbox is fried&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tiger eyes33  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is it possible my xbox is fried&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>This is probably a first heard of case but, when I woke up this morning I had seen that my cat threw up on the solid top part of the xbox, the disc tray was also opened so a bit of vomit got on the tray as well. It had been on I wanna say roughly 4-6 hours
 maybe because it happened while I was asleep. I tried to turn it off but it wouldn't respond so I unplugged it, cleaned it off and it didn't look like anything got inside, and I just let it cool a couple hours. I plugged it back in and now it won't turn on
 and the disc tray is still open. I had tried switching the power box with the other xbox to see if it would turn on but it still won't turn on! Do I need to maybe get an extra power supply or maybe try it at a different wall outlet?</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Struggling to get audio working after I updated to latest version of Windows 10.</p>
<p>Audio driver seems to have disappeared and have tried searching to update to latest driver, but it says the best driver is already installed.</p>
<p>Tried reinstalling graphics driver but no avail. At first it wouldn't even recognise my external speakers EB321HQU NVIDIA High Definition Audio, after a reboot following the reinstall it is now recognising that as an output but not actually playing any audio
 through the speakers and does not recognised when I enter headphones so as is the computer is useless to me with the audio project I am working on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help appreciated!</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            Currently the latest update has been pulled due to major issues, audio being one of them.
<br />Quickly go back to previous build and get that update off of there.

<p>You could but I think they have started to crack down on people doing that. &nbsp;It is the same thing that people were doing a while back by changing the country of origin for their marketplace to get games through X1 cheaper. &nbsp;MS put a stop to it.</p>

<p>Good question. You may be able to. But I may be wrong, but I think with digital pre-orders they come out at the same time. It doesn't matter what time zone you are in. Microsoft may put them out a 12AM EST while it's 1AM somewhere else. Or maybe they wait
 til 3AM where most other time zones are nearing midnight. I don't know. </p>
<p>And you never know, maybe Microsoft has a rule against this and will ban your account for doing so. LOL.</p>

<p>No you cant do this. Watch Dogs released in the UK at midnight and no US gamers were able to access the UK store to begin downloading. More recent example would be Destiny.</p>

<h2>            Where did my cool little &#34;touch keyboard&#34; go&#63;</h2>
                    Okay so I do not have a touchscreen laptop, but there was a button on the bottom right of my screen that looked like a keyboard and it was called "touch keyboard." I used it because it had emojis and that was cool but now it's gone and I can't find it.
 The icon completely disappeared, and when I search my apps the only "touch keyboard" that comes up looks completely different. and doesn't have emojis. This isn't a super huge deal, but I'm rather frustrated. I have Windows 8.&nbsp;

<h2>            Online casino games not running anymore.</h2>
                    I install the last Windows update and since then when I go to play at an online casino any new games I haven't played that I try to download won't download and what used to take seconds now takes over 2 hours. I asked casino support and they said they
 are not compatible with Windows 7 and I need to run and different thing like Vista or XP. When I try and download a new casino I get the message the packet doesn't exist make sure you can access it blah blah blah. I just got this computer and Windows 7 was
 already on here and I'm really starting to hate it! Could someone please tell me how I can fix this?

<h2>            We need to verify your pin number. and app</h2>
                    <p>I'm so sick and tired of fighting off these scammers! I promise that if I could find out who or where they are I would pay to go there and smash their heads in!&nbsp; I just finished doing a Windows 10 reinstall without losing my settings and programs a day and
 half ago. This morning when I turned on the machine I got this pop-up shortly after everything had rebooted. It said that we need to verify your log-in pin number. Since I have been in the repair mode for a couple days I immediately typed in the 4 digit number.
 The pop up had the MS logo and appeared quite authentic. I have been around computers since '77 so I know a little bit about what I am doing. However, this pop up came at the right timing and without thinking I typed it in. Then another window popped up and
 asked for my password. Immediately, bells and whistles went off and I noticed that these pop ups occurred after my Outlook and Chrome had loaded up. Further, the pop up had an X in upper right corner. That told me this is not Microsoft? I X'd out and changed
 my pin immediately...so no harm no foul.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe this is a scam and I wanted to confirm that theory with others in this Forum? I appreciate your response. Thanks.</p>

<p>These pop-ups are the bane of computer users, I have found that using good adblockers, pop-up blockers can really help.</p>
<p>I currently use Adblocker Ultimate, its free on the Microsoft store....its unobtrusive, just sits quietly on your browser toolbar showing the number of ad's/ pop-ups blocked for each site you are on.</p>
<p>Since installing it I haven't seen a single pop-up. You can also disable it on a per site basis if you know its safe to do so if it causes issues (such as Channel 4's on demand service), but I haven't found any problems yet. I'm sure there are similar add-on's
 for Chrome, Firefox etc.</p>

<h2>            Wacom pen&#47;tablet malfunction with Windows 10 update KB4089848</h2>
                    <p>Hi!<br />
<br />
Windows 10 automatically updated me to KB4089848, and a very odd thing occurred.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
In Photoshop CC 2018 (and 2017, tested) - when using the Wacom Intuos tablet and pen, I can use the brush tool regularly on horizontal gestures, but when I begin using the brush with a vertical gesture - the brush tool immediately begins scrolling or panning
 down the canvas.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Vertical gesture input does not register the brush tool, but begins using the Hand tool. I have tried a series of solutions.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
From researching and testing on my own, I have found a few things.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
One, turning off the Windows Ink function in the Wacom settings fixes the issue, but without Windows Ink enabled you no longer get pen pressure sensitivity.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I tried "rolling" back the drivers by uninstalling them, but Windows would not allow me to uninstall KB4089848.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
There are several cases of this issues on the Adobe forums...it's kinda silly that this is the Creative update and it breaks the most popular tool by professional creatives. The Wacom tablet.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Here are some links to the Adobe forums for more evidence.&nbsp;<br />
</p>

<p>
</p><p>https://forums.adobe.com/thread/2470022</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://forums.adobe.com/thread/2460081</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are some workarounds but, they are not ideal.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Is there a way to completely roll back this update? Or, is there a hotfix that could be in the works?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for taking the time to read this :)</p>

            Hi Jofin
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Which version of Microsoft Office is installed?
<br />
<br />Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />taskkill /f /fi "SERVICES eq wuauserv" (Do this multiple times)
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.
<br />
<br />If that does not work..
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Run these codes:
<br />Net Stop bits
<br />Net Stop wuauserv
<br />Net Stop appidsvc
<br />Net Stop cryptsvc
<br />Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.bak
<br />Ren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2 catroot2.bak
<br />Net Start bits
<br />Net Start wuauserv
<br />Net Start appidsvc
<br />Net Start cryptsvc
<br />After running these commands, check if your issue is fixed. 
<br />
<br />Try this additional tips to see if they work:

<p>I'm in the U.S., so not familiar with setup in the U.K., but you should be using a MC remote with the MC IR receiver/emitter (blaster). Only an MC cmpatible remote will be recognized by a Media Center computer.</p>
<p>Normally, the MC IR receiver is plugged into the computer (USB) and the IR emitter is plugged into the back of the IR receiver with the business end stuck over the sensor on the samsung box.</p>

<p>HI JaimeLobo</p>
<p>Just to verify with you yes your are 100% right but for the Windows Media Center remote to learn the codes for the Virgin Box (Cable TV Box) I have to use the virgin remote with the IR blaster and that is where the problem is .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many Thanks for any help offered ....</p>

<p>That box does seem to work with MC, there are a few threads over at The Green Button site related. Don't know if it the same issue, but maybe something in there might help.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have one of these boxes from Virgin hooked up to 7MC and it's working fine.</p>
<p>Which step are you having issues with? Is it getting Media Centre to recognise the Virgin remote, or is it getting the V box to respond to IR commands from Media Centre?</p>

<p>Hi dark</p>
<p>I belive both , first of all the blaster device will not respond when i put the virgin remote to it to teach it the settings and my virgin box will not respond to any commands given by the blaster, its a bit of a gray area as to witch of the two is the problem,
 when virgin set you up did they have to program the ir blaster with a virgin remote or did it work straight off ?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Virgin don't do anything to make Media Centre work. They don't support it at all.</p>
<p>Top tips to getting the remote recognised would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>do this in a naturally lit room with no artificial lights on </li><li>not have direct sunlight hitting the IR receiver </li><li>brand new batteries in the Virgin remote </li><li>hold the remote literally just a centimetre or two away from the receiver when pressing the buttons</li></ul>
<p>Just to check - has the IR receiver been installed correctly by Windows? It shows up in Device Manager in the Human Interface Devices section as Microsoft eHome Infrared Transceiver.</p>

<p>Hi all</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry I have not got back to you in the last two weeks, so much going on ..</p>
<p>1. The problem seems to be when you go to programe the IR blaster it sees the signal from my Virgin Remote and goes throw the process of learning but it will not move to button 2 it stays on button 1 all the time, going throw the cycle over and over again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am holding the remote about 1 to 2 cms away from the blaster, I have tryed to different blasters and two virgin remotes, but it still wont work.</p>
<p>I am using windows 7 with ALL the updates..</p>
<p>I have tryed the advise from TGBmark1234 as well .</p>
<p>Many Thanks for any help</p>

<p>Wow, 5-8 feet is probably wall to wall in most UK living rooms. All I can say is that I've always had best results at the couple of cm range.</p>
<p>Ian, I'm confused why it's not working. But one thing to check: are you pointing the Virgin remote at the IR blaster or the IR receiver? They are different, and you keep saying blaster. The IR receiver is the match box sized and has a USB lead to the PC.
 Point your remote at the front of that. The IR blaster is a tiny bud with a sticky pad to stick to the front of the V box. It connects to the back of the IR receiver using a headphone style 3.5mm socket.</p>
<p>Only one last thing is that whilst my V box is Virgin branded, the remote I've got is a near ten year old ntl branded blue remote from when they first installed digital TV.</p>
