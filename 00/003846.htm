<h2>            Outlook.com&#39;s subfolders not accessible. Click on folder, just sits there, thinking...</h2>
                    I have two outlook.com's (previously hotmail) email accounts, and on one account only, you can click on any subfolder to see the content and the browser never goes there. It just sits there, thinking, forever. This has been going on for several days, even
 after I sign on and back on. What gives?

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Try clearing your browser's cache. This is to make sure that this is not causing the issue. Please click
<a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Clear-Your-Browser's-Cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a> for the steps. If this doesn't work, I suggest that you try it on a different browser.<br />
<br />
Thanks!

            Thank you for the advice, but it did not work, to delete the cache. I have been viewing my Outlook.com page for several months and I have had no trouble, until recently. I noticed that no other links on the page seem to lead anywhere, either. The only
 ones that work are the ones at the very bottom and in the colored banner, above. I don't want to use another browser. I am very happy with Google Chrome. I believe something is uniquely wrong, because I am not having the issue with the other email account
 I have using Outlook.com. How can I report a bug to Microsoft, so I can access my subfolders?
<div><br />
<div>Here's some background info: When I added an outside email address to my hotmail account, it created a second page where the address does not show up in the inbox, but as a subfolder. Is there anyway I can have the email go to the inbox, instead of a separate
 folder? Currently, the inbox stays empty at all times and I have to click on the subfolder to access the emails from my added outside account. Is this normal? What can I do about this? Please help. This problem with the folder links on the page besides the
 inbox is a completely new thing that had not happened for months, prior. Thanks! &nbsp;</div>

            Thank you, Vivien, but this did not work, either, because I am on Outlook.com, not Hotmail.com, nor can I change back to Hotmail, because the link that says "Switch back to Hotmail," is not working, just like the rest of the links on the page. Only "Sign
 Out" is working right now. Even when I sign off and back on, the same problem persists with Outlook.com, and on only one of my accounts. The other Outlook.com account works just fine. What could be the problem?

<h3> mikkol---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Ovi Maps &#43; GPX&#47;KML import</h2>
                    
<p>It would be great to get a GPS import (from GPX or KML for example) to Ovi Maps. Routing would be easy then for example to upload cycling routes available on the web to Ovi Maps account and sync it with the phone. The phone could then be used with cycling
 or hiking, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am working with landmarks, means single points in a row.</p>
<p>The route is then a series of landmarks, one after the other on the route.</p>
<p>That is not what you are asking for, but at least it is a help.</p>
<p>You can export from GoggleEarth, then convert to lmx, then load into your mobile.</p>

<p>I somtimes draw a track in Google-Earth.</p>
<p>Then export as kml or kmz file.</p>
<p>Then load it into a tool called Routeconverter... search the internet, you will find it.</p>
<p>Here you can preview again, clean up, move .... if necessary.... or you simply export as lmx.(Nokia landmark exchange).</p>
<p>That file then can be opened on your nokia with normal explorer, and will then display the single points as POI. You can now save them all, and they will then be stored in your landmarks, in a category called "no category"... from there you could mark them
 all and move them to a new category if you would like to ... do not need to.....</p>
<p>Now if there are many POIs in, then it needs some time before they appear on the map. If you immediatly open the map they are maybe not there... you have to wait some seconds. Just restart the map, and they will be then visible after some time. You could
 also use "display on map" which is available in the landmark-application, but you do not need to...</p>

<p>@dfrog: Check for Sports Tracker. I love that app. I posted the link for the very new version in this board... if your phone is not supported by that version then there are older versions out there. Maybe you have it already installed on your phone? (It
 was on mine...)</p>

            @noplayback I did it just the way you described it. The problem occurs when I try to open the .lmx file on the phone. Both the internal explorer and the external software "file explorer" (<a href="http://www.getjar.com/mobile/29142/the-ultimate-file-explorer-for-nokia-e71/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.getjar.com/mobile/29142/the-ultimate-file-explorer-for-nokia-e71/</a>)
 state: "Unknown file format. Cannot open files, only folders may be opened" when I hit "open". File permissions are set to read&amp;write.

<h2>            Office 365 email migration - If a job fails what happens&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>Hope this is an easy question to answer so here it goes.</p>

<p>If i have a job of say 20 email inboxes to migrate and one fails. Does that kill the entire job and none of the email boxes get migrated or is it the one mailbox that fails. Also if i view the more details of the failed job will it tell me the specific email
 box that failed and why it failed.</p>
<p>I am still new to the O365 environment just trying to get some answers to bring to my boss</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Nick&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Nick,</p>
<p>Other mailboxes can also be migrated successfully when one mailbox failed the migration. For the sencond query, yes, you can find the failed mailboxes in the report together with other detailed information of all the migrated mailboxes.You can find more
 inforamtion about the migration report in the following article: <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj898491%28v=exchg.150%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h3> eruditeprofundity  say:</h3>
<h2>            Writing different emails in TWO languages in Outlook 15 for Mac &#62; how to add 2nd language to Quick Menu&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I work in a bi-lingual country, that requires me to communicate in two languages.</p>
<p>I predominantly type in English(UK), which I want to retain as the Default language, and about 40% of the time, reply/write in the 2nd language.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both languages are fortunately supported by MS, but I'm hoping to set a small teak, to make switching between the two easier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Outlook 15.36 (170702) for Mac, when replying/typing a new email:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under [Edit&gt;Language], I have two options that appear in a sub-menu: [English(US)] and [English(UK)].</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Underneath</span> those two quick-options, is the [Language...] button. Clicking on that, brings up a further window, listing all the languages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently, when I want to type in my second language, I need to click on [Edit] &gt; [Language] &gt; [Language...] &gt; [select 2nd language from list] &gt; [OK].</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">That is 5 clicks in total.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>How do I get that 2nd language <em>into</em> the first submenu, as one of the two that appear under [Edit] &gt; [Language]?</strong></p>
<p>In other words, I want to replace the [English(US)] option on that first sub-menu, with my regularly used 2nd language.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PLEASE tell me this is possible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone? This would make a HUGE difference to my daily routine - all this clicking is driving the efficient me crazy! &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Erudite,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, it can be set up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please go to your System Preferences&gt;Language &amp; Region&gt;on the Preferred languages pane : Select whatever language you want to add or remove, it will reflect in your Outlook’s drop down list.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember restart Outlook after configuration and you will see it in the drop down list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Leo Zhao</p>

<h3> mommabear  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows update crashed my system killed it dead, replaced w&#47; a referb Dell e5510 first update damaged os,Tech replaced it  when it struck a 3rd time</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;I REALLY DID NOT LOOK FOREWARD TO GOING BACK TO MY COMPUTER GUY WITH A 3RD ONE IN 3WKS, I was already being questioned by my own family members who looked at me doubting everything I was saying to them , I really didn't want to see it or hear it from him
 too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>first hit was my 1 year old Acer Aspire ES1-512 on 12/26 killed it with in an hour.
</p>
<p>second was the first Dell Latitude E5510 refurbished by ACT bought 1/4/17&nbsp; received first update within 12 hours of buying it at 3:30pm&nbsp; the tech was kind enough to replace the unit with another just like it on 1/7/17 . the first one would reset the computer
 the unit then get stalled or stuck on the " Hi There" page </p>
<p>on the final unit I did not sign into my Microsoft account right away and first thing made a full recovery drive. I do not think I had given them enough time to assonate this unit with my account because on the sixth day of ownership but signed in to my
 account only a day or two but being cautious of the situation I first signed into one of my backup accounts not my main one that is connected to windows insiders . it was shortly after connecting it to windows insiders I started it up and it began running
 so slowly that a would have made a snail look like the Flash . l tried to run Defender but it would have taken it weeks to finish at the rate it was running so I did a reset first one was probably the killer one because I did it from the hard drive not my
 flash drive. I watched it reinstall the files but it too stalled out at the " Hi There"&nbsp; page , I would do 2 more from the hard drive before going for the flash drive . I tried to reset from the flash but stalled at that same page twice ( I REALLY HATED THAT&nbsp;PAGE)
</p>
<p>I decided that I needed to do a recovery instead It ran but stalled out requiring me to restart the computer I went to F12 to restart booting from flash drive when it ran it came on saying no boot media found I would do F12 4 x's from different locations
 and still received that message . I went online and ended up making 3 separate flash drives reformatted each of them twice before installing the data onto them each one&nbsp;would be&nbsp;wiped out when checked&nbsp;out on other computers&nbsp;it was like there was nothing there
 so I had to make a totally new windows installation &nbsp;disk .&nbsp;I completely reinstalled windows as if it&nbsp;was the first installation of windows but now it is not recognized &nbsp;by windows by its product key I have lost two computers to this and really thought I had
 lost this one as well, when I saw it come on and completely boot up I fell to my knees and cried I really didn't want to have to go back to my tech guy with a 3rd one in that many weeks.
</p>
<p>&nbsp; But I have found a glitch it's a small one considering what we&nbsp;just overcame but&nbsp;one I don't know how to fix&nbsp;myself . I cant seem to activate the new Windows though when I checked my windows dashboard &nbsp;list of devices it does show that it was connected
 to my account but it wont activate without me paying for a new product key . </p>

            <p>Office 365 was associated with a mail account that was designated by whoever set it up, the only way to to change the mail address used is by logging on to the MS Account, and changing there or contacting MS support - and I dont hold up much hope for you
 there - very bad move to allow some other party to install/setup your paid for Office version</p>

<p><span>For other computer mortals, this was my scenario:</span></p>
<p><span>1) old computer motherboard died and decided not to fix 3-yr old computer, purchased new</span></p>
<p><span>2) never stored Office Product key (no print out or email)</span></p>
<p><span>3) didn't want to pay for another</span></p>
<p><span>4) took hard drive out of HP Pavillion and put it in external HD reader enclosure so i could see old hard drive</span></p>
<p><span>5) downloaded&nbsp;Product Key extractor tools:</span></p>
<p><span>5-A.&nbsp; Belarc gave nice summary, but only for booted computer</span></p>
<p><span>5-B.&nbsp; NS Auditor found it, but would have been $29.95 to unlock the grail of my product key</span></p>
<p><span>5-C.&nbsp; Magic Jelly Bean found it for free:&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span><a href="http://www.magicjellybean.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>www.magicjellybean.com</span></a><span>
 They key as Herb noted was that you must run as administrator.</span></span></p>
<p><span>6)&nbsp; Plugged in the product key to my new Windows 7 operating system and office is on line and running
</span><span>you have to "Load a Hive" which is the external drive and go to /windows/ file then it will give all same info.&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>Web page button images are not loading or are otherwise invisible - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> patrickrudisill  say:</h3>
<h2>            Web page button images are not loading or are otherwise invisible</h2>
                    <p>Web pages are missing buttons/commands, and sometimes text.&nbsp; For example, almost all buttons on a web page have the red "x"&nbsp;and a&nbsp;blank box instead of the&nbsp;correct button image.&nbsp; However, some buttons don't even show up as a blank box... instead they are
 invisible phantom bottons,&nbsp;what I mean by that is&nbsp;if I place the cursor near a clear spot on the screen where a button would normally be, the description appears and my cursor becomes a pointing hand icon.&nbsp;&nbsp;On some pages&nbsp;there are also two fields of text that
 tend to overlap each other.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I have already tried the Microsoft Fix-it that resets IE but it did not change anything.&nbsp; Can anyone help?</p>
<p>From other post:</p>
<p>I have been having the same problems listed above bu the Microsoft Fix did not work.&nbsp; What can I try next?</p>

            <p><span>Hello Patrick Rudisill,</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you made any change son your computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Does it happen with any particular website or with all the websites?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Perform the following troubleshooting methods:</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to Optimize Internet Explorer and then check if this fixes the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps from the link “<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936213/ro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to optimize Internet Explorer</a>”, to Optimize Internet Explorer.</span></p>
<p><span>Don’t perform Internet Explorer reset if you have tried it before.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> If you perform an internet reset, all the settings and add-on will be deleted,
 and it cannot be recovered back.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Perform the troubleshooting steps from the link “<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-GB/windows-vista/Why-dont-some-websites-display-correctly-in-Internet-Explorer-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Why

 in the original post&nbsp;DO happen&nbsp;on all websites.&nbsp; Unfortunately none of the solutions you proposed fixed the problem.

<p>Two things you could try:<br />
</p>
<p>Try power cycling down your modem/router for 30 seconds and plugging it back. If that doesn't work try creating a New User Profile from within Windows and see if you're still getting the red x's</p>

</p><p>I have paid for a skype number for years, and also for the ability to make outgoing calls.&nbsp; As of a few weeks ago, people are unable to leave voicemail.&nbsp; There is no method that I have found after clicking through the spagetti of links to try to get help
 and GET THIS RESOLVED.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>There are doctors offices that try to call to confirm appointments, friends and family, the pharmacy, businesses. . . and no one can leave a message.&nbsp; This is a REAL PROBLEM and I have posted it and put it into feed back . . . how can you get a REAL PERSON,
 who will fix this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other point I don't understand is how can a big company like Microsoft have such crappy "service"?&nbsp; Why don't they want to help their paying customers?&nbsp; It makes no sense as far a doing business goes.&nbsp; You get customers and rather than fix their problems,
 they want to ignore them.&nbsp; This is stupid.&nbsp;&nbsp; WE PAY FOR THE SERVICE, not for NO SERVICE.&nbsp; What part of that is complicated?&nbsp;

</p><p>Please reply with a few more details, so we can assist or point you in the right direction to receive further assistance: what are you using to receive calls to your Skype Number on?&nbsp; If a computer or laptop, what operating system does it use?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please also confirm if you have updated your version of Skype recently, as this is an important detail.</p>
<p>

<p>The email I got said to reply so I replied to the email.&nbsp; I just realized that you probably meant to reply to the post.</p>
<p>Here's what I wrote:</p>
<p>I have a desktop with windows 7.&nbsp; The thing is, I have been using that for some time now and voicemail has worked fine.&nbsp; But about 3 weeks ago, it stopped taking voicemail.&nbsp; It hangs up after a few rings.&nbsp; I did go "check for updates" and it says I have
 the latest version, 7.37.0.103</p>
<p>I am sure the reason my pharmacy has called 5 times is because my prescription is ready but it would sure be nice for them to be able to leave a voicemail to tell me that.</p>
<p>Also, my contacts are messed up.&nbsp; I had one for, say, EconoFoods.&nbsp; I called it one day.&nbsp; Later on I was going to call them again and they were no longer in my contacts list and they weren't in recent calls., when I had called them just an hour earlier.&nbsp;
 I looked up the number and typed it in and it came up that I was calling EconoFoods, but they were still not listed in my contact list.&nbsp; So it apparently knows the contact name and number are there but it does not display them.<br />

    <title>Tab problems with Word 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> keithrimmer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Tab problems with Word 2010</h2>
                    <p>&lt;<em>moved from Windows 7 &gt; Windows Update and non-relevant replies deleted</em>&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I am creating page numbers for a Table of Contents, the numbers being set to the right of the page.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To ensure that the numbers are in a uniform column, I set the Right Indent Default setting set at 0 cm 'For this document only'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then create the required page number on the line where it is to be placed and use the Space Bar to move it across the page to the Right. &nbsp;To make sure that it is correctly placed I 'overshoot' &nbsp;the number so that it goes onto the next line down. &nbsp;I then
 use the backspace arrow key to bring the number back up onto the correct line and into position. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>HOWEVER at this point one of two things happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either the number automatically positions itself at a Right Alignment setting of -0.04 cm &nbsp;or -0.08 cm &nbsp;(this despite the default being set at 0.0 cm default); or the it &nbsp;repositions itself so that it is one space to the left of the number immediately above
 it (as below):</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;571 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 572</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once this 'repositioning' &nbsp;has occurred, the only way to bring the second (lower) number into line with the one above it is to move the Right Indent 'Pin' &nbsp;on the menu bar to the right and use the space bar to nudge the errant number into line with the one
 above it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>My questions are therefore:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why does the Indent Spacing alter despite being set as default for the document?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why do some, but not all, numbers reposition themselves one space to the left and resist efforts to place them in conformity with those above and below them?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no doubt a very simple solution to this problem,so any advice would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>It would appear that you are creating the TOC manually. You may want to consider generating it automatically (see
<span><a href="http://www.shaunakelly.com/word/numbering/tableofcontents.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.shaunakelly.com/word/numbering/tableofcontents.html</a>), in which case Word sets the tab stop automatically.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For a manual TOC, you should not be using spaces to position the page number. You should set a right-aligned tab stop where&nbsp;you want the page number to be. You then press
<strong>Tab</strong> to insert a tab character between the TOC entry and the page number. If you want period leaders, you can specify this in the
<strong>Tabs </strong>dialog.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You might also want to start with the Manual Table of Contents from the Table of Contents gallery on the
<strong>References</strong> tab. For more on this subject, see </span><span><a href="http://wordfaqs.mvps.org/ManualTOC.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://wordfaqs.mvps.org/ManualTOC.htm</a></span>&nbsp;and

            You should set a right aligned tab stop at the location where you want the page number to appear and then use a single tab space to locate the number there.&nbsp; Alternatively, if the page number is the only thing in the paragraph, format the paragraph so
 that it is right aligned.

            <p>Thank you Suzanne and Doug for your replies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suzanne: &nbsp;As per your advice, and having not attempted to create an 'automated' TOC before, I went to the link you suggested and followed the steps that 'Shauna' gave.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By way of background (I am using Windows 2010 BTW): The volume I am trying to create a TOC for is an academic treatise, 417 pages long, which has numerous footnotes, photographs, graphs etc., together with an index and bibliography; both of the latter being
 of considerable size. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the creation of an 'automated' TOC is new to me, I very carefully (and tentatively) did as Shauna suggested and, by way of experimentation, created a single entry as per Step 1 applying a Heading 1 style to the SINGLE &nbsp;entry (note that word, it is important).</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per step 2. I located and placed this single entry on the designated blank page which was to be the location for the table of contents, before hitting the &nbsp;enter key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The result was curious:</p>
<p>
</p><p>While the single 'Experimental' heading certainly appeared, it was accompanied by almost everything else which the book contained: Footnotes, graphs, lists of photographs, whole blocks of text from within the body of the work, and most of the contents of
 Bibliography; to a total of 107 pages!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was not quite the result I had expected!</p>
<p>
</p><p>As this is a consequence of the SINGLE entry previously referred-to, there is evidently a problem. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do, of course, have no idea what that problem might be, or why the programme has 'reacted' as it has, and a search of the internet under the search heading 'Problems with Table of Contents, Word 2010' has returned no results. This would seem to indicate
 that this 'problem' has evidently not occurred anywhere else.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the TOC is crucial to the work, and I would rather not have to return to 'manual' mode to create the TOC (a very long process), any thoughts or observations would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I look forward to your reply, along with replies from anyone else who might be able to assist.</p>

            <p>It sounds as if you're putting your heading on the page where you want to generate your TOC, which would not be typical. You should not have to generate any entries if the document already contains headings. You would instead, need to apply heading styles
 to the headings, or designate the current heading styles for inclusion in the TOC. If such a large quantity&nbsp;of your document is appearing in the TOC, this suggests that every included paragraph has an outline level other than Body Text.</p>

            <p>Thank you Suzanne and Doug.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I deliberately did not reply until I had successfully accomplished the TOC task, in case I needed to come back again with further questions that related to what I was doing. &nbsp;I can now report that the TOC has been successfully completed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, it has in turn presented me with another problem; the removal of the leader dot ('Dot leaders?) from the completed TOC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A ;Google' check indicates that while there are lots of 'How to's' to ADD the dots, there are only two about how to remove them, with these seeming to apply to earlier versions of Word than I am using.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Windows 7 / Word 2010 BTW.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When attempting to remove these dots from the completed TOC, I do the following (the arrows indicating the next stage in the sequence):</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right Click in body of TOC&gt;Edit Field&gt;Field&gt;TOC&gt; Table of Contents&gt; Heading 1&gt;Tab Leader&gt; (None)&gt;Modify&gt;Style&gt; TOC1&gt; Modify Style&gt;?</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this (?) stage a sample of text AND leader dots appears within large box in the centre of the page, yet no way of removing the leader dots is offered. What IS offered is &nbsp;as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>'Add to Quick Style List</p>
<p>
</p><p>Automatically Update</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only in this document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Evidently I am missing something important in the 'removal' sequence,, but I cannot work out exactly what it is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given the information I have provided, exactly how DOES one remove the leader dots from a Word 2010-generated TOC?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hoping that you are able to help, I look forward to your replies, or, if you are unable to assist in this instance, the replies of anyone else who might feel they can provide me with a 'removal' solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, thank you both for your assistance.</p>

            <p>If you neglect to select "(none)" as the tab leader when you initially insert the TOC (in the Table of Contents dialog), then you'll need to modify the styles. Since TOC styles all update automatically, all you [should] have to do is modify one entry at
 each level. Right-click in, say, a TOC 1 entry and choose <strong>Paragraph...</strong> from the context menu. In the
<strong>Paragraph</strong> dialog, click the <strong>Tabs...</strong> button in the lower right corner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the <strong>Tabs</strong> dialog, select the tab stop (if there is more than one) that represents the page number position. Under
<strong>Leader</strong>, select <strong>None</strong>, and click OK. This should correct all the TOC 1 entries. Repeat for the remaining levels.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you find that the entries <strong>don't</strong> update automatically (the example document I was working in is being balky), then use
<strong>Ctrl+Shift+S</strong> to open the <strong>Apply Styles</strong> dialog. This should display TOC 1 when you're in a Level 1 entry. Click the
<strong>Modify...</strong> button, and use <strong>Format | Tabs</strong> to modify the tab leader setting directly in the style.</p>

<h2>            HP ENVY 5546 Printing Problems&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a real problem with my HP Printer.</p>
<p>When I try to print anything wirelessly it only prints in Black and White. I can't print in colour at all?</p>
<p>If I revert the printer to printing through the USB socket, no problems at all. I can print in colour all I like!</p>
<p>The print preview image swaps from colour when I select the USB printer dropdown menu and goes back to Black and White when I switch back to wireless mode again?</p>
<p>It seems to be a wireless driver problem by the looks of it? Any Ideas??</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you're using Windows 10, you can sync calendar and contacts using People app and Calendar app. To assist you better, we'd like to verify if you want to remove the account from Outlook 2010 or delete the entire email account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to remove the account from Outlook 2010, calendars and contacts will also remove. However, you can disable send and received Mail options in Outlook for you to stop receiving messages while your calendars and contacts will work as before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To configure your Outlook on how to disable send and received Mail options, kindly follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click the <strong>File</strong> tab and choose <strong>Options</strong> under
<strong>Help</strong> and choose <strong>Advanced</strong> in the left pane. In other Outlook versions, choose
<strong>Options</strong> from the <strong>Tools</strong> menu and click the <strong>
Mail Setup</strong> tab.</li><li>Click the <strong>Send</strong> and <strong>Receive</strong> button in the Send and Receive section.</li><li>Select the account you're modifying (All Accounts might be your only choice), and click
<strong>Edit</strong>.</li><li>In the <strong>Account Options</strong> section, uncheck the appropriate option: Send Mail Items or Receive Mail Items.</li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong>, <strong>Close</strong>, and then <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to delete the email account, the calendars and contacts will also be remove/deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance.</p>

<p>I am going to delete the entire email account, the MS exchange account, as the domain name is no longer required as the business has folded.
</p>
<p>I will be keeping the two other email accounts in Outlook.</p>
<p>

            NO.<br />
<br />
Office 365 is explicitly designed to be installed along side of earlier versions.&nbsp; I don't expect any serious problems.&nbsp; There is only one issue I expect you to encounter. The Office 365 installation will take over the "Windows Default File Associations".&nbsp;
 So when you double click on any file, it will open in the 365 program.&nbsp; You can still use File Open inside of 2007 to open files<br />
<br />
I do agree with Doug's suggestion about upgrading.&nbsp; Unless you have an explicit business ($Money$) NEED for new features specific to 2013 you will probably be happier sticking with 2007 for a little longer.&nbsp; If you look through the forum, you'll see a lot of
 questions about Office 365 being flakey.&nbsp; Many people have problems simply installing it. And many others have problems keeping it working, all of a sudden, out of the blue 365 just stops working.&nbsp; I would wait a little longer until MS acknowledges and fixes
 these problems (another 6-12 months ... &lt;sigh&gt; ).<br />

 on windows 8 phone and it also does not have and file manager kind of app even if does not support a file format u cant delete it as there is no way of browsing the file.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Another disadvantage is that some apps only open files present on phone like pdf reader and all open pdf files present on phone only please provide an update or apps that can resolve those problems&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>and u cant sync ur phone with windows xp os only windows 7 and windows 8 support the sync when i plug my phone into the usb port it keeps on popping and driver msg and even if i allow the popup window to check for a driver it still cannot install the driver
 as a result i cannot connect my phone to my pc so that i can copy files from my pc to phone or phone to pc</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It really sucks pls provide an update or some solution as it would make it a great device and improve the OS performance</div>

            <blockquote>hey i'am unable to play video formats like .mkv,.avi and all on my nokia lumia 520 as i am only able to play .mp4 files when i copy mkv and avi videos on my phone or sd card the video's are not shown in the music + video list , its really a huge
 disadvantage on windows 8 phone and it also does not have and file manager kind of app even if does not support a file format u cant delete it as there is no way of browsing the file.
<div><br />
<div>Another disadvantage is that some apps only open files present on phone like pdf reader and all open pdf files present on phone only please provide an update or apps that can resolve those problems&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>and u cant sync ur phone with windows xp os only windows 7 and windows 8 support the sync when i plug my phone into the usb port it keeps on popping and driver msg and even if i allow the popup window to check for a driver it still cannot install the driver
 as a result i cannot connect my phone to my pc so that i can copy files from my pc to phone or phone to pc</div>
<div><br />
<div>It really sucks pls provide an update or some solution as it would make it a great device and improve the OS performance</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Hey there! I think that Windows Phone 8 does not support Windows XP anymore. Windows XP is ancient, really. An OS from 2000! Well, I know some people that still hang on to it but upgrade! ;)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Anyways, for the video format issue, it's known that the built in native Windows Phone video player does not support a lot of formats for video playback. Thankfully, VLC for Windows Phone (<a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=44fa83f7-a98d-4647-b9d4-c35ed729d0c9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=44fa83f7-a98d-4647-b9d4-c35ed729d0c9</a>)
 is being developed so hopefully you'll be able to play all those files on your Windows Phone in the future! (<a href="http://www.wpcentral.com/vlc-windows-8-win-phone-8-kickstarter-hits-target" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.wpcentral.com/vlc-windows-8-win-phone-8-kickstarter-hits-target</a>)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For now, if you want to play those video files on your phone, take a look at <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsphone/develop/ff462087(v=vs.105).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsphone/develop/ff462087(v=vs.105).aspx</a>. It shows the supported codecs for Windows Phone 8 at the moment, so to play those unsupported video files you have to convert them to supported video files. Try using
 the free tool Super at <a href="http://www.erightsoft.com/SUPER.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.erightsoft.com/SUPER.html</a>. A bit complicated, yes, but worth it if you need to convert them!<br />

<h3> jojogobi---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 1520 not connecting to known wifi access point</h2>
                    
<p>Since Cyan , my lumia 1520 occasionally fails to connect to known wifi access points like my home acess point. I havent been able to confirm a pattern yet, but in most cases a restart is required, or having to manualy reconnect by going to the wifi settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today for instance the router restarted, and all my devices reconnected except the lumia. Going to the wifi settings, the network was visible and listed, just no automatic reconnection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone face this ? any suggestions ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ever since cyan, while there are a few new features the overall consistency and stability seems to have gone.. with lots of niggly issues!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apart from restarting the phone and manually reconnecting to the WiFi network, what other troubleshooting steps have you tried so far?&nbsp;Since installing the Lumia Cyan SW, have you tried checking if the phone's system apps are updated? You can go to
<strong>Settings &gt;&nbsp;</strong>swipe to<strong> Apps &gt; Store &gt; Check for updates</strong>. BTW, you mentioned that&nbsp;this happens to known WiFi access points. Does this mean that the issue also happens&nbsp;when connecting the phone to&nbsp;other WiFi networks?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your response will be appreciated.&nbsp;:cathappy:</p>

            Since buying the 1520 the the wifi settings seam to have a mind of its own . I manually search and select my own Bt wifi secure network within my own home and then it randomly switches to btfon or other bt network .<br />
Also when I use the search location to identify my hotspot its many meters off and not located to my location. It is a major pain and not as seamless as other providers. Why ?

            I have all the way up to denim and randomly cannot connect to some WiFi spots. Usually if they are ad hoc, or even from my WiFi hotspot from tmobile.<br />

Usually a soft reset helps, though it is a pain.<br />

<h2>            Outlook 2013 attachments received and sent in jpg, word, pdf are either corrupt or if jpg open but are distorted.</h2>
                    <p>For example I received three jpg files in an email.&nbsp; One was OK the other two opened but the images showed only one large block of colour with small strips of colour.&nbsp; I saved them to hard drive and they could be seen as large icons but as soon as I click
 on the icon it reverts to the distorted image.&nbsp; Pdf attachments are giving the message - Can't open this file there's a problem with the file format and in preview the message is this file cannot be previewed because it is corrupted.&nbsp; Similar message for word
 attachments.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I'm using a new computer and all emails with attachments&nbsp;transferred across from Outlook 2007 are opening and reading fine.</p>

            I have a similar problem.&nbsp; Just installed Office 365 and tried to use Outlook 2013.&nbsp; Some pdf attachments give a message saying that they are corrupted.&nbsp; Others are OK.&nbsp; Outlook 2007 on the same machine looking at the same e-mails has no trouble reading
 these pdf files.&nbsp; Going direct to Hotmail using Internet Explorer also reads the attachments.&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried sending the same attachments to a non-Hotmail account and Outlook 2013 would not read them there either, while Outlook 2007 had no problem.&nbsp; This is all
 strong evidence of a problem inside Outlook 2013.&nbsp; Is it possible that Outlook 2013 is downloading the files as if they were ASCII?&nbsp; If so how do I fix this?

Thank you for choosing Microsoft Community and posting your query.<br />
<br />
Provide additional information:<br />
<br />
1) Are you able to download/save and then open the attachment.<br />
2) Is </font></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font>any previewer is disabled in Outlook 2013? Check for the same by doing the following:<br />

<strong><span>Trust Center</span></strong> &gt; <strong><span>Trust Center Settings</span></strong> &gt;

Microsoft does not support installation of the MSI version of Outlook 2013 side-by-side with an earlier version of Outlook. Check the following Tech Net article for more information regarding the same:
<br />

<br />
Hence existing of Outlook 2007 along with Outlook 2013 may cause conflict. Let's disable Outlook 2007 from Office installation and then check if the attachments work as expected in Outlook 2013. Refer to the following link for instructions on how to disable
 Outlook from Office installation:<br />
</font></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-in/help/install-or-remove-individual-office-programs-and-components-HA001234067.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://office.microsoft.com/en-in/help/install-or-remove-individual-office-programs-and-components-HA001234067.aspx</font></a><br />
<font><br />
</font></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font><font>If issue still persists, you may try the following instructions and see if it helps:<br />
<br />
1) Start Outlook in safe mode and verify the result. </font></font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font>* Hold <font><b>Windows key</b> + <b>R</b>.</font></font></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font>*</font></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> Copy and paste, or type the following command in the
<font><b>Open </b>box, and then press Enter: <b>Outlook /safe </b><br />
Note: There is space between Outlook and '/'.<br />
<br />
If Outlook safe works, disable the add-ins following steps mentioned below and determine the problem causing add-in:
<br />
<br />
a) Click on <b>File </b>menu, click <b>Options</b>, <b>Add-ins</b>, <b>Go </b>button besides Manage:
<b>Com-in Add</b>. <br />
b) Check if there are add-ins listed, clear the check box. <br />
c) Close the Office program and restart it. <br />
d) Disable each add-in one at a time, restart the Outlook, and repeat the above procedure. If the issue reappears again, it will help you to determine which add-in is causing this issue.<br />
<br />
Note: Check if you're </font></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font>able to download/save and then open the attachment.</font></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
<br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font>2) If issue still persist, create new profile and verify the result. You may refer to following Microsoft article for instructions on how to create new profile in Outlook:

<font>Hope it helps. Please take your time to try the suggestion and let me know the results at your earliest convenience.<br />
<br />
Thank You.</font></span></p>

<div>Thank you for a comprehensive reply. &nbsp;In answer to your questions and suggestions:</div>
<div><br />
<div>1. &nbsp;I can download the attachment but it will not open - it reports as being corrupted.</div>
<div>2. &nbsp;No previewer is disabled.</div>
<div>3. &nbsp;I have tried uninstalling Outlook 2007 but the problem persists.</div>
<div>4. &nbsp;I have opened Outlook 2013 in Safe mode and the problem persists.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have one further clue to the mystery. &nbsp;The same attachment in Outlook 2011 for Mac will open OK. &nbsp;If I forward the note to another account and try to open it in Outlook 2013 in Windows it will open OK, although the same note and attachment opened directly
 in Outlook 2013 is corrupt. It seems therefore as if the problem occurs when Outlook 2013 downloads the note and attachment. &nbsp;I have tried it from two different mail servers and both fail. &nbsp;Is it possible that Outlook 2013 is interpreting the pdf attachment
 as being an ASCII file when it is not?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks again for your help.</div>

<br />
<br />
Thank you for replying.<br />
<br />
Did you try checking in new profile?<br />
<br />
We might not be able to determine the reason as of now. <br />
<br />
Let's disable <em>'</em><strong><i>Enable Protected View for Outlook Attachments</i></strong>' option following below mentioned steps and verify the result;<br />
<br />
Open Excel or Word then click on <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Options </strong>
&gt; <strong>Trust center </strong>&gt; <strong>Trust Center Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>
Protected View </strong>&gt; uncheck '<strong>Enable Protected View for Outlook Attachments

<div>Thank you once again for your further suggestions. &nbsp;I disabled protected view as you suggested and tried to read a new pdf attachment and found that it did not get corrupted. &nbsp;This was great so I tried re-enabling protected view and found that it was still
 working, &nbsp;This either means that what you suggested has corrected something or the source of these pdf files has realised that there was something wrong with them and corrected it. &nbsp;Either way I am now happy that I can read them so job done!</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks again for your help</div>
