    <title>Microsoft Wireless Mouse 3500 and 4000 confusion - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microsoft Wireless Mouse 3500 and 4000 confusion</h2>
                    So I just went to Best Buy and check out the two mouse. The covers list the 3500 mouse with programmable button feature, while they don't list 4000 with it.
<div>The 3500's cover also actually list more features compare to the 4000's. They don't let me check the mouse out so I didn't want to buy it and get something I don't want...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I do my research online however almost everywhere says the opposite. As a matter of fact a month ago I could have sworn I saw the 4000 listed on amazon with "3-programmable buttons," which now decreased to only 1 programmable button...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It is also worth noting that I already got a 3500 from Amazon which has a bottom and inner design that looks entirely different from any images of the 3500 I can find online.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So what is going on? Are there many versions floating around? I am utterly confused.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I would really appreciate it if someone who know about the stuffs can actually help me rather than refer me to the phone support. I could promise you I checked all other support option and all else don't look the least attractive to me...</div>
                </div>

            I don't use MS mice, but do specifications for the ones in the links below match what you
<br />
think they should be ? They both have 1000 dpi (check the technical data sheet at the bottom<br />
of the description page - x/y resoluton &amp; tracking speed). <br />
The extra button is the only real difference from what I can see.<br />

            Well, part of my question is which description of the mice out there is accurate so I don't really "know" right?<br />
<div><br />
<div>Anyhow, your links quote Microsoft's product website for the description so if we use the Microsoft's website as our reference of "correctness," then they are accurate.</div>
<div><br />
<div>However, I don't live in Australia so using this website to get a mouse is really really unfavorable for me. Thanks for the help anyhow.</div>

            There are also Mwave shops in the USA (or used to be. That's where they started), but
<br />
I only linked to that site because it has accurate information.<br />
<br />
<i>"As a matter of fact a month ago I could have sworn I saw the 4000 listed on amazon with "3-programmable buttons," which now decreased to only 1 programmable button...<br />
</i><i>which has a bottom and inner design that looks entirely different from any images of the 3500 I can find online."<br />
</i><br />
Yes, well maybe your memory is incorrect... Also note that with many web sites they will have a<br />
disclaimer as to the accuracy of the photo.<br />
<br />
<br />
<i>"They don't let me check the mouse out so I didn't want to buy it and get something I don't want..."<br />
<br />
</i>Go back to Best Buy and ask them why the 'covers' on the mice have conflicting information.<br />
Challenge&nbsp; their integrity.<br />
<br />
Or find a retailer that will let you try it or return it within xx days/hours if it does not meet your<br />
expectations. But keep in mind you are looking at a 20- odd dollar mouse here.<br />
You can't&nbsp; expect the features of a Razer Deathadder ,&nbsp; Logitech G9&nbsp; or similar mouse.<br />

    <title>Expose discrete GPU selection to better support Freesync hack using - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Expose discrete GPU selection to better support Freesync hack using NVidia GPU.</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft,<br />
</p>
<p>You may be aware that a hack has been found to enable free sync using NVidia GPU's by outputting through an AMD APU or GPU and using that card to transform the output to a Freesync output. Apparently one part of the procedure that is missing is that Windows
 lacks the ability to properly select which discrete GPU is being used. You only expose it as a power-saving feature.<br />
<br />
Please provide this configuration feature in display settings.<br />
<br />
I want to use an NVidia card, but I want to use Freesync. NVidia will not fix this, it's up to you to start rolling out that kind of support. Further If it's possible to force Freesync support from within DirectX then you should do that ASAP. NVidia are acting
 anti-competitively and it fragments the market. It's just insane that If I change GPU's I have to also change monitors.</p>

            Hi Gavin.Williams, 
<br />
<br />They would need to somehow embed the different types of applications (NVidia control panel, GeForce Experience, AMD Catalyst Control Centre, AMD Radeon Settings, etc) into the Settings\System\Display options. However this would most likely cause a number of issues in regards to design, and the mismatch of data. 
<br />
<br />I've found the following article which is an interesting read in regards to NVidias G-Sync options (from <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3129276/components-graphics/why-amd-freesync-is-beating-nvidia-g-sync-on-monitor-selection-and-price.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3129276/compone...</a>):
<br /><pre><code>Nvidia’s answer: It’s about value, not cost
In an interview, Tom Petersen, Nvidia’s director of technical marketing, doesn’t dispute any of these concerns, and acknowledges that the high cost to develop G-Sync monitors puts them into a pricier segment of the market.
But to Nvidia, that’s okay, because G-Sync is supposed to be a premium product. The company points to several ways in which G-Sync is superior to FreeSync, including its ability to handle any drop in refresh rate—FreeSync only works within a specified range—and Nvidia’s complete control over things like monitor color and motion blur, which Petersen argues are superior to what monitor makers are offering outside the module.</code></pre>
<br />
<br />It seems NVidia is offering G-Sync as a 'premium' gaming experience. Do you change GPU's frequently? If not, I would suggest getting a G-Sync monitor and sticking with NVidia GPUs going forward.
<br />
<br />Also, as of recently, the noise about this GPU hack has increased, so perhaps NVidia will listen to their user base and allow for this to be toggled on or off easily. 
<br />
<br />All the best,
<br />Nathan       
        </p>

            My answer to NVidia's concerns : If they could support Adaptive Sync / FreeSync as well as GSync and allow the customer to choose which output to use, then there are no more concerns. Because i<span>f GSync is so much better as they claim, then those who
 want to spend the extra money on a proprietary display can do so and the rest of us can use FreeSync. It should be a clear choice to anybody who has the money to buy the GSync display, if it's that much better. To me however, FreeSync is obviously the better
 technology and the better choice and it's behaviour is within acceptable parameters.</span><br />
<br />
<span>"If not, I would suggest getting a G-Sync monitor and sticking with NVidia GPUs going forward." That statement is exactly my concern and many peoples concern, and it suggests to me that NVidia are acting anti-competitively, at least under Australian Law,
 in that they have created a market situation that places an unnecessary financial burden upon the customer to change to their competitor. And also make it impossible to use the competing adaptive sync technology. We are now at the point were we have no choice
 when it comes to GPU's. NVidia are the only supplier of performant graphics cards. And we are being forced to buy their GSync modules too.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It's true, people can't afford to change both GPU and Display regularly. Now we have a situation where our GPU and Display are locked together. That's madness, there's absolutely no point to it.</span>
<br />
<br />
Edit: For example, I have an AMD R9 390 GPU, I have to upgrade in a month or two. I will also need a new display next year. If I get the 2080 RTX, I have to buy a GSync display. I absolutely do not want a GSync display, I want a FreeSync display. But I don't
 have a choice with NVidia's current policy.

<p>I bought a used XboX360 yesterday. I only kept one username on there since he had a bunch of full games in memory.</p>
<p>I made a new account, put my credit card info in it. Paid for 3 months Live and 49.99 worth of microsoft points and started buying some games for my new account. Problem is, at some points the xbox asked me to confirm it needed to disconnect. I confirmed,
 it disconnected and the somewhere betewwn then and now it connected back with the original account and now all my microsoft points are on that account and the games I bought belong to that account... WTF... I need to change my credit card info from that account
 ASAP since I dont know if the guy will log in elsewhere and notice he has some microsoft points and bill my credit card for more... HHEEELLP</p>

<p>there is no way to transfer ms points</p>
<p>btw sharing accounts is not allowed</p>
<p>games on the hd is not transferable</p>
<p>because the credit card linked to a membership all you need to do is call xbox support</p>
<p>turn off autorenewal and request that xbox support remove the creditcard but those 50dollars of ms points and prepaid time is now lost</p>
<p>because the prepaid token will only be issued to the email connected to the account</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>this is why it is suggested never share account info ever</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>also accounts and DLC cannot be sold</p>

<p>When you got the console home you should have removed any and all previous accounts from the hdd as none of them were yours to begin with. The previous owner should also, for security reasons, removed the accounts before he/she sold the console.
</p>
<p>Nothing is transferable from one account to another including; gamer score, Live time, ms points, download content and certain game saves.
</p>
<p>Since you say it disconnected you and then reconnected you with a different account it leads me to believe you were not logged into the correct account when you added the ms points or Live time. If you were there would be no issue of it showing up on the
 wrong account. </p>
<p>You could try calling support for your region to see what if anything they recommend.

            Hi Larry,<br />
<br />
<p><span>Thank you for choosing Microsoft Community to post your question.</span> This could happen because of third party application interference or corrupt audio and video drivers.
<br />
</p>
<b><br />
Here are some troubleshooting steps&nbsp;that you can try to resolve this problem.<br />
<br />
</b>
<p><b><span>Method 1: Let’s place the computer in clean boot mode and play video and check if it makes any difference.</span></b><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Clean boot will help us to identify if any third party applications or start up items are causing the issue.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">To do this, follow steps from this link:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></p>
<p><b><span>Note: </span></b><span>After checking the functionality in clean boot, follow the suggestions under
</span><span>“How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot”.</span><br />
</p>
<br />
<p><span>If the above method does not work, go to next method.</span> </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><b>Method 2: Let’s update the both Video and Audio card drivers and check.</b></p>
<p>Download and install the sound card drivers from this link: <br />
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.asrock.com/MB/download.asp?Model=Z68%20Extreme7%20Gen3&amp;o=All" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.asrock.com/MB/download.asp?Model=Z68%20Extreme7%20Gen3&amp;o=All</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.asrock.com/MB/download.asp?Model=Z68%20Extreme7%20Gen3&amp;o=All" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
</a></p>
<p>Similarly, install the video adapter drivers from this link: <br />
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us</a></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>If the above method does not work, go to next method.</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><b><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Method 3: Let’s reinstall the sound card, video card drivers.</span></b></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Press <b>Windows key+R</b>, type
<b>devmgmt.msc, </b>hit<b> Enter</b></span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>In <b>Device Manager, </b>go to
<b>sound, video and game controller</b>, expand it.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Right click on the sound card listed, click Uninstall, and click Ok.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Restart the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly Uninstall display adapter drivers and restart the computer.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Now check if you can play the videos without any noises.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>If you face any further issues, please reply to this post and we'll be happy to assist you further.</span><br />

<p>I can't get my console on either. Set everything up correctly but when I press the power on button on front of machine it glows white for about 5 seconds and then goes off again and the power brick light goes from amber to white then back to Amber again
 straight away. This is so frustrating. Can someone from Microsoft please check this issue and reply to us.

<p>Ive just had the most ridiculous conversation with xbox support. Advised it was bad news and a repair is required, 18 day turnaround!! After asking to speak to his supervisor i was then informed microsoft have sent out an email regarding this 'bug' and are
 working on a resolution as we speak. Of course they are. The worst customer support I have ever received. I now await a call in two hours to be told this cant be fixed. My controller turns my xbox on but thats &nbsp;it. Ive judt been informed my xbox needs to be
 sent back, can you believe this is happening on launch day?</p>

<p>I know it sounds stupid, but I put the batteries in wrong. &nbsp;I looked at the metal springs and they have + and - symbols and the batteries were supposed to be opposite. &nbsp;Sorry if this was already attempted, but I thought I would add that.</p>

<p>I had this issue too. &nbsp;I fixed it in the following way:</p>
<p>- Turn off your Xbox by pressing the power button on the console itself (white Xbox logo).</p>
<p>- Wait for all the lights to turn off on every device (Kinect, controller and the console itself).</p>
<p>- Power on your console by pressing the white Xbox logo on the controller itself, not the console.</p>
<p>Everything worked as intended after that.</p>

    <title>Computer Doesn&#39;t Restart After BSOD Error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> reeseeverett  say:</h3>
<h2>            Computer Doesn&#39;t Restart After BSOD Error</h2>
                    I was watching a video on Microsoft Edge and suddenly, my computer bluescreened. Soon it was at %100, but it wouldn't restart. It was stuck saying it was at %100. My sister's computer doesn't ever even get the BSOD. I had to cold boot my computer to boot
 it up again. Could you help me find out how to make it restart after it's done collecting error info? It does this every time and for some reason. Every time I search up this strange error, I never find the same thing that's happening to mine. I tried looking
 through settings but I never found anything that said something about restarting after blue screen.

            Hi Reece,
<br />
<br />Sometimes Windows will no restart after a blue screen, it just sits there at 100% and as you found out a hard shut down is the only way . . 
<br />
<br />To diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .       
        </p>

<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />Detailed steps are in the article.
<br />We need log files(called dump files) that tell us what lead to crash.
<br />Please share them with us for a better analysis of the problem. Instructions can be found here:

<p>
</p><p>I updated my windows 7 to windows 10 64 last year. I want to make a copy of the windows 10 system files, in case I have to wipe my hard drive and do&nbsp; a clean install.</p>
<p>Advice to make a dvd of my current windows program. (In activation it tells me I have a digital entitlement?)</p>

<p>HI Kris,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Since you already upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10 last year, you will no longer need a product key for activation should you decide to perform a complete wipe and clean install. For more information about digital entitlement and how activation works
 in Windows 10, you may refer to this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12440/windows-10-activation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support article</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're trying to create a complete backup of the latest Windows 10 operating system, you'll need to create an installation media using the Media Creation tool. You may check this
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> for a thorough explanation of how it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the flip side, you can also create either a recovery drive or a system repair to back up system files.&nbsp; To create a system repair disc for CD/DVD, type
<strong>recdisc</strong> in Cortana/search bar and click the first result:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/20938aa2-9497-406e-9427-ccc91b5edf15" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/20938aa2-9497-406e-9427-ccc91b5edf15" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure to insert the CD/DVD in your computer's CD reader (or a portable CD reader if it's not available) and select the correct drive. Since this will back up a lot of files, it will take some time to finish:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/44bdd0f6-4b49-402b-b4fa-b730b6b25667" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/44bdd0f6-4b49-402b-b4fa-b730b6b25667" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you prefer using a USB or thumb drive, you may refer to this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/3a747883-b706-43a5-a286-9e98f886d490/create-a-recovery-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support article</a></strong>

    <title>Windows 8 &#34;The Default Gateway is Not Available&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> victor vondoom  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 &#34;The Default Gateway is Not Available&#34;</h2>
                    Like so many others, I too am having this issue.&nbsp; The basics are as follows:<br />
<br />
Windows 8 Pro on a custom rig.<br />
I was playing Guild Wars 2, which froze, requiring a reset.<br />
After rebooting, my network connection no longer worked.<br />
I'm using a wired connection to a wireless access point.<br />
The access point is correctly configured (verifiable on other systems).<br />
I am using a static configuration (DHCP is not an option), it is configured correctly, and has worked for a year or so until now.<br />
Connecting the PC directly to the router is not an option either.<br />
The Unknown Network error only seems to show after some data is sent to the router.<br />
Automated repairs will reset the adapter and clear the error (default gateway...).<br />
Attempting to do anything online will cause the error again.<br />
The error prevents the PC from accessing the access point's web based utility.<br />
<br />
I've refreshed Windows (I wouldn't recommend it to anyone; you will lose all your installed programs), and the error remains.<br />
I've already run sfc.<br />
I've already confirmed the ethernet cable is good, as is the rest of my networking hardware.<br />
I have power cycled and rebooted everything.<br />
I have also disabled the PC's ability to put the network adapter to sleep.<br />
<br />
Is Microsoft any closer to fixing this error yet?&nbsp; Has anyone had permanent luck fixing their errors?<br />
<br />

            I managed to fix it.&nbsp; Turns out it wasn't a software issue at all.&nbsp; I installed an extra fan after Guild Wars 2 crashed, since I had the space and the fan.&nbsp; Apparently, the .35A draw on the optional fan pins, on the motherboard, caused the network adapter
 to stop identifying any kind of network connection (they are in very close proximity).&nbsp; I completely forgot I installed it and, being an unrelated piece of hardware, it never occurred to me.&nbsp; Especially since my power supply is more than adequate for my PC.&nbsp;
 As soon as I removed the fan and booted the computer, the adapter immediately recognized my network and connected to the internet.&nbsp; Next time, I'll just use a splitter and hook them up to the fan controller.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the reply.<br />

<h2>            Issue with gifting a game</h2>
                    <p>I just bought the digital version of Black Ops 4, and now I want to buy another copy to gift to a friend. But when I go to the store, it only gives the me option to install the game because I already own it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there still a way to gift a game through Xbox Live, or do I just need to send him 60 bucks so he can buy it himself.</p>

            I don't know if it's because it's still a pre-order, but that game can't currently be gifted (gifting is still a thing but not all games can be gifted). You could buy an Xbox gift card and give him the code. You can get digital codes through microsoftstore.com
 or places like Amazon.

<p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried all the above, and every other suggestion I could find on the internet. Updates, fixes, reinstalls, deletions, fresh install yadda yadda.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Turns out it was the simplest of things and I guess that both my problems were due to the same thing as they're now fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While looking through all the options in edit/preferences I clicked on language just out of curiosity and there was an option of English (United Kingdom) so I selected it rather than English. It fixed the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How dumb is that, its not under area or location just language.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hate iTunes with a passion, its the dumbest most awkward interface I've ever used and just seems to get worse with every update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I didn't have an iPhone as a company phone, I'd have an Android phone.</p>

<p>Hi Reichl,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do any of the below conditions apply to your account?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>There’s a few things that can stop an account from being able to migrate.
<ul>
<li>If an account is suspended (either due to Enforcement action or due to billing) then it can’t migrate until that is resolved.&nbsp;
</li><li>Any accounts that are currently a part of an Xbox Entertainment for All plan won’t be able to change regions until that subscription is over.
</li><li>If you are a minor in your current region and would <i>not</i> be a minor in the target region (or vice-a-verse-a) you will also be able to change.&nbsp; So it’s got to be minor in both or adult in both!
</li><li>Finally, region migration is only available once every 90 days, so if you’ve migrated your account before less than 90 days ago, that’s going to also prevent the migration from going through.
</li></ul>
</td>
</tr>

<p>Well, I think that my answer is no.</p>
<p>- I have no information that my account can be suspended (so I think that is not)</p>
<p>- I dont think that I am part of something like that, unless its live rewards, because Im in this program (but my gf not and this profile also wont migrate)</p>
<p>- what is "not be a minor in your country"? I dont understand (my english is poor)</p>
<p>- I have never been migrated</p>
<p>But thanks for reply.</p>

    <title>x64 - Network&#47;DNS&#47;DFS issue - HP DC7900 &#40;Intel 82567LM-3 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> 2way technology  say:</h3>
<h2>            x64 - Network&#47;DNS&#47;DFS issue - HP DC7900 &#40;Intel 82567LM-3 NIC&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I'm experiencing a problem with Windows 7 Pro x64 when installed onto the HP DC7900 SFF.<br />
<br />
7&nbsp;appears to be having some sort fo DNS resolution issue and it seems to&nbsp;only happen when installed on the DC7900 (SFF) which&nbsp;just so happens to be&nbsp;using the Intel 82567LM-3 NIC (known to be probelmatic). I'm not 100% convinced it's the NIC just yet as the
 symptom can be resolved using a feature of Windows, but what that feature does&nbsp;remains a mystery.<br />
<br />
The first symptoms are: when logging onto Windows&nbsp;(authenticated by Windows 2003 AD which is running DNS and DHCP) the roaming profile is not applied, redirected folders error out and the login script doesn't get executed - so no mapped network drives appear.
 There is then a pop-up from the Action Center alerting the Roaming Profile could not be applied and there were no Netlogon servers available.<br />
<br />
As part of my troubleshooting, I have&nbsp;observed the NIC takes an long time to obtain an IP address from DHCP when released/renewed and Windows seems to 'identify' the network every so often.<br />
<br />
When the problem is occuring I'm unable to browse the dfs using\\LAB-DOMAIN\DFSRoot, although using
\\LAB-DOMAIN.fqdn\DFSRoot&nbsp;will work.<br />
<br />
Because everything in&nbsp;the organisation is tied back to \\LAB-DOMAIN\DFSRoot, changing this would be a large job and realistically it would only be masking an underlying problem.<br />
<br />
The only way I can get the machine to recognise and use \\LAB-DOMAIN\DFSRoot is to use the Troubleshooting Assistant which pops-up when attempting to map a drive using the DFS&nbsp;path&nbsp;which Windows can't for some reason resolve. Once the troubleshooting
 assistant does its thing, everything appears to work fine until the machine is rebooted. Then you have to go through the manual steps to get it working again.<br />
<br />
The most interesting part about the DFS resolution issue is ocassionally one share will resolve and it just so happens to be the last share added to the DFS root.<br />
<br />
<br />
So far I've tried all sorts of things to resolve this problem&nbsp;including:<br />
<br />
* Reinstalled Windows 7 numerous times<br />
* Trialled 3 differenet versions of the NIC driver from Intel and HP - currently using the native driver v10.5.1.0<br />
* Upgraded BIOS firmware<br />
*&nbsp;Enabled Port Fast on the switch<br />
* Turned off Power Saving on the NIC<br />
* Hard set the NIC speed from Auto to 100 Full<br />
* Trialled the ExpectedDialUpDelay registry key - see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/938449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/938449</a><br />
<br />
<br />
None of the above produced any result.<br />
<br />
<br />
Event errors observed&nbsp;include:<br />
<br />
This computer was not able to set up a secure session with a domain controller in domain&nbsp;LAB-DOMAIN due to the following:</p>
<p>There are currently no logon servers available to service the logon request.</p>
<p>This may lead to authentication problems. Make sure that this computer is connected to the network. If the problem persists, please contact your domain administrator.</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL INFO</p>
<p>If this computer is a domain controller for the specified domain, it sets up the secure session to the primary domain controller emulator in the specified domain. Otherwise, this computer sets up the secure session to any domain controller in the specified
 domain.<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The Group Policy Client Side Extension Folder Redirection was unable to apply one or more settings because the changes must be processed before system startup or user logon. The system will wait for Group Policy processing to finish completely before the
 next startup or logon for this user, and this may result in slow startup and boot performance.<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<span><br />
<span><br />
The processing of Group Policy failed because of lack of network connectivity to a domain controller. This may be a transient condition. A success message would be generated once the machine gets connected to the domain controller and Group Policy has succesfully
 processed. If you do not see a success message for several hours, then contact your administrator.<br />
</span>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<span><br />
<span><br />
The application-specific permission settings do not grant Local Launch permission for the COM Server application with CLSID
</span></p>
<p>{24FF4FDC-1D9F-4195-8C79-0DA39248FF48}</p>
<p>and APPID</p>
<p>{B292921D-AF50-400C-9B75-0C57A7F29BA1}</p>
<p>to the user NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM SID (S-1-5-18) from address LocalHost (Using LRPC). This security permission can be modified using the Component Services administrative tool.<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt; I've looked this up, the ID is for the NAP and I can't change the security in dcomcnfg as it's all greyed out.<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>There are currently no logon servers available to service the logon request.</p>
<p>This may lead to authentication problems. Make sure that this computer is connected to the network. If the problem persists, please contact your domain administrator.</p>

<span><br />
<span><br />
The name "LAB-DOMAIN :1d" could not be registered on the interface with IP address 192.168.2.112. The computer with the IP address 192.168.2.10 did not allow the name to be claimed by this computer.<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<span><br />
<span><br />
Name resolution for the name WIN7X64.LAB-DOMAIN.local timed out after none of the configured DNS servers responded.<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
NONE of the other systems on the LAB-DOMAIN are experiencing this problem so I'm confident this isn't an actual DNS/DHCP or DFS issue. There is 2&nbsp;Windows XP machines and another Windows 7 machine - though both are on different hardware (DC7600 with Broadcom
 NIC and an Asus Laptop). All of the other computers are working fine.</span></span></p>
<br />
Can anyone offer any suggestions?<br />
<br />
thanks,<br />

            Hi Kerry,<br />
<br />
I tried a number of things but still haven't got this working.<br />
<br />
HP is replacing the MB tomorrow, hoping it will be with the Broadcom NIC instead of the Intel.<br />
<br />
<br />

<h2>            There is no red color on the monitor&#33;</h2>
                    <p>As always, I've got a problem with Windows.</p>
<p>Win ver: Windows 8 Build 9600</p>
<p>Downloaded the ISO today from the Microsoft website</p>
<p>Now, my problem is I can't see the red color! There is NO red color!</p>
<p>The computer I'm using is pretty old, but...</p>
<p>It have only VGA, I have two monitors, with one of them everything is fine and working, with the other one there is no red!</p>
<p>I opened the Intel Graphics Control Panel, I tried to change the Red color in RGB settings and nothing happened, but when I changed green or blue it changes instantly...</p>
<p>My graphics driver are up to date (I tried updating them, now I'll try deleting the driver and restarting the computer but I don't think it's gonna work, I'll let you know)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here it is where I change the colors, when I change the red one NOTHING happen.</p>
<p>Please help... I really don't know what to do.. It's not a cable fault because I tried the same cable for both monitors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT:</p>
<p>My picture where I showed the Graphics Panel (a really old one) got removed don't know why .-.</p>

<p>I solved this.</p>
<p>Now I'm gonna explain, I'm not good at it so...</p>
<p>Let's call the first monitor (the problematic one): Seba;</p>
<p>And the one working fine: Giulia.</p>
<p>Now... I just switched to Giulia (which supports 75hz) and set the frequency to 75hz and switched back to Seba (which doesn't support 75hz) and the graphics panel set the frequency automatically to 60hz and now everything works, it could be because before
 I tried the monitor that had problems in the PC I used the other one (the one who was fine) and I set the frequency to 75hz, switched to the one which doesn't support it, had problems with the frequency (like the screen flickering or something) so I changed
 the frequency to 60hz with the working monitor, and everything got green, maybe for the integrated GPU or for something else it was not changed and was still to 75hz, so that may be the thing that screwed up everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this has solved someone's problem (I don't think so because everyone now have Windows 10...).</p>
<p>Have a nice day!</p>

<h2>            Should a Pentium D 945 3.4Ghz compatible with Windows</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is a Pentium D 945 3.4Ghz compatible with Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to the Windows 10 app it isn't, but I've been looking around and there seems to be some problem with the app indicating CPUs aren't compatible even when they really are.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what to believe at the moment, I think I've done everything to ensure I've got the patch for the app, it would be most useful to know if the CPU is actually at fault or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to upgrade from Windows 7</p>
<p>
</p><p>kind regards</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. I will certainly help you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate if you could answer few questions to narrow down the issue and to provide you better assistance.</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the make and model of your PC?</li><li>Does the app shows any other driver incompatibility issue along with this?</li></ol>
<p>I would like to inform you that if Get Windows 10 app is showing processor incompatibility then it’s not recommend to upgrade to Windows 10. Upgrading process to Windows 10 will again run compatibility check and will not allow device to upgrade.</p>

            After accepting the Windows 10 offer and then getting a popup that my Pentium 4 computer hardware was not compatible, I purchased a Pentium D 945 chip for $5 on Ebay and carefully switched it out with my Pentium 4 cpu in late September 2015 but again got
 the popup that my hardware was still NOT compatible. However, 2 weeks later I got another notice again offering Windows 10 and so made a 2nd attempt. Voila!!! My Pentium D 945 machine with 3 gb ram and Windows 7pro and NO separate video card is now getting
 the free Windows 10 pro upgrade!!!! Microsoft must have decided to go ahead and let a tightwad like me to move up to&nbsp; Windows 10 rather than let me weasel out a few more years of life out of Windows 7pro.

            <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for replying I'm glad you had success as well. What I found to work was to download an iso file from the link below it seems to have a different opinion about how compatible my computer was. It installed with no problems at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 runs fine on a D 945 machine it was ok with 2gb of ram but uprated to 4gb.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes I'm too tight to spend lots of cash managed to upgrade for around £15, all second hand parts through ebay amazingly cheap considering all the development that goes into them which just ends up junk in the end to some people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry I meant to update this thread but I forgot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chris</p>

            I am writing to you from a Dell OptiPlex GX620 Slim, in which I upgraded the cpu from a Pentium D 820 to a Pentium D 945.&nbsp; I am running Windows 10 Home Prem. 64-bit with no issues.&nbsp; The upgrade App in Windows 7 also reported my cpu as being incompatible
 before and after I upgraded the cpu.&nbsp; I went ahead and downloaded the Windows 10 Install Media Creation Tool and commanded the tool to upgrade this pc, and here we are, functioning fine.

<h2>            Windows Live Mail Inbox too light to be legible</h2>
                    I have just upgraded from Outlook Express to Windows Live Mail.&nbsp; The color of the list in the inbox (and all other folders) is so light that it can barely be read.&nbsp; The paintbrush offers 12 pastel colors, And More Colors.&nbsp; The More colors does not work.&nbsp;
 I have tried the Appearance change for 3d objects and it does not solve the problem but changes the entire Windows color scheme.

<p>A workaround is a simple message rule.</p>
<p>Box 1: Check: For All Messages.</p>
<p>Box 2: Check: Highlight With Color. Click on the blue Color and choose Black, (Not default).</p>
<p>Name the rule.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 keyboard input at Software freezing</h2>
                    <p>I've upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10 (1709 build 16299.64) via USB today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the upgrade, there is problem with keyboard. </p>
<p>Nothing appears when typing at Home button or Cortana. When you type at whatever software, the software hangs and has no response.</p>
<p>When I install software, I have no problem in typing the admin password. Also, I have no problem when typing in command prompt.</p>
<p>There is no problem when remoting to other computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried already the following but problem still exists:</p>
<p>1. Replace keyboard</p>
<p>2. Switch to other user accounts</p>
<p>3. Uninstall keyboard driver</p>
<p>4. Troubleshoot keyboard at Setting -&gt; Update &amp; Security -&gt; Troubleshoot (no problem found)</p>
<p>5. Reinstall Win 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any other things I could do? Thanks for your assistance.</p>
<p>

            We appreciate the information that you have provided, Leo. Since the issue persists even when you have the updated drivers installed on your PC, we recommend that you contact the manufacturer of your keyboard. This is for them to verify if your keyboard
 is compatible with your Windows 10 PC.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you need further help with any Windows issue.

<h2>            BEX64 error related to PortableDeviceAPI.dll</h2>
                    I've started getting this whenever I try to browse files on my Sony mp3 player. I have to restart Windows explorer. My drivers are up to date.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I can plug it in fine, but not access any of the files through explorer (which is the only way I have access to them). I thought I might have broken the mp3 player, so bought another one, but it's the same error. Both mp3 players work fine on other versions
 of Windows 7.<br />

<p><em>explorer.exe.1212.dmp the assembly instruction at <b>PortableDeviceApi!_GSHandlerCheck+13</b> in

<p>What I would suggest is to update the PortableDeviceApi.dll by installing Service Pack 1 for Windows 7.</p>
<p>If you open Windows Update and "Check for updates" is Service Pack 1 offered as an "Important Update"?</p>
<p>If so, can you install Service Pack 1.</p>
