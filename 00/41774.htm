            It depends of what kind of device you talk about. THere is 2 types of microsoft styluses. First and second generation of surface pro, they were using wacom emr tech. Everthing made after so surface pro3/4 laptops etc. uses ntrig. Those pens can be easly
 recognized cause wacom emr do not need battery to work.<br />

<h3> localh3ro  say:</h3>
<h2>            Missing Icon Labels in &#39;My Computer&#39; Folder</h2>
                    For some obscure reason the icon labels have vanished in the 'My Computer' folder but are present in every other folder.&nbsp;My default view for each folder&nbsp;is 'Large Icons'&nbsp;but if I cycle through the view options for 'My Computer' the names reappear when
 view mode is 'List', 'Details' or 'Tiles'. <br />
<br />
As for Hardware configuration etc all my drivers are upto date and I keep my registry in order with Registry Mechanic so no faults there as far as I know. For what it's worth though I'm running Vista Home Premium on a HP M9265 UK 2.4 Ghz Quad Core 3Gb, GeForce
 8600GT. More details available if needed.<br />
<br />
It's not a major problem, just an annoyance, but one I'd be grateful for help fixing.

<h2>            Importing Photos Directly from Camera not working</h2>
                    <p>When I attempt to import photos from my Nikon D90 camera via USB port, Windows 10 does not recognize the photos at all. It doesn't matter which app/ software I use to attempt the import, Windows 10 does not "see" them. I did not have this issue at all prior
 to the upgrade. I changed SD cards in my camera because SD cards can become corrupted from time to time. This had no effect. No matter what, this seems to be a major bug in Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, I cannot import photos to my machine at all!! HELP!</p>

            <p>Similar to&nbsp;Jan's description, since my upgrade to Windows 10 (from 7) photos&nbsp;on my Nikon D90 are no longer recognized as photos.&nbsp; I have been using this camera connected to my Windows 7 laptop for several years, so it is not a new device.&nbsp; I have tried every
 USB port on my laptop, have restarted several times, all with no success.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that the computer is recognizing the attached device, as it asks what I'd like to do when this device is connected.&nbsp; I chose "Upload photos and videos", then it searches the device and finds no photos.&nbsp; The specific message is: "No Photos or videos
 were found on this device."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Per your instructions I tried inserting the SD card from my camera directly into my SD reader on the laptop.&nbsp; That does work, and I am able to upload the photos.&nbsp; At least this is a workaround until the real issue is found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your assistance Vijaya.</p>
<p>Mike</p>

<p>I only have a micro sd card slot on my machine. Using a microsd + sd adaptor is not a good work around for me at all. It slows down the shutter speed of my camera and that's not acceptable. Please file a bug fix request for this issue. Thanks.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>-- There's not a driver issue. As another commenter said the machine recognizes the D90</p>
<p>
</p><p>-- The troubleshooter found no issues. </p>
<p>
</p><p>-- Again, the drag and drop method is very very very impractical for avid amateur photographers (myself) and is completely unacceptable to the professionals.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your responses Vijaya. I think they're a good response for novice computer users or camera users and all the suggested steps were followed.</p>

            <p>My husband and I both rolled back to Windows 8. The photo import issue is a pretty big deal for me. I use my PC mostly for photos and a few other odd tasks. My husband uses his Surface Pro 3 for work and the wifi issues and the freezing was unacceptable
 performance. We'll wait out the bug fixes and upgrade later.... :/</p>

            So far nothing works. Have eliminated the memory card as the issue, now think it may relate to the Photo Gallery portion of Windows 10 BUT no one from Microsoft has addressed the issue yet.

<br />
<br />Downloading the ISO file
<br />
<br />An ISO file is a digital or virtual replica of a physical disc. In order to use an ISO you must burn it to a optical disc. In the case of Windows 10, a blank Dual Layer DVD or an empty USB thumb drive. If you are using Windows 7, you can create the .ISO then burn it using the built in Disc Image utility. If you are running Windows XP or Windows Vista, you can using a third party burning tool such as ImgBurn or Roxio/Nero. 
<br />
<br />Creating a .ISO file
<br />
<br />For the purposes of this exercise, we are gonna use the .ISO option. 
<br />
<br />Select ISO file, then click Save, Select your location then click Save. 
<br />
<br />Wait while the .ISO image is created. 
<br />
<br />Performing the upgrade:
<br />

If setup does not start automatically, click Start &gt; File Explorer &gt; This PC &gt; open the drive containing the Windows 10 setup files, then double click Setup.exe.
<br />
<br />Click Run setup.exe
<br />
<br />Wait while setup is initialized.
<br />
<br />You can select download and install any important updates before upgrading. This is recommended since it can help to ensure a smooth upgrade. If you are not connected to the Internet, select the Not right now radio box instead. Click Next.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup checks your system for compatibility issues.
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup does one final check to ensure your system is ready.

<h3> melissatronic  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 2 - No Pro Pen Support</h2>
                    <p>I just purchased a "factory"&nbsp;refurbished Surface Pro 2 and also a Pro Pen (the pen made for the SP/SP2).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been trying to get the pen to work, but to no avail.&nbsp; I've tried soft reboots, updates and hard reboots multiple times.&nbsp; I've checked and the system tells me I have a Surface Pro 2&nbsp;running Windows 8.1 Pro.&nbsp; Updating to Windows 10 seems to invite more
 issues with the pen from my online research.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No matter what I do, the pen doesn't work at all.&nbsp; Touch&nbsp;works fine.&nbsp; I did note that under "Pen and Touch" there is no option for the pen nor is there any way to activate/deactivate it.&nbsp; It doesn't seem to exist, which makes me think I'm missing a driver
 or something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried downloading drivers directly from Wacom, but this only caused the hardware buttons to cease to function, so I removed it.&nbsp; It didn't make the pen work anyway.&nbsp; I do have a "HID-compliant-pen" driver that says it is active and&nbsp;up-to-date, however.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how to get the pen to work in this situation?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 3 - Windows will not start</h2>
                    <p>Hello, all.<br />
<br />
(A) is the problem, (B) is a list of results from my trials and errors, (C) contains links to screenshots of potentially relevant system output/information, and (D) is a list of problems I am currently working on solving / options I am considering
<br />
(A)<br />
TL;DR -- SP3 was restarted during update (stuck at 8% for 4 hours), now Windows does not boot after initial surface logo.<br />
<br />
Surface logo --&gt; choose a keyboard --&gt; choose a language --&gt; choose a (recovery) option<br />
These cycles take from 20 minutes to an hour. Called microsoft; they weren't sure why the delay was there.<br />
<br />
(B).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
1. Followed thread to --&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/warranty-service-and-recovery/surface-wont-turn-on-windows-wont-start?os=windows-10&amp;=undefined" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows doesn't start.. --</a>. Tried solutions
 under black screen/choose an option screen. Unsuccessful.<br />
2. Advanced options --&gt; CMD. Tried to manually execute rstrui.exe --&gt;"<strong>To use system restore you must specify the installation of Windows you wish to restore. Restart the computer, select an operating system, and then try again</strong>".&nbsp;<br />
3. Found --&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4Z2Kof82E0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/w4Z2Kof82E0?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/w4Z2Kof82E0?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div>&nbsp;-- . Would writing over my partition fix the locked drive issue? Followed Microsoft's --&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/warranty-service-and-recovery/downloadablerecoveryimage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">recovery
 image creation</a>&nbsp;-- page to create a Window's recovery USB for SP3. Am using a 16gb USB 3.0 that is formatted into GPT Fat32.<br />
4.1. Booting into Safe mode w/ Recovery USB: After ~10 minutes, screen comes up asking me to select a language -<strong>in English, not Spanish</strong>. Selected English --&gt; US --&gt; Advanced Options --&gt; Reset PC --&gt; Keep files.<br />
<br />
On the video the guy's computer began instantly resetting, but I am faced with a third page, asking me to choose between Windows 10 or System Rollback (i believe). I selected Windows 10 and it froze again; I went to sleep, woke up with this error:<br />
"<strong>The drive where Windows is installed is locked. Unlock the drive and try again</strong>".<br />
5. Following 4.1's sequence and choosing the other option -- not the &nbsp;Windows 10 one -- yielded this error:
<br />
"<strong>Unable to reset your computer - a required drive partition is missing".&nbsp;</strong><br />
6. Tried 4.1/5, both win10/other option with both safe mode and normal mode. No success.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">CHKDSK functions for C: -- The type of file system is RAW. CHKDSK is not available for RAW Drives.</span></p>

<p>
</p></div>
</div>
<p><br />
(D).<br />
I don't have anything at all on the computer, so my only goal is to get it up and running.<br />
<br />
<em>Tools I have</em><br />
-I have a Windows Recovery USB but can not reset it do to problems with the partitions, it seems.<br />
-I can access the CMD prompt via advanced options (not yet sure if the present issues will inhibit CMD usage)<br />
- Gparted/Fedora25 boot USB's, but can't yet get them to run on computer<br />
<br />
<em>What I'm trying to solve</em><br />
- How can I unlock a "locked" hard drive? Working through --<a href="https://gist.github.com/nehaljwani/8a71cc1933c29e611e9e850efe7c681d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">these</a>-- suggestions<br />
<br />
<em>What I am considering</em><br />
-What if I used Diskpart to wipe both hard drives -- would I be able to use the recovery usb to reset it from there?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for your thoughts and time;<br />
I'm currently in Japan, so shipping it to the US for work and then back would basically be the cost of just buying a new one.&nbsp;<br />

Sincerely,<br />

    <title>lost sound on computer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bjwalla  say:</h3>
<h2>            lost sound on computer</h2>
                    I recently lost the sound on my computer. I believe it may be related to the tv tuner I installed, or the one I replaced. I had taken one from my old computer which had a smaller case so it didn't fit properly. When I moved the cable, it dislodged it while
 my computer was on. I didn't really pay attention to the sound at that point. I replaced the tuner with one that fits but now I have no sound. The icon in the system tray had a red X on it. I tried removing the tuner, System Restore, checked the BIOS, updated
 the drivers, checked that the sound card was enabled (said none was installed). Finally I uninstalled the driver for the soundcard, then reinstalled it. Now the icon in the system tray is normal, music and TV will play (wouldn't before without an audio output
 device, and I did reinstall the tuner), but I cannot hear anything. The meters in the sound mixer move when music or video are playing but nothing comes out. I tried 2 different sets of speakers and a pair of headphones. Nad

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Remove ALL power to computer and remove and reseat ALL cards and cables (both ends when possible).<br />
Do not just attempt to snug - just do one at a time.<br />
<br />
Then :<br />
<br />
Please do all of these even if you have done them before as it is often the process which corrects the issue.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - SOUNDS - look for HD Audio - Mine says RealTek High Definition Audio&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Write down description make and model - double click on it - drivers tab - write down version. Now<br />
Click UPdate Drivers which may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers. Then RIGHT<br />
CLICK on it and UNINSTALL&nbsp;- REBOOT - this will rebuild the driver stack.<br />
<br />
1st go to system maker's site and look for latest driver Download - SAVE - go to right click on and RUN AS ADMIN<br />
(This is your fallback.) REBOOT after each driver installation.<br />
<br />
NOTE : Sound driver often rollback so check the version after installation and the reboot to see if the version you<br />
installed is there, if not repeat - reboot until it is. It can take several tries depending on how many rollbacks it<br />
does.<br />
<br />
Then do same for Device Maker's site.<br />
<span><br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

            Hi Lori.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Do a Reset from Advanced Startup Options, accessed by one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>
<br />
<br />If not other method works it may be necessary to  create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Then access Troubleshoot options to get to the Reset.
<br />You can choose to save your files or do a cleaner wipe of the drive first.  
<br />
<br />If it fails do the Clean Install from here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            kernel_auto_boost_lock_acquisition_with_raised_irql</h2>
                    <p>I had an issue since I upgraded to Windows 10, the error I keep getting is kernel_auto_boost_lock_acquisition_with_raised_irql. This error restarts my laptop if I touch my mouse pad directly after the laptop is started and I put my password.
<br />
<br />
So I wait a bit and then use it. Sometimes even if I wait around 5 min it still restarts, I have spent hours yesterday chatting to support who reinstalled my mouse pad drivers but to no avail, finally she did a clean boot, which solved the problem however I
 do not want to keep all my programs disabled like that, I need to know what is causing the root issue and have it fixed.
<br />
<br />
Also with clean boot I tried to check disk for errors and the error came up while the laptop was trying to check disk for error, basically it is unable to do the check and repair.
<br />
</p>
<p>If the problem cannot be solved then I want to downgrade to windows 8.1, I tried that too from settings it says I cannot do it because the files are no longer there.. I need this issue solved, not put to sleep.</p>

<p>Mind if i ask you how did you get to pin point what was causing the issue? That was all i was hoping for from Microsoft but all they did is put the whole issue to sleep by the Clean boot...
</p>
<p>I am not a tech savvy person, but i do know how to navigate around when a problem arises and try to fix it, but this was a nightmare...

            <p>In my case it was really obvious, because the computer crashed as soon as I tried to connect my phone to it by Bluetooth. Uninstalling the faulty Broadcom/Widcomm stack solved the problem, but the Microsoft stack has far fewer features -- for example, I
 can no longer stream music from my phone to the computer's speakers with the MS stack.</p>

<p>When i touched my Mousepad during Startup or when entering Password and some time afterwards, i got the blue Screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found out, that it only occurs, when I have an additionally mouse attached to a USB port.</p>
<p>Unconnecting it, helped, but as I am no Touchpad user, I Need my mouse...</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i reverted the Driver of my Synaptics mouspad to the old one (can be done in Device Manager) it worked.</p>
<p>I have the Standard generic mouspad Driver from Microsoft from 2006 installed and the touchpad works and no Bluescreens anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I installed the actual suggested Driver by dell (i have an alienware 17)&nbsp;i get the same reproducable error.</p>

            <p>When my USB Insignia Bluetooth tries to reconnect with my audio headset device I get this same error. The error happens also after the computer come out of a sleep state&nbsp;as well as if I turn the Bluetooth device off then turn it back on again in the device
 manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only time I don't get this error is after a fresh reboot with the USB Bluetooth device plugged in and my paired headset in range, on, and ready to pair.</p>

<h2>            Plantronics gamecom 788 headset mic does not work</h2>
                    After one of the updates my mic suddenly stopped working. It worked when I updated to windows 10 but the update after that my mic stopped working. I've tried re installing the software, using every port on my computer and installed the software from plantronics.
 Could someone help?&nbsp;

            Hi,<br />
<br />
That is the result of malware so do an extremely thorough check and when the system is<br />
clean see the next message to remove that error.<br />
<br />
If you need to check for malware here are my recommendations - these will allow you to do<br />
a thorough check and removal without ending up with a load of spyware programs running<br />
resident which can cause as many issues as the malware and maybe harder to detect as the<br />
cause.<br />
<br />
No one program can be relied upon to detect and remove all malware. Added that often easy<br />
to detect malware is often accompanied by a much harder to detect and remove payload. So<br />
its better to be overly thorough now than to pay the high price later. Check with these to an<br />
extreme overkill point and then run the cleanup only when you are very sure the system is clean.<br />
<br />
These can be done in Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot however you should also run&nbsp;<br />
them in regular Windows when you can.<br />
<br />
Download malwarebytes and scan with it, run MRT, and add Prevx to be sure it is gone.<br />
(If Rootkits run UnHackMe)<br />

<h2>            American Xbox 360&#47;Original Games working on Australian Xbox 1&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So I have recently moved out of the United States and moved to Australia, and with me, my old Xbox 360 and Original Games. Now I have figured out that my 360 and Original Consoles will no longer work because of the different voltages between the two countries, but I have noticed that many of my old games for these consoles are backwards compatible on my recently bought&nbsp;Xbox 1 X, but the Xbox 1 is Australian made, while my old games are American made. If I were to put these old American made games in my Australian Xbox 1 console, will they work or not?</p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks</p>

    <title>.vob files and Movie Maker - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> donna5020  say:</h3>
<h2>            .vob files and Movie Maker</h2>
                    I have video on a Sony DVD camcorder that I am trying to edit and publish as a DVD. I'm running Vista Home Business SP1 altho I've also tried to make this work with XP and MAC.&nbsp; The only system that would read the disk, other than the camcorder itself
 was my husband's Mac.&nbsp; He created a disk of files for me to use in my HP IX506 with Vista. I have used Movie Maker successfully before with video off my Canon Powershot Digital Elph, but getting the files off the DVD on the Sony is reallly flummoxing me.
<br />
<br />
I see that Media Player can deal with a .vob file, but Movie Maker can't. Media Player shows all the clips as 'chapters' but Movie Maker only recognizes the first clip -- altho it's very strange -- if I drag the timer (for lack of a better name) backwards,
 I can see that the other clips are there. <br />
<br />
So where am I going wrong?? Is a .vob file a Mac creation? How do I get video off of the Sony mini-DV camcorder (DCR-DVD305)? My IX506 all-in-one with Vista can't handle a mini DVD in the DVD reader. My XP thinks it's blank.&nbsp; I've connected the camera via USB
 to both and they think the disk is blank.&nbsp; Only the Mac would import the files from the camera.<br />
<br />

===============================<br />
First...just try renaming one of the .VOB files to<br />
.MPG and see if it will import into Movie Maker.<br />
If the import works...drag the file to the timeline and<br />
Save/Publish it in the .wmv or .avi format. Then...<br />
re-import the new movie clip for editing purposes.<br />
<br />
If that fails...rename the file back to .VOB and try<br />
converting the file to .wmv or .avi using the following<br />
free converter:<br />
<br />
SUPER © Simplified<br />
Universal Player Encoder &amp; Renderer<br />
<em>&lt;removed link&gt;</em><br />
(the mirror download site is faster)<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good practice to create a<br />
System Restore point before installing new software)<br />
<br />
After installing SUPER...open the program...<br />
you will see two small circles in the upper left<br />
corner of the screen...tick the TOP circle.<br />
<br />
Now...drag/drop your .VOB files into the Active field.<br />
<br />
Output Container...choose...wmv<br />
<br />
Video Scale Size / No Change<br />
<br />
Left click the Encode button.<br />
<br />
Choose: Simple Profile / OK...<br />
<br />
Wait...<br />
<br />
(FWIW..I have better luck with video if I do not<br />
try to multi-task while a file is being converted)<br />
<br />
When the file is converted...you should find it in...<br />
Program Files / eRightSoft / Super / OutPut.<br />
<br />
Or...you can type...Ctrl+T...to open the Save<br />
Window and choose a save folder.<br />
<br />
Good luck...<br />
<br />

<p><span>Hello Donna,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thank you for Posting on the Microsoft Vista Community Forums.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you have converted the video to AUDIO_TS and VIDEO_TS, VOB files you may not be able to import it in Movie maker.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you want to import the clips from a DVD movie with, VOB files and edit with your Windows Movie Maker, you may get into the trouble that the DVD format is incompatible with Windows Movie Maker.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
To import a DVD clip to Windows Movie Maker, you need to extract the clip from the DVD movie, and then add it to the Windows Movie Maker project. You may have to use a third party software program to convert and edit the same. You may search using your favorite
 search engine and download the same.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
To connect the camcorder to the computer and import the clips to the computer you need to have a Firewire cable and Firewire card installed on the computer. See if the camcorder has a Firewire port. Newer camcorders use this method of video transmission. This
 cable plugs into the camcorder's only Firewire port and the other end connects to the computer's Firewire port.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps. <br />
<br />
Thanks and Regards, <br />

I think I've now realized that I can't edit files from a miniDVD camcorder with Windows Movie Maker.
<br />
<br />
Yes, I might be able to convert the files -- I read Papa John's newsletters -- but that is just too much trouble.
<br />
<br />

            i know that this answer is over a year old but i really hope someone can help me out. i downloaded super and converted a vob file just as was instructed, and when i went to play my video it was only a second long, when the original clip itself was 5-10
 minutes long. i am using a dazzle to record what is on my tv--my gaming which i am posting to youtube, Let's Plays they are called--and then trying to use windows movie maker or pinnacle studio to edit and post the videos. but neither program recognizes vob
 files. so i tried to do what was instructed and now i am stuck. it encodes the file supposedly, but then the video is only a second long. can someone please help me??? i have spent a lot of money on equipment for this project and i would love to figure out
 what i am doing wrong and what i could be doing! any help is much appreciated!!! thank you!

<p><span>Installed Apps in Windows 8 cannot be synced with Live ID. You will have to manually install the Apps on different computers.
 Once you have installed Apps then you can go ahead and sync with Apps using live ID.</span></p>

            Microsoft SERIOUSLY needs to make this known. I just spent an hour talking to a guy who would have much rather been eating turkey, but he had to listen to me complain about my windows 8 pro not syncing to something it was never supposed to sync to in the first place.  I didn't know this, he didn't either. Because of it I was the **** that cost a man his thanksgiving.  EASILY avoided!!!  Apps are not synced between devices! That's all it takes! you have an app on your desktop? IT WILL NOT BE ON YOUR LAPTOP!! Skydrive still has a ways to go.

            I didn't mean to make such a big deal out of it but from what I understood Windows 8 was supposed to be the same across all devices. &nbsp;MASSIVE horseshit when it takes hour long customer service calls to tell consumers otherwise. &nbsp;On top of that no windows
 8 device will work with Cisco devices as of now without an 802.11w patch. Not loving it. Not even enjoying it.

            Yes, from what I can tell they should say sync app data and settings, the system will not install the apps for you. I think it is a big let down, the store shows you a list of apps installed on other devices so its possible to manually sync the apps from
 there by selecting all or the ones you want and installing, but desktop apps have to be downloaded through web browser. I mean seriously Microsoft, even android phones sync apps with one button, cmon.
<div><br />
<div>In addition I've just realized installing the apps this way fails sometimes possibly because 1 pc is 32-bit and the other 64-bit, they installs after a couple of tries so far though.</div>

            <p>Disappointing, but at least this is clear now. Ok, so now I'm trying to synch across the same app on 2 different PCs. Let's take the Weather app. I've already selected a few locations on PC A. How do I make the same app on PC B show the same locations without
 having to enter them ? I'm logged in on both with the same MSFT ID.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Actually, Synch works without me doing anything. It just took a bit of time to show up.</p>

            @deniscabrol,<br />
It's up to the individual app developer to build data syncing into their apps. There is nothing a user can do to enable this.<br />
<br />
I would reach out to the app's support site and ask them to build that into their app.<br />

<h2>            Xbox One slowing down my connection.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm have some seriously bad lag problems.</p>
<p>Any game I join it lags instantly.... When my Xbox is off my internet works great. But the second I turn it on everything slows down.</p>
<p>I even loaded up a PC game to see how much of an effect it was having on my connection. When i joined the server my Ping was 78* but when I turned my Xbox on it jumped to 400+.</p>
<p>Does the Xbox One have uploading/downloading going on in the background? Because thats the only explanation I can come up with.</p>

<p>Hey Blobby<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>To answer your question yes, in the background when updates to games and for the console are available it will generally just start to download it. Are you connected to the modem directly or are you connect Via Wifi? Also, how many other devices are feeding
 off your signal? That will also do a number on your speed.</p>

<p>I'm trying to research this problem myself. so i'm going to watch this thread for a solution and interject my experience with what i think is the same issue.</p>
<p>last night, when i checked my speed on my laptop it was ~58 down and ~9 up. and averages about a 30ms ping. &nbsp;but the xbone was showing speeds wildly fluctuating between 2 and 20 mbps down and 3-5 up. sometimes the upload was faster than the download....
 weird. &nbsp; anyway, pings ranged between 50 and 240 ms. and the wireless signal was always 100% shown by both devices. i got a dfferent speed readings from the xbox every time, and a consistent reading from the laptop everytime. &nbsp;i'm going to try and hook up
 the cable to the xbone and see if that settles it down. it definitely feels like "something" is happening to bog it down though.
</p>
<p>i'll report back if it makes a difference.</p>

<p>I'm having this weird issue that didn't seem to start till recently after the last few updates. My xbox is turned on, the internet is fine, however, if I quit a game, than EVERYTHING thats connected is slow and laggy (lap top, computer, etc). I've noticed
 if I shut my xbox off than it goes back to normal faster, but it only does that AFTER shutting off from a game. That make any sense or anyone had this issue before?</p>

<p>I have been having issues for a few days now. 30mbps connection drops to 1 or 2 Mbps. Sometimes not even 1. After complaining to twc I shut off all Internet connected devices and plugged a laptop in via cat5. It was back to 27mbps. Oh it's fixed right? Nah
 I turn my Xbox on to watch TV and do a check again. 1.5mbps. Turn off the Xbox and test again. 25mbps. No games in que or updates showing on the Xbox one. What is going on?</p>

    <title>Total Computer Lockup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ameberlan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Total Computer Lockup</h2>
                    <p>I recently sold my last motherboard, heatsink, and CPU to a friend and purchased newer replacements for myself. However, ever since upgrading to the new motherboard and CPU, I have been having random system lockups which can only be resolved by unplugging
 the system or flipping the switch on the back of the PSU.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wasn't having this issue on the other motherboard and CPU with all the same parts so I'm inclined to believe it's one of my new hardware additions, but I could be wrong. Also, I'm fairly certain it's a hardware problem as I'm not getting any kind of software
 crash symptoms. No "this application has stopped responding", no windows error reporting dialog boxes, and ZERO blue screens. I have not gotten a single blue screen, but they are FULL system lockups and if a sound is playing, it locks in that singular sound
 and plays it nonstop until I force the system off. Whatever picture is on screen is locked in, and moving the mouse or hitting keyboard keys such as the "Windows" key or combinations such as CTRL-SHIFT-ESC yields no Task Manager, and ALT-TAB refuses to let
 me check open applications and switch. NO interaction permitted whatsoever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue occurs at non-consistent intervals. It always starts up fine and then I've had lockups occur anywhere from 30 minutes to 3 hours later. I have performed the memory diagnostic included with Windows on a whim but it reported no errors. I also used
 OpenHardwareMonitor (not sure on the accuracy of it) to log the temperature, usage, and clock speeds of any running components every second until it crashed but I'm not sure what to do with the data I received.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hardware:</p>
<p>Motherboard: MSI Z270 Gaming 7 (new part)<br />
CPU: i5-7600K (new part)</p>
<p>RAM: 16GB Corsair Vengance LPX 3000MHz C15</p>
<p>Hard Drive: 250 GB (actually not sure exact model but I can lok it up if needed)</p>
<p>Graphics Card:&nbsp;ASUS GeForce GTX 1060 6GB ROG STRIX</p>
<p>PSU: Corsair RM750x</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been using all the same parts except for the CPU, Heatsink, and Motherboard for the last year without issue until i swapped them out for newer parts and this all began. Any advice or assistance in diagnosing this would be helpful. And if I need something
 replaced, I just need to know what. Thanks!</p>

            <p>Have you considered reinstalling Windows as a clean load?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although it has improved considerable compared to earlier versions hardware changes can be problematic. If the installation is still the free upgrade program&nbsp; then it can also have the residue from the Windows 7 it upgraded from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IF that is your history then I really wouldn't consider anything else before starting to blame the hardware itself.</p>

            Probably should have included this above as well, but it IS a clean install. I made a Windows disc right before doing a hardware swap and the hardware swap was a week ago so its not a botched update either because the windows disc was the Creators update
 vereion of the OS and it hasnt had to install any since.

            <p>Then check the event logs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If after the reboot you find an entry "The previous shutdown was unexpected" (it will not be the 1st entry after reboot, a little way in) then the crash was so total Windows could not log any events.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are few situations that this could happen under software (there shouldn't be any really) so it does point to a hardware error. The fact that the sound chip and graphics do not get a reset (Non Maskable Interrupt) points to a total stop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally in 32 years I have never had a CPU failure to fix so I would put the motherboard as the strongest culprit. Memory tests are OK but the best memory tester I know is Windows setup. I have had DIMM that have passed innumerable tests but will not
 install Windows (proved by replacing the DIMM).</p>

            <p>I noticed that. I did think to check the event logs because i have noticed even some blue screens will log and some wont. Ive only been dealing in computer repair for 7 years now but i had more or less assumed total crashes would cause event log to be blank
 for the session it was on for. Checked it yesterday after the most recent crash and sure enough the only log ive received at every lockup is the "last shutdown" was unexpected error. Off point for a second but kinda glad to get confirmation that that's why
 ive seen blank areas in event viewer in some of the computers ive tried repairing. Core hardware such as cpu and motherboard arent my strong suit though​ because im really not sure what kind of traces they leave behind.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for this one, yes i can say that event viewer is showing the symptoms you described. Blank for the session up to the crash and only states that the system shutdown upon restarting was unexpected. Kind of wish there was a way to make the log save elsewhere
 so i wouldnt lose all the events leading up to it but im not sure it would even record motherboard​/CPU errors. They dont exactly advertise their errors.</p>

            <p>Really good motherboards (particularly servers) will maintain their own event logs but they are few and far between.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are two forms of interrupts&nbsp;within PC architecture. The normal one allows a device to flag up that it needs attention but waits until it is serviced. An NMI is compulsory, it has no wait condition. For a total crash to occur I think even that is not
 being processed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hypothetically Windows could programmatically stop and not write a log as that takes time. It would almost be impossible to debug such a condition.</p>

            <p>So in this case, there's really no way to tell which component is causing the total crash, but considering theres nothing being logged it's​ likely nothing at the software level? I mean im hoping im safe in making the assumption that its either the cpu or
 the motherboard causing this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I did notice this because my motherboard has a temperature led but this motherboard and the 7600K are running a good 15 degrees hotter than my last setup. Last setup was a Z170 chipset, Gaming M5 motherboard also from MSI and a 6600K CPU. Normally ran
 a good 5-15 degrees cooler than​ this one with all the same heatsink and fans. I was under the impression Kaby Lake was more efficient and ran around the same. Not sure if its relevant...</p>

<p>What I have noticed is the crashing occurs more frequently since the little ad box at the bottom was added.&nbsp; It appears that Microsoft wants users/players to purchase the game, so the game often crashes when there are no ads showing up in that little box.&nbsp;
 I think it's merely a marketing technique to make more profit$!&nbsp; &nbsp;Because of this, if &amp; when I do decide to purchase, it won't be from Microsoft.</p>

            None of the suggestions worked for me... what did work for me was going into Settings-&gt; Apps-&gt; MS Mahjong-&gt; Reset. The reboot system.&nbsp; Worked well and I did not lose my stats or history.&nbsp; I'd just like to know why it happened in the first place... think
 likely due to a recent Windows Update.
