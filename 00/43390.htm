            Echo is for testing Skype audio calls only. You can test your video in your video settings. If you want to test your video on an actual call, you will need to call another video-capable Skype user. Video will not be an option when calling phone numbers
 since there is no medium in which to transmit video.

                    What are the steps to apply a software update? Used to be you would download it but I guess there is a new way now. I was told that the Printer Offline problem I have may be caused by this update being missing, which it is.

<h2>            Fable 3 and the xbox play</h2>
                    <p>I have Re-Installed fable 3 games for windows live using the cd I bought a few years ago,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed the client Games for windows live and signed in, (as apparently it could still connect to the network to play fable 3)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then done some research and found out it runs through steam as well (fable 3 is not on steam or atleast any more)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I signed in the xbox live in windows 10 as normal created a short cut to add the games to the list and it still doesnt work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still keep getting the error that it cannot connect I have run in admin mode as well to see if that helps an no go, the xbox live recognizes that I have played it in the past in 2015 but this does me know good, any suggestions would be appreciated</p>

<p>There are only a small number of games that used the dread and infamous GFWL that Steam will allow you</p>
<p>to transfer the games activation key to a Steam key/download on your Steam account.
</p>
<p>I don't think any games from MS are among them though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know why, but some games that used GFWL are particularly troublesome. With these games an&nbsp;
</p>
<p><em>xliveless </em>fix ( a replacement for the xlive.dll ) is required.&nbsp; Single player only when using a fix though.</p>
<p>You should be able to find an xliveless fix at a Fable3 modding sites. </p>
<p>
</p><p>- In addition to dropping GFWL, Fable 3 also uses another notorious form of DRM, which MS also stopped supporting
</p>
<p>years ago...<em> SECUROM</em> (If you are not already aware of the <em>SafeDisk</em> DRM issue read my post at&nbsp;
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-gaming/login-as-administrator-warning/56cf28ad-c7e5-432f-89ab-d22e08a06544">
--this thread-- . </a></p>
<p>The easiest way to get around DRM issues is to use a noCD fix/hack. I get mine from&nbsp; -&nbsp;
<a href="https://megagames.com/games/fable-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">game /fable-3</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>There is only one noCD fix for this game, but it should work. Most fixes use a replacement for the games .exe&nbsp; (<em>fable3.exe</em> ? ) file.
</p>
<p>I just downloaded (and scanned) this fix,&nbsp; and see this one uses file titled <em>
Paul.dll</em> instead.&nbsp; </p>
<p>You would place this file in the same folder/sub-forlder the games .exe is in (If a file with this name already exists</p>
<p>I would move that file to a new sub-folder as backup )</p>
<p>

<p>Hey, i have the same issue (Fable 3 worked with Windows 10 first time installed - then i reinstalled windows, and now its not working because "Live ID Sign-in cannot be reached"; also, the .exe files in the microsoft games/fable III folder are 0 kb in size)</p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT i had a folder backup of the Fable 3 folder from the old Windows 10, so i copied the contents and now it works.</p>
<p>O_o</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyway someone explain how i can install fable 3 (original retail cd box) with the .exe files installing correctly ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>BY THE WAY i have got other games for windows games, well, i hope there will be no 3-days-testing-and-trying to get them to work. Would really be the best if you could switch the serial number keys of the games with e.g. steam code.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I didn't try the modified xlive files, because on that website, it says that download content could become blocked because of the patched files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, i can't imagine the no-cd patches for fable 3 to work for me, because the game won't event install correctly on my pc.</p>

<p>Am i right that doing this method is only to see if an app could conflict with fable 3 not installing correctly ? I'm asking because i do a lot of system scans to keep my system clean, but i think that disabling services or startup
 items as you suggest in your method is only temporarily to check if there are conflicts, and does not change system settings Permanently. So it is trying each app/service after the other which could make problems, right?</p>
<p>Anyway, i don't need to do this method because i got Fable 3 to work now - not only by copying the fable 3 folders from my old windows installation. Maybe some people can be helped by my method to make the game work:</p>
<p>I copied all the fable 3 folders (also those from "Users"-"AppData") to my new windows installation (Savegame Transfer). Then i uninstalled fable 3, saved games remained after uninstall.
<br />
In the meantime, i installed another GamesForWindowsLive game: Batman Arkham City. This game worked (Verifying purchase date) by changing the computer's time to year 2012 or similar during the verify process.</p>
<p>Then, i made a clean fable 3 install, started the game and the Windows-Live-ID-Purchase-Date-Verifier passed directly and the GAME WORKS.</p>
<p>So, i think it really has something to do with the GFWL correctly installed and up-to-date, like suggested in other forums or guides.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, download content in fable 3 is NOT working, is there anyone who could get this to work ?</p>

<p>Hi Jomari,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I purchased Fable 3 + DLC on physical media and that did once install great but when that started to have issues and I could see the end of GFWL coming I then purchased it on stream and it installed fine but now you can only download the base game from steam
 and not the DLC. Which is really annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Neither Microsoft nor Steam want to help with this game I have gone back and forth multiple times with people in forums and with Microsoft and Steam chat.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What annoys me the most about your comment is the fact that Microsoft bought and closed down the Lionhead studios who are the developer of this game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, therefore, you Jomari Arc are the closest thing we will ever come to contacting the developer as you suggested.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me to get this game working on a pc I have to play a cracked copy of the game, which is unbelievable since I legitimately own 2 different copies of the same game.</p>

<h2>            cannot view status of active networks</h2>
                    have win10 pro 64bit on an ASUS laptop. have recently been experiencing problems with my lan and home group. I have been able to reestablish connections but in the network and sharing center I am told that I am currently not connected to any network, in
 the device manager in the software devices category my pc has disappeared and i can`t get it back. all other computers in the lan appear there. On the other computers all devices are visible and active network status is shown- all except a macro apple laptop
 but connection to and from the apple is available on all computers. any idea?

            I've done that before. no problem was identified. To clarify, I have complete control of my homegroup and network. They appear in the file explorer, in the this pc view and network. The mac pro appears only in the network. the only problem seems to be
 that in the device manager the laptop does not appear in the software devices- pc1 and pc3 do. on the other machines all 3 pc's appear in software devices (no mac pro). and in pc2, in network and sharing under active networks, I am told the computer is not
 connected to a network or homegroup. But I am and everything works as it should- internet and homegroup. I did a restore to a time before the mac was attached but this problem existed before this time (according to the results of the restore).

            <p>Yes, I've been able to leave and join my homegroup. I have full access to the internet and homegroup. Everything seems to be 'normal'. But in network and sharing control panel I'm still listed as having no internet connection and no homegroup status is shown,</p>

<br />
I use an external monitor, which is an AVOL 22" 1080p television to watch movies on, through the HDMI port on my ACER Aspire 6930.&nbsp; It has been working in this configuration for at least a month, but recently my computer fails to recognize the tv.&nbsp; It says
 "no signal".&nbsp; I tried a buddies laptop, and the tv works as advertised, so I am pretty sure this is the computer.&nbsp; Any suggestions?&nbsp; Thanks.

            Well, I think that something to do with my HDMI port/card is not working.&nbsp; I found out that we had a power surge the other day, and I think that is what is going on.&nbsp; It got zapped.&nbsp; I have found numerous programs that just don't have anything in them,
 and its been quite a process to get it all going again, but I can't get the HDMI port to work.&nbsp; I got the VGA port to work, but not the HDMI.&nbsp; I did the above a couple of times, and made sure that I had the correct and latest drivers, to no avail.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp;

            I downloaded the VC500 Complete Package, reinstalled the drivers and the programs. It seems to have solved my major problems with the VC500. In my case, the video was okay but the sound was very distorted. I also had issues with instability of the settings,
 if I did anything on the pc, such as open a browser or allow the screen saver to activate, during the 1 or 2 hours of recording, some settings would occasionally change. Time will tell if the stability issue is fixed.

            Do you still have warranty with HP?
<br />If so, then contact them and get a replacement for your Hard drive.
<br />And if you happened to buy this machine at a Best Buy or PC store where they gave you warranty I would take it to them to have them replace the hard drive and see if they can save your files.
<br />Crossing my fingers for you.

                    Recently i was given a laptop which only had one account on it. I linked my microsoft account forgetting that my screentime is up and it has now locked me out of my computer. Ive changed my age to 19 and left the family hoping this would resolve the issue
 but it hasnt. So I've made a new account, attached my affected one making it a child account and accepting any screentime requests its given me but it still shows the times up error. Is there a way i can unlink my microsoft account or removing screentime without
 needing to login?

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Quickest solution is to change the Microsoft Account in Windows 10 to a Local Account:  <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-10-tip-switch-back-to-a-local-account-from-a-microsoft-account/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-10-tip-swi...</a>
<br />
<br />Or create a new Local Admin Account:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a-new-local-user-account-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a...</a>
<br />
<br />Then to try to get help with the Microsoft Family account I'd ask in this thread which is being serviced by a Family representative, who also posts his Twitter handle there:
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-security-winpc/troubleshooting-family-safety-features-in-windows/29533738-5766-4ba5-881c-c588e45201dc">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

 and installation is simple, i'm a bit bewildered.&nbsp; Nothing wrong with network connection or anything like that. Have to say i'm having a blast with&nbsp;the ten year old game crackdown with the only fly in the ointment being these strange error messages. Thanks
 in anticipation for any helpful advice.</p>

<p>Hi everyone!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Solution found at a windows&nbsp;report page from 2016 I think.&nbsp; Just type in fix "installation stopped" xbox one error.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks to the person who&nbsp;headed me in the direction of DNS issues.&nbsp; I followed the instructions and went to network settings, then advanced settings and inputted 8.8.8.8 as primary dns and then 8.8.4.4 as secondary dns.&nbsp; I was desperate at this time and
 didn't really want to do strange things I know nothing about. I should have realised that an xbox console is just as effin' temperamental as a computer…. anyways, &nbsp;everything is loading finally! you tube, bbc news app, amazon prime, all loaded in seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the dns settings have automatic as an option so I didn't worry about altering anything so im glad I took the plunge and did something that was out of my comfort zone!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope the solution works for everyone</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best wishes from Clifford slug!</p>

 etc.) I have reinstalled all possible drivers, Installed different mixers, tried all kinds of configs, but can't get the microphone input in to programs. Also, I can hear my mic in voicemeeter, but I can't in any way transfer the signal to programs. I used
 voicemeeter before with no problems aswell. I'm running out of ideas here. Have I missed something?</span>

 now, I have tried to fix the problem by using the "sfc / scannow " command and by updateing the OS but the problem still persist.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                    <span>
<p><strong>Got a clean install of Windows 7, (64 bit) and apart from a few glitches all seems to be working well. &nbsp;Last night I tried the speech recognition and it seemed very good, but this was with teh default windows 7 sound card drivers. &nbsp;Today I installed
 the&nbsp;on board&nbsp;sound card&nbsp;drivers, reltek HD v6.0.1.5780. &nbsp;I can play back sounds and I can test the microphone without issue, but the Speech recognition detects no input from the mic, everything else seems to detect it without issue.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">I've read a few threads for similar issues but none seem to solve my problem. &nbsp;Speech recognition for me isn't a show stopper, but it would be good to play with it, if only it could hear me (as it did before I loaded the reltek
 drivers)</span></p>
<p><strong>Any help, suggestions are welcomed.</strong></p>

            Great, although none of the above seemed to work I located the Advanced speech config through Sound Devices, recording tab, selecting the appropriate microphone, Config button, Advanced Speech options, Under Microphone: Advanced, Use Audio Input device
 and explicitly set the Microphone (Realtek High Def Audio). &nbsp;Speech recognition now works.

<div>I guess there is a shorter route to this setting but at least I'm sorted. &nbsp;Thanks for your help.</div>

<h3> broughtvulture  say:</h3>
<h2>            GTA V, has a secondary download&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>GTA V is 50% off on the marketplace. Decided to purchase it last night and hoped to give it a spin today. I loaded it up and it sent me to a screen where the bottom right corner says downloading, but when I bought the game it said it was 7.6GB, so that was
 sort of confusing. After half an hour or so of waiting for something to happen, since there is no percentage bar, an xbox message popped up saying "GTAV Pack 4 is downloaded", I check my active download list and see three other "GTAV Packs". What's the purpose
 of these packs, they're probably 2GB each, which is a long time? Do I need them to play offline?</p>

<p>Hi there,<br />
<br />
Unlike most Xbox 360 games, GTA V is quite large and there are additional downloads. &nbsp;Its total install is around 16GB. &nbsp;You download the first part direct from the marketplace as you would other digital Xbox 360 games. &nbsp;Upon starting GTA V the game will start
 the additional downloads. &nbsp;All the downloads must be completed to allow you to play the game.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.</p>

<h2>            Outstanding Balance Question</h2>
                    
<p>If I have have an outstanding balance on the credit card currently attached to my account (which no longer exists because I cancelled it) can I pay off the debt using a prepaid card? I.E. If i put in a 3 month code will it pay off the debt and then add 2
 months?</p>
