            Hi.
<br />
<br />Regarding translator it is devices in Belorussian.
<br />
<br />Issue could be different such a translation bag, profile corruption, Store issue etc.
<br />
<br />What is your current build?
<br />Do you have any other translation issue?
<br />
<br />Do:
<br />1) Check system files using this guide <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833...</a>
<br />
<br />2) Be sure that OS updated
<br />
<br />3) Reset the Microsoft Store cache:
<br />Press Windows + R keys to open the run command box.
<br />Type WSReset, then try launching Microsoft Store and sign in.
<br />
<br />4) Reinstall Store: 
<br />Open Start, type: powershell. Right click PowerShell. Click Run as administrator. 
<br />At the command prompt, type the following then hit Enter: 
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage *WindowsStore* -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"} 
<br />
<br />Exit Powershell then restart. 
<br />
<br />5) Create a new user profile.
<br />
<br />Let me know how it goes

            Hi,
<br />I wouldn't worry about this. It still says devices, so the likelihood is its a bug with how the text is retrieved. It's done based on your language settings but short of resetting the app or at an extreme resetting windows. There isn't much you can do to change this.
<br />Sorry I couldn't provide more help.

<h2>            WMM won&#39;t save any movie longer than a couple of minutes &#40;part 1&#41;</h2>
                    <b>Question Summary</b><br />
I have questions related to saving and sharing a movie

<div><b>Which version of Windows Live Movie Maker are you using ? </b></div>
<div>Other</div>
<div><b>Choose your Operating System version : </b></div>
<div>Windows 7</div>
<p><b>Additional Details</b><br />
</p>
<p><span>(1/3)<br />
Hi, I'm posting this on behalf of a student who I've been helping out with this problem, and we're tearing our hair out.</span><br />
<br />
In a nutshell, her WMM doesn't seem to successfully save any movie longer than 2 minutes or so. However we've only found this out after she's made a 25 minute long film with a lot of different camera cuts (from a small number of source files) and voiceovers,
 captions etc in it, which makes recreating the project in a more sophisticated program a significant task. The details of it are weird however, it's definitely not just a simple matter of "a few too many pictures" or "not enough disk space".<br />
<br />
Scrolling through the project up and down shows that it's definitely not cacheing all the thumbnails properly for some reason. If you move a good percentage through it, suddenly all the thumbs - even ones that have loaded mere seconds before - are replaced
 by grey (and pink?) boxes with warning triangles on, and it takes a couple seconds to reload them from disk. The project top to bottom isn't more than 4 or 5 screens however, which I would think represents maybe 10-15mb uncompressed image data and a handful
 of kb's for the necessary indices?<br />
<br />
All of the files are present and correct, this has been double checked both by her and myself. The video will play all the way through in preview mode absolutely perfectly - my contingency plan for getting material out of the machine suitable for submitting
 to the exam board is to hook the machine up to a VGA-Composite scaler and then to a DVD recorder - meaning it's not having any trouble finding the files, interpreting them, rendering the transitions and captions, mixing the audio and producing a usable output
 at greater than what the savefile resolution will be. There's a great excess of space to save the output file both on her hard disk and on the memory stick her project is backed up on.<br />

<p><span>Look, guys, this kind of nonsense is exactly what I’m talking about in one of my other WMM posts – egregiously mistimed error checking. The point at which to tell me I only
 have 3000 characters is, at the very least, when I enter my 3001. Preferably, tell me before I even start typing. Not at the point where I’ve written more than double that, and have somewhere else to be this evening rather than sticking around
 to edit my post down. I will instead split it across multiple replies. I’m sorry, but that’s the way it’s got to be, unless someone’s got a secretary I can drop this off with and they can précis it down?</span></p>

            (2/3)<br />
<span>When you try to save the movie, regardless of destination - DVD, email, computer, etc - and what quality settings are used, it will plug through it fairly slowly (it's an Intel
 Core i3, I think, possibly an i5?), get to a point somewhere in the 90% range, and fail with an error message. I've lost exactly which one it is (can dredge it up if it's important), but it's a pretty generic and useless one and I've found more help so far
 (eg the suggestion of "cut it down to really short clips") by just searching the symptoms rather than the code. Given the problem with the thumbnail cacheing etc, and the possibility of over-running whatever potentially needlessly short edit list it has built
 in thanks to the number of cuts, I had already suggested she try initially rendering it in 4-5 short chunks then concatenating them. The student has tried this, and had the same result.</span><br />
<br />
Yes, with a movie 20-25% the size, probably excluding several of the source files that were in the original, the process fails at about the same percentage, with the same error message (though obviously it doesn't take as long getting there). This is decidedly
 abnormal behaviour.&nbsp;Unfortunately it isn't kind or clever enough to leave the half-mangled remains for us to pick over after the failure, so we can't e.g. make a movie that's 11% longer, padded with a load of blank slides at the end, then just pick up the
 pieces left behind when it fails at the new "90%"...<br />
<br />
However cutting the movie down quite severely to under 2 minutes in length means it suddenly works fine. It saves a lot quicker because of the short length, goes through to 100% and shows a "success" message - though I'll admit in our elation we didn't check
 what the exact settings used were, or whether the resulting movie played properly. We were just relieved that I might not have to carry on trying to beat life into the malfunctioning scaler that I had originally intended to connect the laptop to in that help
 session.<br />
<br />
With any luck, she'll be able to find sufficient breakpoints in her project where it can be sliced into sections of roughly 2 minutes, they will all render fine, and she can then drop the resulting files back into WMM to be re-joined into one big one. This
 will still beg the question however - why couldn't it just do them all in one go, and why does it get so far through the production before breaking down?<br />
<br />
(If we find that all of the sections encode fine except for the final one, I guess we'll have the answer ... but in that case, why did the 1/4-length file also break?)<br />
<br />
(And indeed, how come it can't handle a project that I could have happily knocked together over the course of a day and then encoded on a far less capable machine using a hokey ascii-file-based freeware video processor like AviSynth? Is the code based on v8
 of Pinnacle Studio or something? (The only other video editor I've used that has such odd, almost non-deterministic problems))<br />

<p><span>(3/3)<br />
The one thing I guess we haven't checked is whether it's an old or new version of Movie Maker. The laptop is a couple of years old, so it could be the 2009 version... but, why would it not have been updated along with the other regular windows updates? This
 kind of problem is fairly fatal. I WILL recommend to her that she try updating it as soon as she's done trying to save her project by the cut'n'shut method... but I only hope this won't then effect some fundamental internal change that means her old project
 file is no longer loadable?! I don't think I would be able to find a large enough rock to hide under to save my life should I cause it to break in that way, because then it can't even be recreated scene-by-scene in, e.g. iMovie by having her laptop next to
 the mac monitor.</span><br />
<br />
Please ... any help or advice you can give on this that isn't off the usual script (I've read those entries in other posts already ;-) would be very helpful and appreciated.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

(PS... as I now have characters to spare... The rather contrived screen name is because I don't have anything better to call myself that won't cause an unwanted link between my now-exposed-to-everyone Real Name and any previously used (ie any that I'll be able
 to remember) intended-to-be-anonymous pseudonyms, and it won't actually let me use my own name. Call it a peaceful protest against a crazy corporate policy that forces my real name to be shown to the world whilst at the same time chiding me not to give away
 any "personally identifiable information" on the profile edit screen. Hence I've cut and pasted said screen's exact words.<br />
So, my apologies that you may have to refer to me using it rather than the snappier 6-letter handle I previously used. Say MrP if you prefer.)<br />
((further edit: OK, so it doesn't display HERE, but I bet it still does on the MSN forums, which is where I first spotted the problem and from where I went in a panic straight to the profile screen change my registered name - I REALLY don't want said personal
 handle being crossed over with my professional dealings. I don't even do anything sketchy with it, but those two life areas are deliberately separate.))</p>

            I hope this doesn't seem too ungrateful after you took the time to (hopefully) read and to reply, but... that's not really helpful and I can't do any of that :-)<br />
<br />
1/ I'm not even sure if I have a Skydrive account, and if I do, I've never used it and don't even know how to get to it let alone use it. Could you perhaps have included a link? Is it a standard thing, or something I'd have to sign up for?<br />
EDIT: Now I've posted that, a link has appeared at the bottom of your post. I presume it's something I needed to be signed in to see, as I was signed out and got signed back in as part of the "Post Reply" process? Does that mean I don't need to explicitly sign
 in to Skydrive itself and can just be signed in here then click the upload button?<br />
<br />
2/ The files, work, etc all belong to someone else, a student at the college I work at. I'm probably explicitly prohibited from sending her stuff about, even if I had access to it, which I don't. It's on a memory stick in her possession. You would probably
 need all the source files etc anyway wouldn't you? These come to at least a gigabyte, maybe two; even ignoring the upload times, possibility of bandwidth caps, timeouts, etc, would there be enough space?<br />
<br />
3/ The log files would probably be inaccessible or maybe even meaningless as we tried this both on her computer (which we appear not to have admin rights to? I don't know. It was a walk-up helpdesk job) and on a network machine, and it's been quite a while
 since either. I have no idea what bearing the *system* logs would have on things, anyway - the problem appears well contained to Movie Maker. Wouldn't you want the WMM logs instead?<br />
<br />
(Again, without being disrespectful: Is this in fact a generic, canned response?)<br />

This appears to be a fairly common and widespread problem, after all. Other than updating the software on her machine - which I've directed her to do but have no idea whether it's actually happened due to limited communications (and, I can't do it on the college
 machines; plus, my own computers are still on XP so I couldn't even use them for this if I wanted to) - is there no similarly widely-applicable fix or patch we can apply to stop this nonsense?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
MrP<br />

            Hello MrP,<br />
<br />
<span>
<p>We apologize for the inconvenience this issue has caused you and your student. I read your post on other thread and to sort this out, can you please verify if the student you are referring to was the thread starter
 in <a href="https://windowslivehelp.com/thread.aspx?postid=145e4ea5-8f37-4d48-afde-7da8eb8df040#145e4ea5-8f37-4d48-afde-7da8eb8df040" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>this link</strong></a>. If yes, please advise your student to provide us the log files from her computers from which the issue persists. Windows Live Movie Maker logs contain technical information that can help us identify and diagnose issues in the
 client. We use log files to determine the exact cause of the error in the machine and are critical for investigating certain errors.
<br />
<br />
The steps are in the link below in gathering log files of the computers (don't worry, there's no need to sign up&nbsp;again just to view the link). Please post it in the private data area I’ve provided below.

 Messenger related Errors</span></b></a><span><br />
<br />
We also need the camera specifications which she had used to capture the videos. We assume that she is using a high-definition camera which may be the cause or part of the cause&nbsp;of the issue. For now, please try to zoom (+)&nbsp;all the way the time scale slider
 in the lower right part of Windows Live Movie Maker before saving the movie and inform us if she will get the same issue.<br />

            The "dn" following the model number means that the device contains a duplexing unit and is network-aware.&nbsp; The IP address 127.0.0.1 is a special IP address meaning "myself"; i.e., the local host.&nbsp; Your PC is 127.0.0.1 to itself and the printer is 127.0.0.1

Without the user calling it to? hmm...<br />
<br />
You seem to forget (as many people won't realize) that a printer is just another computer on a network with exactly the same problems and, 'if' compromised, the same impact. Even devices we don't think of as computers can be hacked and do things we don't intend,
 compromising our security. For an embedded system (or any system for that matter), if you can rewrite the OS, you can control the device and make it do all sorts of unintended things.<br />
<br />
Even users with printers that are not directly connected to the Internet might be at risk. As long as the printer is connected to a computer (through a USB cable, for example) it could be used to launch attacks (or as part of a botnet). In theory, it's possible
 that a PC might be infected (see OP's opened/related thread) to then infect its printer (if it was intended), though I would suspect such effort would only be rarely used.<br />
<br />
FWIW in addition, it wouldn't be the first time that HP printers have had vulnerabilities, specially on their old (models prior to 2009) LaserJet printers, that do/did not check for digital signatures before installing a firmware update (as in
<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-4161" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">CVE-2011-4161</a>). Every time the printer accepts a job, it checks (through a process called "Remote Firmware Update") to see if a software update is included in that job, but it doesn't
 check the source of the update software (a typical digital signature is not used to verify the upgrade software’s authenticity); thus, a specially crafted version of firmware could be remotely installed by creating a crafted printjob including the new firmware
 version. Whilst only specially-crafted files sent directly to the printer can do that, print commands sent by a hacker to trick an HP printer into reprogramming itself is also possible.<br />
<br />

@<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/28c246ae-977e-4a52-bc65-915feead1527">SAM SAMAR</a>: Please note I'm not saying the above is your case, or that your printer might be already compromised (very unlikely), as I don't know
 s**t - and Win32/Small.CA has no ability (I think) to do this by itself anyway. However, since malicious files detected as variants of this trojan's malware family can have virtually any purpose, and often used to install additional (more dangerous) malware,
 as <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/threat/encyclopedia/entry.aspx?Name=PWS:Win32/Zbot.gen!C" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
PSW:Win32/Zbot.gen!C</a>, for instance, which do have the ability to modify the Windows Hosts file in order to redirect specified URLs to different IP addresses... who knows?<br />
<br />
Now, returning to this specific thread/question (where you selected the option 'Other/Unknown' for your OS when posting your question), shall assume it's the same Win7 (maybe a recent upgrade, perhaps?) machine as in your other thread...<br />
First thing I would suggest you try is updating the printer's firmware to the latest version. You may also find some other suggested solutions in
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-hardware/get-devmgmtdiscoverytreexml-error-from-printer/c40b5e64-d402-4538-84b8-f5a5dd2f528a">
this related thread</a>, including to disable the "printer status notification", workaround which at least, has helped users to save so much paper :-)<br />
<br />
Hope this info to be of any assistance.<br />

            <p>While I'll concede that a bogus firmware update could break a printer, even if it's not malware, there are a few points you fail to address.&nbsp; First, nothing in the OP's post indicates that he performed a firmware update.&nbsp; Second, it would be pointless for
 someone to write malware for a printer like the OP describes.&nbsp; While HP all-in-ones can access PCs, they do so only when network-connected and then only through the HP sharing software and then only a specific folder on the PC.&nbsp; There would be nothing of value
 malware could access.&nbsp; Third, even if something of value could be accessed, the amount of effort that would be required for writing firmware for a particular model printer that wouldn't brick the printer immediately is economically impractical.&nbsp; Malware writers
 expect economic return on their time investment.&nbsp; That simply doesn't pertain in this case.&nbsp; It would cost way too much for minimal return, in my opinion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do think your suggestion to update the firmware has merit, since the error message can indicate that something in the printer's internal web service or&nbsp;device management code&nbsp;is missing.&nbsp; I'd also recommend that

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I realise that I am replying to an old post but thought it might be useful for anyone else experiencing this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You need to disable Printer Status Notification. Click on&nbsp;Printer Properties/ Device Settings/ Installable Options/ Printer Status Notification and set to disabled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will stop the printer from periodically printing it's status. I have no idea why this option exists as I can't see why anyone would consider this desirable behaviour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Battery Life on Surface Book 2 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> elias goodrich  say:</h3>
<h2>            Battery Life on Surface Book 2</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone, I recently purchased a Microsoft Surface Book 2 for college.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I know some people have complained about battery drain problems while gaming, but I am not experiencing that. What I am experiencing, however, is severe battery draining while doing simple tasks. Using Chrome to read a book in my English class and working
 on a text document in physics was all it took for my battery to drain (about a little under three hours of usage).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is obviously far from Microsoft's advertised seventeen-hour power extravaganza.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering if anyone had a similar problem as I did, or if anyone has found a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. I had a similar problem on my MacBook where there was a certain task running in the background that absolutely killed my battery. Perhaps a similar occurrence might be seen here?</p>
                </div>

            So far, the reset seems to work. I have been working for about an hour and my battery is down to 90%. I suppose that's a good thing. Perhaps there was an update in the software that I had installed before that drains my battery? I've heard that the anniversary
 update has been causing problems for some people.

<p>If you're using Google Chrome - try stopping using that and switch to Edge or IE and see if there's a major difference.<br />
<br />
For me stopping using Chrome increased my battery life 100% (annoyingly enough)</p>

            Knowing a server name won't do you any good because the school's firewall will block your attempts to set up a VPN.

 &nbsp;How do I change the screen display so that I can see the entire screen without scrolling to the right?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>There are a couple of things you can try:</p>
<p>Change the Screen Resolution;</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Change-screen-resolution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Change-screen-resolution</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that does not fix it, go to your Computer Manufacturer's website &gt; Drivers download Section &gt; then Key in your Computer Model number &gt; look for your Operating System &gt; find either Graphics / Video or Chipset Drivers and download and install them.</p>
<p>Then try&nbsp;to do the Screen Resolution change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or do a System Restore to before this happened.</p>
<p><a href="http://bertk.mvps.org/html/restoresysv.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">http://bertk.mvps.org/html/restoresysv.html</font></a></p>

            Hi Chris,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />I hope you have updated to 1903. Is it an issue with a specific game or all app updates are throwing this error?

            1) After installing Windows 7 - have you installed the newest audio drivers? If not download them from the manufacturers website, or if they don’t have any try Windows Update. Update driver for hardware that isn't working properly:<br />
<br />

    <title>FIFA 14&#58; Unable to connect to EA Servers after resuming game after - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fingleberries  say:</h3>
<h2>            FIFA 14&#58; Unable to connect to EA Servers after resuming game after an App &#40;e.g. Netflix&#41; - Press RS to connect. </h2>
                    
<p>Just wondering if anyone else experiencing this: You've played FIFA for a bit and then switched out to an App (e.g. Netflix, etc.) and when you're finished you've turned off the console (low-power state). After coming back the next time, when you launch
 FIFA, it says that it is unable to contact the EA Servers and press RS to connect.</p>
<p>It never connects. If you go back to the home screen and try to resume FIFA again, it fails.
</p>
<p>The Workaround, if you can call it that, I have found is to Launch another game (e.g. Killer Instinct) and then relaunch FIFA - this seems to reset the 'Game Console' VM and load FIFA successfully.
</p>

<p>yes every time i resume the console. </p>
<p>my fix which is ridiculous is to start an other app before i power off the console. so fifa is not running when i power of as i still cannot work out how else to close the application apart from start onther.</p>
<p>then when it resumes (the next day etc) i can go straight back to fifa and it will load normally and work with no issues. If i leave fifa open i have to power down (fully power off) and restart before i can get it to connect to ea servers and start playing.
 which defeats the quick resume mode??</p>

<p>^^ &nbsp;It's EA's servers that are garbage. &nbsp;Any other non-EA game and this "feature" is actually a refreshing change. &nbsp;Come home from work and click on your favorite game and *bam* you're right where you left off.</p>

<p>An Update to this thread - this issue seems to be when you resume FIFA after it has been inactive for some time (e.g. watching Live TV, Netflix, etc.)
</p>
<p>- The workaround is still required (e.g. start a different game, then start FIFA again), as this resets the Game Console VM partition in Xbox One.
</p>
<p>- Alternatively, in FIFA, if you go to Settings &gt; Change Profile and then select your profile as the Lead profile.
</p>
<p>This works around the issue and gets you back in the game. No chance for EA or MS to resolve it at this stage, as I am sure FIFA 15 is only four months away.

<h3> internovas  say:</h3>
<h2>            Getting BSOD&#39;s with different error messages, help&#63;</h2>
                    I've been having this problem for some time and I can't remember when it started.
<div>First of all, my computer crashes whenever doing something more active, like playing a video game. The computer also crashes from a slight touch. For example, last day I plugged out the mouse, and the computer got a BSOD.</div>
<div>I get a variety of error messages, but the computer also acts strangely.</div>
<div>Here's how it goes:</div>
<div>I'm playing the game, and suddenly the computer crashes. Sometimes it just freezes with a buzzing sound coming from the speakers, and I have to force restart it, but most of the time it just crashes with a MEMORY_MANAGEMENT BSOD, and then the strange behavior
 starts to happen. My computer powers down, then turns on again and shuts down after ~2 seconds, then attempts to do the same again multiple times. It feels like it keeps losing power for some reason. Then it goes to the windows loading screen (I have Windows
 8 64-bit pro), but the spinning loading icon does not appear. Instead, I get a BSOD after a couple of seconds displaying KERNEL_SECURITY_CHECK_FAILURE. After a couple of attempts like that the computer tries to do automatic repair, but crashes in the middle
 of the loading with the same security check BSOD. Finally, after ~10 attempts to boot up it finally manages to do so, and I can return to work. I am currently writing this from that computer.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Event viewer always displays "Event-41 Kernel Power" critical error after each BSOD, but now for the first time I got a different error.</div>
<div>I was playing a video game called Minecraft, and my computer suddenly got a BSOD. I wasn't surprised, but I noticed a different error -&nbsp;UNEXPECTED_KERNEL_MODE_TRAP, and the even viewer displays BUGCHECK this time instead of kernel power. This happened
 for the first time.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Here's a link to the dumps:</div>
<div>http://www2.zippyshare.com/v/84501001/file.html</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In both bugchecks I get "It's probably&nbsp;&nbsp;ntkrnlmp.exe"</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I may suspect my ram (2x 2GB kingston sticks and 2x 2GB crucial sticks), but memtest got all the passes clean without any errors. Although, if I try to boot after removing any stick of ram, the PC won't boot anymore, it just goes to the windows loading
 screen and the restarts without any errors infinitely, unless I put all 8GB back, so I can't check the sticks one by one.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The CPU and GPU are acting fine, I did some stress testing, they're in great shape and never overheat, there's no overclocking on my PC.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This problem has been bothering me for a very long time, any kind of help would be very appreciated.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you.</div>

            <b>To find the definitive cause please run these two tests.</b><br />
<br />
<div>
<div><strong>These crashes were caused by memory corruption (probably a driver).&nbsp; Please run these two tests to verify your memory and find which driver is causing the problem. &nbsp;</strong></div>
<div>
<div>
<p><br />
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">*Dont forget to upload any further DMP files (especially those when verifier is running)</span></em><br />
<br />
*If you are overclocking anything reset to default before running these tests.<br />
In other words STOP!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; If you dont know what this means you probably arent<br />
<br />
<strong>1-Memtest.</strong><br />
*Download a copy of Memtest86 and burn the ISO to a CD using Iso Recorder or another ISO burning program. http://www.memtest.org&nbsp;<br />
*Boot from the CD, and leave it running for at least 5 or 6 passes.<br />
*Just remember, any time Memtest reports errors, it can be either bad RAM or a bad motherboard slot.<br />
*Test the sticks individually, and if you find a good one, test it in all slots.<br />
<br />
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Any errors are indicative of a memory problem.<br />
If a known good stick fails in a motherboard slot it is probably the slot.</span></em><br />
<strong><br />
2-Driver verifier</strong><br />
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Using Driver Verifier is an iffy proposition. Most times it'll crash and it'll tell you what the driver is.</span></em><br />
<br />
*But sometimes it'll crash and won't tell you the driver.<br />
*Other times it'll crash before you can log in to Windows. If you can't get to Safe Mode, then you'll have to resort to offline editing of the registry to disable Driver Verifier.<br />
*I'd suggest that you first backup your data and then make sure you've got access to another computer so you can contact us if problems arise.<br />
*Then make a System Restore point (so you can restore the system using the Vista/Win7 Startup Repair feature).<br />
<strong><br />
Here is the procedure:</strong><br />
- Go to Start and type in "verifier" (without the quotes) and press Enter<br />
- Select "Create custom settings (for code developers)" and click "Next"<br />
- Select "Select individual settings from a full list" and click "Next"<br />
- Select everything EXCEPT FOR "Low Resource Simulation" and click "Next"<br />
- Select "Select driver names from a list" and click "Next"<br />
*Then select all drivers NOT provided by Microsoft and click "Next"<br />
- Select "Finish" on the next page.<br />
*Reboot the system and wait for it to crash to the Blue Screen.<br />
*Continue to use your system normally, and if you know what causes the crash, do that repeatedly. The objective here is to get the system to crash because Driver Verifier is stressing the drivers out. If it doesn't crash for you, then let it run for at least
 36 hours of continuous operation.<br />
*If you can't get into Windows because it crashes too soon, try it in Safe Mode.<br />
*If you can't get into Safe Mode, try using System Restore from your installation DVD to set the system back to the previous restore point that you created.<br />

<h2>            Turning on Guest User on Windows 10</h2>
                    My laptop just finished installing windows 10, I am trying to change my settings back to what I had what windows 8.1.&nbsp; I cannot find a way to create a guest account (i.e. an account that does not require a password to log on to it), the only account options
 available are for "family and other users" which require email addresses, I don't want to set up accounts for every person that might use my computer how can I create a guest user?

<p><span>This behavior can occur if a registry value is corrupted:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This behavior can occur after you install a 16-bit program or a program that uses a 16-bit installation program that is not Windows vista-compliant. This
 behavior can also occur if the Command.com file that is installed on your computer is damaged or is the incorrect version.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span> If you have installed any program lately
 or trying to install a program which is not compatible with windows vista, you may want to install the program in compatibility mode, see the link below for the steps

    <title>The new away status is unavailable on Windows desktop and Android - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> barrygreybeard  say:</h3>
<h2>            The new away status is unavailable on Windows desktop and Android</h2>
                    <p>With my current profile I am unable to choose the "away" status on both my Skype for Windows Desktop (on Windows 10) and my Skype for Android. However, if I use Skype for Web the "away" status is available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To trouble-shoot this problem I created a new profile. With this new profile I can choose the "away" status on all three platforms. If I log in to my previous profile the ability to choose the "away" status disappears on both Android and Skype for Windows
 Desktop.<br />
</p>
<p>Does anyone have any suggestions why this might be happening? I don't want to ditch my current profile if at all possible.</p>
<p>

<h3> glynr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Window 10 Update Version 1703, Why is the GAC&#40;Windows&#47;assembly&#41; Folder structure visible through File Explorer&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed after performing this update that the GAC file structure was visible through File Explorer although I was always under the impression it shouldn't be. I expected to be greeted with the standard list of DLLs you usually get when trying to access
 this file location instead was presented with the GAC_32, GAC_64 and GAC_MSIL folders with their corresponding DLLs inside.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What it should look like:&nbsp;</p>

<p>

<p>Is there a reason this change has happened and if so why as I can't find any notes about this change?&nbsp;</p>

<h3> justmeand myself  say:</h3>
<h2>            This device can perform faster when inserted into a USB2 Port. For a list of ports...etc.</h2>
                    
<p>I upgraded my Vista (Home Basic) Laptop to Windows 7 Ultimate (32 Bit).</p>
<p>I did not encounter any upgrade problems, but now every USB device I attach gives me the warning:<em>"This device can perform faster when inserted into a USB2 Port. For a list of ports...etc."</em></p>
<p>Other than that, I'm happy with the upgrade, and I don't want to go back to Vista.</p>
<p>The laptop is a bare bones eMachine (I believe made by Acer) that I got assigned for work. 2G Memory (not upgradable), 500G Sata HD. Not sure about BusSpeed - I believe 1.6.</p>
<p>How can I get back to USB2? (Without going back to Vista!)</p>
<p>Thanks for any help and suggestions.</p>

<p><span>If your high-speed USB 2.0 ports don't work, you might not have the correct driver installed for the ports in your computer,
 or the ports might be defective. If you are using an external USB hub plugged into your computer, this might also be defective or lack the proper drivers. Check Device Manager to see if your USB ports or hubs are working properly.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Open
 Device Manager by clicking the&nbsp;<strong>Start</strong> button, clicking &nbsp;<strong>Control Panel</strong>, clicking&nbsp;<strong>System and Maintenance</strong>, and then clicking&nbsp;
<strong>Device Manager</strong>.</span><span>‌</span><span>&nbsp;If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation,
 type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Double-click&nbsp;<strong>Universal
 Serial Bus controllers</strong> and check to see if all your USB ports, hubs, and controllers are functioning correctly. Any devices not functioning will have a yellow exclamation mark in front of them.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>If
 Device Manager shows any USB ports, hubs, or controllers are not functioning, check for updated drivers. For more information, see<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Update a driver
