                    <div><b>Original Title:&nbsp;</b>"archive calendar"</div>
As there is no Archive option for Outlook for Mac 2011, I exported the calendar. After exporting i see all events even which happen in future has also moved. When I have imported the archive file to calendar, the events are showing under 'on my computer' folder.
 The problem is that these events are not showing in the regular calendar due to which it is not syncing with my iPhone calendar.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am unable to move certain items from archived file to regular file also.</div>

            <b>Hey&nbsp;Shameek,</b>

<div>I need to know how your Outlook is configurd (POP3, IMAP, Exchange etc..)? Or if that confuses you just describe if it is at home, or work or however it is used.</div>

    <title>Can&#39;t log in to Microsoft on Internet Explorer 11 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dschigusa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t log in to Microsoft on Internet Explorer 11</h2>
                    <p>Recently I have been having problems with Internet Explorer (both Metro and desktop) when trying to log in to Microsoft sites.<br />
<br />
The two Microsoft sites I can't log in to or use properly with Internet Explorer are:<br />
(a) <strong>Microsoft Community</strong>. I click "Log in" at top right, and I can see the tab quickly flick in succession from "answers.microsoft" to "Resuming" to "login.live.com" before it reverts to the same log in screen, every time.<br />
(b) <strong>https://commerce.microsoft.com/</strong><br />
I can log in but<br />
(i) clicking on "Basic Info" or "Security and Privacy" doesn't get a response. I just stay on the "Welcome to your Microsoft Account" screen.<br />
(ii) even though clicking on "Payment methods" and "Payment-related help" takes me to those pages, if I click on "Add a payment method" my "Country/Region" selection shows up, but below that is a constantly revolving cursor, or a revolving cursor that eventually
 changes to "This content cannot be viewed within the frame."<br />
<br />
(NB I have a Japanese OS Windows 8.1 so the above titles are rough translations.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then how come I'm here on Microsoft Community and submitting a question? Because I'm now using Firefox (obviously with none of the above problems). But I prefer using IE because I can easily turn off picture downloading when I'm on my limited-bandwidth portable
 modem. </p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>the solution is to remove the domains from your trusted sites list...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tools&gt;Internet Options&gt;Security tab, Trusted sites icon 'Sites' button....</p>
<p>remove </p>
<p>https://*.microsoft.com<br />
https://*.xbox.com<br />
https://*.zune.net</p>
<p>
</p><p>save your changes then try to login to the MS community sites......</p>
<p>
</p><p>IE has a security setting to prevent navigation into domains of lower integrity.... when you access a MS/xbox/zune/google/Facebook site or any website that users a verification service like MS Passport or your Facebook id it has to navigate to another website
 to validate your credentials... if the OTHER website is not in the same security zone, there is a conflict of site integrity...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hence you see the address changing to and fro in the address bar.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Generally, home uses should not have any website listed in the IE Trusted Sites list.... It actually has lower security settings (allow unsigned ActiveX controls and java applets)... Public websites like MS.com, google and Facebook are designed to work just
 as well if they are not placed in the Trusted Zone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Trusted sites zone is mostly used for large companies and governments where they know and trust the website which are not publicly accessible and may be using unsigned ActiveX controls, applets or certificates..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I ask, did you place those websites (Microsoft.com, xbox.com and zune.net) in your trusted sites list?</p>
<p>If not... what is the brand of your anti-virus software (eg. Malwarebytes, Spybot S&amp;D etc).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you using Windows 8.1 or server 2012 SPx.... server versions of Windows have a different default IE security zone configuration and sometimes the above domains may be in the Trusted Sites list by default (factory settings).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<h2>            How can someone send a vcf file without it showing as an attachment&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Someone I work with includes her .vcf file in every email.&nbsp; I can see a benefit to that but I find it a little annoying because every email has an attachment. That means I can't distinguish emails from her that actually have attachments from every other
 email she sends. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on how she might accomplish the same thing without having it show up as an attachment in every email? I'm wondering if it is possible to embed the vcf or provide a link to the vcf.&nbsp;

            No, that is not possible. The information can be either placed within the actual signature itself or she can decide to place the vcf-file on a web location (or shared cloud storage) and include a link to it within her signature.

            <p>Hey Joe</p>
<p>The most common causes for this problem are covered in article<span><span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2671569" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">KB2671569</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>Here are the methods mentioned in the article.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>Method 1: Install the latest updates</strong><br />
<br />
You might need to set Windows Update to automatically download and install recommended updates. Installing any important, recommended, and optional updates can often correct problems by replacing out-of-date files and fixing vulnerabilities. To install the
 latest Office updates, click the link specific to your version of Windows and follow the steps in that article:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Install-Windows-updates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Install Windows updates in Windows 7</a><span>
</span><br />
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Install-Windows-updates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Install Windows updates in Windows Vista</a><span>
</span><br />
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-xp/help/setup/set-up-automatic-updates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Install Windows updates in Windows XP</a><span>
</span><br />
<br />
<em>If installing the latest Office updates did not resolve your issue, continue to method 2.</em>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<strong>Method 2: Check to make sure Excel is not in use by another process</strong>.
<div><br />
If Excel is in use by another process, this information will be displayed in the horizontal status bar at the bottom of the screen. If you try to perform other actions while Excel is in use, Excel may not respond. Let the task in process finish its job before
 attempting other actions. <br />
<br />
<em>If Excel is not in use by another process, continue to method 3.</em> </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<strong>Method 3: Investigate possible issues with add-ins </strong>
<div><br />
While add-ins can enhance your experience, they can occasionally interfere or conflict with Excel. Try starting Excel without add-ins to see if the problem goes away. Here’s how:
<ol>
<li>Do one of the following:<br />
If you are running Windows XP, click <b>Start</b>, and then click <b>Run</b>.<br />
If you are running Windows Vista or Windows 7, click <b>Start</b>.</li><li>Type <b>Excel</b><b> /safe</b>, and then click <b>OK</b>.</li><li>If the issue is resolved, on the <b>File</b> menu, click <b>Options</b>, and then click
<b>Add-Ins</b>.</li><li>Select <b>COM Add-ins</b>, and then click <b>Go</b>. </li><li>Click to clear all the check boxes (Disable the Add-ins) in the list, and then click
<b>OK</b>.</li><li>Restart Excel.</li></ol>
If the issue does not occur, start enabling the add-ins one at a time until the issue occurs. This will allow you to figure out which add-in is causing the problem. Be sure and restart Excel each time you enable an Add-in.<br />
<br />
<em>If disabling add-ins did not resolve your issue, continue to method 4</em>.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<strong>Method 4: Repair your Office 2010 programs </strong>
<div><br />
Repairing your Office 2010 programs can resolve issues with Excel not responding, hanging, or freezing by automatically repairing errors in the file.
<ol>
<li>Quit any Microsoft Office programs that are running. </li><li>Open the <b>Control Panel</b>, and then open <b>Add or Remove Programs</b> (if you are running Windows XP) or
<b>Programs and Features</b> (if you are running Windows Vista or Windows 7).</li><li>In the list of installed programs, right-click <b>Microsoft Office 2010</b>, and then click
<b>Repair</b>.</li></ol>
<b>NOTE:</b> If you are using Office Click-to-Run, please see the following Microsoft Office article and follow the steps to Repair Office Click-to-Run:<br />
<br />
If you're not sure if the version of Office that you have is Click to Run, check your version by:
<ol>
<li>Open any Office product (Excel, Word, PowerPoint etc.).</li><li>Click on the <b>File </b>Tab and select <b>Help</b>.</li><li>Under "About Microsoft Office" it should say (32-bit) or (64-bit) next to the version number.</li><li>If you have a<b> Click to Run </b>version it will be stated there.</li></ol>
<br />
<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/update-repair-or-uninstall-office-click-to-run-products-HA010382089.aspx?CTT=1#_Toc272139012" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Update, repair, or uninstall Office Click-to-Run products</a><span>
</span><br />
<em>If repairing your Office programs did not resolve your issue, continue to method 5.
</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<strong>Method 5: Check to see if your antivirus software is up-to-date or conflicting with Excel
</strong>
<p>If your antivirus software is not up-to-date, Excel may not function properly.
<br />
<br />
<b>To check whether your antivirus software is up-to-date</b><br />
<br />
To keep up with new viruses that are created, antivirus software vendors periodically provide updates that you can download from the Internet. Download the latest updates by visiting your antivirus software vendor’s website.
<br />
<br />
For a list of antivirus software vendors, see <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/antivirus-partners/windows-7.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Consumer security software providers</a><span> </span><br />
<br />
<b>To check whether antivirus software is conflicting with Excel </b><br />
<br />
If your antivirus software includes integration with Excel , you may experience performance issues. In this case, you can disable all Excel integration within the antivirus software. Or, you can disable any antivirus software add-ins that are installed in Excel
 . <br />
<br />
<b>Important:</b> Changing your antivirus settings may make your PC vulnerable to viral, fraudulent, or malicious attacks. Microsoft does not recommend that you attempt to change your antivirus settings. Use this workaround at your own risk.
<br />
<br />
You may have to contact your antivirus software vendor to determine how to configure software to exclude any integration with Excel or to exclude scanning in Excel.
<br />
</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>
</p><p>How is this possible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When a User-1 opens the FORM and selects some data, the autonumber ID is populated on the FORM and if the record is not saved until the user clicks SAVE... how can a &nbsp;unique autonumber ID be given to the FORM for User-2 or User-3?&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The autonumber ID is unique (no duplicates) and is the Primary key.</p>
<p>The db is set to share and record level locking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that sometimes... &nbsp;it appears that User-1, User-2, or User-3 have the same autonumber ID on their FORM! &nbsp;This is what is really confusing to me!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I confirmed this by Remote Desktop Connect onto (2) PC's installed the 2013 runtime module and copied the .accde to the desktops. I have 3 monitors that I can see and run each session.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else experienced this problem and can you direct me on the best action for a resolution?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The LACCDB should appear on the front-end and back-end database. The LACCDB appears on the back-end database when you create a lock on it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A lock is created when your front-end database opens a table linked to a table on the back-end database. It can also occur if you create an explicit link to the back-end database. For performance reasons, your front-end database should have code that does
 this when it starts. That eliminates the repetitive creation and deletion of the lock file.

OK, in Outlook do File-Open-Outlook Data File and see if there's another pst file lurking there...<br />

Hello Tim, thank you for your attention. The solution that&nbsp;Mr.<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/0a0753b4-d11f-4ee4-b41c-e4b27cc1747d">Jack

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was facing the same issue on my lumia 800 for past one month but it is working fine now.&nbsp; I was able to browse google websites like gmail, youtube etc. But when i tried to open any other webiste it was not opeingin up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only mistake i realised was&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;wifi was turned on under settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But ever since the day i turned it off, &nbsp;its working fantastically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If &nbsp;wifi is already Turned&nbsp;off please contact your service provider for Proxy server/URL and Proxy port and update this information under Settings - Cellular Data - Edit APN
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It should work fine :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All the Best.</p>

<p><span>Hi Suepchristensen,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>It seems that you are experiencing the issue that you can’t see the Survey button in Excel Online. If yes, I’d like you to confirm and provide the following.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Give us some screenshots showing the symptom of the issue you are experiencing.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Where do you create the Excel file and open it in Excel Online?</span></p>
<p><span>3. If you change a browser, what’s the outcome? If you are using IE, I recommend you try clearing IE cache via Tools&gt;Safety&gt;Delete browsing history and do a test again to see the result.</span></p>

<p>None of this seems to be working for me.&nbsp; I am working inside a large Corp. and we have OneDrive Business (Office 2016).&nbsp; I need to get the Survey function working.&nbsp; When I go to OneDrive and click new and select survey&nbsp; I do not get any Survey icon.</p>

    <title>Cannot open your default e-mail folders. Outlook is using an old copy - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> systemoftheworld  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot open your default e-mail folders.  Outlook is using an old copy of your Outlook data file &#40;.ost&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I use Outlook 2010 on a PC and laptop, both running Windows 8 and using local profiles, both connecting to an Exchange 2007 server.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Starting Outlook on the PC today it opens, shows the mail in the OST but I get the message:
</p>

<p>"Cannot open your default e-mail folders.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Outlook is using an old copy of your Outlook data file (.ost).<span>&nbsp;
</span>Exit Outlook, delete the file, and restart Outlook.<span>&nbsp; </span>
A new file be automatically created next time you initiate a send/receive."</p>

<p>Outlook will not update the OST file, even though it lets me use its contents.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I tried various workarounds that I have used to accelerate Outlook set-up in the past, but in the end only deleting the OST and letting Outlook recreate it has worked.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It’s painful, because it’s a 2GB download of data that is already there and accessible, but I can tolerate it just this once.<span>&nbsp;
</span>My concern is that I have no idea why it happened, hence cannot prevent it happening in the future.</p>

<p>Looking around forums I see one of the main causes is when you use of roaming profiles and your profile information and Outlook OST go out of sync,
 but this is not applicable in my case since all profiles are local.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Other causes seem rarely mentioned are equally not applicable.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Does anyone have any suggestions of possible causes of these symptoms?</p>

<p>Thanks, David</p>

            <p>It's best to get your Exchange administrator into the mix here. If anything has happened with your mailbox or user account on the mail server, then this could happen as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A method which may prevent you from needing to redownload the mailbox data is by copying over the ost-file from your laptop to the PC. Worst case scenario is that you need to redownload everything after all.</p>

    <title>Nokia Lumia 928 software update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rousseau57  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia Lumia 928 software update</h2>
                    Dear community,greetings. I am a Nokia Lumia 928 for Verizon user in Bangladesh using a local SIM and the phone is working perfectly. I surfed the internet and found that it will get the official release of WP 10. One thing I noticed that only phones with
 Lumia Denim and OS version&nbsp;8.10.14219.341, or newer will get the update. My lumia is also Denim, but the OS is&nbsp;8.10.14203.306. Today I noticed an update for my phone saying Windows Phone 8.1(8.10.14219.341) is ready for download. I started the download connecting
 to a hi speed wi-fi and charger connected. Every time at 4% level,the download stops and says the update couldn't be downloaded (801882cc). I googled the net but no solution regarding this error. I even gave a hard reset and again starter the download but
 the same result. Anyone please help me in this regard? Thank you in agvance

<h2>            Office 365 Education Plus for students younger than 13 years.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>We are a K-12 school and have Office 365 for employees and would like to extend some of the apps to students from 6 to 12 grades. We also have volume licensing for Office so are eligible for Office 365 Education Plus for Students (and Teachers). I see the
 availability of these licenses in my admin portal. Our students don't have email address in our domain (and we don't want them to). However this means they cannot self-sign up.</p>
<p>Is it ok to create students accounts through the admin center, even if some of the students may be below 13 years old? We will disable the Exchange and Yammer part so they do not get email.</p>
<p>I have made test accounts with student licensing and am able to disable Exchange and Yammer so I know that it can be done. I am trying to find out if that is acceptable use.</p>

<p>Regards,</p>
<p>JM.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it is not possible to show weekends in different color using the in built functions within Outlook. Perhaps this could be accomplished by creating forms. For more information on how to
 create forms you may post your question in Microsoft Office Programming forum below:</p>

<h2>            Syncing my smartphone and laptop wirelessly</h2>
                    I have a Samsung smartphone and for a while the email synced with my laptop wirelessly but nothing else. When i was out on the road the emails came and went beautifully though i would also have liked calendar to sync too but it didn't. I tried to load
 device centre in the hope it would fix it but now nothing sync's. My phone now has an outlook email account on it with all the mail i previously received but i can't get it to sync. Email comes to my laptop but not the&nbsp;phone and the phone won't send. Can anyone
 help. How do i get that outlook account on the phone working again? I tried starting from scratch with an new email account but apparently i can have only one outlook account so i need to get this one working.

            You can create multiple outlook profiles in control panel and choose which profile is used to sync the phone, not just one account.&nbsp; I have had countless problems with bluetooth active sync myself.&nbsp; So, I have reverted back to syncing with usb on my master
 PC.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have a second PC, you could also use that PC to create another relationship, migrate the data to that PC then disassociate the first sync relationship and then start over again establishing the new link.&nbsp; I have found that it resolved a world of ills..

<h2>            OneDrive, problem syncing files within subfolders, within main folders</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am using windows 10 on my HP Pavillion&nbsp; laptop, I have my OneDrive folder which contains main folders and sub-folders, to which I save documents and pictures of various home remodeling projects I am doing. So if I have anything new, I save it to the appropriate
 folder or sub-folder within OneDrive, assuming it will automatically sync; however, the files themselves to not load, only the folders and sub-folders, the only way I seem to be able to get this to work is to manually 'drag and drop' the files into the folder,
 am I expecting OneDrive to do something it's not supposed to do, or am I going about it the wrong way ?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>
</p><p>Based in my research, &nbsp;I am afraid currently Visio will not work with Office 365 for Home accounts and is only available to Office 365 for Business.

<p>
</p><p>Personally, I'd like to encourage you&nbsp;visit the <a href="https://visio.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Visio UserVoice </a>forum to vote for a similar&nbsp;idea or submit your owns.&nbsp;Microsoft loves reading your feedback and is committed to continuously improving your experience with Microsoft products.</p>

<p>Hi Brian,</p>
<p>Please note that the current workaround to uninstal the KB3085566 update is applicable to the .msi-based installs of Office.</p>
<p>As you installed the Click-to-Run edition of Office 365 ProPlus 2013 from the Office 365 portal, please look up for the details in "Current Status" from Service Health Dashboard (SHD) for incident SP31654 for any action items or recent updated information.</p>

<p>Last Updated: Oct 15 2015 11:08PM UTC<br />
Engineers have developed a solution that will resolve the issue. This solution will require an update to the Office 2013 client software, which is expected to take an extended period of time due to the complexity of the client software update process. Engineers
 are anticipating that the new client update will be ready for distribution early next week.</p>
<p>We will update to the primary thread below once the issue is resolved or you can obtain the most recent information from SHD.</p>

<h2>            How to re-use a one seat license on another pc&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I purchased a new Surface Pro and promptly purchased a one-seat license to Office 2016. After a couple weeks of just using the Internet, I decided I need a laptop with a much bigger screen as I'd been using a 17" one!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I plan to wipe the Surface Pro clean and return it to Costco, then buy a larger laptop.&nbsp; How can I use/activate that serial key on my new laptop?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help,</p>

<p>The “Office Install” MS support site has detailed instructions for this process.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Essentially it is a 3 step process which can all be done from the new computer.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>The first step</strong> is to log in<span>&nbsp;
</span>to the MyAccount site on the new computer.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Second step </strong>is to remove permission to use full functionality on the old computer, you “deactivate” it. In Office 365 you do NOT have to uninstall Office. When you use the “deactivate” function, that copy
 of Office goes into “limited function mode”. When in that mode, you can open files and print them, but you cannot save any changes to the files. In other words, you cannot edit the files</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<div>
<strong><span>The third step</span></strong><span> is to install on the new computer. The install will also assign a license “count to it to “activate” the programs.</span>
<p>Here are the specific links you need:</p>

    <title>File Painter and VBA - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> adam from here  say:</h3>
<h2>            File Painter and VBA</h2>
                    I support a suite of macros for Word that includes a background process that substitutes for the unsupported application events. (It's a macro that calls itself using OnTime.)<br />
<br />
This works pretty well, but has one side effect. The OnTime macro interrupts and resets the status (button up or down) of the File Painter button. Consequently I am trying to either (1) interact with the button programatically or (2) create a custom control
 with the same functionality and use it instead.<br />
<br />
Normally, as far as I can tell, pressing the button (1) runs the CopyFormatting command and (2) sets the state of the button to msoButtonDown. Then clicking or selecting any part of the document (3) runs PasteFormatting and (4) sets the state of the button
 to msoButtonUp.<br />
<br />
My working assumption is that Word detects the button status after each click event and, if the button is down, performs steps 3 and 4 above. But if the button state is reset to up, nothing will happen.<br />
<br />
Running any (?) macro interrupts this sequence and resets the button state to msoButtonUp, which prevents (3) from firing. Unfortunately the button state for a built-in control suich as the format painter is read-only, so I can't store the value of the state
 in a variable and reassign it.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know how to interact with this button using VBA? I think I could solve my problem if I could just keep the button pressed.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, can anyone suggest how to essentially duplicate this control in a custom control? The thing I am hung up on is getting steps (3) and (4) to run on click.<br />
<br />
I know this is an odd problem but I'd be grateful for any ideas.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<p><span style="color: rgba(38, 38, 38, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(38, 38, 38, 1)">As you probably are aware, the Format Painter is not fully implemented on the Mac in the same way as on the PC. And by that I mean the automatic next selection clicks of the mouse or as you have indicated the mouse button down
 and up, which would apply the formatting.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(38, 38, 38, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(38, 38, 38, 1)">And you are correct that the Mouse Up event for Mouse Click does normally trigger the PasteFormat function.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(38, 38, 38, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(38, 38, 38, 1)">However on the Mac you can use Cmd+Shift+C to copy the formatting (this executes the CopyFormat function) and follow it with a Cmd+Shift+V (this executes the PasteFormat function) to apply the formatting to a newly selected text
 somewhere else in the document. Not quite a slick as the Mouse only action but very workable.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(38, 38, 38, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(38, 38, 38, 1)">As for a VBA solution you could replace the CopyFormat subroutine and turn it into a toggle like event utilizing the same shortcut keystroke for copying or the CopyFormat toolbar button. To use this code you need to declare a
 Public Boolean variable of cpyFormat.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(38, 38, 38, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Sub CopyFormat()</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If cpyFormat = False Then</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Selection.CopyFormat</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cpyFormat = True</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Else</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Selection.PasteFormat</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cpyFormat = False</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If</p>
<p>End Sub</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>And a third alternative...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(38, 38, 38, 1)">If you already have the Mouse events coded then instead of using a timer to activate I would suggest the Public Boolean variable method that executes the Selection.PasteFormat command if it encounters a True condition on the public
 variable.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(38, 38, 38, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(38, 38, 38, 1)">Hope this helps</span></p>

            This for information only.<br />
<ol>
<li>Format Painter works as follow in Mac.</li><li>Highlight desired section to copy format from</li><li>Click on format painter <b>"once"</b> and&nbsp; click at beginning of section you want to format.</li><li>Format Painter then turns off.<br />
</li><li>Double click on Format Painter.</li><li>When double-clicked Format painter remains active until you click on it one time again or you use ⌘-Z to undo a change.
</li><li>When fully active (double clicked) you can select contiguous items or non-contiguous areas.</li></ol>
That is the way Format Painter works on Mac. <br />
<br />
Maybe this can help figure out what is turning off format painter at the wrong time.

            Thanks Phillip that was helpful... yes if his routines are looking for a single click then that's why the Selection.PasteFormat is not being triggered.

            Thank you, Rich, and also Phillip below.<br />
<br />
I do know about the cmd+shift key shortcuts. Personally I&nbsp; prefer them to the style painter button, but my goal is to restore as much of the default functionality as possible.
<br />
<br />
Ideally a new hire at our firm who knows Word would not have to relearn anything (though he or she might have to learn about some of the new features the suite of macros provides) or encounter any suprises.<br />
<br />
Phillip, I know what is interrupting format painter, it is the macro that runs in the background, using OnTime, to fill in for the missing events.<br />
<br />
Rich, as I read your code I cold certainly track the status of any format copying by using a public variable. I could also detect and store the state of the commandbar control. The thing I am trying to figure out is what to do with that information?&nbsp; since
 the .status property of built-in controls is read-only.<br />
<br />
I have several ideas about that but none are perfect. Maybe I don't understand the code you propose, it seems to me that would make the copyformat command behave very differently than it usually does!<br />
<br />
Thanks to both of you for your thoughts.<br />
<br />
Adam<br />

            I'm afraid I must not have been clear at all.<br />
<br />
I do not care about difference, if any, with how this feature is implemented on the mac versus windows versions. Rather<br />

Thus my question:<br />

<li>Does anyone know how to interact with this button using VBA?

It's not about how the file painter works normally. It's about how to trick it into working normally given the ontime hack.<br />

            No Adam you have not made yourself clear.
<div><br />
<div>"This works pretty well, but has one side effect. The OnTime macro interrupts and resets the status (button up or down) of the File Painter button. Consequently I am trying to either (1) interact with the button programatically or (2) create a custom control
 with the same functionality and use it instead."</div>
<div><br />
<div>Your original post subject was about what you called "File Painter" which does not exist. I took the leap and figured you were meaning Format Painter. By your subsequent response it appeared that my assumptive leap was correct.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Now you say that your post was not about "File Painter", which again does not exist, except that you say... "Alas, this macro interrupts File Painter and resets the state of the button to unclicked."</div>
<div><br />
<div>So I guess I am very confused about what you want help with.</div>
<div><br />
<div>But let's start over...</div>
<div><br />
<div>Events cannot be trapped with Word 2011 VBA; you cited the January Answer from Peter. With the 14.3.4 release, the "Format Painter" function now performs in Word 2011 just as it does in Word 2010 on the PC so other than where the button is located... what
 would your user's need to learn or what would your macros need to trap in order to help them? But your post is not about Format Painter... right I get that now, so I'll move on.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Word VBA on the PC can only identify mouse actions of WindowBeforeDoubleClick or WindowBeforeRightClick, which leaves WindowSelectionChange as the only possible method of determining what the user has selectively done regarding a mouse click. Unfortunately,
 I have to say it again, since Word 2011 for the Mac does not allow the trapping of events, these events are not available to Word 2011 VBA code.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The way I see it, your only possible alternative is to figure out a way to trap or invoke the mouse down event using Applescript... checkout "System Events."</div>
<div><br />
<div>Good luck</div>
<div><br />

            Rich, I am sorry for the errors that plagued my post and am grateful for the efforts you have made.
<br />
<br />
I am sure it is hard enough to understand the nature of the problems that people bring here even when they do not screw up their descriptions of it. I do not know what possesed my hand or by brain to type "file painter."<br />
<br />
I am indeed asking about interacting with format painter through VBA. I don't think AppleScript would be a good solution for us.<br />
<br />
I am aware that application events are not supported in Word 2011 (though apparently they are in Excel); it is the workaround for that exact problem that interrupts format painter. It is that problem that I am trying to remedy.<br />
<br />
I had though perhaps it might be possible to write Format Painter from scratch and assign it to a custom button, which, being custom, would allow its .state to be reset.<br />
<br />
I have been so unclear that perhaps I ought to just delete this thread and start over.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the trouble, and thank you.<br />

<p>I'm not going to give my vote to a phone model that has faced it's dead end my manufacturer in less than a year. Support&nbsp; is gone, Nokia closed Maemo apps like Maps will not improve anymore, I'm afraid.</p>

<p>We are left with a phone (well, let's call it mobile computer) with rock solid OS with half-done apps from Nokia and some very useful 3th party apps.</p>

<p>Even if that were true, that doesn't mean the phone as it stands isn't better than the Palm Pre. It quite simply is. But, you're wrong. support isn't gone, there's a bugfix for 1.3 which is speculated to arrive in coming months. Maps may improve, Nokia have
 said if the maps for MeeGo can be easily ported to Maemo they will be.</p>
<p>Apps always come from 3rd parties, you think Apple made 200,000 apps? No. And, with the QT4 framework, the N900 will be able to get the apps for Symbian ^3 and MeeGo.</p>

<p>I've never used Palm Tre, so hard to say which one is better, quite sure that it is N900.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I consider support missing when manufacturee responds to everything with deep silence, roadmap of n900's future is full of speculations. As you say, PR 1.3 speculated to arrive, not guaranteed to arrive. Maps may, or may not, improve.</p>
<p>I really does not make difference, who has developed N900 calendar, email, media player et al, they are Nokia's. If they don't develop them further, who will?</p>
<p>Mu understanding is that QT-based apps must be, at minimum, re-compiled for Maemo, one cannot just copy the app to N900. QT is not interpreter. Compilation needs source code, right?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are right, basically. Nothing is lost per se (at least yet), but the signs are not very promising. Hopefully I'm wrong..</p>

<p>Rightfully so. To think we almost lost to a device that doesn't even have video recording...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next round will be tough though, Galaxy S or X10, both have a large user base which the N900 doesn't have</p>

<p>The companies and independent developers that created those 200,000 apps (250,000 as of September 1, 2010) saw that there were money to be made in doing so. With Nokia having killed Maemo, what appeal is there for third parties for developing apps for the
 N900? Is the phone selling like hotcakes? They would probably sell more of it if they hadn't announced that MeeGo will not be available for it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One example in which I would be interested: will Audible be dedicating resources to porting their audiobook player app to the N900? Do you think they expect to sell so many more audiobooks after having done that that they could recover the expenses for the
 porting effort?</p>

<p>Did you not notice how the N900 was never really advertised by Nokia? It was never a mass market phone - intentionally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You say will apps be made "for the N900", that's misleading. The N900 is a device; what you mean is will they make them for Maemo. Some are, yes, but most won't. However, they won't need to, because with the QT4 framework, Symbian and MeeGo apps will work
 on Maemo. In fact there are already some MeeGo apps available...</p>
