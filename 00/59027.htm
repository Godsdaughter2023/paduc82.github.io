<h2>            Bluetooth Headphones can&#39;t pair with Windows 10 PC</h2>
                    <p>I have a pair of Sony WH-1000 XM2 headphones that work with devices like my phone flawlessly but can no longer pair with my Windows 10 PC, even though they used to work with it at one point in time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I have tried:</p>
<p>-installing the latest Intel bluetooth drivers</p>
<p>-unistalling bluetooth devices from device manager</p>
<p>-restarting my PC</p>
<p>-resetting headphones to factory settings</p>
<p>-turning on the "allow bluetooth devices to find this PC" in bluetooth settings</p>
<p />

            I got it to work, finally. Seems the problem was the 2016 bluetooth drivers that MS installs. Searching on the MSI forum, I found a reference to the 2018 Killer driver suite, which is what this laptop uses. I installed their Bluetooth driver and the issue
 is resolved.

            That's okay. With so much customizations, no two machines are identical :)<br />
<br />
I'm giving you an alternate way for Steps 1 and 2. Hope this helps.<br />

<h3> lisaa_833  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10&#58;  Windows Explorer Process consuming CPU</h2>
                    My laptop recently starting displaying the blinking circle next to the cursor and is running very slowly.&nbsp; I checked the task manager and noticed that the Windows Explorer process was consuming a lot of CPU.&nbsp; This only happens when logged into one of the
 user accounts.&nbsp; There are no problems when logged into the other account so I believe this is caused by some process I cannot see that is only executing in one of the user accounts.&nbsp; I have disabled everything on start-up for that account and still the problem
 persists.&nbsp; I removed the device driver that I recently installed, although I don't think the device driver is the problem since it only happens when logged in as one of the users.&nbsp; If the device driver were the problem it would show up regardless of which
 account was logged in.&nbsp; As expected, this had no impact.&nbsp; Does anyone have any thoughts?

            <span>Hi Lisa,</span><span>&nbsp; </span>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for giving us an opportunity to assist you with the query.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>I understand the inconvenience caused, n</span><span>ow that you have me with you let me take care of this.
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>High CPU usage occurs for various reasons:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Virus/Malware infections.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Outdated drivers, </span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Third party software conflicts.</span><span>&nbsp; </span>
</p>
</li></ul>
<p><span><span>As an initial step, I suggest you to disable antivirus software and firewall on the computer and check if that fixes the issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Disclaimers</strong><span>: Antivirus software helps protecting your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other
 software and\or troubleshoot any pertinent issue, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to malware attacks.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Let us try the following steps, and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 1</strong>: Let us run <strong>System Maintenance</strong> troubleshooter which helps to find and clean up unused files, shortcuts, and perform maintenance tasks.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Follow the below steps: </span></p>
<p><span>1. Press <strong>Windows</strong> and <strong>X</strong> key together and select
<strong>Control Panel</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click on <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Click on <strong>View all option</strong> on the left side of the Windows.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Click on <strong>System Maintenance</strong> option.</span></p>
<p><span>5. Click on <strong>Next</strong> and follow the onscreen instructions.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let us try to start your computer in safe mode with Networking and check if the issue appears there as well. If it does not appear in safe mode with Networking place the computer in clean boot state to identify the culprit program running in the background
 creating this issue. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2: Safe Mode with Networking</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Safe mode is a diagnostic mode that starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Refer: <strong>Start your PC in safe mode in Windows&nbsp;10</strong></span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-10/start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-10/start-your-pc-in-safe-mode</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the problem does not exist in safe mode, try to perform a clean boot and check.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 3: </strong><strong>Clean Boot</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the article How to perform a clean boot in Windows in the below link and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note</strong>: Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section
<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong> to boot the computer in normal mode.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope it helps.</span></p>

<h2>            iTunes error and missing tab after installing Win 10</h2>
                    <p>I've had no end of problems with Windows 10. Maybe I need to roll back to 7 and try again? First was the problem with all my documents being "read only" even though that was unchecked under properties. I got that fixed, but now I'm trying to update apps
 in iTunes and receive a 5105 error which indicates a problem in the registry. I cannot find any way to change my screensaver, even though one runs after 10 minutes. And on top of that, I've tried to set up my computer to boot to screen menu but when I click
 properties on the taskbar, I don't get what everyone else gets. I don't have a start tab and I only have 1 thing under the navigation tab (see picture).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anybody offer me any suggestions?</p>

            An even easier way is to do this:
<div><br />
<div><b>1) Right click on the font you want (usually has &nbsp;.ttf after the name of the actual font).</b></div>
<div><b>2) Click install &nbsp;(the third item from the top).</b></div>

    <title>Worst Customer Support, Ever&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cosanostra88  say:</h3>
<h2>            Worst Customer Support, Ever&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Well folks, after 30 minutes talking to a rather slow-typing agent in chat, who inevitably had no power to help me, I went on to have Xbox Live customer support call me.</p>
<p>I spoke with an agent for about 5-10 minutes, and he said that he understood my issue (I was getting more and more spam message) and thought his supervisor could help me out. So after waiting another 5 minutes for the supervisor, he came on. That's when
 everything got worse. The supervisor told me that I had no idea what I was doing and that his policy dictated what he could do.</p>
<p>To rewind a bit and clarify the issue:</p>
<ol>
<li>I just bought a new Xbox One and was setting everything up </li><li>I got to the change gamertag page and was confronted with a $9.99 charge to change my gamertag, despite the marketing about "First gamertag &nbsp;change is free".
</li><li>I read into this more and now realize that accounts older than 3 years were able to "choose" their first gamertag and were therefore not applicable for this new change due to the new process giving customers a randomized gamertag from the get-go.
</li><li>Thinking that my 6 year gold status would show them that I haven't had the opportunity to get a gemertag change, I promptly told them about it
</li><li>"We could care less if you were one day or ten years" You have to pay for your gamertag change
</li><li>I said that due to the harassment I thought a one-time exception would be acceptable, and a good customer service play to keep me happy with their service. I mean what does this cost on the other end for their servers to propagate data in a different way?
 Changing a text string is a very simple process. </li><li>I asked repeatedly for a case number to which the supervisor considered this a threat when I told him I would be contacting Microsoft about this experience (did I mention the guy wouldn't stop talking over me and talking down to me?)
</li><li>Finally the supervisor told me, "I don't take kindly to threats and am hanging up on you now"
</li></ol>

<div>At the end of the day, $9.99 isn't much, but I will tell you what is, the $550 I spent on the Xbox, the $60 I spent on an extra controller, and the hundreds of dollars on games that would come next.&nbsp;</div>

<div>Unless I get an apology, my gamertag changed, and the clarity that I am a valued customer -- I plan to move on and not look back.&nbsp;</div>

<div>Regards,</div>
<div>W</div>

<p>CosaNostra88, it's simply Microsoft policy that forbids the free gamertag change. &nbsp;And, there are no exceptions, unfortunately. &nbsp;Either you pay for the change or you get reported by other players and get forced to change your gamertag if it is considered
 offensive. &nbsp;The support reps you spoke with are following policy in order to protect their jobs. &nbsp;Look at it like this, if you go to a cashier at a store and say, "Hi, I shop here every week, can I get this item free just cause I am awesome like that?" they
 would not be allowed to do that because more than likely it goes against store policy. &nbsp;And, if the cashier goes against policy he can be written up or fired. &nbsp;But, I understand that it is not what customer service says... it's how they say it. &nbsp;And, it sounds
 like they didn't say what they had to say in a very friendly, empathetic manor. &nbsp;So, I am sorry that your customer service experience was not a good one, but you had a request that they could literally do nothing about.</p>

<p>a you refuse to follow basic trouble shooting steps</p>
<p>by not changing privacy settings and using it as an excuse for a free change</p>
<p>that isn't an escalatible case because you refuse to "protect yourself" and claim harrassment</p>
<p>setting privacy settings will stop all harrassment</p>
<p>it is also ser clearly in the terms of use</p>
<p>you should feel privilege to even have the option to change as no other console allows name change</p>
<p>the ironic thing is you are claiming bad customer service when it was the moder forums or YouTube video you Google for the info that gave you fake info</p>
<p>any reputable site will tell you if you have a real harrassment problem how to deal with it which is privacy settings or calling the cops</p>

<p>I appreciate everyone's comments. To Lilliathvain's point, to me it was about HOW everything transpired, not even WHAT transpired.</p>
<p>I spoke to another rep right after to report the behavior of the supervisor, and "Matt" was an amazing guy. Was very friendly and reminded me of a couple of great options to fix the spam messages I get. I was very appreciative of his approach to the situation.
 At the end of it, he even told me a few good games to check out. How's that for customer service? The guy literally diffused the situation and up-sold me to buy more games.</p>
<p>Again, to reiterate, it's how everything went down that was upsetting.</p>

<p>Thanks Halo. Let me check that for you.</p>
<p>KM: at 11:11:33</p>
<p>Halo which one is your account the one from New Zeland or Austrialia?</p>
<p>halo: at 11:12:07</p>
<p>New Zealand</p>
<p>halo: at 11:12:44</p>
<p>the phone operator in new Zealand said that the reference number wouldn't work</p>
<p>halo: at 11:13:01</p>
<p>and when I told them if I could email the transcript to them they said they don't accept email</p>
<p>KM: at 11:13:58</p>
<p>Okay I have found the case.</p>
<p>KM: at 11:14:11</p>
<p>I see that you are having problems with account migration?</p>
<p>KM: at 11:14:17</p>
<p>Is that correct?</p>
<p>halo: at 11:14:21</p>
<p>yes</p>
<p>KM: at 11:14:59</p>
<p>Upon understanding, You came from New Zeland then you when to Austrialia?</p>
<p>KM: at 11:15:08</p>
<p>Or is it the other way around?</p>
<p>halo: at 11:15:19</p>
<p>?</p>
<p>halo: at 11:15:26</p>
<p>my brother wants to download stuff</p>
<p>halo: at 11:15:31</p>
<p>his in new zealand</p>
<p>KM: at 11:15:39</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>KM: at 11:15:44</p>
<p>Let me check more.</p>
<p>halo: at 11:22:16</p>
<p>are you there?</p>
<p>KM: at 11:23:03</p>
<p>I am still here sorry i am checking thouroughly on your account.</p>
<p>KM: at 11:23:14</p>
<p>Don't worry i won't disconnect the chat.</p>
<p>KM: at 11:23:30</p>
<p>I am checking the update if they hav already fixed your issue.</p>
<p>KM: at 11:23:35</p>
<p>have*</p>
<p>halo: at 11:23:37</p>
<p>ok</p>
<p>KM: at 11:26:11</p>
<p>I just want to verify Halo. Who purchased the content? you or your brother?</p>
<p>halo: at 11:26:27</p>
<p>my brother</p>
<p>KM: at 11:29:24</p>
<p>Okay understood. Just to check for the error message that your brother is getting when trying to download his games?</p>
<p>halo: at 11:29:51</p>
<p>he gets corrupt file error</p>
<p>halo: at 11:30:17</p>
<p>but we were told through a phone operator that that is because the region is Australian and not new zealand</p>
<p>KM: at 11:32:21</p>
<p>That's fine as long as you will be able to see those games to his download history. May we please try to delete the corrupted files? corrupted files actually has an effect whenever we are trying to download.</p>
<p>halo: at 11:33:15</p>
<p>we tried that</p>
<p>halo: at 11:33:20</p>
<p>and we cleared cache</p>
<p>halo: at 11:33:26</p>
<p>it still says corrupted</p>
<p>KM: at 11:34:30</p>
<p>Okay can you please navigate the console to SETTINGS&gt;&gt; SYSTEM&gt; STORAGE&gt;&gt; Harddrive or Memory Unit&gt; Games and Apps then let me know if you will see a corrupted files by having an exclamation mark icon.</p>
<p>KM: at 11:34:51</p>
<p>If there's corrupted files, then please delete it and try to re-download the game.</p>
<p>halo: at 11:36:21</p>
<p>we have tried that 7 times already</p>
<p>halo: at 11:36:26</p>
<p>for fuse and for need for speed</p>
<p>halo: at 11:36:33</p>
<p>everything else downloads correctly</p>
<p>KM: at 11:39:53</p>
<p>Can we try this?</p>
<p>KM: at 11:39:55</p>
<p>We want to do a full powercycle of the console. Let’s turn off the console, disconnect all controllers and cables including the power supply from the power outlet and console. We’ll wait for 1 minute and reconnect everything back again.</p>
<p>KM: at 11:40:11</p>
<p>But instead of one minute. Try two minutes.</p>
<p>halo: at 11:41:41</p>
<p>we have tried that too but we can do that right now again</p>
<p>halo: at 11:41:51</p>
<p>ill let you know when we have finished</p>
<p>KM: at 11:44:31</p>
<p>Alright. If we already done all the troubleshooting steps, Possibly the game serve has the proble.</p>
<p>halo: at 11:44:32</p>
<p>we are done</p>
<p>KM: at 11:44:35</p>
<p>problem.</p>
<p>KM: at 11:44:45</p>
<p>I have tried all my resources.</p>
<p>KM: at 11:44:56</p>
<p>Have you tried to contact the game developer?</p>
<p>halo: at 11:45:00</p>
<p>ok, but I haven spoken to other tech support operators, they told me the region</p>
<p>halo: at 11:45:05</p>
<p>game developer?</p>
<p>halo: at 11:45:14</p>
<p>why game developer?</p>
<p>KM: at 11:45:19</p>
<p>I think it's notthe region.</p>
<p>halo: at 11:45:26</p>
<p>I worked when I downloaded it here in australia</p>
<p>halo: at 11:45:32</p>
<p>it doesn't work for him in new zealand</p>
<p>halo: at 11:45:42</p>
<p>its the region</p>
<p>KM: at 11:45:47</p>
<p>Because there might be a possible problem with the game server that's why you cannot download it properly.</p>
<p>KM: at 11:48:10</p>
<p>Honestly the region doesn't affect the game, because this game is available to all regions like New Zealand.</p>
<p>halo: at 11:49:03</p>
<p>ok but corrupt downloads twice? for fuse and need for speed</p>
<p>halo: at 11:49:07</p>
<p>what can we do about it?</p>
<p>halo: at 11:49:12</p>
<p>refunds?</p>
<p>KM: at 11:50:06</p>
<p>Because if the issue here is region, then you cannot purchase and download it from the first place. As you can see these games were published by EA (Electronic Arts). Also may I know if you are having the same issues on the another games, which is not, right?</p>
<p>KM: at 11:50:56</p>
<p>We have 2 options here by contacting the EA's support for them to explain to you what's wrong with the games or processing a refund as well.</p>
<p>halo: at 11:51:27</p>
<p>ea makes garden ops and that works fine</p>
<p>halo: at 11:51:41</p>
<p>the problem is the xbox live market place sending corrupt data packets</p>
<p>halo: at 11:51:51</p>
<p>I don't think it has a thing to do with the game developers</p>
<p>halo: at 11:51:58</p>
<p>its your service that's bugged</p>
<p>halo: at 11:52:38</p>
<p>I have need for speed on my brothers console here in australia</p>
<p>halo: at 11:52:44</p>
<p>there was not a issue there</p>
<p>halo: at 11:52:53</p>
<p>need for speed worked fine</p>
<p>KM: at 11:52:58</p>
<p>I understand you. However the games that you are trying to purchase is from EA as well. Are you also having problems with other games?</p>
<p>halo: at 11:53:29</p>
<p>i am only have problems with downloading the games in my home country new zealand</p>
<p>KM: at 11:54:13</p>
<p>Like I have said it's the game server.</p>
<p>KM: at 11:54:24</p>
<p>I was just trying to help you Halo.</p>
<p>KM: at 11:54:45</p>
<p>You have done all the troubleshooting steps that we have for your issue.</p>
<p>KM: at 11:55:11</p>
<p>Like I've said, It's the game server.</p>
<p>halo: at 11:55:48</p>
<p>your trying to help me yes, did i say you didn't?</p>
<p>halo: at 11:56:01</p>
<p>i purchased something i cant use</p>
<p>KM: at 11:56:07</p>
<p>It's doesn't mean that everything is okay if other games from EA is working. I am referring to the Game server.</p>
<p>halo: at 11:56:11</p>
<p>i just want a refund if theres a problem with the game servers</p>
<p>KM: at 11:56:24</p>
<p>I know it's frustrating. I'm just explaining myself.</p>
<p>KM: at 11:56:32</p>
<p>I really want you to have the download.</p>
<p>KM: at 11:56:45</p>
<p>If not I won't be here on the chat session.</p>
<p>KM: at 11:56:56</p>
<p>Okay I can process a refund.</p>
<p>KM: at 11:57:01</p>
<p>Give me a few minutes.</p>
<p>KM: at 11:57:24</p>
<p>Everything that I have said here is true. Every chat is recorded.</p>
<p>KM: at 11:57:30</p>
<p>One moment please.</p>
<p>halo: at 12:01:16</p>
<p>I understand, I'm not attacking you its just everytime I speak with operators they give me different information on the problem. This problem has taken 3 days so far to resolve</p>
<p>KM: at 12:02:04</p>
<p>I know that but I assure I'm telling you the right thing.</p>
<p>KM: at 12:03:00</p>
<p>First of all we are not allowed to give false information.</p>
<p>KM: at 12:03:13</p>
<p>I might loose my job.</p>
<p>KM: at 12:03:58</p>
<p>By the way I have refunded Fuse. You can check that on commerce.microsoft.com</p>
<p>halo: at 12:04:31</p>
<p>what am i suppost to do with need for speed? the download doesn't work remember</p>
<p>KM: at 12:05:43</p>
<p>I thought there was no problem with need for speed?</p>
<p>KM: at 12:05:51</p>
<p>You just told me earlier.</p>
<p>KM: at 12:05:58</p>
<p>I have red it again.</p>
<p>KM: at 12:06:01</p>
<p>"09:53:28] halo: I have need for speed on my brothers console here in australia</p>

<p>ANyway let me see what i cna do.</p>
<p>KM: at 12:06:19</p>
<p>Anyway*</p>
<p>KM: at 12:06:34</p>
<p>Please don't shout at me. I'm just helping out my friend.</p>
<p>halo: at 12:07:17</p>
<p>I had to point it out because its taken you at least 1 hour so far to fix a simple problem</p>
<p>halo: at 12:08:07</p>
<p>ill be posting this conversation in forums as well so others can see the problems I go through with admins from xbox just to fix one problem</p>
<p>halo: at 12:08:21</p>
<p>and to your managers</p>
<p>KM: at 12:08:39</p>
<p>Okay here's what I found out on your account. I am seeing it here that there's a lot of refund processed on your account. And our system, is preventing to process another refund on your account.</p>
<p>halo: at 12:08:50</p>
<p>because this is ridiculous, I mean seriously</p>
<p>KM: at 12:09:13</p>
<p>Yes sure go ahead. Please post it to any forums as I believe that we are just doing our job to support you.</p>
<p>halo: at 12:09:43</p>
<p>Well I don't, explain to me please how your system is preventing another refund on this account?</p>
<p>KM: at 12:10:36</p>
<p>If you are having an issue on the games you purchased then I believe that the issue here is the console itself.</p>
<p>halo: at 12:11:11</p>
<p>wrong, my cousin bought his console it worked fine</p>
<p>halo: at 12:11:35</p>
<p>*it didnt</p>
<p>KM: at 12:11:44</p>
<p>There's a lot of refunds on the account, and you are still asking for a refund which on the first place these games were published by EA.</p>
<p>KM: at 12:12:12</p>
<p>I understand that, but there's a lot of refunds on the account and there's no option for us to process another refund.</p>
<p>KM: at 12:12:18</p>
<p>Is there anything else I can assist you with?</p>
<p>halo: at 12:12:30</p>
<p>yeah my refund for need for speed</p>
<p>KM: at 12:12:58</p>
<p>I am afraid that we cannot process that since there's a lot of refunds on the account.</p>
<p>halo: at 12:13:49</p>
<p>no now your just being ridiculous, the person i chatted to earlier told me i would be getting two refunds</p>
<p>halo: at 12:14:17</p>
<p>I want a refund because the download doesn't work. I didn't pay $50 for something I cant have</p>
<p>halo: at 12:14:30</p>
<p>What kind of service is that?</p>
<p>KM: at 12:14:59</p>
<p>Yes that's correct if there's no refunds processed yet on the account however on this case, there's a lot of refunds on the account. We are going in circles and circles here Halo. Is there anything else I can assist you with aside for the another refund
 you are asking for?</p>
<p>KM: at 12:16:06</p>
<p>If not, then I am going to close this chat to support another customers in queue.</p>
<p>halo: at 12:16:09</p>
<p>yes is there a manager or head office email I can complain too in regards to your performance?</p>
<p>halo: at 12:16:35</p>
<p>yeah, i had to wait at least four minutes for each one of your replies, and now you think you can close it whenever you feel like</p>
<p>halo: at 12:17:26</p>
<p>so you cant process the refunds now? then when can you?</p>
<p>halo: at 12:18:24</p>
<p>which day and date can I get my refund for my need for speed that doesn't work??</p>
<p>KM: at 12:19:20</p>
<p>I am afraid that we cannot process it the refund as I mentioned earlier because there's a lot of refunds processed on the account. If you are having an issue on this particular games which is published by another game publisher then it's much better to contact
 them.</p>
<p>halo: at 12:20:01</p>
<p>"theres a lot of refunds" when does this clear up! when can you process the refund for the game download that wont download</p>
<p>halo: at 12:22:02</p>
<p>just like you gave me a refund for fuse, i wanted to same for need for speed because like i keep repeating myself need for speed download doesn't work. So when will my account be ready for you to process another refund, because the game download from xbox
 live marketplace doesn't work</p>
<p>KM: at 12:23:26</p>
<p>I apologize to tell it once again but the refund is not an option on this Halo. You mentioned earlier that you can play other games, right? For the last time. Is there anything else I can help you with aside from this concern?</p>
<p>halo: at 12:23:30</p>
<p>Which date and time will my account be ready for you to process another refund for the game download that doesn't download lol?</p>
<p>halo: at 12:23:50</p>
<p>you haven't answered my question, you keep repeating yourself</p>
<p>KM: at 12:24:05</p>
<p>If that's everything, then thank you for contacting us today. Have a nice day!</p>
<p>halo: at 12:24:07</p>
<p>your trying to end the conversation prematurely, I'm very dissapointed</p>

<p>first off read what the agent said</p>
<p>it does not matter what can download in new Zealand</p>
<p>if your account region does not match your actual region you will have issues with most dlc</p>
<p>if you migrate your account region locked content doesn't transfer over </p>
<p>also note that not all content is region locked</p>
<p>racing games rarely have objectionable content</p>
<p>however halo is censored in many countries due to content that censors object to</p>
<p>hence why it is region liocked</p>
<p>you have to abide by international laws</p>
<p>if you want triple a titles your account region must match your actual region</p>
<p>region locks don't apply to all content you aint going to find much in racing games that are censorable</p>
<p>however due to content laws in a lot of regions especially Australia and new Zealand and Germany
</p>
<p>violent content is region locked </p>
<p>there is no refunds for content transferred between regions</p>

<p>While the information given by the Agent. I still agree that there is some room for improvement in the quality of the support you receive. As for similar recent experiences I had the same type of Agent dealing with my case. I wanted to update my contact
 e-mail associated with my Xbox Account. After half an hour of telling me I have to go to account.live.com aliases to do so, I spent half an hour telling her I don't, and that I believe it's something to do with Xbox.com and that I tried it and it didn't work.
 So I went with her theory even though I knew it was wrong and just wasting time on a chat session I didn't really need to be in. She then asked if I set my new Alias I changed from my account section (the one i wanted to make on my Xbox Contact E-mail) had
 been verified yet. So I said you don't even need to ask that question. She said I do, it's procedure. I said well you cannot have much knowledge on Microsoft Accounts then. She assured me she did. So I said why would I need to verify an account I've already
 verified? You see earlier on I mentioned I set it as the primary with no problems.</p>
<p>And in order for a 'own domain e-mail address' not a 'outlook.com' address to be set to the primary it would have to be verified in order just to do that. In the end I wasted about an hour and a half and she wanted me to be transfered to someone else. I
 said forget it, and left. I then alternatively trying to update my contact e-mail address through the console rather than xbox.com. It showed it was set, testing it out on support.xbox.com/contact-us to make sure my submission shows as the new one I set, and
 it did. So I was right all along, it just didn't work on Xbox.com. And the whole time of her repeating herself thinking she knew best, she actually didn't. I see where you're coming from in regards to your experience with an Xbox Support Agent. I guess it's
 just the luck of the draw. It's like phone support with my ISP but not as much hassle. You cannot phone in tech support happy, and leave happy. I always get stressed i see where you're coming from though!</p>

<p>As far as I know, the only way to find out what age you set it up as, is to call Xbox Support. Although if you're set up with a child account, I don't think you are actually able to change that until you turn 18 (or whatever DOB you entered turns 18)</p>

            Word Pad is a very basic word processor. To get more sophisticated options, you will need to use a full-featured word processor. If you don't want to buy Microsoft Word, then

    <title>Live charges for renewal either very early or very late&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nabby 2010  say:</h3>
<h2>            Live charges for renewal either very early or very late&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>So I decided I was not going to renew my Live Gold this month, and noticed some strange differences between the dates listed on my billing history and when my card shows actual charges being made on my card.</p>
<p>My Live billing history shows I signed up for Gold on Nov 20 and bought points, and those charges show on my card history for those days, then my renewal shows up on my Live billing history on Dec 19, but I don't find a charge again on my card until Jan
 12. Since then, my card has been charged each month on the 12th, while my renewals and billing history on Live always show the 19th. In the early hours this morning, March 12, I was charged a renewal fee, but my account is supposed to last until March 19.
 I went ahead and stopped my auto-renewal, and the March 12 charge is still on my card, but I got an email from MS saying my account will expire on the 20th. I can't figure out if I'm being charged a week early or three weeks late, and why my billing history
 doesn't show the actual dates I was billed. Is this sort of thing common? Also, all of my charges in Live's billing history say "Partial amount : Gold – 1 Month $9.99" ... what's this Partial amount stuff about?</p>

    <title>How do I get rid of ReadyBoost&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> longtime user az  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I get rid of ReadyBoost&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I just switched from XP to Windows 7. I did not install Vista, and boy am I glad that I didn't. And, as you can see from the date of this post, I waited a long time to install Win 7, so that the teething issues common with new releases have been solved.</p>

<p>Microsoft is infamous for&nbsp; 'features' that cause issues for users.&nbsp; I've lost track of the number of these that affected my computer experience since I first got a Microsoft product on my computer in 1982.&nbsp; The one in the title here - ReadyBoost - is one
 such 'feature' that has side effects.&nbsp; I want to get rid of it one way or the other.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I format a SD card for my camera, Win 7 puts ReadyBoost files on it, and takes space I don't want to give it.&nbsp; I know the documentation tells me that I can 'turn off' ReadyBoost for a particular drive/SD card/external memory device, but space appears
 to be allocated for ReadyBoost anyway.&nbsp; A display of the Properties shows a tab for ReadyBoost, indicating something is switched on for that SD card.&nbsp; I re-formatted the card in my camera, and when I put it back into my computer, the drive still showed ReadyBoost
 parameters when I displayed the properties of the SD card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I've checked the information in the Help files and can't find a way to configure ReadyBoost at all.&nbsp; In fact, all that I can find is how to turn it on or off for an eligible drive.&nbsp; So, how do I get rid of ReadyBoost?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows 7 supports Windows ReadyBoost. This feature uses external USB flash drives as a hard disk cache to improve disk read perfor¬mance. Supported external storage types include USB thumb drives, SD cards, and CF cards. Since ReadyBoost will not provide
 a perfor¬mance gain when the primary disk is an SSD, Windows 7 disables ReadyBoost when reading from an SSD drive.<br />

 to uncheck use Readyboost becomes disabled and your usb device is now write-protected.</p>

    <title>Explorer.exe seems to be malfunctioning inexplicably - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Explorer.exe seems to be malfunctioning inexplicably</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,<br />
<br />
So every now and then I'll log back into my computer and my start bar button, task bar expander button (or whatever it's called) and most buttons that are specific to explorer.exe will simply be missing. Close, maximize, and minimize buttons will kind of appear
 but won't work. I'm also unable to bring up task manager. Every time I try it closes immediately. I've tried restarting explorer.exe from the command prompt but that doesn't work. It just comes back the way it was. I've also run sfc /scannow and there are
 no errors. I'm not really sure where to go from here apart from doing a complete reinstall of Windows, which I'd prefer to avoid. The fix is simple enough. I don't have to restart. I just have to sign out of my account and back in. Oddly enough, it doesn't
 effect my wife's log in. One other thing is that dialog boxes don't come up. For example, if I open notepad, jot a quick note down, and then try to save as..., the dialog box to indicate where and what I want to save the document as doesn't come up. Or at
 least, if it does come up I can't see it interact with it. Any ideas?</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Chad</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply. I have performed DISM as well. Clean boot really isn't a great option for me. This typically only happens when I've been logged into my account and been away from it for a day or so, and it seems relatively random. Running in clean
 boot for days is not appealing. I haven't recently installed anything new and this issue has been going on for quite some time. I also use a Surface Pro 3 when I'm out and about. It doesn't suffer from the same problem, but I wonder if the issue that I'm having
 stems from using my SP3 and syncing settings between that and my desktop. I turned theme syncing off to see if that does anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was more hoping for someone to say something like "I have the same issue and here's how I solved it..." or "That sounds like this... Try doing this..." The only reason I haven't done a clean install up to now is because the issue is only mildly irritating
 and logging off and then back on every few days is not a huge deal.</p>

    <title>Unable to run programs on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nickauditore  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to run programs on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Ever since upgrading to Windows 10, I have been unable to run a majority of my programs. However, the problem only occurs on my account. I have an administrator account on this computer and all the programs work there just fine. If I try running things as
 administrator they still do not work, I have to be on the other account. Additionally, many installers have been unable to run as well. It seems like anything that requires an administrator won't work on this profile. Everything else works just fine. I don't
 know if there's any way to fix this other than to use an administrator account from now on, but I would really prefer not to.</p>

<h2>            Brother HL 5140 suddenly not printing showing error &#35;1801</h2>
                    <p>Since upgrading to Windows 10 from WIN7 two months ago its been great. No problem setting up the printer originally and adding it into home network. On Thursday the desktop computer downloaded a large WIN10 update. Suddenly the printer shows an error. I've
 uninstalled and reinstalled. The printer shows up as the default printer. Tried working with MS Support chat but that was was useless, really useless. i know virtually nothing about software &nbsp;fixes expect as an experienced user after for 40+ years on a computer
 I can fumble through and get some things done. But the techs I chatted with were awful. No solution. Tried Brother but missed them before the weekend stated apparently. &nbsp; Anyone with a similar experience after the last update and know a possible fix? Thank
 you.</p>
