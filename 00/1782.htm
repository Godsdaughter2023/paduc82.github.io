<p>I have a new PC. I installed the Palm CD which had Active Sync 4.1.&nbsp; I have my 700w in a cradle, although I have also tried this with must the&nbsp; cable.&nbsp; I upgraded to 4.5 on active sync, nothing helped.&nbsp; I use a USB connection which Active Sync says is "available".&nbsp;
 But, it won't connect. Oh, yes, I disabled the Firewall and that made NO difference.&nbsp; Any suggestions out there?</p>

<p>I think I would consider "rolling back" to a restore point prior to the installation of ActiveSync 4.1 and rather than install from the CD, I would just download the latest ActiveSnc, install and then try to establish a partnership.&nbsp; I can't understand why
 it would not not connect.&nbsp; I have the 700W, and it has paired easily with three different computers.&nbsp; The last time I did it, it recognized that it alrady had two computers to sync with so it asked which one I wanted to delete.&nbsp; I told it which one and then
 it paired easily.&nbsp; So the point of all that is that it does work so we need to get your computer at a point where the install of active sync will work.&nbsp; Rolling back and then installing version 4.5 might work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you looked at the help guides here:</p>

<p>I would also have you look at Chris DeHerras Pocket PC FAQ site.&nbsp; He has a wealth on active sync information there</p>

<p>Reinstalling the Palm software installed active sync 4.1.&nbsp; that does not work either.&nbsp; I have removed the reference to my old PC on the 700w and checked the box "synchronize all PC's using this connection" and the drop down box contains "'USB".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The USB is directly plugged to the computer tower, not through a hub.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The device is not recognized upon attachment.&nbsp; The green light on the cradle goes red almost immediately.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I click on Connect in activesync on teh PC, it checks for connections (pinging as it searches the Com Port and USB) and tells me that it is missing this one file.&nbsp; I dont' know how to find and insert that file.

<h2>            Office Business Essentials with Sharepoint &#40;only 20 sites&#63;&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a question: right now in my company, we have about 150 Exchange Online (Plan 1) licenses, and 60 Office Enterprise E1 Licenses. We use Sharepoint and we have over 40 sites in it (and some have more subsites underneath).</p>
<p>
</p><p>We want to move to an all-standardize Office Business Essentials License, so that everyone owns the same license. The thing is that I read in this article (http://www.strategicsaas.com/office-365-e1-vs-business-essentials-plan-comparison/) that with Business
 Essentials, we will only have 20 websites collections.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My doubt is, it is true? What would happen with my +40 sites that we have right now, if we change the licensing?&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Luis,<br />
<br />
From the official article: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/SharePoint-Online-software-boundaries-and-limits-8f34ff47-b749-408b-abc0-b605e1f6d498?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
SharePoint Online software boundaries and limits</a>, we can see that we can add 500,000 site collections(other than personal sites) in per tenant with Office 365 Business Essentials plan instead of 20 site collections. We can add up to 2000 subsites per site
 collection.&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            onedrive fails to upload multiple files using chrome on Mac, get&#58; &#34;Aw Snap&#33; Something went wrong&#34; every time.</h2>
                    <p>my onedrive app on my mac stopped uploading files some weeks ago (no solution).&nbsp; So now I have to manually upload any new/changed files by hand via the onedrive website.&nbsp; This is fine if you only upload one or two files at a time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I need to upload several directories of photos from my phone and camera.&nbsp; For example, one directory contains 1842 items, mostly jpg and a few moves.&nbsp; All file names are short, and the largest file is 1.5GB, and there are no non ASCII chars in the
 file names.. I have 1 TB onedrive, and have 300GB free.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time i try to upload, it gets to a random number of files (e.g. 453,&nbsp; 775 or 683 and crashes).&nbsp; As onedrive as no "continue" feature, every time it crashes, I have to start again uploading.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i now literally have no way to upload my photos, unless I painfully upload a few at a time, which will take days, and it would be easy to miss some out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the usual precautions of closing chrome completely before I start, and not running anything else in chrome, but this does not help.</p>
<p>

<p>Chrome 69.0.3497.100<br />

            Thanks Eli.&nbsp; Note, the total size of files I am trying to transfer is 7GB. The largest file is 1.5 GB, but most are small.&nbsp; All file names are valid.&nbsp; I gave up with chrome, and tried it in safari.&nbsp; After 3 attempts, I managed to upload the last directory
 of photos.

<p>Hi nutmix,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems you have uploaded these files successfully via Safari browser instead of Chrome. Given this situation, you could use this mothed as a workaround.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still have concerns regarding the issue in Chrome, I would like to confirm the following information to narrow down if it is caused by Chrome itself.</p>
<p>1.If it's convenient for you, please try another Mac with the same account to upload these files in Chrome (The Same Version) to check if the issue still occurs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.You could also upload these files with a different account via Chrome to check if it might be caused by account itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Eli</p>

<h2>            Calendar won&#39;t send share invitation</h2>
                    <p>I am attempting to share my calendar with a coworker. &nbsp;My assistant and I have shared calendars, but for some reason, I am unable to share with this other coworker. &nbsp;Every time I try, I get an error that says, "The sharing invitation couldn't be sent to
 the following recipient: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried with both of this coworker's emails. &nbsp;Originally, it was an email that she had linked to outlook. &nbsp;We thought maybe she had done something wrong in the linking process, so she just went and created a whole new email through outlook.com. &nbsp;I tried
 sharing to the new email, and still get the same error message.</p>

                    I do not want my credit card info left on my account.&nbsp; It is a personal card and this was a business purchase.&nbsp; If I have paid for the subscription, why does my credit card info need to be sitting in this account?

    <title>Which files do I need to rescue to keep Office settings&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tim hj  say:</h3>
<h2>            Which files do I need to rescue to keep Office settings&#63;</h2>
                    I have a laptop running Windows 7, which will not boot (even in Safe mode).&nbsp; I am rescuing critical files and folders (for example, my Outlook data) from the drive prior to a clean reinstallation of Windows and would ideally like to keep my Office settings,
 custom dictionaries etc.<br />
<br />
Which files and folders do I need to rescue from the drive in order to re-install these when I re-install a clean version of Windows?<br />
<br />
All the help threads I have read presume that I will be able to export the settings from within Office, but given that I cannot even use Windows, this option is not available to me.&nbsp; I just need to know the actual files and folders that I need to find and copy
 over to an external hard drive pending the re-installation.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Tim<br />

<span>1) How are you transferring the files from the old hard drive?</span></p>
<p>
<span>2) What other Office applications do you use along with Word/Excel/Outlook/</span></p>
<p><span>Enable hidden files and folders using the link below before looking for the files:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Show-hidden-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Show-hidden-files</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>Copy the custom dictionary file that you want to add it latter to your computer.<br />
Custom dictionaries carry the .dic file name extension. They are generally located in the following folder:
</span></p>
<p><i><span>Boot_Drive</span></i><span>\</span><span> C:\Users\User Name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Proof</span></p>
<p><span>When you copy the file to the computer, put it in the equivalent location. For example, put the file in the following
 location: </span></p>
<p><i><span>Boot_Drive</span></i><span>\</span><span> C:\Users\User Name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Proof</span></p>
<p><span>Unformatted AutoCorrect entries in Microsoft Office programs are stored in an AutoCorrect list (.acl) file. The .acl
 file for the Office programs is located in the profile for the user.<br />
<br />
<b>Note</b> The default location of the .acl file for the Office programs is as follows:</span></p>
<p><span>C:\Documents and Settings\<i>username</i>\Application Data\Microsoft\Office</span></p>
<p><span>Formatted AutoCorrect entries in Word are stored in the default template file for the user. The default template file
 in Word is named Normal.dotm.<br />
<br />
<b>Note</b> The default location of the Normal.dotm file in Word is as follows: </span>
</p>
<p><span>C:\Users\<i>username</i>\Application Data\Microsoft\Templates</span></p>
<p><span>There is no one file to transfer all excel settings to another computer.<br />
<br />
There is a toolbar settings file named .xlb this will transfer toolbar settings.<br />
It is located in a file ending with .xlb, the file is named differently for different excel versions.<br />
<br />
1. Do a search for *.xlb <br />
2. Copy the file to a flash drive <br />
<br />
</span><span>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office14\XLSTART</span></p>
<p><span>C:\Users\User Name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel\XLSTART</span></p>

Thanks for your answer.The trouble is not exactly that the battery does not last,but ,when I put the phone to charge,even if it is in airplane mode,it takes hours to get to 100% full charge....

<p>You can try resetting your phone. Press and hold the <strong>Power</strong> and

<p>Hi Cora,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's been a while since we have provided you with the steps that may resolve the issue with your phone.&nbsp; We hear you and we&nbsp;would love to help you and get this sorted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>May we know if you're using the same charger that came with your device when you purchased it?&nbsp; The issue you're experiencing can be due to either a software or hardware related.&nbsp; Slow charging or battery draining fast may often be caused by software components
 that need to be updated on your phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To eliminate this, we would like you to check if there are any available updates for your phone and if there is, to update your phone.&nbsp; To do this, simply follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Lumia with Windows 10:</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Go to&nbsp;<span>Settings</span>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<span>Update &amp; security&nbsp;</span>&gt;&nbsp;<span>Phone update&nbsp;</span>and tap&nbsp;<span>Check for updates</span>.</li></ul>
<p><strong><em>Lumia with Windows Phone 8:</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Go to&nbsp;<span>Settings</span>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<span>Phone update&nbsp;</span>and tap&nbsp;<span>Check for updates</span>.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Please be reminded to backup your phone prior to running updates.&nbsp; Also ensure you are connected via Wi-Fi and that you have at least 50% battery life left.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If after updating the phone, the issue still persists, we would like you to try a different charger.&nbsp; If a different charger would not change the speed of charging your phone, then it may be a possible battery issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you have already replaced the battery and the issue still persists, you may need to contact
<a href="https://support.b2x.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">B2X</a> for this so they can help and assist you further in troubleshooting your phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you have any further inquiries, please post back to this thread so we could further assist you.</p>

    <title>Word to Excel DDE - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> 30318alan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word to Excel DDE</h2>
                    There are lots of posts relating to DDE problems with Word and Excel. I use DDE because I need the Excel database open for data entry at the same time as the Word document with the mergefields in. The merge works with OLE but doesn't allow Excel to be
 open and if I open it manually, it's locked by the OLE link. I need to enter data into Excel to be displayed in Word which is the front face of an invoice. This setup has worked for me since Office '97 but 365/2013 stubbornly refuses to co-operate, offering
 the 'Something went wrong' box. Help would be appreciated. Alan.

<br />
C:\Users\[User Name]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Word\STARTUP<br />
<br />
If you do not see the AppData folder: - <br />
<br />
In Windows 7, - In Windows Explorer, click on the Organize drop down and then on Folder and search options and in the Folder Options dialog, go to the View tab and select the item "Show hidden files, folders, and drives".&nbsp; While there, it is a good idea to
 uncheck the box of "Hide extensions&nbsp;for known file types".<br />
<br />
In Windows 8 and 8.1, in the File Explorer, click on Options on the View tab of the ribbon and then on the View tab in the dialog that appears and select the item "Show hidden files, folders, and drives".&nbsp; While there, it is a good idea to uncheck the box of

            <p>Thank you very much Doug. I have done as you suggest and I see the additional menu items but it still doesn't really seem to do what I need it to. By opening the Excel file and then performing a mail merge I did once get it to work, being able to put data
 into the spreadsheet and seeing the results in Word. I saved both files and shut them down but on re-opening it wouldn't work again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the few items I have to do these days I am not over-worried. I can use Office 2007 where I know it works well, but my curiosity was aroused as to why this facility had apparently been taken away or modified. I realise that DDE is an obsolescent technology
 but it has worked for me for nearly two decades and its absence leaves me scratching my head.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alan</p>

<h2>            Returning employee recreated -&#62;  &#34;Your account is temporarily locked to prevent unauthorized...&#34;</h2>
                    
<p>An employee who left last year, returned to us now. His user was deleted, and is now recreated. &nbsp;His user on Office365 is synched with our AD. user is not locked, login on our systems work fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When trying to log in on portal.office.com, or trying to activate his Office license on our Citrix, he gets the message:</p>
<p>"Your account is temporarily locked to prevent unauthorized use. Try again later, and if you still have trouble, contact your support person."</p>
<p>I have tried blocking and unblocking in Office365 Admin.</p>
<p>I have compared user info on this user and a working user by giving command suggested in this thread:</p>
<p>https://community.office365.com/en-us/f/148/t/403507</p>
<p><strong>get-msoluser –UserPrincipalName *** Email address is removed for privacy *** |fl</strong></p>
<p>I can see no differences that should matter. The only thing that puzzles me, is that the @&lt;&gt;.onmicrosoft.com address is prefixed with an underscore. It is not the case in the list of Proxyaddresses in our AD.</p>
<p>This is getting very urgent, first it took several days before we got the license activation mail, and now this... Hope you can help quickly!</p>

<p>Hi Gordon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your description, Outlook performs normally if disabling the add-ins, if so, I suggest you disable the add-ins</p>
<ol>
<li><span>In Outlook, click</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">File</span><span>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">Manage Add-ins</span><span>.</span></li><li><span>Under</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">Manage add-ins</span><span>, in the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">Turned on</span><span>&nbsp;column, uncheck the box for the add-in one by one and find the
 affected add-in, then disable it and check the result.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>Moreover, you can also check</span><span> the native add-ins in Outlook by navigating to
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">File &gt; Options &gt; Add-ins </span><span>click</span><span style="font-weight: bold"> Go
</span>and<span> disable them all, then re-enable them one by one and check which add-ins is the cause and disable it and check the outcome.</span></p>

<p>Hi Bryan</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't mean to sound unappreciative to your response, but I am looking for a solution for the issue. Yes disabling the addin allows Outlook to function normally, but the functionality of the addin is lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Others have said the issue lies with the&nbsp;UCAddin.dll.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could do with someone being able to point me in the right direction to get a working dll for the version of Office my user is running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Gordon</p>

<p>Hi Gordon,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your posting back, I definitely understand your concern, if Outlook works well without that add-ins, may I confirm that if it's third add-in? If so, based on our experience, the issue should
 be related to the third add-ins, and we can do nothing about the third add-in. Given this situation, to better help you, we suggest you contact the support of the third add-ins provider and report this issue to them. They should have a dedicated channel to
 check the issue about their add-ins product, you can also share it here if there is any update about the issue,. Your time and understanding will be appreciate. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Hi Gordon,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Greeting, my clarification might not be clear, since the Skype Meeting Add-in for Microsoft Office is the default add-in in outlook like following image, I just suggest you to check if you have add
 other third party add-in that may cause this issue, if so, please try to disable the other third party add-ins and check the result.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9d91927f-dae6-464c-b92b-421b1c2c96b6?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9d91927f-dae6-464c-b92b-421b1c2c96b6?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If it not related to the other third party add-in, to check whether it's related to your Outlook desktop client,<span>&nbsp;
</span>you can also try to <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>I use the Retail License release of Office 2016 so I don't have the Ribbon customizing features with which to confirm, but my somewhat educated guess is that the control cannot be removed. My reasoning: It is not a part of the
<em>Ribbon</em> itself, the QAT, nor to my knowledge is it even a Microsoft device. It has been relayed to me that it's an Apple contrivance which is an integral part of the windowing design. As such it's probably up to a developer as to whether they implement
 it in their software, but the decision can't be reversed at the user level.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I can suggest is that you keep your document window as wide as possible in order to minimize its imposition on the document name. Note that at any time you can see the entire name as well as the path to where it is stored by right-clicking the name.</p>

<h3> major ben  say:</h3>
<h2>            Address Book in Outlook in Office 2013 problems</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I first addressed this problem in August 2013 through help from MS Community and it was solved for awhile.&nbsp; When I went back to the thread, I can't find all the replies so need to start again:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; The first problem is that when posting a new entry and saving and exiting, sometimes it will show up&nbsp; in the list and sometimes, no matter what I do, it will not post in my address book.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; While trying to find a solution on my own, my entire address book has disappeared.&nbsp; All of this&nbsp; happened at about the time of an update Office 13.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp; have a copy of an email from Michael from Australia who was helping me export my address book in NK2 and it has worked but the same steps have not helped this time.&nbsp; I know that&nbsp; my entire address book is in my computer in NK2 as I can see it but it does
 not show up in my address book.&nbsp; I also have a message on my DT to update Outlook but I don't know how.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help will be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Step by step solutions are especially helpful or my nerd level computer experience. &nbsp; Semper Fi Ben</p>

<p>Hi Dan, thanks so much for your comeback.&nbsp; Frankly, I am all over the place on this one.&nbsp; I don't know how to answer you questions and I realize they are important.&nbsp; To get started, yesterday I was able to see my email addresses in NK2 and their were 98
 entries, a reasonable number for current use---not yet today.&nbsp; But, I think I have found where they have been hiding but not yet usable and their are 490 entries which seems to take me back to my beginning use of a computer some 20 years ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the location of this latest email addresses: PC&gt;Windows C&gt;Users&gt; Test&gt;Contacts. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an external drive and I suspect this is where I am looking.&nbsp; I also think that there is a way to get to the same location within my hard drive where the NK2 file is now saved with 98 entires but not sure. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, in past posts on MS Community, some techs state that there is no such thing as a "Test" location.&nbsp; All I can say is that my default save location for some things such as my printer is the one above.&nbsp; For a long, long time, I did not know how to find
 what I had saved after scans, etc on my printer but happened to stumble on it and not change it back to just PC documents where I save.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, that is not the issue I don't think.&nbsp; The issue is within Outlook and I don't have a clue as to what to do next;&nbsp; if you have read my complete post, I lost my address book before and that is when I learned about NK2; I was advised to go to File and
 select export to a contact file in outlook and it solved my problem; this time, I quickly found NK2 file and tried the same option and the list appeared as before but it did not work but gave me the pop up message. "Either there is no default mail client or
 the current mail client cannot fulfill the messaging request.&nbsp; Please run Microsoft Outlook and set it as default mail client."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried but can not figure out how to change my default from *** Email address is removed for privacy *** to Microsoft Outlook.&nbsp; In my email accounts, I have 3 and have not found a way to change from my current default of *** Email address is removed for privacy *** to Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully, the above will give you some idea as to what I am facing and will be looking forward to a reply from you.&nbsp; Semper Fi Ben</p>

<p>Thanks Dan, I went to outlook.com and I couldn't find any contacts; looks like this is a commercial site, if so is this a MS site?&nbsp; I don't understand the difference between my program that I bought and download and the one on line.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the other suggestion and the robot is absolutely a waste of time and trying to get to a person appears to cost money.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am&nbsp; ready for the next suggestion and I feel it is in NK2 but am hopelessly lost.&nbsp; Semper Fi Ben</p>

<p>Hi all, I was just clicking around this morning and in my address book in Outlook 2013 on my DT, under 'contacts (this computer only)' I changed to 'name' and viola, my address book list showed up as before.&nbsp; I am not sure if it is in NK2 yet because I need
 help in saving what I&nbsp; have.&nbsp; On my DT Outlook, I went to File&gt;Open and Export&gt;Import/Export&gt;Export to a file&gt;Outlook Data File&gt;Select Folder to Export from&gt; Outlook Icon is showing at extreme top left with my default Outlook email folder is checked with all
 of my files listed but only Outbox has an arrow in it.&nbsp; Checking 'next' brings up a page with 3 options as to what to actually export and I assume the first choice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Frankly, I am reluctant to use any of the above&nbsp; until I get some expert advice fro MS Community.</p>
<p>First, the word "export" in my&nbsp; past experience can mean that once you export something you do not have is any longer, it is gone to a new designation---seems copy would be more appropriate.&nbsp; 2nd, In the list of files, I do not see 'contacts' or address
 book.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I sure do not want to lose what I had,&nbsp;<strong>when I last check my address book in outlook on my DT.</strong></p>
<p>Dan you have really been great at getting me exploring.&nbsp; I sure appreciate any help I can get.&nbsp; Semper Fi Ben</p>

<p>Hi Hal, thanks for your reply.&nbsp; I have&nbsp; read the two references you mentioned and they are really good reading, probably a must if one is concerned about having a workable address book; I must say that I didn't have a clue about ost files and little about
 pst.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I like everyone else having problems with email addresses want to emphasize that I can now see once again my email addresses in my address book on my DT and it is my&nbsp; priority to be able to save them in case I lose them again.&nbsp; Here is what I know: &nbsp; While
 I can see them and I know the list exists some place, I can't find where they are hiding, whether or not they exist as a saved file in my hard&nbsp; drive or in Outlook on the web.&nbsp; I have searched and searched and I can't locate the place from which I can save
 or find if I need to replace them in my address book on my DT.&nbsp; They are not viewable in NK2, contacts in PC&gt;Windows C&gt;users&gt;contacts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I sure welcome any other comments as I seem to learn something from each one and do appreciate your time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I almost sent the above but did some more clicking around: First, I need to state that I have 3 email accounts with one set as default, normal I guess.&nbsp; From Outlook program on my DT: File&gt;Info&gt;account settings&gt;Email accounts:&nbsp; All three listed separately
 and all are of the type: IMAP/SMTP with the note <em>sent from default account.&nbsp; One is selected as default account with the note: selected account delivers new messages to all accounts.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Below is another note with I find very interesting as it is the first time I remember seeing .ost: " In data file C:\users\test\Microsoft\outlook\default account.ost"</em></p>

<p>Hi, I think I finally found where my address book is located but I don't know what to do next.&nbsp; I need someone's assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found the location from data files in Outlook File and found&nbsp; it by using File Explorer&gt;C&gt;Users&gt;Test&gt;App Data&gt;MS&gt;OL. Opening&nbsp; it up I found the&nbsp; below but my 3 email accounts all had the MS bag icon (Store) indicating I had to download a program; several
 programs were option but I chose the only free one and I forgot the exact name but the picture is shown below on all three accounts; just as I was nearly finished downloading I thought, I got a message from MS Defender stating that a threat had been detected.&nbsp;
 I went to uninstall and deleted this free download I think; it stated that it had been uninstalled and it no longer appears in the list of programs BUT as you can see its image is still shown at the location shown above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should I do at this time.&nbsp; I have my address book with email address but I am afraid to use them before I know I can replace file if I lose it again. There is indications that the file exists in the track I quote above.&nbsp; Please let me have your thoughts.&nbsp;

<p>Hi, while I am awaiting some expert help from my above posts, I am studying what I do have daily and have some more comments and questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; I have had no comments or suggestions as to why my address book list is not showing up in U2k files which I still think is important should I lose my address book again in my DT OL so I want to bring that up again so I won't lose sight of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; From another source, I have recently learned that another avenue to maneuver within the DT OL is by going through 'People.' which I have never done before but after trying it, it may be that I have should have done this some time ago.&nbsp; But trying it
 out, a new entry works well and shows in contacts in People in DT OL but not the address book that I have been using by going in clicking on Address Book at the top of DT OL.&nbsp; And, People contacts is blank except for the one I&nbsp; just entered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Big question for my immediate use is that by going in to my address book at the top of DT OL,&nbsp; I can see and use all of my individuals with email addresses which I can easily send and email.&nbsp; But, while at the present I can go through the process of making
 a new entry, after selecting 'save and close,' the new entry does not show up in the address book.&nbsp; In the past, it has taken spells of acting this way but at times, the new entry would show up which makes me think that I am now again overlooking a step or
 something of that nature.</p>
<p>Comments or thought on any of the above will be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Semper Fi Ben</p>

<h2>            Excel or Word documents fail to open from SharePoint</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;have Office ProPlus/Office 2016 installed on my desktop. When&nbsp;viewing a file in Office Online (hosted in SharePoint/OneDrive)&nbsp;and&nbsp;trying to&nbsp;open the&nbsp;file&nbsp;in the full Office program version (e.g. Excel, Word).&nbsp;I get an error saying that to open the workbook,
 the computer must be running a supported version of Microsoft Excel (Word, PowerPoint .etc). See attached for a screenshot of the error. I've tried open the documents from both Internet Explorer and Google Chrome.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A bit more info:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- This used to work without issue</p>
<p>- I tried running the full Office365 repair</p>
<p>- The file opens in Office Online without issue</p>
<p>- This is happen to more than one users at our company</p>

<h2>            Can I &#34;remove&#34; a single post in a &#34;private conversation&#63;&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Can I "remove" a single post in a "private conversation?"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could (and can) in standard Skype messaging, but in "Private" </p>
<p>
</p><p>1) when I click on a post, the remove option is gone (and oddly for a secure service forward and copy options still are there. But that's another conversation.)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) if I select a post by click on the dot in a thread of the conversation, the remove option is grayed out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe I can delete the whole conversation, or that how I understood it. I just want to delete one post.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone can help me, I'd appreciate it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<div>In Word 2010 all I've succeeded in doing so far after following instructions is</div>
<div>adding a category "new tab" to my ribbon.</div>
<div>How can I add a keyboard shortcut for "accept change" (without moving through document)</div>

            <p>To clarify, do you want to just accept the current change or do you want to accept the current change and advance to the next? You can add a keyboard shortcut for either one:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click on the Ribbon and choose Customize the Ribbon.
</li><li>In the "Customize the Ribbon and keyboard shortcuts" dialog, click on Keyboard shortcuts: Customize (lower left corner).
</li><li>Select the All Commands category.

<h2>            Can&#39;t use routers E-Mail allert through Outlook.com account</h2>
                    The goal is to have my router send me logs via E-Mail. The issue is that the Outlook server doesn't seem to like that.<br />
As of now, I have the fallowing information in the settings :<br />
Outgoing server : smtp.live.com<br />
Send to this address: *************<br />
Server requirers authentication : Checked<br />
User name : *** Email address is removed for privacy ***<br />
Password : ****************<br />
<br />
I have verified that the correct informantion is enterd there by simply using copy and paste with notepad and loging into my E-Mail via the web site.<br />
<br />
However, every time the router tries to send the logs, I get this error : [email failed] ssmtp: Cannot open smtp.live.com:25<br />
<br />
I set everything up and nothing is blocked from the hardware. I disabled all the protection in the router, and the gateway is set up as bridge with the everything disabled. I manually logged in to make sure before I decided to pose here.<br />
In addition, if I add an exception to my firewall for testing purposes, port 25 is open.<br />
<br />
Router is a Netgear WNDR4300.<br />

Thank you for posting here.<br />
<br />
I understand that you are unable to use your router to send you logs via email.<br />
<br />
As I've checked the settings, it is correct. Please contact your router's support team for it may be an issue on your router.<br />
<br />
If you have other questions, please post back.<br />

<h2>            Change default accounts in Outlook 2016</h2>
                    I have several different email accounts that I would like to send from in Outlook 2016. However, if I go to the Account Settings and change the default account like I used to in my older version of Outlook, it still sends from my primary account. The only
 way I can get it to change addresses is to open each email individually and change the address. Am i missing something new? Thanks.
