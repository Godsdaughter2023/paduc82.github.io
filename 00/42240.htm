    <title>Myriad of problems with Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bloodshovel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Myriad of problems with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I'm having several problems with my computer since updating Windows 10. I can't seem to find an appropriate fix for any of these.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Computer is a Dell Inspiron N5110</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Computer doesn't sleep</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Desktop appears to "refresh" or hiccup constantly and the following problems occur:</p>
<p>2a. If I'm typing in a window, it deactivates and I must click back into the window to continue typing.</p>
<p>2b. Open folders and the Start menu will close with these hiccups and I have to reopen them.</p>
<p>2c. Applications on dashboard disappear briefly, then reappear.</p>
<p>2d. Constantly get "How to exit full screen" reminders in Netflix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Computer volume seems much quieter depending upon what I'm doing (have to crank Netflix, for example)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if there is a fix for these issues. The simpler the better, I'm a step above being completely computer illiterate.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>We apologize for the delay&nbsp;for not being able to assist you in a timely manner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to check if the issue persists in a Clean Boot state. <span>
A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows
 7, or Windows Vista. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.</span></p>
<p><span>*
</span><span>Place the computer in a Clean Boot and check if the issue is occurring due to any third party programs.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow the link to view the steps to perform Clean Boot:</span></p>

    <title>Notifications no longer working for Twitter apps for both PC and - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Notifications no longer working for Twitter apps for both PC and Mobile</h2>
                    <p>This has been causing me nothing but unending headaches.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Essentially what has happened is I am no longer able to receive notifications for almost any Twitter app. Tweet It,&nbsp;Fenice, not even the official Twitter app itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Initially I thought this was an issue with just my Lumia 950, but today I decided to try things out an install the apps on my PC and... the exact same issue. Notifications that aren't working or, in the case of twitter, only half working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even for testing it out, I loaded up the Twitter app for Android on my tablet and was able to get Notifications just fine, so instead I'm left here scratching my head as to what the heck has happened with the apps linked to my accounts? Reinstalling them
 didn't help because all it ended up doing was loading the User App Data from the store and bringing me back to the apps like they were right before I uninstalled them in the first place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's worse is I haven't see anyone else reporting this at all and its driving me crazy and contacting Microsoft through their support channels has been of no help at all.</p>
<p><br />
Like just please, could I get someone to at least read what's going on with me and help me at least figure out what is even going on because I've never been so frustrated in my life with any sort of technical issue before as I am now.</p>

</p><p>Since you are having issues with both mobile and PC, we would need to clarify some information to know the next step to offer.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Which Windows version does your Lumia 950 have?</li><li>When you said notification for Twitter in PC, are you referring to the notification on the PC itself or just the notification of the application?</li><li>Same goes with your Lumia phone, are you referring to the notification that would show up in your phone or in the app itself?<br />

<p>We look forward to your reply.</p>

            <ul>
<li>Which Windows version does your Lumia 950 have?</li></ul>
<p>Current version is 1607 build 14965.1001. Fast Ring of the insider build, and none of my other apps have been having issues with notifications.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When you said notification for Twitter in PC, are you referring to the notification on the PC itself or just the notification of the application?</li></ul>
<p>Basically here's what's been happening. In the case of Tweet It and Fenice (the third party twitter apps) they just don't show any notification at all for any reason in my notification center, no toast ever pops up, nothing. With the official Twitter App,
 I'll get notifications when people will "like" a tweet and sometimes if they send a DM, however when it comes to mentions, I'll get almost no notification at all. Very rarely when I do get one though, its seemingly random on who I get it from.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Same goes with your Lumia phone, are you referring to the notification that would show up in your phone or in the app itself?</span></li></ul>
<p><br />
This behavior is mirrored on both my PC and my Phone, which is weird. All of it is made even weirder by the fact that when I linked Twitter up on the Android version of the app, every notification was coming in fine and dandy. And of course, I can't even get
 help from Twitter since they don't even have support to contact beyond "tell us a problem and we might get around to fixing it in a future version".</p>

<p>I am with you. I have had many situations where a toast pop up should come, but doesn't on my Lumia 950XL.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went into settings, because under sounds, if you haven't had a pop up, the app list in manage sounds won't show the app until you get one. Twitter is in my list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went into the app settings inside the manage sound and notifications is on and I even changed the ringtone to ensure I know the sound is the toast, but it won't show.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went into the Twitter app and check the apps settings for notifications, and indeed the toast settings are all on, so I should be getting toast pop ups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently, the only way I know something happened on Twitter is when I am emailed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because I didn't put effort in it, I cannot pin point what caused the issue, but it used to work before November, so I guess an app update or WM10 update may of caused this. However, I also have a Outlook.com migration happening and so that might be causing
 me issues.</p>

            <p>I just checked Twitter on my Laptop, it also has toast pop ups on, but won't get them, but it has never worked coz in the Windows 10 Settings, under Notification &amp; Action section, the app isn't even there for editing sounds and such.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest Microsoft check to make sure nothing is wrong with the Toast service for W10 &amp; WM10 but maybe Twitter Devs will need to check the Apps Code for bugs.</p>

            <p>I'm glad to see I'm not the only one still having an issue, though I'm sorry its affecting you as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, since then Tweet It has been able to work with tweets just fine, however I'm still having issue with the official Twitter app. I have noticed though I do get toast notifications when</p>
<p>
</p><p>-They're DMs</p>
<p>-They're Likes or RTs</p>
<p>-Weirdly, if they're mentions and my @handle is in the middle of the tweet, but not at the beginning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to contact twitter support, but their website even states that they don't directly respond to technical issues, so I may as well be shouting into the void. I was hoping Microsoft might be able to help or at least get some leverage cause honestly,
 it feels like twitter doesn't give a hoot about Windows users unless Microsoft themselves bring up the problem directly.</p>

<h2>            Upgrade to Win 10 - no network adaptor detected.</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to WIN 10 from Win 7 Professional. &nbsp;Everything looks fine but in the upgrade it did not pick up the network adaptor on my PC. ie no internet connection. &nbsp;Looked at Device manager the network adaptor did not show up in the Device manager. &nbsp;The
 update said that it cannot located a network adaptor. &nbsp;I revert back to Win 7 and updated the network adaptor driver then upgrade to Win 10 again. the same thing happen.</p>
<p>Called Microsoft Case # 2134644503. &nbsp;They told me to call back once I have update to Win 10. &nbsp;What your call centre do not understand is that once I have update it Win IO have no internet access at all. &nbsp;That is my problem. &nbsp;Plus the number she give me to
 call is not a valid number. &nbsp;+61 901161.</p>
<p>Once I am on Win 10 I have no internet, so let me know what I should do, because I cannot access Microsoft via the net once upgraded!</p>

            <p>Hello Eric,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We realize the inconvenience you have experienced.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>What is the make and model of your computer?</li><li>Are you referring Wired or Wireless connection?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>From the description, I suspect that the problem lies with the incompatible network drivers. If Windows can’t find a new driver for your network adapter, visit the PC manufacturer’s website and download the latest network adapter driver from there. If your
 PC can't connect to the Internet, you'll need to download a driver on a different PC and save it to a USB flash drive, so you can install the driver on your PC. You’ll need to know the PC manufacturer and model name or number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggest you to check and install the latest Windows 10 Network drivers for your device from manufacturer website.&nbsp; Most probably this will fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't find the latest drivers for your device, then try to install the legacy (I.e. Windows 7 or Windows 8.1) drivers to see if it fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep posted if you require further assistance, we're happy to help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi Eric,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to clarify, you have successfully upgraded to Windows 10, is that right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, I suggest you to try uninstalling the network adapter driver and restart the computer and have Windows automatically install the driver upon restart.</p>
<p>1. Press Windows key + X and select device manager.</p>
<p>2. Expand network adapter.</p>
<p>3. Right click on the driver and uninstall it.</p>
<p>4. Restart the computer and check the functionality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the result. </p>

            <p>Thank your for your replay.&nbsp; Just checked my Email today.&nbsp; My situation has changed since I first posted my question.&nbsp; Before receiving this replay I did run Microsoft Fix It.&nbsp; It fixed some problems in my registry in the framework.&nbsp; I can now open my Turbo
 Tax programs and print Microsoft documents from the web.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I attempted to download and install Microsoft .NET Framework&nbsp;1.1 and received the following error: C:|DOCUME'''1\snow\LOCALS""1\Temp\XP000.TMP\netfx.msi" cannot be found.. Verify that you have access to this location and try again, or try to find the installation
 package 'netfx.msi' in a folder from which you can install&nbsp; the product Microsoft .NET Framework l.l.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also tried to run the Microsoft Fix It tool after this and got this error:&nbsp; Microsoft Automated Troubleshooting Services BootStrapp has encountered a problem and needs to close.&nbsp; We are sorry for the inconvenience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will not attempt anything further until I hear back from you so as not to complicate things further.&nbsp; I only use this computer for my taxes and word processing.&nbsp; Again thank you so much for you help.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10&#59; Printer Offline</h2>
                    I am using Windows 10.&nbsp; My HP 7525 is connected wirelessly to my computer.&nbsp; I was able to print until two days ago.&nbsp; I was getting a message that my printer was "offline".&nbsp;&nbsp; My printer diagnostics showed there was no problem and that I was still connected.&nbsp;
 The control panel showed that the printer was the default printer, but when I right clicked on the printer&nbsp;the data showed that it was offline.&nbsp; When I went to the&nbsp;"see what's printing"&nbsp;&nbsp;page and clicked on the printer&nbsp;command it showed that &nbsp;the "use the
 printer offline" was grayed out.&nbsp; What can I do to get the printer online again.

    <title>Xbox 360 slim Keeps Freezing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> codxcoconut  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox 360 slim Keeps Freezing</h2>
                    
<p>A couple days ago I started up my xbox 360 slim normally(bought it in fall of 2011) and decided to play Thief for the first time. &nbsp;When I started it up my xbox crashed and I had to restart it, only to have it freeze when I got to
 the dashboard. &nbsp;I restarted my console more times then I could count and it would keep freezing, sometimes not even reaching the dashboard. &nbsp;Every once in a while it would tell me that there were corrupt files and that I needed to get a system update to fix
 it, but as soon as it was finished my xbox would just freeze again. If I left it off and unplugged long enough then I could mess with the settings for a minute or two, but that was it.</p>
<p>So far after looking at other people's advice I tried it without my 250gb hard drive and it worked but if I used any other storage devices even if they were configured and formatted the console would still just freeze. I've cleared
 the cache on my hard drive and even moved game saves over to the cloud then formatted it. &nbsp;After that the console was a little bit less laggy and I could go about 5 minutes without it freezing, but it still didn't fix the issue. &nbsp;Because of this I assume it's
 the xbox itself that's the problem but nothing is near it and nothing is covering the fan, and I even rubbed it with a dry cloth to get rid of the dust, but it still won't work.</p>
<p>I've realized that I'll probably have to get my console repaired(off warranty) or buy a new one but before I do that I wanted to ask other people so if anyone could help that would be fantastic so thank you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Alright, try to unplug all your devices, any HDD, USB drives, Kinect, etc. Boot up with that, put a game in and play it for a while. If nothing happens, then it's your accessories causing the issue. If it's freezing with nothing attached to it, then it needs
 to be sent in for repair. If it isn't, re-add each of your devices and figure out which one is causing the freezing. Disconnect your console from the internet as well, as sometimes the Xbox's software pauses when waiting for a response from Xbox Live, and
 if it doesn't get one, it just waits forever.</p>

            Hi,
<br />
<br />Completely remove everything of Nvidia driver using DDU and install the newest copy of the driver available.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-driver-uninstaller-download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-dri...</a>
<br />
<br />You can head to either the card manufacturer or device manufacturer to get the newest driver.
<br />Let us know if you require any assistance.

<p>Ok i think i might know why the Bsod occur.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ive run MemTestx86 (or whatever its called) for 2.5 hours and it said it didnt find any errors however...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chckdsk told me multiple times it found "defect hardware" and altough it never said which piece of hardware its gotta be my HDD, SSD or RAM right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ive tested to run my Setup without my HDD = it still failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then i tried to reinstall it and it crashed during the installation (it wasnt installing or anything i was selecting the language) process. My thougt is that at the point of the crash Windows had nothing to do with my SSD nor my HDD (right?) so if im right
 its gotta be one of the two ramsticks.</p>

<h2>            old webcam doesn&#39;t work on windows 7</h2>
                    i have an old webcam (genius express videocam) and it used to work on xp but now i have windows 7 and it doesn't work on it. i lost the cd but i still have the cd key so i tried downloading the driver of this webcam but it doesn't work. I also tried running
 it in compatibility mode and it still doesn't work. Do I have to buy a new webcam or is there a way to fix this ?

            <span>Hi braft,<br />
<br />
1. What is the model number of the Webcam?<br />
2. What happens when you try to install the drivers?<br />
3. From where are you trying to download the drivers?<br />
<br />
<b><u>Method 1<br />
</u></b>I would suggest you to select the model number download and install the drivers.<br />
<a href="http://www.geniusnet.com/wSite/sp?xdUrl=/wSite/productDownload/download.jsp&amp;ctNode=85&amp;mp=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.geniusnet.com/wSite/sp?xdUrl=/wSite/productDownload/download.jsp&amp;ctNode=85&amp;mp=1</a><br />

<br />
<b><u>Method 2</u></b><br />
I would suggest you to try the steps from the following link:<br />

<br />
If the above steps fail, then I would suggest you to contact Webcam manufacturer.<br />

<h2>            Activate Windows problem on an upgraded Windows 10 copy</h2>
                    Hi. I've been using my copy of Windows 10 that was upgraded from Windows 7 for free when it was still available. Today I started getting "activate windows" watermark after a series of updates(that I've been slacking to proceed with) from Windows on the
 right bottom side of my screen. When I try to troubleshoot, it states that the digital key I own is for Windows 10 Home edition and the version I'm running is Pro so I need to reinstall Windows 10 Home or buy a key for Pro version. What gives?&nbsp;

<p>Which edition of Windows 7 were you running prior to upgrading? </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you were running Windows 7 Home Basic or Home Premium, then you really should be running Windows 10 Home.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Windows 7 came preinstalled on my computer, </strong><strong>how do I find the product key?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The&nbsp;product key is usually located on the COA sticker attached to the bottom of your laptop or in the battery compartment. In some rare cases it can also be found in the memory compartment. For tower systems, look at the top or the side of the system unit.&nbsp;It
 looks like the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=0f490afc-06fb-47e1-92e9-647fed014b3c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/df77f698-5aad-42e6-88e1-3ba5f531ab6a" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the Certificate of Authenticity (COA) sticker is damaged or letters or not legible, you will have to consider the following options:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Use a digital camera to capture a picture of the COA then enlarge it on your computer.
</li></ul>
<span>
<ul>
<li>If the COA sticker is damaged, then you would need to use the recovery partition to reinstall Windows 7, this will exempt the need to use the product key to activate your Windows 7 installation.</li></ul>

contact the manufacturer </a>of your computer and request a recovery disc set you can use to reinstall Windows 7. They might charge a small shipping and handling fee. This will exempt the need to use the product key also.</li></ul>
</span>

<li>If none of the above options work or is not available, then its best you purchase a new Windows 10 license:

            The problem I have is rather technical I think because one activation page it has a yellow message that says "We are unable to activate Windows on this device because we cannot connect to your organization's activation server." Something like this, translated
 from TR.

            So you're telling me that I need to reinstall my Windows to get rid of that notification on my screen? While upgrading I didn't choose anything like "Install the pro version", the updater did everything on its own. Is this some kind of trick to get people
 to eventually buy Windows after its initial free promotional give-away?

            I don't think we're on the same page. My Windows prior to upgrading wasn't activated, I was using Linux before the Windows 10 promo so I downloaded a legit copy from Microsoft then proceeded with the upgrade. Which means I never had a key to begin with.
 The OS was working fine until couple days ago. Then this nonsense popped up and all of a sudden my digital key is for Home version, who knew?

</p><p>DistributedCOM error 10016 is an event in Event Viewer that usually occurs when

<p>It is possible that there is an issue with the drivers of your computer and that can be the reason why your computer is crashing. Kindly boot your computer to
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">safe mode with networking</a></strong> for us to verify if you will encounter the issue. Please take note that you may not
 be able to play games while in safe mode. Since you mentioned that the crashing issue is also happening when many Google Chrome tabs are opened, we suggest that you visit multiple websites in different tabs in Google Chrome in order for us to see if the issue
 will occur.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted.</p>

<p>I appear to have fixed a regular freezing (5 secs) with screen flicking problem on my machine after sorting out a 100016 error that related to RuntimeBroker. I've spent lots of time reinstalling the latest clean version of windows 10 and ensured all drivers
 are working correctly and got nowhere. I'll been running diagnostics and nothing found. Updating component services permissions at computer level allowing my username full rights is the only thing so far that appears to be working. 48hrs since and no freezing
 so far (no other updates have occurred). The dcom errors are a bit of mess in win10.1, lots of people are having issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note you can investigate the 100016 error by searching in regedit with the CLSID code, if it's the 'Runtimebroker' it maybe the issue I've had for a while now.</p>

<p>I'm having the exact same issue. Only difference is, that it make CS:GO freeze (and only fix is a restart of the computer).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
And yes, it's the runtimebroker. Just did a clean install today, updated all drivers to newest stable release, and the problem still occurs. And at this very moment, the only thing that's installed besides Windows 10 Pro is Office 360, Steam and CS:GO. Always
 nice to make a reinstall ten days after buying a new pc.<br />
</p>
<p>Furthermore, while searching for answers in the 10016 error it's quite obvious it's a known issue. While I'm not a fan of fiddling with the component service tool or regedit for that matter, it's a wonder why the issues is not handled by MS earlier. A quick
 search reveals the specific topic dating back to 2015.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 changes primary display to HDTV - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alistair and angela rattray  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 changes primary display to HDTV</h2>
                    <p>Recently upgraded from Win 8.1 Pro(N) to Windows 10 .</p>
<p>
</p><p>We use a wireless Digitech HDMI sender to put to duplicate the PC display on Pana HDTV in other room .</p>
<p>Since the upgrade, &nbsp;Windows changes primary display to the TV whenever it is connected hence the PC screen becomes monitor 2 . This is causing outlook some grief eg when new email is generated outlook uses the TV .</p>
<p>
</p><p>The sender is sometimes not switched on so the PC display can be display 1 or display 2 , &nbsp;if the sender is switched on
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Drivers are all up to date . The video card is an ASUS G210 .&nbsp; All worked fine before the upgrade. Windows plugNplay is being too clever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PC monitor has been set to the primary both before and after the TV is connected but the setting does not stick .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alistair</p>

    <title>Microsoft Wireless Speed Wheel for Xbox One&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> skinnycyclist  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Wireless Speed Wheel for Xbox One&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Although I prefer to play my racing games with a proper wheel - like the Logitech G25 (which of course only works on the PS3...) - I think that the Microsoft Wireless Speed Wheel for Xbox 360 is an excellent product - easy to set up and use, and certainly
 a lot better than driving with a gamepad, which I hate...</p>
<p>I have had a lot of fun in Forza 4 and Forza Horizon using this wheel, now I'm having some difficulties enjoying Forza 5 and Forza Horizon 2 equally much because of that pesky little gamepad. And because of the location of the console - the living room -
 a more stationary wheel with pedals and stuff, is not an option.</p>
<p>Anyone know if Microsoft have any plans for a Wireless Speed Wheel for the Xbox One?</p>

            Hi Saud.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />The error normally means that someone has activated Windows with a Volume License Key meant only for business or organizations that activate a large number of PC's, which need to check in with the organization's server regularly to reactivate.
<br />
<br />Sometimes this is done by shops reinstalling Windows, unnecessarily because the PC either came with a Windows Product Key embedded in the BIOS/UEFI firmware, or it was already activated for free Upgrade and would have reactivated after a reinstall had they given it the chance and not interrupted this by installing the illegal key.
<br />
<br />If you know Windows was originally activated legitimately by one of these methods then to fix the problem what I would do is go offline to remove the Volume License key and then restore the Generic Product Key that is used to activate with the Digital License issued by Upgrade or Factory install. Then we'll see if it activates:
<br />
<br />1) Go offline by opening Action center at the right end of Task Bar, then clicking on Airplane mode to turn off internet.
<br />
<br />2) Next type CMD in Start Search, right click to Run as Administrator, then right click to copy and paste this command in and press Enter: slmgr -upk
<br />
<br />3) Restart PC and then insert Generic Product Key for WIndows 10 Pro from here: <a href="http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-</a>...
<br />
<br />This sets everything back to default so that if there is a Digital License issued during a proper Upgrade it should reactivate within a few days. If not we will need to try something else:
<br />
<br />What Windows Operating System came on that exact model PC originally - you can google it's make and model to read the specs to find out? If it says Windows 7, 8 or 8.1 Home version then that is a clue you need to reinstall Home instead of Pro to try to activate. We might even be able to still activate it fresh with a Windows 8/8.1 Product Key read from the BIOS or on the Windows 7 COA sticker on the PC, or any of those retail keys.
<br />
<br />If nothing else works you may need to reinstall the licensed Windows edition that came with that PC, or buy a copy of retail Windows 10 to reinstall (if necessary) and activate it. I would buy only from a major retailer who backs their sales or Microsoft here: <a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US</a>...
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

A: I updated to Windows 10 almost a year after they first started offering the free upgrade. Probably almost two years ago from today.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It sounds like you&nbsp;upgraded from Win8(.1) to Win10 at some point after 29 July 2015 (i.e., early-to-mid-August 2015).</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>Q: Did you upgrade manually or was the upgrade offered <em>

A: I guess it was through Windows Updates. I recall downloading a tool and it automated the install process.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it sounds like you chose to upgrade manually using the Win10 Update (read: Upgrade) Assistant.&nbsp;It was too long ago for us to know for sure&nbsp;and your Update History wouldn't even give us a clue as to how or when you upgraded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That being said, the fact that <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023057/windows-10-version-1507-1511-1607-update-reliability-kb4023057" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Update [for] Win10 1507, 1511, &amp; 1607 for update reliability - includes files and resources that address issues that affect the update processes">KB4023057</a></strong>
 was offered &amp; successfully installed on 24 August 2017 tells us (or at least, tells me) that the update servers have recognized the problems you've been encountering since late October 2016. As such, Windows Update is offering possible fixes (i.e., "reliability/performance
 updates") in hopes that one of them will make things right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No one can know when -&nbsp;or if - that'll happen - but since the computer's missing so many security-related updates, I'd very strongly recommend giving
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10startfresh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">the specific&nbsp;"Fresh Start" option I cited in my previous reply</a> a try. If it works, you'll end up with Windows 10 Version 1703, OS Build 15063.540 or higher.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't make things right, I'd recommend a literal clean install of Win10, not a Repair Install (AKA In-place upgrade; AKA Fresh Start), not a Refresh or a Reset. See
<a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/1950-windows-10-clean-install.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/1950-windows-10-clean-install.html</a> </p>
<p>
</p><p>A literal clean install will wipe out your current settings as well as your personal data and any/all applications that you've installed since you installed Windows 8 (not Windows 10). As such, you may want to backup your personal data beforehand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's all I got. Good luck!</p>

    <title>Forza 5 get drivatar out of my single player game - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Forza 5 get drivatar out of my single player game</h2>
                    
<p>I know the Xbox One was designed to be a more social machine and the multiplayer experience is ever so popular. But I for one still enjoy playing solo, and I as a private gamer should be able to do so. The new drivatar system is a very cool aspect, and im
 sure it is very popular among drivers who like the extra challenge of racing "bots" of actual human drivers. But for a gamer, who is just a casual driver and rarely would be caught dead in the multiplayer lobbies, is absolutely frustrating.&nbsp;I loves the Forza
 series for the fun and experience of&nbsp;racing expensive cars, not being owned on the track by "bots" invading my single player game. I will be the first to say that I am a horrible driver, but should that disqualify me from playing Forza? If Forza&nbsp;5 was advertised
 as a multiplayer game only, I would never have purchased it, but it wasn't. Yes I know&nbsp;drivatar has difficulty settings, set it on the easiest setting and watch all my "friend" bot cars own me on the track, set it higher and watch strangers and my friends
 make a fool of me, not fun! I&nbsp;am contemplating removing some friends to be competitive and it should not come to this. All I am&nbsp;saying is, If I choose to play single player, I should be able to. Multiplayer should be kept in the appropriate area of the game
 or at the very least have the ability to turn drivatar off. Forza 5 is the main reason I bought the Xbox One on day one, by day 2 all the joy of this game was gone.</p>

            <p>It still is single-player, and on the easiest setting it tones down your friends' abilities just like it would the AI otherwise.</p>
<p>The Drivatars on this difficulty setting are probably no more difficult than the AI, except that they behave in more believable manners - fighting a little harder, for example, for places and overtaking opportunities.</p>
<p>If you remove friends it still fills the slots with random Gamertags, so that might not actually help at all.</p>

<p>From what I read online, that isn't true. It would make sense if it were true and would make it easier to play for the casual racer. However it appears that the drivatar difficulty settings only take effect for the randomly inserted drivatars from the cloud.
 People on your friends list will still enter into your games with the drivatars completely as-is, even if they are much better at the game than you are.</p>
<p>I'm a casual racer myself and I've always loved Forza as a game I can just pick up and play for half an hour and have fun playing it. They've now ruined that aspect of it for me. I've got some friends who are pretty hot on racing games, so even if I turn
 the drivatar difficulty settings right down to the easiest level, I'm still engaged in a constant battle with my friends drivatars who are unaffected by the difficulty settings, to the point where it's no longer stress free fun, and to the extent where my
 car and my friends drivatars cars are ahead of the pack with the rest of the random easy drivatars at least half a lap behind.</p>
<p>If they don't fix this aspect of the game and allow you to either block your friends drivatars, or make the difficulty settings apply across the board, then I'll be selling my copy of Forza and it will likely be the last Forza I ever buy. Such a shame.</p>

<p>I think this is a very valid point - I spend hours in the paint both to make my friends look good on the track &amp; then when I need to race to get more credit no matter how much I tone things down, I'm still fighting for every credit battling against crazy
 unmanageable digital representations of my friends, who spend 99% of their time driving.
</p>
<p>Two things are missing here in the drivatar model:</p>
<p>1. The race settings should apply to all competitors including your friends as mentioned above.</p>
<p>2. The AI model hasn't taken into account your friends don't slam into you, dive into every corner &amp; make it stick with unimaginable physics ?? They don't bash into you because they are your friends.
</p>
<p>The first of foremost rule of any motorsport racing sim should be for a clean race. The real life car counterparts costs hundreds of thousands in some cases over a million dollars. Do you think anyone is ever going to be allowed on a track if they in a real
 race just randomly slam into everything. Clean lines, respect for the man &amp; machine, life &amp; limb should be characterised by our digital counter parts. Simulation is supposed to be as close to the real thing as they can make it right. Safety are the order of
 the day in any pro racing drivers tool box. Also I forgot to mention that my car ends up looking like it should sent to the scrap heap now at end of every race.
</p>
<p>There are no codes of conduct in a multiplayer game, which is why most serious drivers form clubs &amp; only race people who will stick to the above mention codes of conduct. The AI in sega's Daytona had the ability to run side by side in a group &amp; not take
 you out, why twenty years later are we at this point, with " the most successful racing franchise in recent times" can't we at least expect the same if not better.</p>
<p>I'm heading to the same point as the the guy above, I'm considering removing long time friends simply because there avatars are ruining my racing experience.</p>
<p>Turn 10 please help, you're making me hate my friends!!!!</p>

            <p>Hi Lam,</p>
<p>If your issue is with Forza 5, please make a new thread - split-screen racing is definitely a feature, I've used it. I'm not as sure about Forza 6 but thought it was there too. In either case, make a new thread instead of bumping this 2.5-year old one.</p>
<p>If this is a feature you're requesting, you would be best off submitting it to <a href="http://feedback.xbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://feedback.xbox.com/</a> or going to Turn 10's forums to let them know directly.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
NO it is not safe. No registry cleaner fixes bluescreens, that is a tip off, its like RegCure, all hype. My bluescreen<br />
troubleshooter is below for reference if you are having that issue. Post the error codes using the Nirsoft utility<br />
below and we can help solve the bluescreens.<br />
<br />
Put that one in place of RegCure and you have the same animal.<br />
<br />
I would ditch RegCure like a hot potato <br />

Seems those sites which promote these poor products are all part of the scam. They include a couple<br />
or legitmate products (if any) and then rate all of their products higher and they are often virtually the<br />
same.<br />
<br />
Unless you know how to recover from an errant deletion and that can be extremely difficult its best not to
<br />
use a registry cleaner. And they "fix" very little and "BREAK" a lot<br />
<br />
Run RegCure uninstaller&nbsp;C:\Program Files\RegCure\uninst.exe<br />
<br />

<br />
Or Use Revo to Uninstall it :<br />
<br />
If RegCure is running use TaskManager to close (end Process) - Right Click on Taskbar - Task Manager<br />

<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
