<h2>            Desktop very slow after being afk</h2>
                    <p>I don't know if this happens to someone else but when going afk for about 30 minutes and comeback for the PC , the desktop gets very slow almost impossible to use and also when open something like Steam, steam gets invisible for a while and when writing
 something on steam it does not update like if i wasn't writting anything.</p>
<p>Already tried to Restart explorer.exe and still the same, the only way i found was Restarting the PC.</p>
<p>Is there any way to fix this permanently?</p>

<p>Hi Engellic,<br />
</p>
<br />
<br />
There’s a possibility that the issue is with the compatibility of the programs or application on your computer. To better assist you, please clarify the following:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1. Does the same issue happen when you use a different user profile?<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2. Are you experiencing the same issue when you access your computer into safe mode? &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3. Does the same issue occur on other apps of your computer? &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Regards.&nbsp;

<p>32-bit software cannot be made to run in some kind of '64-bit mode.'</p>
<p>
</p><p>32-bit software runs very well on 64-bit hardware. 64-bit software doesn't run 'better' than 32-bit software.&nbsp; Running 32-bit software on a 64-bit computer does not cause lag or freezing. For example, I have 32-bit Microsoft Office and it runs very well
 on my 64-bit computer.</p>

    <title>How do I delete old &#34;Boot&#34; folder from old hard drive&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> skywalker993  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I delete old &#34;Boot&#34; folder from old hard drive&#63; It&#39;s screwing up my new hard drive&#39;s startup sequence.</h2>
                    
<p>Short version: I need to delete the "Boot" folder from my old hard drive because it's preventing my new hard drive from working properly.&nbsp;I've changed the hard drive boot order with BIOS, taken ownership of the folder, changed privileges, booted&nbsp;in&nbsp;Safe
 Mode,&nbsp;downloaded third-party kill programs... everything Google and I&nbsp;can think of, but it still says "Access is denied." How do I delete&nbsp;this&nbsp;folder? It's not even in use but it's preventing the new hard drive from working.</p>
<p>Longer version: Here's what's going on. I have an 1TB WD hard drive and I installed Windows 7 64-bit Pro and it worked perfectly for months. Then I got a new 300GB&nbsp;Velociraptor hard drive and installed Windows 7 64-bit Pro on it. My intent was to use the
 raptor as my OS and the 1TB as storage. I deleted all my old settings and stuff from the old hard drive but the folder named "Boot" was not deletable, no matter what I did (taken ownership, changed privileges, booted in Safe Mode, downloaded third-party kill
 programs).&nbsp;Then I went into BIOS and changed the boot order of hard drives; it worked perfectly... until last night when it crashed in a game and wouldn't restart.&nbsp;I know it's not a problem with the new hard drive because my computer starts up like a charm
 if I take out the old one. Therefore, I'm pretty sure it's the "Boot" stuff that I can't get rid of. I currently have the old hard drive hooked up to a docking chip and connected it to my PC via USB, that way I can access my 800GB of music, pics, vids, and
 so on. HELP ME FLUSH THIS SUCKER!!! It's taken up hours of my life and given me tons of frustration.</p>

<br />
"Installing a 64-bit version of Windows Vista on a computer that is running Windows XP Professional x64 Windows XP Professional x64 users can purchase an upgrade license for the 64-bit version of Windows Vista. However, they must perform a clean installation

    <title>&#34;Documents&#34; folder multiplying in navigation pane - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kinghawk  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Documents&#34; folder multiplying in navigation pane</h2>
                    <p>I have a problem where the Documents folder which you find under %username%/Documents by default multiplies in the navigation pane. The situation is that I moved the Documents folder to D:/OneDrive/Documents, so the folder is directly under OneDrive. At
 some point I noticed that the Documents folder showed up multiple times in the navigation pane and they kept coming one by one.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Searching on the web for this problem resulted in nothing but later I noticed that the folders start multiplying at the exact same time as when OneDrive starts Syncing or Checking files in this folder.&nbsp;</span>What is weird is when
 I test this with the Pictures folder (which should be in the exact same situation)&nbsp;nothing happens so I wonder why it only happens to the Documents folder.<br />
-</p>
<p>Below in the example you can see the multiple "Documents" folders and they vanish when you reopen the window:<br />
Video showing the problem&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/zlPWJrujE1w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://youtu.be/zlPWJrujE1w</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/zlPWJrujE1w?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/zlPWJrujE1w?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div></p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bc6b244d-50ab-4b24-a6bf-2839974de3bf" /></p>
<p>The number of "Documents" folders has been over 20 before, this just depends on how long you leave the window open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And the properties of this folder:<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5e6bbdac-c157-410e-86d2-171878a21ff0" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried to relocate the folder outside of OneDrive to put it back in later but this didn't help much, only when it synced all files I noticed that the folder didn't multiply but later when 80% was done syncing it started appearing again. Might it be caused
 by something in the Documents folder?<br />
In the Event Viewer nothing related to OneDrive shows up so nothing to find there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope someone has a idea on what might be causing this, thanks!</p>

<p>
</p><p>When I restart the computer and reset-up OneDrive it takes OneDrive a long time to check all files and during this time the problem doesn't occur. But once it finished the first full rebuild and started checking again the problem immediatly appeared so it
 returned sad enough.</p>

<p>At first it didn't bother me so much but once you start working in a folder and keep saving and testing a file it can get quite annoying, escpecially with 30 "Documents" folders in the navigation pane.</p>

 file explorer/this pc and reopening it clears it up. BTW I'm using a local account.</p>
<p>

            <p>Happened again today. Google drive was not indexing or syncing. &nbsp;From the post above it appears that this is not related to cloud storage after all. Also I'm seeing the same removable device (memory card) twice.</p>

            Glad I moved it here since it seems not to be related to sycning software. I hope we'll get a fix for this because it's quite annoying and weird as it only happens to the Documents folder.

    <title>USB Ports not working after Windows 10 update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> karenr8199  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB Ports not working after Windows 10 update</h2>
                    <p>Hello --</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am experiencing issues with my USB ports not reading anything. Not a printer, nor my keyboard/mouse(wireless), my thumb drive, my external hard drive, etc. They are showing in the device manager but they are not working. When I plug something into the
 USB port, it shows up under "other" as an "unknown device".</p>
<p>
</p><p>My biggest issue is that I am unable to use my wireless keyboard and mouse. I was able to use it after upgrading to Windows 10 for more than a year, until about 2 or 3 months ago when the latest update came out for Windows 10. I have had several updates
 since then, but to no avail. I really hope that Microsoft puts out a hotfix for this issue, because I know I am not the only one out there that is frustrated with an older computer and having this same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the steps I have taken to attempt to clear up this issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Update drivers for the keyboard mouse. </p>
<p>2) Manually download drivers for keyboard mouse combo.</p>
<p>3) Uninstalled, reinstalled the mouse keyboard</p>
<p>4) Attempted to use the USB for another purpose: my external hard drive - does not work. The EHD is only a year old.</p>
<p>5) Cleaned my registry keys (there were multiple non used registry keys that needed to be cleaned up). I used a software clean up tool.</p>
<p>6) Manually downloaded USB device drivers from my manufacturer (nope didn't work)</p>
<p>7) Used the "hardward device troubleshooter" - that didn't work either. It just said I had a problem and wouldn't fix it.</p>
<p>8) Used "Update device" in "Device manager" for every single instance of my devices. ALL OF THEM. None of this worked.</p>
<p>9) Googled this and got the same Microsoft responses as above, and followed the KB articles. NONE OF THAT WORKED EITHER.</p>
<p>10) Made sure I am on the latest update of Windows 10. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Look, I'm going to be straight with you. I am a software developer manager. I used to work QA.&nbsp;I'm not dumb on this. This is a fault of Microsoft discontinuing the support of&nbsp;older model devices in their Windows 10 update. However, the issue is, the original
 download of Windows 10 included all of this. I have had W10 for over a year, and their update messed it up.
</p>

            <p>Hello --</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately this did not work. The updates would not uninstall. It gave me an error and told me to reinstall all of windows if I wanted to step back my updates. That is not an option for me as it would take days to get this fixed. I can tell you which
 update caused the error as I know when it started. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I still think that Microsoft needs to provide a hotfix. </p>

<p>
</p><p>the history does not go back to October's update, but this is the last cumulative update that was applied to my system in December:</p>
<p>Cumulative Update for Windows 10 for x64-based Systems (KB3205383)</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was the same type of update in October that slightly corrupted my system, caused errors for many days until the new update came out. I believe that update was October 15th ish. After that update, the USB ports did not work. Before that update, the ports
 worked fine. I have USB 1.0. </p>

            Hi Karen,<br />
<br />
Regarding your concern, we recommend that you download and use the <strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Media Creation tool</a></strong> to reinstall Windows 10 on your computer.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you need further assistance.

            <p>I'm sorry to be blatantly rude, but you didn't read that installing windows again is not a possibility. I am unable to backup my computer due to the USB ports not working! Like what part of that led you to telling me to reinstall windows?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Look, to add insult to injury, I found out through trial and error that the USB ports are no longer being read at all by the computer. They have been renamed to a USB 3.0 name in the last upgrade. They upgrade no longer powers the USB ports.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is exact issue is being reported across this exact forum, and should be entered as a defect in the operating system, not as an uninstallation fixing the issue, because doing so would render my computer unable to upgrade past the October/November release.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>So the good news is, now the computer is properly powering the USB ports, but after plugging in my USB hard drive the computer doesn't read it. Also, I tried the USB mouse, and it doesn't detect it either (I have used this exact mouse on this computer before).&nbsp;</p>
<p>I scanned for updates, and it said I had a windows defender update. &nbsp;I installed and rebooted the computer with no improvement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You got one step closer. &nbsp;Keep trying. &nbsp;</p>

            We recommend that you connect your USB mouse and USB Hard drive to your computer while it's turned off, then run your computer in Safe mode. In this way, the BIOS will perform hardware initialization during the booting process.<br />

<h2>            Files moved to a sub-folder appear in duplicate back in the main folder</h2>
                    <p>I have been using OneDrive for a couple of years for our practice. It has been trouble free up until the start of 2017. The drive is used for documents that are divided into pieces for faxing. The filing system is at the start of a new year move the original
 documents to a sub folder named "Archives" and delete the "pieces" of the original that were used to fax.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The oddity is OneDirve is duplicating the earlier action and recreating the original documents with their pieces that had been deleted.</p>
<p>The action of moving the documents are not reversed but recreated.</p>
<p>When I attempt to move the original (clone) back to the archive sub folder I am presented with a pop up that asks if I want to replace / merge / override etc.. as the document is in fact already in the sub folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The OneDrive folder has 3 main folders with 5 sub folders each.</p>
<p>2 people have full rights to all folders</p>
<p>2 people have rights to 1 individual folder and the sub folders within.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the help. Unfortunately this thread has to do with duplicates getting renamed to allow both files to exist in the same location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My issue is the original file is recreated back in the original place AFTER moving to a sub folder within itself.</p>

            <p>Are you looking at a folder or at the Documents Library as opposed to the Documents folder? If it's the Library, Libraries shows the content of all sub folders at the top level. That's what makes it different to a folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you try to move the file, it is already in the folder, hence the error message.</p>

<h2>            Command and Conquer not displaying properly.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title:</p>
<p>RED ALERT 2 </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been scouring the internet for a solution to this problem, but ultimately I've found none, so I now look to you of Microsoft support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the game set Command and Conquer, the First Decade. I'm well aware that EA launched this pack back in the golden days of XP, so it's technically not supported by Windows 7 or 8, but I'm not going to give up as I've had them working before. My computer
 is a Dell Inspiron 7010 i5 with Windows 7 X64.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To begin, I am past the installation process. By running the installer as an administrator for Windows XP SP3, they installed without a problem from the disk. The older C&amp;C games (up to RA-1) run without a problem. Generals had an issue when launching it,
 but I found a patch that fixed that. Red Alert 2 is different though- it loads up and runs fine, but it's missing pieces of the menu- it won't display certain video components to me. I would provide a screenshot, but all of my screen capture software is able
 to somehow "see" what I cannot, and displays the videos and buttons as they should. Now, I know the menu layout, so I can get into the game itself and it plays fine for the most part- with just a few missing elements that again show up to my screen capture
 software, but not on my monitor. This is a common bug for this game, and seems to only plague the newer 7 and 8 computers. My brother has this game on his older HP laptop running Windows 7 X32, and he was able to fix this by altering a few .ini settings. I
 tried this myself to no avail, and after tinkering with the compatibility some more, have yet to come up with the answer to this problem. It's clear that the game runs fine on Windows 7, but it just isn't displaying properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said, I welcome any assistance from the Microsoft community! Thank you in advance!<br />

            <p>Wow, that was fast.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Okay, so while perusing a dead thread on Tom's Hardware, I found a link to some YouTube video. It's long and kinda hard to follow, so I'll spare you all the trouble. The issue with the buttons is in the display, and for some bizarre reason Windows 7 (and
 8 I'm hoping, will find out shortly) needs this weird second monitor added to make it work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go into "Screen resolution", and hit "detect"- when that pops open, set up a new monitor in the #2 (or whatever slot is next) using whatever the default graphics card is for your machine. Mine is a laptop, so I had one choice- I doubt it would make much
 difference which graphics card you choose, but this guy recommends grabbing the "default" one. Once you've done that, tell the new display to go through VGA anyway, and save it. Once it's ready, select your "new" display, and select "Extend display" under
 settings. The screen will freak out for a second, then ask you to save the changes- do that, and you're golden.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The thing about this fix that has me upset is that it's both easy and totally bizarre. I have no idea why this fixes it. I have no idea why it does what it does. It just works though- for both Red Alert 2 and Yuri's Revenge. I hope this will help someone
 else not go through the trouble I just went through!</p>
<p>
</p><p>For those of you looking for a step by step, check this guys' video out. Be forewarned, it's lengthy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=hojMNk93PoU</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck!</p>

<h2>            Help&#33;  Locked Out of Computer</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I purchased a new laptop for my mother for Xmas.&nbsp; It's an HP15 f722wm laptop with Windows 10 on it.&nbsp; She is locked out of her user&nbsp;profile; there has been some sort of mix up with the password and she cannot obtain access to do anything on the computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
 computer did not come with a reset disk or any sort of system restore disk.&nbsp; My first thought was to perhaps delete the profile and just start all over since she's only had it for 2 days but I don't see a way to do this.&nbsp; Is there any way to reset her password
 or&nbsp;perhaps create another profile or access the computer via Administrator to fix this issue?&nbsp; She doesn't have a Microsoft account yet as the computer is still new and I haven't had a chance to sit down with her and walk her through doing all of her registrations.&nbsp;
 As of right now there is no way for us to get past the login screen, I'm completely stumped.&nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks in advance for your help.</p>

            Hi Ken.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Have you tried Repairing Office at Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features &gt; Microsoft Office &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Modify &gt; Repair.  This solves a lot of problems caused by Updates and Version Updates.
<br />
<br />If that fails you can reinstall Office from a fresh install from here:  <a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/download-back-up-restore-microsoft-office-products" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://products.office.com/en-us/download-back...</a>
<br />
<br />You also have ten days if there are too many problems to Go back to Old Version in Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Recovery, then hide the Version Update using the Hide Updates tool until it has more time to mature:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            A. Try repairing your Office installation. First try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general) 
<br />
<br />How to repair instructions -
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair...</a> 
<br />
<br />Note for Office 2013 and below - Please repair only if you have product key with you as sometimes it asks for the product key again after the repair.
<br />
<br />B. If repair doesn't solve the issue, an uninstall and reinstall would be the next course of action.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Download-and-install-or-reinstall-Office-365-or-Office-2016-on-a-PC-or-Mac-4414eaaf-0478-48be-9c42-23adc4716658" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />C. If repair / reinstall don't solve this, let Excel development team know about this in case this is a bug.  You should report this to Microsoft so that Microsoft developers should look into this. There are 2 ways to give this feedback -
<br />
<br />1. Open Excel &gt; File &gt; Feedback &gt; I have a suggestion
<br />
<br />2. Through Uservoice - Click the following link to see the feedback of others and to provide feedback - <a href="https://excel.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://excel.uservoice.com/</a>

            You mean, will AutoCAD 2005 run on your PC if you upgrade to Windows 7. Not necessarily, Windows 7 is based on the same foundation as Windows Vista, so there are likely to be continued issues in Windows 7. Have you attempted Compatibility Mode? Right click
 AutoCAD 2005 executable, click Properties &gt; Compatibility (tab), check the Run this in Compatibility for box, click in the list box and try one of the appropriate versions of Windows the product is known to work in.

            I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If the laptop is within a year old, you should contact HP to have it serviced or replaced under the included warranty.  Do this before the warranty expires so that everything is correct while they still must correct it.  
<br />
<br />If not then try cleaning out the fan as best you can following this guide:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2021499/how-to-clean-your-laptops-cooling-fans.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/2021499/how-to-...</a>.  If after it';s clear of dust it still makes noise it may need to be replaced.  There are disassembly and cleaning video guides for that model on Google but it is quite involved which is also while it will cost a lot.  
<br />
<br />If you can relieve the fan noise but still have high usage that you think are from Windows then go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.
<br />
<br />With low CPU use but normal high RAM use this may mean you need to increase the RAM, e.g. actually need 6-8 gb on a 4gb PC.  To determine this for certain run Crucial System Scanner which will tell you what's available for your PC and offers competitive prices on good quality RAM.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Unable to access Auction House and Clubs on Forza Horizon 4.</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I've been playing Forza Horizon 4 for a month or more now, and I am level 40. I had noticed from when I first started playing that Clubs and the Auction House are inaccessible, and grayed out. I assumed that they could be unlocked as a house perk, etc.
 However, the issue has continued. Also, to clarify, I exclusively play the game while connected to internet, and have used it in different locations on different internet connections. I don't think it is an issue of restarting the computer, as in the month+
 I have played it I have definitely restarted my computer on numerous occasions. What do I do?</p>

<h3> elkhorn mountain man  say:</h3>
<h2>            Screen keeps darkening down on me</h2>
                    I have a Samsung series 9 ultrabook with windows 8. I do not have the power saver on and have it set for brightest setting. Today I have been unable to keep the screen well lit. When it first comes on it is nice and bright. In less than a minute it will
 dim down and then a little later dim down even darker. During the restart wind down it will all of a sudden brighten up just before shutting down. On restart it is bright once again but only for about a minute. Any ideas out there what might be going on? I
 does not seem to matter if it is plugged in or not.

<h3> abslom rob  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 4 network speed is slower then all other devices on my network</h2>
                    <p>I just purchased a Surface Pro 4, and was having horrible network speed (speedtest.net reported between 5 and 10 MBps, with huge spikes and lags, which made streaming video nearly unwatchable).&nbsp; After researching, I decided to upgrade my WIFI to 5G, so I
 bought a DLink DIR-819.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THis <em>did</em> help; I'm now get 17Mps download as measured by both SpeedTest.net and Microsoft's "Network Speed Test" app.&nbsp; However, my laptop and smart phone both get 80+MBps, so while the increase in speed and stability is
 nice, I'm still only getting 1/4 of the network speed that I ought to.&nbsp; This is difficult to accept on a device that cost as much as this does.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any settings I should be looking at that might help here?</p>

<p>that router is probably one of the worst choices IMO (there have been numerous reports of performance issues with Surface devices with the Marvell wifi). I know it is inexpensive.<br />
If it were me, I'd return it (as it appears to be new) and buy something better.<br />
I personally have and use a Netgear R7000 (latest firmware) and it works<br />
perfectly with all my computers and devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume you have the latest firmware and different SSID names for the 2.4 and 5GHz channels.</p>

<p>This is honestly one of the worst answers to a problem that I've ever seen.&nbsp; So much so that I stopped what I was looking for just to sign in and make this reply.&nbsp; Whether the OP's router is a good choice or not, the surface should be getting at least close
 to the same speed that the other devices are getting.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I came here to the forum for help with my own WiFi issues with the 30 surfaces that we bought for our facility to iron out the bugs before we buy another 150 to 200 devices in the next 12 months.&nbsp; It looks like the Zebra ET50 has better support than "buy
 new routers" because I can assure you we're not replacing all of our Motorola enterprise grade access points with R7000s.&nbsp;

<p>Ah yes.&nbsp; Lets see.&nbsp; I have three laptops, a Nuk device, two gaming desktops, a browsing desktop, two smart phones, an android tablet, two gameboys, a PS4, and a NAS device.&nbsp; All of which are able to connect to this router and access the internet at reasonable
 speeds.&nbsp; And then I have one device, my Microsoft Surface Pro 4, which doesn't.&nbsp; I've been in tech support long enough to be able to connect the dots...</p>
<p>
</p><p>IN addition to that, I've tested the Surface on other people's WIFI, as well as against my smartphone in tether mode.&nbsp; IN all cases, the throughput on the Surface seems to cap at around 17Mpbs.&nbsp; That number is consistent enough that I think it's safe to
 assume that there is some issue with the Surface, and NOT with the literally every other device that exists in my geography.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only real question at this point is if the problem is an actual defect in my particular Surface, or if there's something else.&nbsp; But I think I'll be father ahead to return it to the store to see what they say.&nbsp;

            <p>Because there have been numerous reports of performance issues with Surface<br />devices with the Marvell wifi and this specific router, and because<br />Microsoft/Marvell is not doing compatibility work quickly (if at all), I made<br />the suggestion to try a different router. <br />The issue IS MOST LIKELY on the Surface Marvell driver side. There are a few<br />specific routers that exhibit this poor performance, even thought every other<br />device the customer owns has blazingly fast speed by comparison. <br />As for your case, in an Enterprise IT situation, you CAN get support by opening<br />an IT Support case (not the Answer Desk for consumers). <br />Suggesting that a customer replace a $45 router they just purchased and can<br />return for a refund is a but different than a multi thousand dollar Enterprise<br />wifi network. <br />And note that Microsoft officially does not support Enterprise Surface issues in<br />this forum and will tell you to call business support.

            <p>you should definitely do that if you have completely updated your SP4 and are<br />running the latest version of Windows 10. do you have separate SSID names for<br />2.4 and 5GHz? If not change one of the names. then test speeds on both. <br />(one more thought, have you tried reloading the driver? go to device manager and<br />uninstall, but do not delete the marvell wifi network driver, then restart -<br />this will reload the driver).</p><p>if you are in the US and near a physical retail Microsoft Store, no matter where<br />you purchase your SP4, you can go there and they will test.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>But I think I'll be father ahead to return it to the store to see what they say.&nbsp;</p></blockquote></blockquote>

            <p>it sounds like you have an issue with the lack of "the roaming aggressiveness<br />setting" that other Enteprise customers have complained about. We've seen this<br />before, and all we can do is ask customers to open an IT Support Case. I don't<br />know how bad your speeds are so can't speak to that. <br />can you clarify if you are using a customized Enteprise image or just the stock<br />retail load? and what version of Windows (run winver) is on these devices?</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>I just need it to switch access points sooner, before the signal is so bad the users start turning the surface off and back on to fix it</p></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>I did a reset of the software, and that seems to have somewhat resolved the problem.&nbsp; I say "Somewhat" because oddly enough, when I launch the Network Speed Test, the first test always shows that same 17Mbps download speed.&nbsp; But if I do the test a second
 time, it now gets up to the 80 or 90Mbps that I'm expecting.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Out of curiosity, I installed "Speedtest by Ookla".&nbsp; By the end of that test, it was up to 75Mpbs, but I noticed that the first four or five seconds of the test, it seemed to sputter at around
 1-2Mpbs.&nbsp; Not sure if that's relevant, but it's certainly interesting.&nbsp; Some form of auto-negotiation perhaps?</p>
<p>
</p><p>At any rate, I'm in the process of re-installing all the programs and apps that I had on before (and testing between each install) to see if something causes it to break.&nbsp; I did notice that the initial Windows 10 welcome screens were different this time
 (I assume because of the windows creator update?), so likely there was some legacy setting in my old install that got wiped out by the reset.&nbsp; That's my hope, anyway.&nbsp; Would be nice if someone figured out what it was, 'cause a complete wipe of the device isn't
 exactly the most user-friendly "Solution".&nbsp; Fortunately, I'm experienced enough to know better then to keep anything important on a windows device...backups of backups solve many problems.</p>

            <p>Many Vista programs&nbsp;will install and&nbsp;work without problem in Windows 7. If you find difficulties you may try compatibility mode:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows</a>&nbsp;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also check the programs compatibility at the program publishers website or here:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, 64-Bit specific&nbsp;programs will not work on 32-Bit Windows (irrespective of whether it is Windows Vista or Windows 7, etc.). Most, but not all, 32-Bit programs will work in Windows 64-Bit. For more info. please see:</p>
