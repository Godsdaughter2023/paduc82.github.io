    <title>Column break creates page break - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marianngreenlee  say:</h3>
<h2>            Column break creates page break</h2>
                    I am pretty familiar with this feature, but every once in a while when I hit column break it creates a new page.&nbsp; The page set up is set for continuous.&nbsp; Nothing in any of the drop down menus is set to create a new page, so why do I get a page break when
 I want a column break?!!! Beyond annoying, especially when I cannot fix it.

            <p>Suzanne's suggestion is probably more likely, especially if the document is in fact in Word 97–2003 (*.doc) format.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if the continuous section only barely fits on a single page, then the paragraph mark following the section break may add a page, simply because there isn't enough space for the paragraph mark below the section break. In such a case, you can format
 the "extra" paragraph mark as hidden text (and/or set its Line Spacing to "Exactly" 1 point, make sure that Spacing Before/After is zero and that the font size is 1 point).</p>

    <title>Lumia 930 pee damage - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vixenite  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 930 pee damage</h2>
                    
<p>Hey everyone,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wonder if anyone can give me some advice. I have a 5 month old Nokia Lumia 930 which my darling 1 year old managed to pee on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I dried it up with a towel initially and at first all seemed fine and it was responding, then after about a minute-2 it suddenly changed screens as if I pressed and held the back button, wouldn't respond for about 15 seconds then turned itself off. Since
 then it hasn't turned back on. This happened Friday.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have all together:</p>
<p>1) put it on a radiator over night (we did this with a lumia 610 after it was submurged in Jack Daniels &amp; Coke and another time after it was submerged in coffee and it still works sweet as a nut about 2/3 years later)</p>
<p>2) Put it in rice for 33 hours</p>
<p>3) volume down and power button for upto 30 seconds (repeated times since Friday I've tried this)</p>
<p>4) tried to charge it incase it was just low battery</p>
<p>5) tried Nokia Software updater for retail</p>
<p>6) tried Windows Phone Recovery tool (neither programmes could find it)</p>
<p>7) my moron other half blew a hairdryer through the sim card tray. Only about a minute though before I realised and stopped him and he claims it was low heat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I spoke to my insurance company said 2 things:</p>
<p>a) not covered under accidental damage and they don't cover water damage in anyway</p>
<p>b) if I send it to Nokia they will never insure me on the phone if it is repaired as Nokia is not on their list of approved repairers.</p>
<p>c) If I send it to Nokia and they repair it they'll cancel the insurance and charge me the remainder of the year's premiums (around £200)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I spoke to my friend who works as a receptionist in the local Nokia repair centre who spoke to her boss and said I could take the back off without affecting the warrenty as long as I didn't touch anything else and see if it all looks in order. I did this
 and there were still some droplets of wet just under the case. dried these with a q-tip and still no success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm really stuck, not sure what else to do here. Any suggestions?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First off, the back cover is not removable in any official way on the 930.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, if you left the phone to dry out it will probably have severe corrosion damage as pee is not exactly clean water It's not unlikely the battery is damaged and may have damaged other parts as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right now I'd say get the battery out if you can and rinse the phone thouroughly in clean and purified water, leave it submerged for an hours or so. I know that sounds strange but trust me, if it does not help it certainly won't hurt at this point. Then
 put the phone is a bowl of dry rice for 24 hours. This will pull the moisture out of the phone. The try if it comes on, if it does you got very lucky, if not I'm pretty sure the phone is a dead.</p>

<h3> rseiler  say:</h3>
<h2>            OfficeBackgroundTaskHandlerRegistration flashes a window every hour</h2>
                    <p>Is there a really, really good reason that the "OfficeBackgroundTaskHandlerRegistration" task (see it in Task Scheduler, Microsoft, Office) must run every hour? &nbsp;This is what it says that it does: "This task initiates Office Background Task Handler, which
 updates relevant Office data."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ask, because it runs&nbsp;officebackgroundtaskhandler.exe in such a way that it <em>
flashes a window</em> (itself) on the screen. Only instantaneously to be sure, but it's noticeable, especially once you catch onto what's happening. You can run the task manually if you want to see it without waiting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why doesn't the task use one of the many tricks to hide a window from displaying?</p>

hi Daniel</p>
<p>it happens in all Word documents. </p>
<p>When I started in Safe mode, I didn't even get the "Welcome Back" bubble. I tried with several documents but none of them would produce the "Welcome Back". I did try Shift+F5 to be sure there was indeed a spot that could be moved to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only add-in I had&nbsp;&nbsp;enabled was the Adobe Acrobat PDF add-in. I tried disabling it, but still no difference after restarting Word.</p>

<br />
is there a shortcut key to get this message to reappear? Lately i'm finding the message is appearing very briefly when I open a Word 2013 document but before I can react to it, the message is gone. I know Shift+F5 will get me there, but if I have inadvertently
 clicked anywhere that is gone too.

            <p>Hi Daniel</p>
<p>thanks, but no luck. I tried all the steps. After deleting the Word Data registry subkey the notification came back for a split second when I reopened my Word document. But not long enough to click on and it wouldn't repeat it next time I opened Word.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second step - Deleting the Word Options registry key did not exist in the registry for Office 2013.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I didn't have any entries in the Startup folder add-ins.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>so, back to the drawing board. </p>

<br />
Thank you for replying.<br />

Did you renaming the global template as mentioned in the KB article and check? <br />

If yes, let's repair the Office suite and verify the result. Check the following article for instructions on how to repair the Office suite:<br />

            <p>Yes Daniel, I did try renaming the global template as well. I also just did another Office repair.
</p>
<p>The first time I open the Word document I get the notification to resume at my last spot but it flashes so fast that I don't have time to click on it. If I close the document and reopen I don't get it at all. However, if I press Shift+F5 it does take me
 to a spot in the middle of the document so I know it does remember where I left off.</p>

                    Cheaper phones supports USB OTG but windows phone doesn't. Microsoft is brand they have to include it. Even Chinese phones have this option. They must have to do something for it.

            &nbsp;The answer to why doesn't WP have something is usually pretty simple. MS or the OEMs chose not to include it. Like most things that WP doesn't have, that other budget or flagship phones do, at some point in time meetings were held at Microsoft to determine
 the requirements for both software and the hardware platform. Long lists were drawn up, and somewhere on that list a line was drawn. Above the line things would be included and required; below the line, only if there is money and time. Yes, money and time
 are a concern even for MS. Everything you add, has to be developed, tested, supported, updated... and&nbsp;added into the final selling price. Hardware is done as a specification to partners that actually build phones. Remember, until MS bought Nokia's phone business,
 they did not build phones. OTG&nbsp;requires both hardware and software, and making it a basic hardware requirement, adds cost to the manufacturing. Yes cheap phones to have it, but also have cheap processors, displays, l

<p>Hi SumitGhate </p>
<p>
</p><p>No they don't and here is why IMO.</p>
<p>
</p><p>USB-OTG</p>
<p>You ALSO need to purchase another cable, <em><strong>the Female to micro USB cable&nbsp; in order to connect your USB to the phone.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>1.The likelyhoood that there is a FILE only on your USB stick, that has NOT been sent via email and you have NO access to it in order to forward it is remote. [create something and ONLY save it on the USB stick]</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">The phone also has to provide "power</span>" [not as much as usb charging]. USB OTG is a drain on the battery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.There maybe somewhere some professional who needs his phone to act as a PC, but in that case it would be unlikely they did not also have a laptop, [any attachment on an email you could just forward the email NOW using your phone]</p>

    <title>Reinstalling Office 2010 &#34;product key is not valid&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pjs15  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reinstalling Office 2010 &#34;product key is not valid&#34;</h2>
                    <p>My trusty laptop died suddenly. When I tried to install Office Professional 2010, I got this message when I tried to activate it: using the 25 character code that came with the application. It's the same one application and the same serial number I had used
 for the now-dead laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this occurring because Microsoft thinks I am trying to install the application on two computers?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, how do I deactivate the dead one. I have gone to account.microsoft.com but could not find an option to deactivate the device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I also need to add my new device? Is there a way to do that without using Microsoft account to sign into my new computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            I take it this is a replacement PC? In which case it will undoubtedly have a trial version of Office present, or the links to that trial. This will interfere with the validation of an earlier version because of shared resources relating to Office. Assuming
 your copy of Office 2010 is a transferrable copy (Office 2010 was also produced in versions valid only on the original PC as a lower cost option) you should be able to install it provided you first uninstall any later version or trial that is present.<br />

                    I have installed Office 2019 Professional Plus purchased by my university on my personal computer. It's very great however I have never got the new icons. I think these new icons are very amazing and great. My friend's Office 2019 Home &amp; Students has already
 got the new icons and they looks very nice. I have check the update but it told me that I have already got the newest version of Office 2019. I'm a Windows 10 1903 user and my Office version is 1808 (16.0.10344.20008) . I hope to know how to get new icons
 for my Office 2019 Professional Plus. Thank you!&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Thank you for your reply. But I think you may misunderstand my question. I'm talking about the new icon design (Fluent Design) released this year by Microsoft for Office 2019 and Office 365. These new icons are different from those for Office 2013 &amp; 2016.
 I want to get these icons for my Office 2019 Pro Plus, however I cannot get them. I have seen that Office 2019 Home &amp; Students has got these new icons. So I want to know when and how can I get these new icons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you can see, the OneNote for Windows 10 has got a new icon, but Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook 2019 haven't got new icons yet.&nbsp;<br />

<p>MS is doing a "controlled" roll out of this update. There is nothing you can do to force it (or prevent it). You will get it eventually, when MS feels like giving it to you.&nbsp; They even did the rollout in stages. First 4 icons, then a couple more and still
 a few more waiting ... </p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try doing a manual update of Office, but I don't expect it to help:&nbsp; </p>
<p>File menu &gt; Account command &gt; Update Options button &gt; Update Now command.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to make you feel worse, MS decided to give it to my Office 2016 Pro Plus, even though I didn't expect it, and REALLY don't want it. &lt;g&gt;.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry there is no fix, you just have to wait for it to come to you. </p>

            I had the same issue on a Mac. I updated the all the MSoffice software to the latest version and had all the new features, but the old icons. However, I was able to get the new icons after I activated the account from the desktop application in outlook
 even though I was already signed in and using MSoffice.

            I just checked and found out that Volume-licensed Office 2019 (since you say it was installed by your University) is still on old build of 1808, that's the reason you haven't got the new icons.

            Go to settings - Internet connections - and delete saved wifi connections.<br />
<br />
Then again reconnect.<br />
Remember to enter the "Wep key/Pin number" correctly.

<h2>            Outlook&#58;  How to transfer folders w&#47;emails from one outlook account to another outlook account</h2>
                    <div>I have 2 outlook accounts--one for business and one for me personally, each with their own folders to categorize the emails. &nbsp;Now that account linking is gone, it's a real pain.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Anyone know how to transfer all of my folders w/emails to my "main account" (personal account). &nbsp;I am now forced to have a main (personal) account that forwards my formerly linked account (business account). &nbsp;Trouble is, when I do that, I no longer have
 my folders and historical emails from the business account.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
Why account linking in Outlook was discontinued is a mystery to me. &nbsp;It makes things much harder now. &nbsp;I'm seriously looking into switching to gmail because with that you can at least have both accounts open at the same time. &nbsp;Any help at all is appreciated.
 &nbsp;There must be some way to transfer contacts, folders and emails from one account to another.<br />

<h2>            Outlook.com&#58; Creating New Alias Says Already Associated With Account But Doesn&#39;t Show in Outlook</h2>
                    I've created several aliases successfully and they show in Outlook 2007, but there is one that I'm trying to create that when trying to do so says, "This email address is already associated with you account", but doesn't show like the others do in Outlook.
 Any ideas?

            It shows in neither. Actually, it is not an alias, but the new name for my old MSN account.
<div><br />
<div>Btw, how many aliases are allowed in addition to the main account name?</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So that account name was already taken, if that's the case, you cannot add that account name as an alias&nbsp;of your account.
</p>
<div>
<p>You can create up to five new aliases per year, for an overall maximum of 15. Deleting an alias removes it from the overall count, but not the yearly limit.</p>
<p>For more information about aliases, please refer to this link :

            Not already taken. When I first created &nbsp;it, it was &nbsp;accepted, it just never showed up. I've tried to create other aliases that were already taken and there was a message that said so. They were different. With this one, if said "name already associated

            Is it possible to use one of my aliases as my main account address and use the one that is now the main as an alias? I use Outlook.com in Outlook and it sends from the main account from there and there is no way to change it to send from an alias instead.

<h2>            How to start Microsoft Edge from command line&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So I need to be able to find and launch Microsoft Edge on a Windows 10 platform with a local self-hosted javascript page via a powershell script or an automated test application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried calling the application with </p>
<p>
</p><p>"explorer 'C:\Windows\SystemApps\spartan_#######\spartan.exe'"</p>
<p>"%SystemRoot%\LaunchWinApp.exe 'C:\Windows\SystemApps\spartan_######\spartan.exe"</p>
<p>I have even tried providing a url after each call.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only calling the explorer.exe will do anything (open itself up), but it does not open up the browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help, references, or pointers would be helpful. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been searching for the past day and I thought I found something where you would call "explorer shell:???spartan???", but I can't seem to find it anymore.</p>

            Since Word works in Safe mode, the cause is a damaged Normal template, corrupt registry entries for Word, or a malfunctioning add-in. You can troubleshoot all of these by following the manual steps&nbsp;in the Knowledge Base article at

            <p>You have run into a new "feature" of Office 2013/365.&nbsp; It is called "animation".&nbsp; The feature does "funky" stuff (I don't know specifically what) that effectively slows down response.</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<strong>Slow Word 2013</strong>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<p>I experienced a similar issue with slow typing speed in Office 365 Word. I edit a substantial number of Word and Excel documents for work and found the SkyDrive storage incredibly beneficial for working remotely.</p>
<p>I realized though that documents which are being edited from Skydrive, not a local copy, experience the slow typing speed issue.</p>
<p>The fix: &nbsp; From word: &nbsp;File, Options. Word Options has an advanced tab on the left labeled ‘advanced’. About 3/4 of the way down, a category for ‘Save’ options exists. The default setting has ‘Allow Background Saves’ checked. I uncheck this option and instead
 check ‘Always create backup copy’ and ‘Copy remotely stored files onto your computer, and update the remote file when saving’.</p>
<p>I assume that if you’re storing the files on Skydrive, or Dropbox, or web, or maybe even some external drive or flash memory this background save could be lagging and result in typing slowness. Either way, I changed the advanced options, and no more problem.
 Maybe it’ll work for you.</p>
<p>Excel didn’t have the option, and I usually save a local copy anyways due to the working file size.</p>
<p>*I run windows 7 with office 365 and windows surface pro with win 8 and office 365. 4gb memory each.</p>

<p>Answer</p>
<p>I have had the same problem on many computers and tried every solution I found on the web and nothing worked(registry changes, office settings(save display and more)).&nbsp; As a test&nbsp;I copied the files from my Onedrive folder to the desktop and everything worked
 well - typing was as fast as office 2010 - the slow typing&nbsp;was a one drive problem. &nbsp;Wanting both the benefits of Onedrive and the ability to type without lag I did the following:</p>
<p>1.Created a folder outside of Onedrive call Onedrive-Local. </p>
<p>2 Downloaded MS SyncToy to sync Onedrive-Local to the Onedrive folder which uploads to the cloud.</p>
<p>Now I only work out of the Onedrive-Local folder and things are fast.&nbsp; The files get synced and I have access to them on the cloud.
</p>
<p>&lt;/snip&gt;</p>

<strong>Slow Excel 2013 - Rubber band effect, delayed Response time when typing – Disable Animation feature</strong>
<p>In Office 2013 MS added a funky new UI feature called “Animation”. It is supposed to “smooth out”, or some such nonsense, cursor movement in the applications. I first noticed it in Excel 2013. I found it so annoying that that “feature” alone was enough to
 completely turn me off from using the whole Office 2013 bundle. Fortunately, or not (?), I found these fixes.</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt; Hi, I have exactly the same problem, Excel2013.</p>
<p>Just opened a new spread sheet, typed the nr 1 in cell A1 to A22, took me about 10 seconds.</p>
<p>Took excel 55 seconds to display, looks like slow motion.&nbsp; &lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>The article in the first link has a link to another article with a downloadable file that will make the change without you having to edit the registry manually</p>
<p>There’s an easier fix for the “rubber band” animations in Excel - just turn them off
</p>
<ol>
<li><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>File menu, </li><li><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Options command </li><li><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Advanced option </li><li><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Scroll down to the Display section of the dialog, </li><li><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turn ON the box for “Disable hardware graphics acceleration</li></ol>

<p>******************************</p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>I have my Control Panel set up to display small icons (meaning I don’t get the big generalized groupings), and here’s the path in that kind of setup (Windows 7):</p>
<p>Press the Windows Button + [Pause/Break] to skip the next 2 steps</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open the Control Panel</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Choose System</p>
<p>Choose Advanced System Settings in the left hand column of choices on the next dialog</p>
<p>On the [Advanced] tab, click the {Settings...} button in the Performance section</p>
<p>Clear the checkbox next to the “Animate controls and elements inside windows” entry right at the top of the list</p>
<p>Click [OK] and close out all of the dialogs and the Control Panel.</p>
<p>That did it for me instantly without a reboot. </p>

<p>I found an option that can be turned off when you’re typing over cells that have already been saved. Under options &gt; advanced - (allow editing directly in cells) once I turned this off the lag stopped.&nbsp;</p>

Note, you may have to also add the “Graphics” key. </p>

<p>Alternate, related solution</p>
<p>I’m using Windows 8, and found a different solution there: </p>
<p>To disable Windows animations (this is secondary IMHO, but may be required):</p>
<ul>
<li><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the metro start screen type Edit, </li><li><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&lt;tab&gt;, &lt;down Arrow&gt; to then move the search results down 1 to “Settings”</li><li><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“Edit system environment variables” is the first thing in second column on my search results, yours may vary

</li><li><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Click on Apply</li><li><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>OK out</li><li><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>boot the computer</li></ul>
<p>Under options &gt; advanced &gt; turn off<span>&nbsp; </span>“allow editing directly in cells”</p>
<p>Here is another idea worth looking at :&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<p>I have had this problem also when authoring user guides.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eventually I found that if I switched off the “Maintain compatibility” check box in the Save As dialog the problem disappeared.</p>
<p>Word may be scanning each element to make sure it maintains compatibility.</p>

<p>Hello Jacques,</p>
<p>I just saw this, and I can explain it. In 2013 we went to a more secure algorithm across Office - not just in Excel. Excel 2013 uses SHA-512. It makes only milliseconds of difference with one call, but in those cases where code runs, protecting and unprotecting
 many sheets, it all adds up to a terrible performance issue. </p>
<p>Because it is considered a security risk to modify that, all request for a change have been turned down. The development team will never do anything to make Office less secure. See

            <p>Hi Lucretia,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not quite sure where you are (but we've seen a lot of this) so lets start from the beginning, check a few things, and make sure everything is done correctly. And we're going to forget upgrading and install MSE fresh to remove upgrade problems from the
 equation. This virtually always solves the issue though the issue varies from case to case. I believe it is a conflict with something that existed that didn't bother prior versions (check with the tool for anything that may be there from the past) or with
 how the upgrade deals with removing the prior MSE version (and doesn't do it well sometimes and even MrFixit isn't enough). Please don't skip steps or shortcut. All may not be needed (most usually isn't) but follow in order until the situation is resolved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Start with the following compliments of Dr. Strangelove:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that you have removed all other real-time antimalware products that were ever installed on your PC, including free/trial products that were installed when the PC was purchased (Norton, McAfee, TM, AVG, OneCare, Malwarebytes (paid), etc).
 Then, use the cleanup tools here: </span></strong><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>List of anti-malware program cleanup/uninstall tools</span></b></a>.
 You MUST use the cleanup/removal tools to get rid of these programs properly as the normal uninstall process leaves remnants behind that cause problems with any other AV product you install later including MSE<span>.</span><span>This means not only current
 ones but any EVER (including free trials you may never have used) or done years ago and possibly forgotten. See the following compliments of Dave__M:<strong><span>If you aren't sure of what may still be on your system as remnants, which could be interfering
 with the MSE install, try a scan of your system with this security application detection and removal specialist:</span></strong></span><a href="http://www.appremover.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>http://www.appremover.com/</span></strong></a>.<span>Do
 not yet remove the one primary AV program you are using until you have downloaded the MSE file so you are protected while doing so – then uninstall and remove that program after the download but before beginning to install MSE.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>NOTE: If you have installed Adobe FLASH, and you already had the Google toolbar, you were presented with the option to install “McAfee Security Scanner”, which is selected by default. If you were caught by this, and unknowingly/accidentally
 installed McAfee, uninstall it and use the McAfee cleanup tool in the list above. Other programs "package" deals like this as well with this or other products and if you've recently done a clean install (a restore to factory conditions) you may have also re-installed
 trial software that you long since forgot was there.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that your PC clock is correctly set. If not, correct it. If it is wrong, you may also want to either synchronize with a different internet time server or replace your CMOS battery (which keeps the clock running when you turn off the
 PC and like any battery can eventually run down).</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that you are up-to-date with SERVICE PACKS and updates (including .NET and IE). Yes, it can take some time to do this.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify if MSE is already installed that Windows Defender is disabled (Vista or W7) or uninstalled (XP).If not, please do so as this is a classic cause of conflict-related problems.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Then, if anything changed, restart your PC.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, try the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try a clean boot (Vista and W7) <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a> (except for MSE). If the problem goes away then it's just a matter of tracking down the culprit causing the problem. Follow the procedures in the article. Once found, delete, remove, deactivate, or uninstall it. Once
 done be sure to reset your system back to normal status as explained in the procedures. If the problem occurs in clean mode then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work. If using XP, see<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353</a>
 and<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/316434" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/316434</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, uninstall and re-install MSE. To uninstall MSE, proceed as follows:<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4</a>
 or<span>try </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2483120" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2483120</span></a> I suspect some problem with uninstalling the prior version is behind this, so you may need to focus more of the second
 link with the Mr Fixit and probably also the manual procedures to be sure it is completely removed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To install or re-install MSE, check out this article and follow ALL the procedures:<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/check-list-for-installing-microsoft-security/bf757e6a-e320-4a67-92bc-767e6acb26c4">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/check-list-for-installing-microsoft-security/bf757e6a-e320-4a67-92bc-767e6acb26c4</a>-
 but also check out the next paragraph before you begin the download.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do or ever did have any other AV program installed on your computer (even if you didn't use it), you need to make sure they are all uninstalled and fully removed after downloading MSE but before you install. To fully remove them, check out this listing
 of removal tools<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91</b></a>
 or the listing in that article at the bottom under troubleshooting steps (why this link isn't at the top near things to do first where it discusses removing all the prior and current AV programs is beyond me) or, if not on the lists, go to the website of the
 AV software and get and use the removal tool for that product.<span> </span>You cannot just uninstall these programs – you MUST also use the removal tool – even if the uninstall was years ago but you didn’t use a removal tool at the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To install, go to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx</a> and click on more languages and versions and then choose your language and the appropriate version for your operating system. When you download, save it to the desktop (rather than running
 it). When finished, uninstall and remove any remaining AV program you retained for protections during the download and then reboot.Then right click on the installation icon and click run as Administrator (even if you’re logged in as an administrator) as I’ve
 found this sometimes helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then you need to configure your settings, set a scheduled scan, enable real-time protection, update MSE, and then run a quick scan (or a full scan if you have time).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also recommend the following setup for MSE (though the decision is yours - I've just found this helpful and the most effective and best way to set it up and is how I have mine configured):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure that ALL threat levels are sent to Quarantine where you can then decide whether or not to allow them or leave them there, or remove them. It is the safest solution for having the most options for dealing with the situation. Quarantine is as safe
 as removed, but in some cases you may want to remove them to be more certain - and with this one I would remove it (when the time comes). To do this, open MSE, click on the Settings Tab, and for each of the threat levels, set the action to be Quarantine and
 save.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the History tab and click on allowed and unless you specifically placed something in allowed, remove everything else from the allowed category. Only put things there that you ABSOLUTELY know are not problems (are "false positives") and triple-check
 before you do it as doing this could allow a real threat to bypass security and infect you and it won't be detected or rather won't be reported or acted upon by MSE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on MAP and click on Advanced and save. This is not at all dangerous to you and no information sent will be used by Microsoft to identify you even if some minor identification information is sent in terms of defining the infection,
 but it can sometimes help with new threats by initiating an immediate update to deal with the problem if it is in the MAP database (and it helps Microsoft update definitions to provide you and everyone else better protection).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on Advanced and check the box for save Quarantine items and change it from one month to three months so you have more time to decide if you want to restore something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*************************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't help, then there's a good chance you may be infected by malware. Please proceed as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, try the following programs if you haven't as they may help. I recommend you download, install, update, and run full scans with Malwarebytes:<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a> and SuperAntiSpyware:<a href="http://superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://superantispyware.com/</span></a>
 and then run a full ESET online scan: <a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner</a>. This may or may not remove the infections, but will probably not repair any damage caused by them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Properly and completely removing such infections can be complex and often require manual removal procedures (which may or may not be entirely effective either).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Start here - </span><a href="https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/</span></a><span>and select the link that says - I think my</span><span>computer is infected. Options
 will vary by region, but phone support leads you to Microsoft Answer Desk (</span><a href="http://www.answerdesk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.answerdesk.com/</span></a><span>)<b> in the US at this time.</b> After an initial free consultation, a fee
 will be charged for assistance, based on the details of the case.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You can start here: </span><a href="https://consumersecuritysupport.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://consumersecuritysupport.microsoft.com/</span></a><span> (which will also lead to the paid support options if you are in the US)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>In other regions not served by the link above, go here: </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/security" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://Support.microsoft.com/security</span></a><span>and go to the “assisted support” or contact us menu.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If the above is too expensive and you'd like some free options (though they can take days or a week or so before getting a response and then more days going back and forth in a forum environment - and though the quality of help you get is generally
 good, the level of expertise of the person assigned to your case is pretty much the luck of the draw - but that's the "price" of free options), here are some free malware-removal forums:</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>********************************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If malware was found and removed, then you need to again uninstall and re-install MSE as it will never work properly if installed on an infected system (which we didn’t know at the time).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully, one of these solutions (or a step in one of these answers) will resolve the problem. If not, then open a support case describing the problem starting at:<a href="https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/</b></a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Excel 2013 Document Recovery Pane won&#39;t go away</h2>
                    <p>If we close Excel 2013 with a document opened, the next time we launch Excel that doc is in the Recovery pane.&nbsp; How do we stop this?</p>
<p>The doc is opened, unchanged.&nbsp; When we close, we are not prompted to save it since it was not changed.&nbsp; Excel closes fine - not crashing.&nbsp; It should not have the document in the recovery pane.&nbsp;

            I'd suggest doing an online repair of the installation.

            <p>I have asked this question before and was told to synch my phone. It wouldn't work either. The answer you have given suggests the issue is by phone design. So guess only NECESSARY fix can come from Microsoft. My phone is Nokia 630, using w8.1. I see this
 issue as a MAJOR design fault.</p>

<h2>            Can I create a new Skype account to solve my Skype problems that seem unfixable&#63;</h2>
                    My Skype is so bolluxed up that I am thinking of just creating a new account, but I don't know if that will create a bigger mess.&nbsp; My original account is gone.&nbsp; Skype created a new account when I changed my phone number on the original account.&nbsp; This second
 account is linked to Microsoft:&nbsp; it does not have a Skype ID, just my email.&nbsp; (I really really don't want Microsoft involved with Skype as it has already caused me a lot of trouble).&nbsp; Could I just go back to the beginning and create a brand new account with
 a new Skype id, or will this mess up my ability to Skype even further?

<p>Hi, Susan</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are signing in to Skype with an email address, you have a Microsoft account. But you are given a Skype ID (live:xxxxxx) for you to be easily searched by your contacts in the Skype directory.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If you created your Skype account using an email address, here are the steps on how you can find your Skype ID:</span></p>

<li><strong><span>Through the Skype website:</span></strong></li></ul>

<p>Noel, THANK YOU !!! for this post and link, </p>
<p>and also for&nbsp;all the help you've given to everyone here. Your posts are thoughtful and valuable and have helped me in the past.
</p>
<p>I will keep this link and I wish I had had it before as it would have saved me HOURS of futile attempts to correct what I thought was a problem on my systems/programs end. Just happy that my long time Hotmail account is now back to working via Win Live Essen
 2012 on Win7 Pro.</p>

            If you want to sync a windows mobile phone to your computer, the software you'd use is Activesync or Windows Mobile Device Center.&nbsp; These applications are only designed to sync calendar, contact, task data to Outlook.&nbsp; If you don't have Outlook installed
 on the computer you can't use ActiveSync or Windows Mobile Device Center to sync this data to your computer since there is no software on the computer to receive it.<br />
<br />
You might be able to find other third party syncing software that lets you sync to a proprietary calendar, but you'd have to buy that too and I don't know if such software really exists.<br />
<br />
If you've got a windows mobile 6.x device, <a href="http://windowslivehelp.com/solution.aspx?solutionid=46bd910c-ed99-497d-80d7-ab8b11237ed0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
you can sync contacts and tasks to a windows live account.</a><br />

<p><span>Hello ASD11_111,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The Teams guest access features can be controlled by your organization administrator to achieve different organization policies. Therefore, if you are not able to add/search guest in your Teams, please kindly
 contact your admin to check if the guest access for your organization is enabled in each authorization level.</span></p>

</p><p><span>Meanwhile, the guest access feature should be enabled for both organizations. Please also confirm with the recipient side (the organization you want to add) to check their settings.</span></p>
<p>
