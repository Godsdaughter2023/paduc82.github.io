            <p>Hello Justin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry to know that you're receiving the same issue about not being able to upload videos to YouTube. The questions that has been asked were to isolate the issue further. Though having the same scenario, the information behind the issue is different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would need to verify if you can upload videos to YouTube directly for us to know if the issue only happens on the program. If you're able to sign in and upload to YouTube successfully, we would need to verify if your two step verification for Google account
 is activated. If it's not active, please activate it and use an app password to login to Movie Maker. Please contact a Google representatives for more details on activating two-step verification on your Google account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the results afterwards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Xbox &#40;Beta&#41; - PC game pass app save&#47;achievements problem</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>So I installed Lichtspeer: Double Speer Edition on the Xbox (Beta) app with PC game pass. This is the first game I installed with the game pass. Every time I exit the game my progress is lost. Anyone have the same problem? Beside this, achievements like
 "100 headshots" and "Killed a 100 enemies" does not even work. I hope this is not the case with every game I install on the Xbox app...</p>

            I haven't personally played this game or had this problem. I'd recommend while waiting to hear from others here, you send feedback through the Xbox (Beta) app. You can do this by clicking on your gamer picture and choosing "feedback" from the drop down
 menu.

<p>I have not played that one specifically, but I'll try it tonight.&nbsp; I can say that it hasn't been the case with me with other games on the service.&nbsp; Into The Breach and The Messenger have both been working great, even though Into The Breach doesn't have Xbox
 Live integration (cloud saves, achievements, etc) but it has saved my progress locally, and The Messenger has been fine in all regards of cloud saves and achievements.</p>

</p><p>I'll let you know if I see issues with Lichtspeer, but <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Lichtspeer-Double-Speer-Edition/achievements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
looking at TrueAchievements page, it looks like there are some issues others are having some issues with the achievement as well, with a number of achievements being listed as unobtainable.</a>&nbsp; SOMETIMES those are fixed by the developer; I've seen it have
 a much better fix rate on the PC, but back in the Windows Phone day it was real hit or miss if they would fix them or not.</p>

<h2>            WLM not working right since Windows 10 NOvember Upgrade</h2>
                    I have two PC's. &nbsp;One is running Windows 10 Home and the other is running Windows 10 Pro. &nbsp;Prior to the November upgrade, my Windows Live Mail was working fine. &nbsp;Now I cannot get the program to open on either PC. &nbsp;When I click on the WLM Icon, I get the
 hourglass for about 5 seconds and then it just stops and nothing else happens.

<p>Does the same happen if you disconnect from the Internet (e.g. by disabling Wi-Fi or pulling out the Ethernet plug) before launching the program?</p>

            Actually, a reboot always restores it, but it is very inconvenient and annoying to have to take the the time for the pc to reboot when I need to get into my mail. &nbsp;By the way, it is WLM v 2009 on the PC running Windows 10 Pro and it is WLM v 2011 on the
 PC running Windows 10 Home if that makes any difference.

            <p>Microsoft screws us again! I just got an email informing me that WLM 2011 will not work with the latest Windows 10 upgrade and encouraging everyone to make sure they have the latest update to WLM in order for their WLM to work with Win 10, but I could not
 get the WLM to update. They want everyone to switch to the horrible Mail app in Windows 10.

            Just use WLM2012, which will still be supported for the time being. However, don't install the latest patch for this contained in the email from MSFT, as it breaks WLM. I'm still using WLM2012 until the built-in W10 mail catches up with features.

            I am thinking about just switching to Office Outlook, but I like the idea of having my e mails saved on the cloud. I really need to compare the two programs, especially in regards to back up.

            I'm guessing that it will also keep the emails in the cloud, if you get the 'Keep a copy on the Server' type option. Only use Office Outlook from a Corporate POV, the Exchange server at work retains a copy of all my emails but with a limit of 1GB. Not
 sure how this works when it comes to using a POP Server although I'm not sure if Outlook.com really is a POP server anymore, as it uses EAS according to my online settings).

<p>Well, yes, it does. Both of those versions are obsolete. They only exist because versions later than 2009 won't run on XP and versions later than 2011 won't run on Vista. The 2012 version is the only one supported on Windows 7, 8.1 and 10.&nbsp;When upgrading,
 be sure to have good recent backups of your data (mail and default contacts - the ones you see when not signed in).

<p>That's not what the email I got said. It didn't mention any upgrade to Windows 10, and I'm sure I've seen references in these forums to Windows Live Mail 2011 on Windows 10 v.1511 - the latest upgrade. Can you please quote the bit of the email you're referring
 to? It's quite important to know&nbsp;whether&nbsp;v.2011 is going to stop working on Windows 10.</p>

            <p>I'm already on WLM2012, so I probably received a different email to you. I think they are trying to push users to use the built-in mail in Win10. However, from the email I got it suggested that WLM2012 will remain in use for now, albeit requiring you to
 download and install a patch that seems to break WLM2012 for some users. But WLM2011 does appear not to be supported anymore.</p>

            <p>To Firedog: &nbsp;See the post from Lee_G3. &nbsp;Apparently Lee already had WLM v 2012, which Microsoft says they will be issuing a patch for but apparently my WLM 2009 &amp; 2011 are done for and I cannot get a download of 2012. &nbsp;The download system reads that I already
 am on Windows 10 and keeps directing me back to that dumb app in Win10.</p>

    <title>Cannot remover high contrast settins in Windows 10 on Lenovo - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> trishiathompson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot remover high contrast settins in Windows 10 on Lenovo G50computer</h2>
                    <p>I am ready to throw this computer out the window! I&nbsp;made the horrible mistake of thinking I would be able to&nbsp;read the display better by turning on high contrast, and made it worse by thinking I would like my background hue pink. Now I have green faces, text
 and command buttons I cant see. I have tried for weeks to get back default settings, including restoring computer to previous date. I have been to the high contrast setting page a million times, there is no none to select on the pull down menu. Catena will
 not respond when asked, the&nbsp;search takes me to web who suggests&nbsp;none on the pull down window. Ctlr Alt prnsc does nothing.&nbsp;I am actually failing out classes because I can't use this computer as intended. I'm afraid it will import these setting into Windows
 8 if I&nbsp;dump Windows 10. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am losing it, over something that should be so simple! But I am finding nothing is simple on Windows 10!!!!!!! If this was suppose to make amends for taking away XP that was Microsoft's crowning glory, they failed. &nbsp;I wish I had never bought&nbsp;this thing,&nbsp;and
 that Mac weren't so expensive. If accessibility is supposed to be for those who are disadvantaged how can&nbsp;Microsoft making their computer experience so frustrating and horrible? If anyone has a better idea then throwing this thing out the window I would really
 appreciate it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 PC. The PC has no issues with upload or download speeds (~230mbps down/20mbps up), and my Xbox One X's get about the same.....however, my problem comes in that the upload speeds keep fluctuating badly, so bad in fact that we can't even use 2 Xboxes on the
 same network without atrocious lag. It spikes continually back and forth between 26mbps and 1mbps, over and over between each speed test on the xboxes. PC keeps a consistent 20mbps upload no problem. Wireless devices are ok. It's ONLY my Xboxes doing this,
 both wired AND wireless.</span><br />

<span>I've tried power cycling. Factory resets of ALL devices. Unplugging other devices (so it's solo). Threw Static IP's on both consoles and forwarded all Xbox Live ports. Threw my Xbox One
 X into the DMZ. ISP has checked every line and splitter from the device to the drop line outside with no reported issues. They even replaced all the lines just to exclude them as culprits. ISP tried removing and re-adding and configuring my modem into their
 systems. All channel signals and power are well within specs. I just don't get it. It started happening after a storm, but no power outage or any other issues. Download speeds are unscathed but for some reason these consoles absolutely cannot play together
 without having a huge problem holding a steady upload speed.</span><br />

 and nothing else, but I honestly can't think of what else the problem could be other than maybe an xbox update affecting something?&nbsp;</span>

<p>Hi Co2,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums. When you did the port forwarding there is a special way to do it for 2 consoles. You an use this guide in case you didn't set up correctly.</p>
<p><a href="https://portforward.com/portforward-two-xboxes/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://portforward.com/portforward-two-xboxes/default.htm</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Reason is you are unable to use exact same ports for both. So for example if you went through set up the first, then went in and set up the second the same way. The only one port forwarded is the second. Also with upload the problem could be with any part
 of your internet. Router, wires inside and outside of house, posts that the ISP are in control of etc. Have your ISP check everything let them know you are wired and upload is horrible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

</p><p>My OP states they checked all the lines AND replaced them as a courtesy. Everything from the modem back to the drop line outside was replaced. Any splitters got replaced. My X1X was in the DMZ and my gfs X1X gets the ports forwarded. Everything was fine
 before on dynamic ip addresses. I never needed static. Ports were always open and everything ran fine for a year....i mean, its a gaming modem/router after all. NETGEAR forums suggested coming here because they feel its an Xbox or Xbox update issue.</p>

    <title>Odd issue with Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ryanmjqr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Odd issue with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Ever since I installed Windows 10 (yesterday), I've found that there are a few issues:<br />
- Most games continuously minimize, literally seconds after unminimizing them, while games that do not, act as if I'm selecting another program constantly (going to pause menus, disabling controls, etc).<br />
- The rotating circle next to the cursor turns on and off very other second<br />
- Any right-click menu is closed within a second</p>
<p>- If I try to full screen a video, on Netflix for example, it will stay full screen and then return to its former state almost instantly<br />
<br />
All these problems, to me, seem related, as if the mouse is continuously clicking somewhere, but I have no idea where. No one else seems to have this issue as far as I can see, and I've tried switching mouse, or even removing them entirely, to no avail. I've
 closed every possible program on task manager and had no luck there either.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It's driving me insane so any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            Hi!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thanks for the reply. I've done both methods and neither seemed successful. However the sfc scan found an issue with a file "StartLayout.psd1", which it couldn't repair, and I can't manually repair it because my other Windows PC doesn't seem to have that file.
 What should I do, and is that likely to be the issue?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Ryan<br />

            My issue is similar. Surface pro 4, brand new. Recent win 10 update, now "cannot find camera". F4244 error. Cannot find camera in device manager, not in imaging devices, not in video controllers. Turning off antivirus did not help. The troubleshooters
 both in Windows on online here are useless, find nothing. Unable to roll back win 10 update. None of the fixes supplied on this forum have done anything. I can't load a camera app from the store, error says "can't find a camera". I don't know where else to
 go next. Any ideas, this seems like a Windows 10 issue, and the same old suggestions wont work.

            Same issue here.&nbsp; We have 7 Surface Pro Tablets, and the last round of updates, including firmware, broke the camera on all units.&nbsp; The same update corrupted Windows restore points and can't roll back.&nbsp; Repaired using DISM, reinstalled drivers and ran
 the latest firmware updates with no luck.

<p>The errors that I am receiving on all 7 Surface Pro 4 tablets are these...</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>Windows 10 Camera App Error Code 0xA00F4244(0xC00DABE0)</span></li><li><span>Skype for Business 2016 “We didn’t detect a camera”</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>After the latest round of driver/firmware updates in September through WSUS, all of our Surface Pro tablets (7 of them) have lost their cameras.</span></p>
<p><span>In Device Manager, under “System Devices” I can see the Microsoft Camera Front/Back/IR drivers and there are no issues/errors for them. However, there is no “Imaging Devices” listed in Device Manager.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Here are all the steps I have taken.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>I verified the system was up to date on Microsoft Updates.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>I verified that all firmware and drivers are current and up to date. Downloaded and installed latest “SurfacePro4_Win10_15063_1704001_0.msi” drivers/firmware and installed.<span>&nbsp;
</span>These are the same drivers that were pushed through WSUS.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>I’ve ran “SFC /Scannow”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>No issues found</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>I’ve ran “DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Issues found and repaired.<span>&nbsp; </span>Ran second time and no issues found.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>5.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>I’ve uninstalled and deleted the camera drivers under “System Devices” and reinstalled them with the newest version.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>6.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>I uninstalled all antivirus software. No change.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>7.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>I’ve turned off all cameras in UEIF BIOS, then logged in and verified that the camera devices did not show under “System Devices”. Then turned them back on in the BIOS and verified that they showed back up.<span>&nbsp;
</span>But still no “Imaging Devices” listed and same errors for camera app and Skype.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>8.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>I do not see any errors in the logs for drivers or anything related.</span></p>
<p>So the only thing left that I haven't done is to completely wipe and reimage one of these devices.&nbsp; These are our Executive devices and I'm reluctant to do this unless it's the only option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already performed the steps you suggested and none of them resovled the issue.&nbsp; I do not know what else to try accept to reimage a devies to see if the cameras come back.</p>

<p>Yesterday I was able to get one of our surface tablets with this issue and image.&nbsp; The image was created in June and had all Windows updates as of June.&nbsp; After imaging I tested the cameras and they both worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then proceeded to run Windows updates and install the latest updates that we had approved. After updating, the camera issue was back. No front or back cameras were working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled the last security update that was installed, <strong>KB4038788</strong> cumulative security update (OS Build 15063.608), and the cameras came back.&nbsp; So the issue is being caused by security updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried uninstalling&nbsp;<strong>KB4038788 </strong>on another Surface with the issue, and this didn't resolve the issue. However, I'm still in the process of testing.&nbsp; This tablet also had
<strong>KB4040685 </strong>installed and I haven't had a chance to uninstall this update yet. Hoping that removing both of these updates resolves the issue.</p>

    <title>How to unzip large files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mackinthomas  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to unzip large files</h2>
                    This question is a derivative resulting from a response to one of my previous questions. The previous question was how could I open an attachment which had been sent in an e-mail to me from a trusted source? Hotmail had blocked the attachment without providing
 me the usual opportunity to view or accept the challenged attachment. Following some helpful advice on one of these forums, I tried to forward the e-mail to Documents on my computer but was unsuccessful. I then tried to forward it to one of my other e-mail
 accounts (gmail) and the message forwarded but not the attachments. Then I attempted the last recommendation, which was to have the sender e-mail it to me as a zipped file. I received the zipped file successfully and downloaded it but the warning appeared
 that it was too large to unzip without purchasing WinRAR. &nbsp;I had used WinRAR once about 2 years ago so the free trial period had long since expired. I should add that each of the hundreds of other zipped files I have received since the expiration have all
 opened automatically after being downloaded. &nbsp;Anyway, I then attempted to purchase it online following the popup that appeared but was shuttled from one site to another attempting to sell everything but a simple version of WinRAR.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So, I am back to where I started. Does anyone know how I can unzip that file now? Preferably for free or limited expense.</div>

<p>As Admiral Ackbar would say,<em> "It's a trap!"</em>.</p>
<p>There is no Microsoft or Bill Gates lottery and never has been. It is simply a<em> phishing</em> attempt to get you to part with personal information so you can be scammed.</p>
<p>Just delete it.</p>
<p>BTW, direct peer-to-peer communication in these forums is generally discouraged. Posted email addresses are automatically removed from messages.</p>

<h2>            Computer freezes with grinding noise and then restart itself</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys, I've got a problem that's preventing me from playing and I'm kind of starting feeling a little desperate now, so I need expert help
</p>
<p>Basically while playing (doesn't matter the game, it happened both with MTG:Arena and Path of Exile) the machine will freeze at random with a loud, sometimes hear-piercing grinding noise, and after 2-3 seconds reboot itself.
</p>
<p>I've already tried scanning with malwarebyte, testing ram with memtest, updating video drivers and updating windows, but all this didn't worked.</p>
<p>Last play session I was monitoring the stats while playing, GPU was 50% usage, ram usage was low and CPU around 30%, everything seemed fine when suddenly happened again.
</p>
<p>So far only happened while in a game, and I got my machine restarted 7 times today, playing is impossible and under this circumstances frustrating too, and I'm out of ideas.
</p>
<p>Please help me </p>

<br />Follow that up with a full Disk Check, from the Command Prompt if necessary:   <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-drive-fix-failures-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-dri...</a>
<br />
<br />2) Update the sound driver from the PC or sound controller maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model, if it is newer than the one presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  While there compare to make sure you also have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display, Network and all other drivers.  
<br />
<br />3) Try physically reinstalling the video card, check all interior connections.  
<br />
<br />4) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />5) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>

            Hi Marcus 
<br />
<br />Due to that sound you are hearing, I would suspect overheating as the cause
<br />
<br />Check the fans and grills on your system for a dust build up and blow those out if necessary
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download the free Open Hardware Monitor
<br />
<br />That comes down in a zip file and does not need to be installed
<br />
<br /><a href="https://openhardwaremonitor.org/downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://openhardwaremonitor.org/downloads/</a>
<br />
<br />Run that on your system to monitor the temperatures of your CPU and GPU and also fan rotation while playing games, please let me know if that points to any problems
<br />

            Temperature don't seems to be the cause, it happened with the VGA at 66° which is normal for this card, and the CPU at 60° which shouldn't be high enough to cause this.

<p>More information:</p>
<p>After trying many things and rulying out the obvious stuff, I decided to remove the 480GTX and replace it with my old 8800GT, and the problem is gone, I can play without freezing/restart.</p>
<p>To recap, the problem I was having was that while launching demanding 3d applications (games, path of exile, magic the gathering: Arena) at a random point during execution, the game would freeze, the screen switch to a solid color (somewhat related to the
 image displayed right before the freeze, maybe an averange of colors or the one of a random pixel of that image), the speaker would emit a lound grinding noise (different from game to game, probably just stuttering on wathever sound was played at the time)
 and the machine would restart itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now my thoughts are 2, the first is that some part of this 480GTX have failed, the card can still work and allow me to do simple stuff like browsing, watching videos etc, but when under stress (gaming) if the broken part is requested to do work, freeze/restart
 will happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second is the problem being the power supply. I cannot exclude that because the 480GTX requires 14 pin to be powered, while the 8800GT require only 6. Therefore I was thinking that maybe the PSU is not able anymore to steadily fullfill the huge power
 requirement of the 480GTX, or that some of those 14 pins are not working properly, and I got lucky with the 6 I plugged into the 8800GT being the good ones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that the problem has been narrowed to this 2, there is anything we can do to test them and find the true cause?</p>

            That's where we would have looked next as it happens... the homegroup, network and streaming settings are all a bit muddly! Periodically one of my wireless devices will stop cooperating and I have to reset everything. It actually happened late a couple
 of evenings ago - just when I thought I'd put on some soothing music... needless to say, I was far from soothed!&nbsp; - Anyway good to know it's sorted - thanks for updating. - Regards, Ric.

                    Hi all,<br />
<br />
I currently built a desktop computer using this motherboard: GA-H55M-S2H<br />
After installing windows and installed the motherboard CD-Rom drivers, I attempt to connect to the internet but failed. The connection is used to test on Windows XP and it worked.<br />
<br />

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>There is no problem with the device drivers. The device manager displayed okay.</p>
<p>The IP v4 properties is also showing correct values.</p>
<p>I have called up starhub and they solved the problem for me:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Solution:<br />
</span>The problem lies with the cable modem and cable, not the computer.<br />
<br />
1) Switch off the cable modem for 10 seconds.<br />
2) Take out the RJ45 cable on both sides (modem and PC) and switch</p>
<p>It worked like a miracle!<br />
Thanks all!</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply. Yeah, I know that, but I wanted to transfer only some items. My brothers and I share the first Xbox, so I want to move my stuff over to the new Xbox without having to move the entire hard drive. Any way of doing this? I just don't want
 to use a flash drive because I have nothing bigger than 4GB flash drive and some of my items are like 5GB or higher. Thanks!</p>

<p>easy flash drive</p>
<p>when using the transfer cable it erases the source drive and the any info on the main drive is erased</p>
<p>i'm not sure what you mean by some stuff being bigger then 5gigs because no gamesave is that big</p>
<p>if you are talking about DLC </p>
<p>it would do you no good to copy dlc over</p>
<p>DLC is only associated with the original purchasing console</p>
<p>also the original purchasing gamertag &nbsp;has to be signed into live at all times to use the said content</p>
<p>also you can redownload dlc at anytime from the purchasing console</p>
<p>however the gamertag that purchased it still has to remain on LIVE</p>
<p>that being said you will have to do a drm transfer and then redownload the content if you want the other console to use the content offline</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>this means the other console will have to have the purchasing gamertag signed in at all times</p>
<p>either way dlc can only be used on 1 console offline at a time</p>

<p>Oh alright then. I guess I'm stuck using a USB. And the stuff bigger than 5GB are installed games. I can't reinstall them on the other console because it is laser burned and that's why I want to copy the games over. Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently, there's a tool called Alien Respawn installed on your machine, details here:
<a href="http://www.dell.com/support/contents/us/en/19/article/Product-Support/Dell-Subsidiaries/alienware-support-site/alienware-respawn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.dell.com/support/contents/us/en/19/article/Product-Support/Dell-Subsidiaries/alienware-support-site/alienware-respawn</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I mention that because a user on one of the Dell forums mentioned that it was causing games to randomly minimize. See the sixth post down from the top in this thread which has been marked as "Suggested Answer":

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the response. I tried uninstalling it and the problem persisted. I noticed that as I was surfing the web, my chrome window kept selecting and deselecting itself at random intervals. I began to discover this happened to any application working.
 So I went about trying to find the source of the error. I found this page and followed the instructions and it worked. http://www.sevenforums.com/general-discussion/124483-windows-keep-selecting-deselecting-themselves-2.html No more random deselect. I have
 come to ascertain that ever since I upgraded to windows 8.1, it would try to send error reports to microsoft but nothing would be showing, hence the deselect and minimising! Must be a conflict with some of my installed applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you! (:&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I suggest you do here is the following.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make a note of the exact time the game minimizes the next time. After you finish playing, hit "Windows key + X" to open the power users menu and click
<strong>Event Viewer</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Expand the tree to <strong>Windows Logs</strong> and then click <strong>Application</strong>. Wait until the center pane populates and then right click the same Application submenu and go to
<strong>Filter Current Log</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the menu which opens, change "<strong>Anytime</strong>" at the top to "<em>Last hour</em>" (assuming you finish your game within one hour of it minimizing suddenly), or "<em>Last 12 hours</em>" if it's longer and then click OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Find the log file(s) which coincide(s) with the time the game minimized, right click it and go to "<strong>Copy</strong>" ---&gt; "<strong>Copy Details as Text</strong>". This will copy the data to the Windows Clipboard in a readable format.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, open Notepad, right click and select Paste. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also copy the contents of the log file here if you wish and I'll take a look at it. It'll stay on the Windows Clipboard until you either copy something else, or shutdown or reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked at the post in the link to the thread you posted but Windows Error Reporting only sends a report to Microsoft when an application fails to install or crashes.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other than that though, the thread dates from 2011 and might well have applied to Windows 7, but I haven't heard of it happening in 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some antivirus applications like AVG regularly check for updates every hour or so unless the user reconfigures the scheduling and it could be something like that stealing focus from the game. Same goes for running a scan in the background which is every
 hour by default on most AV. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, Adobe Flash Player calls home every hour to check for updates which is a waste of time since Flash patches are only ever released every second Wednesday of the month. You can change that in Windows Control Panel and go to Flash Player settings.
</p>

<h2>            Lenovo 100s ideapad Bitlocker problem after Windows update Nov 2018.</h2>
                    My Lenovo 100s got a Microsoft update on 2/11/18. Since restarting I get the bitlocker blue screen asking me to enter the recovery. I never set one up, was never asked to set one up, so don't have one. Been backwards and forwards with Lenovo, who say they
 are working on the problem and have now said it is a problem for Microsoft to sort out. Contacted Microsoft who have said it is a hardware problem for Lenovo to sort. Please can someone just help to sort it out.

<p>re the issue with Lenovo 100s and bit locker having been onto Lenovo and Microsoft to get issue resolved</p>
<p>first speaking with LENOVO they confirmed it is a Microsoft issue 100s Ideapad&nbsp; DOES NOT HAVE TPM CHIP INSTALLED NOR IS THE HARD DRIVE PARTIONED&nbsp; OR A SEPERATE BOOT OPTION IF YOU READ MICROSOFT OWN CRITERIA&nbsp; for bit locker to be enabled THE MACHINE NEEDS
 THESE also as bit locker is Microsoft&nbsp;</p>
<p>not LENOVO . Having now spoken to a Microsoft agent in the U S A he now agrees that it is their issue&nbsp;</p>
<p>having pointed out their own criteria for bitlocker&nbsp; he agreed beyond his pay grade and would force it up the line</p>
<p>I pointed out also two days before the update KB4462919 within my Microsoft account where you are supposed&nbsp;</p>
<p>to find this key my setting was off it now shows on not changed by me so why cannot the Microsoft accounts be rest to off by default like the update did earlier in year .I have written in disgust to Microsoft AS THIS IS NOW THE SECOND TIME UPDATES HAVE CAUSED
 ISSUES WITH LAPTOPS WITHIN THE FAMILY AND WE NEED ANSWERI AGREE CORPARTIONS NEED BIT LOCKER I DONT</p>
