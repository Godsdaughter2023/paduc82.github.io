<h2>            Choosing a new Gamertag&#58; an unexpected error has occured. Please try again later</h2>
                    <p>Hey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been thinking about changing my gamertag for some time, as I have once before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When checking availability, some ideas are taken, some can be claimed, but some just give the error message above, regardless of when and where I check for it.</p>
<p>I've checked with another site, and one idez is still available, but always give the error above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why do some gamertags consistently give errors when chrecking the availability on the official sites?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>
<p>

<p>Hello Cookie McCooks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for posting on the Xbox forums. We understand that you are getting error messages when searching for certain gamertags. This may be due to the fact that some gamertags are released from Microsoft accounts, but they are not available to get
 just yet. These gamertags take some time to become available to the public. We cannot say for sure. Does this error message appear when you search for gamertags on the
<a href="https://account.xbox.com/Profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox website</a> instead of the console? Be sure to let us know the results!</p>

    <title>Right arrow key opens windows media player&#59; code - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Right arrow key opens windows media player&#59; code &#39;hge&#43;&#39; appears when key is pressed in a text box. How to fix&#63;</h2>
                    Hi, I've been having this very infuriating problem lately with my laptop's keyboard where now the right arrow key ALWAYS opens up Windows media player when I press it. For some strange reason, if I click the right arrow key in a text box the code 'hge+'
 will appear. Because of this, I've effectively lost use of my right arrow key and there doesn't seem to be any solution online, from what i've searched. My sticky keys are off and there's no problem with hotkeys or anything like that. Can someone please help
 me?<br />

            <p>Hi Patrick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>2. Do you get any error message/code related to the issue?</p>
<p>3. What is the make and model of the keyboard/computer?</p>
<p>4. Does the issue occur on connecting the keyboard to another computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might be caused due to bad/corrupt keyboard driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>I would suggest you to run the Microsoft Safety Scanner and check:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to:</p>
<p><strong>Microsoft Safety Scanner</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>Try to boot into safe mode and check if the issue persists. </p>
<p>Refer the following link to boot the computer in safe mode:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Start your computer in safe mode</strong></span></span></p>

            There is NO place now for " selecting which program should open the file " at all ! ... There used to be a way to open a ' Paint ' screenshot using another program? ... and you'd click it and a drop down menu would appear: I've searched all over the new
 ' old paint ' program and the " Paint 3D " program and there is now no way to select any other program? ... I sometimes used to choose Inkscape or other programs to edit a screenshot.&nbsp; Sending you a picture would do no good.. unless you yourself do not have
 access to the new Windows 10&nbsp; " Paint " offerings.&nbsp;&nbsp; ? .. thanks, however... I thought someone could help explain.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would like to clarify, did you mean right clicking on the file and choose <strong>
Open with</strong> so you can select which application you want to use to edit the file or photo.</p>

            Hello:&nbsp; There used to be some kind of icon that would say ( Perhaps it WAS the words: " open this with " ) something that would give you the option to open the paint with some other program like Inkscape. There is now no option whatsoever that I can find
 either in regular " paint ' or in " 3Dpaint " .... right clicking on the image/screenshot or what have you doesn't bring any option other than the usual ...so there is none.... thanks so much for your response. Hopefully i've answered your question.

    <title>Some Windows Default Apps No Taskbar Icon After Deleting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> leonardoluchetti  say:</h3>
<h2>            Some Windows Default Apps No Taskbar Icon After Deleting &#34;tiledatalayer&#34; Folder</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I few weeks ago I was having trouble with start and search functions on my laptop, an HP notebook 15. As a fix, I deleted the tiledatalayer folder in Appdata, as a well as ran a few lines of code in the powershell program. Since then, when I run the microsoft
 photos or groove music apps, no icon appears in the task bar, so when I minimize the program, there is no way to retrieve it but opening it again from a shortcut or the task manager. This is annoying, as I often like to have a photo viewing app open but minimized.
 Is there anything I can do to fix this? I believe that I may have deleted the .ico from the photo viewing app entirely but I don't know how to get it back. Thank you.</p>

<p>&nbsp; That isn't possible.&nbsp; System Restore points are replaced by newer ones over time, the number maintained depends on your settings.&nbsp; Note also, that system restore becomes problematic when very old restore points are used.&nbsp; SR is intended for emergency repair,
 not for long term usage. It's disturbing if it was an MS tech who misinformed you.

<h2>            Recorded Skype calls won&#39;t save the data when downloaded</h2>
                    I am trying to record skype calls for a podcast. The recording feature worked beautifully, but when my partners and I saved the chat and tried to download it, the downloaded file came up as taking up 0 KB of storage and hence wouldn't load when we attempted
 to open it. Can anyone help me recover this file before it deletes?

<h2>            Problem with C&#58;&#92;WINDOWS&#92;System32&#92;Logfiles&#92;Srt&#92;SrtTrail.txt</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought a new video card hardware last week (a GeForce GTX 1070) and today, after arrived by mail, i decided to install. I have some experience in hardware, so, before I install the new video card, I used DDU to uninstall the old drivers. I entered in safe
 mode and used all the recommend options (except one, I decided to uninstall Nvidia's paste). Well, after that, I removed the old video board, installed the new one and I restarted my computer. So far everything was in order, then I putted in the CD driver
 and I installed all the video card drivers. After that, I decided to restart the computer... and the problem began. I received a message that there war a problem with the
<strong>C:\WINDOWS\System32\Logfiles\Srt\SrtTrail.txt</strong>. I tried to use the repair tool, but it didn't work. Now I trying to use the chkdsk to repair, but i've done some research in the internet, and I noticed that most people who try this don't get
 what it need. I have a reboot pendrive with win 10, but i want to use it as my last option. So, microsoft, any ideia what I can do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks! And sorry for my english!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Lenovo g505 laptop and i left it to download the new windows update.When i woke up i saw a message in front of the Lenovo loading screen saying windows couldn't finish the installation. It's still stuck on the loading screen and i can't fix it.<br />
</p>
<p>One time i was in safe mode and there were a couple of options to cope with this problem. Long story short i couldn't log in to my microsoft account to go back to the previous version and i restarted it. Windows started fixing my hard drive but then it restarted
 and the same message popped up.<br />
I would really appreciate if you could help me out cause i have little computer knowledge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>*I couldn't log in my account so i changed password and still couldn't log on. The router&nbsp; my laptop always connects to was turned off but i dont think thats a problem.</p>

            First you will need to force your machine to get into the recovery screen.
<br />To do this boot up and wait for the blue windows screen with the spinning circle, when you see that press and hold power button to shut down.
<br />Boot up again and do the same thing by waiting for the blue windows screen with the spinning circle then shut down, power up for the 3rd time and you should get repair screen.
<br />Let it run.
<br />You will then get a screen with the Automatic Repair, select the Advanced Options.
<br />
<br />From here I would recommend doing a reset of your PC and keep files.
<br />Make sure when doing this to NOT be connected to the internet.
<br />Wait till your machine has reset and you can log back into windows.
<br />Once you can do that then reconnect to internet.
<br />As for the updates hold off for a couple of days to do them.
<br />New ones coming out this week.

    <title>Windows 10 Creators Update&#47;Fall Creators Update Issues on MSI MB - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lettuceman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Creators Update&#47;Fall Creators Update Issues on MSI MB</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone! I have a custom built desktop computer (i7-6700K @4.5GHz CPU, GTX 970 GPU, 16GB RAM) that is currently running Windows 10 Version 1607 (the Anniversary Update). I have been perpetually unable to upgrade the device since the release of the Creators
 Update and, since its release, have also been unable to upgrade to the Fall Creators Update. When I try to update through Windows Update I get the "We found some issues" message but the system is unable to resolve the issues. I have also tried to update directly
 through the Media Creation Tool and the ISO images and every time I get a "This PC cannot run Windows 10" error. Most recently I have been trying to use the Upgrade Assistant, but that still gives me a "Something went wrong error" and an error code 0xc1900201.
 I have contacted Microsoft Support a few times about the issue. The first time they told me that MSI (my computer runs on an MSI motherboard) had not released compatibility support for the Creators Update and that is why I was getting the errors I was getting.
 They sent me the following link: https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/check-this-list-to-determine-if-your-computer-is/5152bb37-f95d-48a6-b7b2-ad0d5c738923 , a list of manufacturers that have released support for the
 update and told me that MSI would be supporting the Creators Update soon. The list has changed since that time, and has also since been updated to include the manufacturers that support the Fall Creators Update, however MSI has yet to be included in that list.
 However, MSI's support page (linked here:&nbsp;https://us.msi.com/support) has since been updated with the message "All Windows 10 OEM devices support the update to Windows 10 Creators Update", yet I have still been unsuccessful in upgrading to that version. Recently,
 the Upgrade Assistant has been popping up on my screen a lot trying to upgrade my system to the latest version but has been unsuccessful. Every time I open it it tells me my computer is compatible with the update and actually starts installing it but, when
 the install gets to about 71-73% it gives me the "Something went wrong" message and an error code. I did some research into this error code (0xc1900201) and found out that it may mean the system partition in my hard drive is too small or too full to install
 the update, however, I have been unable to find a successful way to expand or clear out the junk data in this partition. I contacted Microsoft Support again about this issue and they were also unable to get either update to install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I guess I have a couple questions. Firstly, should I trust the MSI support page or the Microsoft list on whether my computer is even compatible with the update? Has anyone else with MSI-based machines had issues with either of these updates? And if it
 is compatible, and the issue is my system partition, how can I free up the space necessary for the upgrade? Or is there another solution that I haven't found? Please let me know if you know anything about this. Thank you!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are various reasons why you aren't able to upgrade your computer. This could be due to issues on the system partition, motherboard compatibility, and an outdated BIOS firmware. Now, since you already tried updating your PC using the media creation
 tool and you're still not able to get through with it, then we suggest that you update the BIOS firmware of your computer. We also recommend that you contact the motherboard manufacturer for further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            I applied a BIOS update to my motherboard but still received the same error. I contacted MSI about it and they did not know of any other solutions besides the ones I had already tried. Please let me know if there is any other way I can fix this.

<p>Since you already updated the BIOS firmware of your PC, but it still the same, you can try a clean installation of Windows 10 Fall Creators Update. Backup your files before performing the suggested step. For the detailed procedure on how to perform a clean
 installation of Windows 10, please refer to this article: <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/clean-install-windows-10/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">
Clean Install Windows 10.</a></p>

<p>A very similar situation to the above by LettuceMan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a MSI X58 Pro-E (MS-7522 ver 3.1) Motherboard with an Intel Core i7 950 @3.07Ghz processor 16 GB DDR3 RAM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is currently running Windows 10 ver 1607 (Build 14393) and has been attempting for weeks to update to Windows 10 ver 1709 (Fall Creator) and in the process using up my limited available ADSL band width and making the machine almost unusable when so doing.
 I finally downloaded an ISO file of the later version, but all I get at the end is Windows 10 failed to update. Switching off all virus and malware software and unplugging all USB peripherals as suggested by some has not helped. Still only the advice of&nbsp;Windows
 10 failed to update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In desperation I directly contacted MicroSoft and allowed one of their technicians to remotely take over my machine. He finally advised that my BIOS was out dated and needed to be upgraded. This was duly done - on the MSI web site from AMI V8.14 (2010) to
 V 8.15 (2011). Again it has not helped!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Checking on the MSI website via&nbsp;https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/check-this-list-to-determine-if-your-computer-is/5152bb37-f95d-48a6-b7b2-ad0d5c738923 gives a whole host of Windows 10 compatible motherboards but
 these are more recent and there is no&nbsp;MSI X58 Pro-E.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the intention in providing ongoing upgrades to Windows 10 to upgrade until such time as the hardware is totally outdated and must be replaced? I doubt it, but Microsoft should ensure when this wall is reached, that there is a provision for the automatic
 update process to be switched off, either manually or by using AI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Come on MicroSoft, listen to your clients out there!&nbsp; Can MicroSoft please give a response? I assume they monitor these "answers"!</p>

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We need to do further investigation so that we can identify the cause of the issue. What exactly is the error message and code when you try updating Windows 10 automatically and not through the ISO file? Is it the same as the original poster's error code?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your response.</p>

 a while, I saw that it fails after the second reboot, after maybe 40% completion,&nbsp;when it decides to rollback by itself without any explaination.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that this is not a brand new computer and there's much more powerful comps out there but it's plenty powerful for my needs! I don't NEED to replace it! Why does it always failing???</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know why it could not be supported since I have another computer with a Core 2 Duo that is much older than this and on this one, Fall Creators is installing flawlesly!</p>

            Hi Athon,<br />
<br />
Insufficient storage space during the update is one of the possible reasons why this issue is happening. We'd like to verify how many storage spaces left on your hard drive.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, we suggest using the<strong> Windows Update Assistant </strong>to help upgrade your device. Click this
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>, then click
<strong>Update now </strong>to use the assistant. If you encounter any error messages, we'd like to know what is the error message to help identify the cause of the issue.<br />
<br />
We'll keep an eye out for your response.
        </p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>I have plenty of space left. There's 320Gb free on my system drive. I've also already tried the assistant many times. No use. I've looked at the event viewer too. Nothing. I tried to check the update log. No interesting info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing I could have thinked is that my onboard storage controller was already a problem when I made the upgrade to Windows 10. It's an Intel ICH10R.&nbsp;I had a hard time finding the right driver.&nbsp;I was using a RAID1 array for my system drive. So this
 one was ok when I upgraded. Since&nbsp;I was using a&nbsp;RAID5 array for my data drive, I had to install a PCI express RAID SATA controller, a PERC H310, to make it work again. The onboard RAID was causing many errors.&nbsp;I achieved to get a working Window 10 driver for
 the&nbsp;H310&nbsp;to make it work. All was going well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe that's the problem. But how can I get past this one? I need my RAID arrays, at least for the moment. I'm not ready to upgrade to an SSD or whatever. I just don't understand why I can't upgrade to the next update.</p>

            Thanks for the information. We recommend temporarily disabling the RAID setup when upgrading to see if it helps complete the installation.

Keep us in the loop with the result.

            Thanks for all your responses! I ended up being able to resolve the issue by doing a reset of my computer. Not a factory reset, I was actually able to keep all my data, but after I reset the computer it updated no problem. I'm still assuming it was the
 limited space left in the system partition (it cleared out when I did the system reset) but I'm happy that that was all it took to fix the problem. Hopefully Microsoft or MSI will be able to issue a fix for this issue in the near future!

Think Video drivers mainly though it can be others. See the driver section in my generic
<br />
bluescreen troubleshooting methods below. BIOS, low level chipset drivers and <br />
antivirus/antispyway/security programs can also cause this. Check the troubleshooter and
<br />
when you get to the driver and memory testing sections refer to the generic methods in next<br />
message and then return to the troubleshooter if needed.<br />

<br />
<strong>Bug Check 0xD1: DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL <br />
<br />
</strong>The DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL bug check has a value of 0x000000D1. This indicates that a kernel-mode driver attempted to access pageable memory at a process IRQL that was too high.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Important Info If You Have Received a STOP Code</strong> </p>
<p><br />
If you received a blue screen error, or stop code, the computer has shut down abruptly to protect itself from data loss. A hardware device, its driver, or related software might have caused this error. If your copy of Windows came with your computer, call the
 manufacturer of your computer. If you purchased Windows separately from your computer, Microsoft provides support. To find contact info for Microsoft or your computer manufacturer,
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183644" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contact Support</a>.</p>
<p><br />
If you have experience with computers and want to try to recover from this error, follow the steps provided in the Microsoft article
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183646" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Resolving STOP (Blue Screen) Errors in Windows</a>.
<br />
<br />
These actions might prevent an error like this from happening again:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and install updates and device drivers for your computer from Windows Update.
</li><li>Scan your computer for computer viruses. </li><li>Check your hard disk for errors.</li></ol>
<p><strong>DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL Parameters</strong> </p>
<p><br />
The following parameters are displayed on the blue screen. <br />

<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff560244(v=VS.85).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff560244(v=VS.85).aspx</a>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p><br />
A driver tried to access an address that is pageable (or that is completely invalid) while the IRQL was too high.</p>
<p><br />
This bug check is usually caused by drivers that have used improper addresses.</p>
<p><br />
If the first parameter has the same value as the fourth parameter, and the third parameter indicates an execute operation, this bug check was likely caused by a driver that was trying to execute code when the code itself was paged out. Possible causes for the
 page fault include the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The function was marked as pageable and was running at an elevated IRQL (which includes obtaining a lock).</p>
</li><li>
<p>The function call was made to a function in another driver, and that driver was unloaded.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The function was called by using a function pointer that was an invalid pointer.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p><br />
To begin debugging, use a kernel debugger to get a stack trace. <br />
<br />
If the problem is caused by the driver that you are developing, make sure that the function that was executing at the time of the bug check is not marked as pageable or does not call any other inline functions that could be paged out.

Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen<br />
info that would help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other<br />
error information such as STOP codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />
<br />
As examples :<br />

BCP2: 8C013D80<br />
BCP3: 00000000<br />
BCP4: 00000002</p>
<p>or in this format :</p>
<p>Stop: 0x00000000 (oxoooooooo oxoooooooo oxooooooooo oxoooooooo)<br />

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi,<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : Run DriverView - set VIEW
<br />
to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their names. (Also update
<br />
the BIOS and&nbsp;chipset drivers.)<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a>

Installing and updating drivers in 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above is preferred<br />
to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually<br />
be older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it)<br />
and then go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

<p>=========================================<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show<br />
a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

    <title>Windows 10 - Handwriting panel - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> unbiddenheart21  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 - Handwriting panel</h2>
                    <p>Dear Microsoft,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I have a Surface Pro with Windows 10 (quite new - from Jan 2017).</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I mostly use it to write notes using the pen - some months ago, the Handwritting Panel started to pop up everytime I am writting something (in tablet mode). This is undesirable as it covers the text which I need to refer to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I've contacted a couple of times Microsoft support and got always good support. Now, the solution seems to be to disable the Touch Keyboard service. The service seems to be re-activated after upgrades (at least this is what I experienced). Moreover,
 that does not seem to be a very elegant manner to disable the Handwritting Panel. I must say I am extremely satisfied with my Surface Pro but this handwritting feature is quite negative for such a great device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Question: Is there any plans by Microsoft to have an option to disable the Handwriting Panel ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks and Regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<h2>            System registry is corrupted.</h2>
                    <p>Chave Lafave, 16yold,</p>
<p>My computer has just recently not been able to boot into safe mode or normal mode. It runs auto repair but just goes to the blue screen with the advanced options with trouble shooting. I have tried manualy copying and pasting the system registry files using
 &gt;copy c:\windows\system32\config\regback* c:\wndows\system32\config and also used &gt;copy c:\windows\system32\system system.old and so on and so forth. Ihave run sfc and it says Windows Resource Protection could not perform the requested operation . but the
 sfc scan goes through 100%. I disabled auto repair using bcdedit /set {default} recoveryenabled No so now when i boot it telles me that the problem is in the directory windows\system32\config\system and it shows me the error for it witch is 0xc0000225 and
 ive looked it up and its all said to run sfc /scannow but it has not worked(as said above) and the error also says the operating system couldnt be loaded because the system registry file is missing or contains errors. And i have aslso tried bootrec.exe /rebuildbcd,
 bootrec.exe /fixmbr, and bootrec.exe /fixboot. Any help would be very well apreciated.</p>

            The last thing i did was install a steam game called smite. It was installing Direct X and then that crashed and the game wouldnt boot. Then my windows itself said i needed to update my netframe network. Or something along that line. Then i couldnt connect
 to my wifi i wasnt getting internet acces like i was litteraly seconds before. But i was conected to the router. Then i restarted and i couldnt boot at all. I get the following in my advanced options tab. (System Restore, System Image Recovery, Automatic Repair,
 Comand Prompt, and Startup Settings)

            <p>We suggest try to turn off the computer on its tower and turn it back on after 5-10 seconds. If you still get the same windows screen of Advanced options you can choose
<strong>Startup Settings &gt; Restart &gt; </strong>and <strong>select F5 </strong>to<strong> Enable Safe Mode with Networking</strong>. Make sure that you are currently connected on a network connection. Let us know if you can boot the computer in safe mode. This
 will help us try if you c an still boot the computer in desktop. Safe mode will only run the computer in a basic state having a limited set of files and drivers.</p>

                    <p>I am using the Lenovo Z70, no touch screen, after traveling 6 hours, I turned on my laptop, and connected my Arc Touch mouse. &nbsp;I got up after 5 minutes, to go eat, my mouse would no longer work when I came back. I replaced the batterys&nbsp;twice, and now it
 will not reconnect, the sync button on it usually makes the light blink on and off, but it will not do that. I looked in the Device Manager, and it gave me this error on Bluetooth LE Device:</p>

            <p>this &nbsp;same thing happened to me but with the intel trusted execution interface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so my system randomly turned itself off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I fixed it by reinstalling 8.1, which is quite sad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried reinstalling drivers, OS and new drivers from the manufacturer but neither did the trick. I guess all that covered the steps in the KB article.</p>

            .NET 3.x is "built on top of" 2.0. &nbsp;So, if you have programs that make use of the 3.x features, you would want to keep both the 2.0 and 3.x versions of the framework installed. &nbsp;Safest bet would probably be to leave things as is. &nbsp;Are you pressed for disk
 space, that you are looking to remove some of these items?

            Not sure what you mean about hoping I am okay with frogs, BulldogXX, but my Windows 10 is already at 100% by default. When I try to decrease it,&nbsp;the next option&nbsp;is 75%, which makes it too small. I need somewhere in between 75% and 100%.

            <p>Hey, everybody, just reporting back on my prior dilemma which brought me to this thread seeking answers. I happened to discover a "fix" on my own, which is nothing short of a miracle (devilish grin). Should anyone else out there have this problem, here are
 the steps to what worked for me:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Control Panel -&gt; Display -&gt; Screen Resolution -&gt; found it was set on the "recommended" resolution of 1024 x 768 -&gt; changed it to 1280 x 1024. Once the changed resolution was saved, my browser page snuggled into the size of my 19" monitor. &nbsp;YEA!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this might be of help to others. Do want to thank you, BulldogXX, for responding to my inquiries.</p>

            Well, I don't know what to say, BulldogXX, making a change in the resolution took care of the problem and there is no fuzziness or pixel problem displayed at all. I will say this, not sure it has anything to do with anything, but I did not go into anything
 that pointed to or referred to as being for video(s). I only messed with the resolution of my monitor screen display. &nbsp;Not sure, but this CP tower originally had Windows 7 and was upgraded to Windows 10 - perhaps that "recommended" resolution was left over
 from Windows 7. &nbsp;All I know is that I no longer have the problem which caused me to come to this forum seeking help: my Windows 10 browser now fits perfectly inside my 19"monitor.

            Well, there you go....that was the reason for my problem.&nbsp; Once, I changed the resolution to 1280 x 1024, the problem was solved. The "miracle" I was referring to was that I&nbsp;found that section of the control panel on my own, didn't have a clue as to what
 the resolution was supposed to be, but saw which one was checked. Then I wondered what would happen if I tried one of the other sets of numbers; so, I clicked on the next highest set of numbers, which was the 1280 x 1024....so, the miracle was that I stumbled
 on the answer myself. Being a grandmother, I am not very computer literate at all, certainly do not have your expertise; so, I am quite proud of myself for being brave enough to click something else on&nbsp;just to see what happens. Making changes to the computer
 scares the **** out of me as I don't know what I am doing&nbsp;on it&nbsp;most of the time. Hope this clarifies everything.

            <p>It is good that you resolved your problem by modifying your display resolution to better fit your monitor. That is better for everything including preventing pixelization.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However for others reading this question about Edge, the problem is likely not your Windows desktop resolution.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Edge there is a&nbsp;'...'&nbsp;(More) toolbar icon&nbsp;on the far right. On its submenu is a Zoom setting.&nbsp; This allows you to set the bowser to fit the
 web pages better&nbsp;by default.&nbsp; On a small high res monitor (like a Microsoft Surface) that is 1920 X 1080, you may want it at 150%.&nbsp; But on yours, 100% is likely what you want.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that if you have a touch screen you can re-size the web page content using your fingers. But the zoom setting above is the minimum it will stay at when you let go. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>The WMP library works in mysterious ways and does cause confusion - it took me a while to get the hang of it. WMP takes the info from the 'properties' 'details' title rather than the file title, so I'm guessing this is what you need to alter.</p>
<p>Open the file in the wmp library pane - right click and select 'open file location' then right-click again and look at the properties 'details' tab to see how it is named there.</p>
<p>You can actually rename the track in wmp (best place to do it - it won't mess up your library) hover over the title, right click again and choose edit there - the title can now be altered.</p>
<p>Let us know how it goes - R</p>

<p>Hi Gargoyle,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are several factors that may cause your drives to over work that results to 100% disk usage. It could be caused by one of the services that is currently running or could be that your computer is infected with malware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to identify what might be causing this and how this can be addressed, please check out the following suggestions:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Disable Windows Search</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong> and select <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.</li><li>In the command prompt window, type in the command below and hit <strong>Enter</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>net.exe stop Windows search</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Check if the performance has improved and the disk usage has lowered down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Disable Superfetch Service</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong> and select <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.</li><li>In the command prompt window, type in the command below and hit <strong>Enter</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>net.exe stop superfetch</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Check if the performance has improved and the disk usage has lowered down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Scan for viruses and malwares</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please see these links for the steps:</p>

<p>
</p><p>It gives me in response:</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\WINDOWS\system32&gt;net.exe stop superfetch<br />

More help is available by typing NET HELPMSG 3521.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run personally Windows defender every few weeks, it is scheduled to run twice a week on its own in the background and I have performed several Offline scans these past weeks. Never the less I'm gonna run another offline scan after this post exhausts it's
 resources.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- To Edit - I'm gonna restart and see if that command fixed it. (the Offline Scans where done in my other computer which has Windows 10, not in the one in question, which is Windows 8.1)</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I restarted, and Disk is has been at 100% for the past 15 minutes.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What can I do next if you are so kind?</strong></p>

<p>Thanks for the feedback, Gargoyle. To answer your question about Windows Defender, yes, you can perform a scan while your computer is not connected to the internet. By the way, can we ask for a screenshot of your
<strong>Task Manager &gt; Processes</strong>. We would like to compare the results with what is shown on the performance monitor that you've used.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please verify also if you have <em>svchost.exe</em> on your Task Manager. If you do, disable it and see if it has improved your computer's performance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also perform a clean boot to help us determine what conflict is causing the problem. Check out the link,&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to perform
 a clean boot in Windows</a> and follow the steps intended for Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your reply.</p>

</p><p>&nbsp;Hi&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(0, 93, 166, 1)">Vanessa!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for your detailed response.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As soon as I have time, will do those and post them in here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The link you gave me about how to do an offline scan with Windows Defender, was outdated, as I followed the steps, and it was not there at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They may have moved it to another part of settings, but I spent 30 minutes and couldn't find it in windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should I do when I perform the clean boot?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your responses as they are very helpful!</p>

<p>Hi. Windows Defender may not be turned on that's why you're unable to find it. To verify this, follow these steps to check whether Windows Defender is enabled or not and how to enable it in case it's off:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key + Q</strong> to launch search.</li><li>Type in <em>defender </em>and click <strong>Windows Defender </strong>from the search results to launch the program.</li><li>If the program is already turned on, then you can easily edit the security settings.</li><li>If it's off, launch the search window again and type in action, then select <strong>
Action Center</strong> from the search results.</li><li>In the <em>Action Center</em>, look for <em>Windows Defender</em> and have it enabled or turned on.</li><li>Once done, you should now be able to launch and perform scan using Windows Defender.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>With regard to performing a clean boot, make sure you check the box for Hide all Microsoft services before you disable all other services. This steps is available under
<strong>How to perform a clean boot &gt; Windows 8.1 and Windows 8</strong> on the link provided above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to let us know if you need further information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>Thanks&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(0, 103, 184, 1)">Vanessa Yar</span>&nbsp;that's very helpful advice, and I thank you for that!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will proceed with the steps mentioned in this post, later on, as in this moment I'm working overtime. The first step you commented, the command line, indeed worked, but it did not fixed the issue in its entirely. But it did help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As soon as I am able to have some free time, I'll post my results here so if others have the same issue it can help them. It won't take more than two weeks I hope.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Performing a clean boot may be too time consuming, as I use Ableton, and I have downloaded from official sites literally hundreds close to thousands of programs (which I will have to download and activate again, look for the passwords, do all the steps required
 for an installation, etc), which run when they are prompted, and stuff like Blender, that has a strict file system, and that with a minor change It would be unable to open projects and find files, but I'll study that option as it may be healthy for my computer!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many Thanks! I'll post the results as soon as I follow those recommendations!&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Please bring back the ability to create Skype usernames.</h2>
                    The current system is awful. My "username" is awful as its part of an email I no longer use. It doesn't help that it's this long phrase of "account live:" and the name will have an underscore and then a random number after it. Please give us the ability
 to create usernames again. If I can have a gamertag for my Microsoft account then I should be able to have a username for my Skype account.

<div><br />
<div>1. Download CCleaner <a href="http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>, install it and open it and click run cleaner.</div>
<div>2. Delete everything in the C:\Users\(yourname)\Downloads if any.</div>
<div>3. Start&gt;All Programs&gt;Accessories&gt;System Tools&gt;Disk Cleaner</div>
<div>4. Consider upgrading your hard drive.</div>
<div>5. Scan for viruses as they can fill in the hard disk free space.</div>
<div>6. Uninstall any useless programs.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The Dotnetfx3.5.exe can be safely deleted. DON'T DELETE all .exe files or it will mess up your Windows.</div>

            Hello Tony,<br />
<br />
<strong>Chkdsk</strong> is a utility that checks the integrity of the files and file structure of your hard disk. This will run on boot if the system has detected problems with your hard disk. Since you are getting errors, we suggest that you boot your computer
 in <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17419/windows-7-advanced-startup-options-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">safe mode</a></strong> and run chkdsk again. This will start your system with a minimal set of drivers that should
 help us run this task.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you will need further assistance.

If your soul levels are fine, <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/networking/nat-error-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">double check that you each have open NATs</a> because incompatible NAT could prevent you from joining each other. If that all looks correct and you still run into issues, you'll want to reach out to <a href="http://www.fromsoftware.jp/pc_en/contact/contact_darksouls.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">FromSoftware</a> for further support with the game itself. </p><p><br /></p><p>Good luck! :)</p><p>
