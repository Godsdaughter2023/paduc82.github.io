<h2>            Benchmarks for Visual Effects</h2>
                    Is there any documentation on benchmarks for performance concerning the Visual Effects in Windows7: Let Windows choose what's best for my computer vs. Adjust for best performance?

<p>Hi</p>
<p>It depends what aspect of the Video system is important to you.</p>
<p>If you are looking for fast Gaming search for a Gaming video bench mark and optimizer.</p>
<p>Do the same for other type of Video activities.</p>

            Do you have any issues? Windows runs the WEI (Experience Index) test and based on this it selects what is best for you.

            This stops Aero and increases the CPU usage, because the CPU must now render the output like in XP. I never heard about a benchmark about this. Take on PC and install the 90day Enterprise Trial and test it. So you can see how fast it is. Do you testings
 and decide what is the best FOR YOU.

<p>Hi</p>
<p>In theory, everything that is not essential to the actual function that the computer is used for takes a little power from the system.</p>
<p>However, Windows 7 has 3-principle type of Video (GDI,D2D,OGL).</p>
<p>The real saving depends on what the computer is mainly used for, and what the specific Visual Effects are switched On, or Off.</p>
<p>As an example on a Compaq 8000 used for mundane office work like typing and using other Office application, it would not matter whether the Visual effects are On or off.</p>
<p>However, if the computer is used for 3D graphics work, Visual effects that involves 3D video might be better off switched Off.</p>
<p>It hard to give you a better focused answers when the info has to be extracted one post at the time.</p>

<h2>            Find people who blocked you.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I came on Xbox the other day and I know who I got as friends on Xbox. But the other day I came on, I instantly noticed that I lost a friend (and) follower. So I was trying to find who this person was as I'm not good with names but it's stressing me out when
 someone pretty much "blocks" me for no apparent reason.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, to ease my stress, is it possible to find out who this person I recently lost as a friend? As in can show me list of all people I or they unfriended vice verse over a certain period.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to find this person though my other friends' friends lists but no name in any of them I recognise as being on my list.</p>

                    When I purchased and installed Windows 10 in 2016 the Whole file was +- 20GB worth of space. I now would like to transfer the OS to a new 120 GB SSD that I have purchased, but am alerted that it is too small as my "system" folder requires a 440 GB drive
 to be transferred to.

            Hi Masnet
<br />
<br />No need to do that yet . . 
<br />
<br />When installing Windows onto the SSD, disconnect any other drive on your system, there is a little known problem if other drive(s) are attached during the installation process, the page file or boot configuration can end up on the wrong drive . . .
<br />
<br />So Install Windows 10 onto the SSD and then install any required device drivers
<br />
<br />Then you can re-connect that other drive and remove the Windows installation files and folder from that drive . . .       
        </p>

            Hi MasNet
<br />
<br />Your Windows folder is the correct size and you do not seem to have a lot of software installed, have you considered just clean installing Windows onto the new 120GB SSD, and re-installing your apps
<br />
<br />Can you connect that original drive to your system and use that as a data drive?
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

<p>Are you running Windows Defender. If so shut it down and re install McAfee and then put windows defender on again. Also check if it is getting past the firewall.</p>

            Thanks for the quick response.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it might be something besides McAfee.&nbsp; I turned off Windows Defender and went to uninstall McAfee to start over but McAfee doesn't even show up as an installed application (though it was installed originally
 when my wife bought the computer).&nbsp; I reset the PC using the option the keep personal files and it still won't boot past the HP logo.&nbsp; Could be a registry setting perhaps? Thanks again.

            best bet is debris of security software left behind if you can still re install mcafee then backup and do a clean install of windows a custom install reverts to a clean computer and then install mcAfee and other compatible software you previously backed
 up good luck.

<h2>            Windows 8.1 How to type-and-display-accents-and-diacritical-marks&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a pc with Windows 7 and a laptop with Windows 7, both are able to type the accent marks, etc. necessary for typing in Spanish for my homework and notes by switching to a Spanish keyboard and using the right hand Alt key.</p>
<p>I have a new laptop with Windows 8.1 and have downloaded the language package and selected a number of Spanish keyboards. &nbsp;But even when a Spanish keyboard is selected and typing anything in English is underlined with red because it is recognized as misspelled
 in Spanish, I cannot type the necessary accent marks.</p>
<p>I have tried calling Microsoft help, I have gone everywhere on the college campus trying to get help, I have done several Chats with Microsoft and all anyone will do is repeat how to download the language pack and select a Spanish keyboard.</p>
<p>It has been two months now, the semester is almost over, and I STILL cannot type in Spanish on the new laptop.</p>
<p>Every search for what key to use is OLD information on previous versions of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>
<p>What key is used to create accent marks in Windows 8.1?</p>
<p>And if I upgrade to Windows 10?</p>
<p>The majority of the time, I type in English. &nbsp;I just need to use a Spanish keyboard to do my homework.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>I finally figured it out myself.</p>
<p>For Windows 8.1 using the Spanish (Mexico) keyboard:</p>
<p>The ; key will give you the - ñ</p>
<p>The ' key will give you the áéíóú accent marks if you type the ' key before each vowel key.</p>
<p>The \ key will give you the ç</p>
<p>The = key will give you the ¡</p>
<p>Haven't figured out how to get the inverted ? yet.</p>

<h2>            XP SP3 - Clean install - Corrupt PnP Sofware Device enumerator</h2>
                    
<p>Having had the automatic update of SP3 create a problem with my Realtek AC'97 onboard sound device, as well as my two optical drives, I did some digging on the internet and have ascertained that the problem seems to arrise as a result of some form of corruption
 with the Plug and Play Software Device Enumerator.<br />
<br />
I have followed the advice on certain sites regarding attempting to reinstall the PnP enumerator via an edit of the machine.ini file and editing the registry to remove any keys which may contain corrupt references to the swenum.sys file, to no avail.<br />
<br />
I have since attempted to do&nbsp;a clean reinstall twice. On the first occasion I installed SP2 from the automatic update and the problem returned. On the second&nbsp;occasion I went straight to an SP3 install directly from a downloaded .exe file as opposed to doing
 it via automatic updates. As soon as SP3 in installed the problem returned. As you can problably imagine, I'm not the happiest of bunnies at the moment, having spent a significant&nbsp;ammount of time&nbsp;trying to rectify the problem!<br />
<br />
Can someone help me please?</p>

    <title>Wifi very slow on new windows 10 PC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danfer91  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wifi very slow on new windows 10 PC</h2>
                    <p>Got a new PC a few days ago and the wifi is absolutely atrocious, running around 1-2 Mbps download speed. I've tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Running the troubleshooter which doesn't find anything.</p>
<p>- Flushing the DNS</p>
<p>- Completely reinstalling windows</p>
<p>- disabling tcp/ip v6</p>
<p>- Installing the new drivers from the intel website for my wireless adapter and chipset.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Completely updating windows</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I've looked through multiple things online that are supposed to help with this issue to no avail. The internet worked fine for about 24 hours after I reinstalled windows then went back to being incredibly slow. This is a brand new computer and there are
 no other issues with connectivity on my phone or laptop.&nbsp; Does anyone have any other ideas? I really don't want to have to return this computer and this whole process has really turned me off to Windows.&nbsp;<br />

            Hi Dan.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I'll give you everything else possible to try in order of priority so that hopefully something works: 
<br />
<br />Which network icon is showing in System Tray:  the Wireless waves or Ethernet TV with plug?  Left click to see if any Networks show up to sign into.  
<br />
<br />If not right click the network icon in System Tray at bottom right end of task bar to Troubleshoot Problems.  
<br />
<br />Check that the wireless button on a laptop is toggled on.  It may be a Function (Fn) key or it may be an actual switch on the side.
<br />
<br />Try powering off modem, router and PC and then restarting in that order with 1 minute in between each.
<br />
<br />Try all of these steps:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/how-to-reset-network-settings-to-default-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.kapilarya.com/how-to-reset-network-...</a>
<br />
<br />Update your network adapter drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page using the full model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If you have the latest network driver then try on it's Driver tab also to Roll Back, or Uninstall and then restart PC to reinstall the driver.  Try also all older drivers from Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick list working backwards.
<br />
<br />Go to Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; WIfi &gt; Manage Known Networks, highlight and remove the network having problems, restart PC to see if it shows up again.  
<br />
<br />Try plugging in by ethernet cable to the router to compare, then plug the ethernet cable into the modem (if separate) to see if this might be an issue with the router.    
<br />
<br />For a new PC you're entitled to Support, Repair and replacement by the manufacturer for the first year, so I would use that to get all issues shaken out in time.  The store may still cover it for return or replacement.
<br />
<br />You also are entitled to Support from your internet provider to get online on all devices and to get the speeds you pay for.  This is always included in the monthly bill.  If your router is less than a year old they will also Support getting it connected and optimized.
<br />
<br />Another option is you could replace the wireless adapter with an inexpensive USB nano adapter like this one:  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df_B06XSFPDFX5388318/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;creative=394997&amp;creativeASIN=B06XSFPDFX&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=198076677096&amp;hvpos=1o1&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=17389337054377542194&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9012017&amp;hvtargid=pla-373873511931" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df...</a>
<br />
<br />Or you can use an Ethernet cable as necessary which should connect automatically.  
<br /> 
<br /> if this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Version 1809 Update, if it's too late to roll it back  I can help you shrink C by about 50gb in Disk mgmt to do a test Install to the shrink space, which will configure a Dual Boot you can sign into to set up to see if the problem goes away.  If so I'll then help you move into the new install and eventually delete the old one and recover its space.  Steps here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

            I gave you a list of everything possible that works for 90% of cases I handle here by the thousands for this.  In less than 6 minutes you reported back that over a dozen steps didn't work.  That's not even enough time to try one or two steps.  Did you want help?

<p>Most of your suggestions I've already tried. Said already that I've tried updating drivers and updating windows. I've already also said that I completely reinstalled windows and the problem persisted after getting better for about 24 hours. I've been on
 the internet the last 3 days trying everything that I could find, the issue I'm having isn't 90% of cases so yes I reported back a clear copy paste job as unhelpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just tried the network reset again (which I had tried before I originally "fixed' it) and that didn't work either.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Actually scratch that, I just read your reply more thoroughly, I've literally tried every single one of those fixes. Some of them also don't have anything to do with my problem. Not trying to be a jerk man seriously, but it's a little frustrating when I
 say in my post that I completely reinstalled windows and one of the first things in your post is "did you restart your modem?".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand you probably help a lot of people with that copy-paste and I'm glad there's people like you out there that are helping out people with these problems en-masse but this really isn't 90% of issues. This is a brand new PC, I wasn't getting any
 internet when I first booted it up, tried all these steps, finally reinstalled windows, it fixed the problem for about 24 hours, then suddenly my internet dropped off massively. Then I tried all these steps again, and it still hasn't worked. I'm still getting
 a little bit of a connection now, but like I said it's about 1-2 Mbps when it should be 25-30.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess I could reinstall windows again, but I don't want it to just go back to being terrible again in 24 hours, I really need to fix the underlying issue here. The weird part is that it was working fine up until about 8 hours ago when it suddenly dropped
 off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, any of the steps involving plugging in an ethernet cable aren't an option so I didn't try any of those. But again, the issue is clearly with the computer and not my actual internet since my laptops internet is working fine.&nbsp;</p>

            I said I was going to give you everything possible, not edit out things you hinted or didn't even tell me that you'd tried.  
<br />
<br />I also have no idea what kind of install you've done.  I could have given you the link to my Clean install which has been done by millions over the past ten years without a single complaint or return problem by anyone who follows the steps.   But then you would have complained that you already told me you did a Clean install even though no other Clean install comes close to this, no shop, no amount of money you can spend.
<br />
<br />And if I left out the most basic step like restarting the modem, then the 500 people who were helped by that step alone wouldn't have gotten their wifi fixed.  So there's really no pleasing some people.  It's a shame because as I say below I will not quit for those who cooperate and can bring all the resources needed to fix any problem.  No one else fixes more on the web than I do.  But those who can't be nice won't get any help from anyone because of the toxicity.

            Fair enough, and like I said, I'm sure you help a ton of people with that and it's certainly efficient. Apologies for being a jerk, wasn't my intention I'm just genuinely frustrated at having paid 1200 dollars for a new PC that I also waited a month to
 receive that I may not be able to use. Certainly didn't mean to take it out on you but I'm sure you're well aware how frustrating computer problems can be. All the best.&nbsp;

            Two other things reading back over the thread again:
<br />
<br />1)  You said it's a new PC.  This means the manufacturer must make it right under Warranty with Support, Repair or Replacement within the next year, and it may still even be under store return policy.
<br />
<br />There's a chance it's a known issue.  So since you've tried every possible thing I'd put it on them to fix it.  But you really have got to be nice, because that's all they respond to.  Support people just move on to the next customer if they are not treated decently.  So I really try to engage them positively and if I still don't get the help I need, politely bow out and then call back.
<br />
<br />2) Since you did mention you might try the reinstall again, here's the gold standard Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />Take your time installing each group of Updates, each app and program and every other change to observe closely performance to try to isolate what might be causing the problem.  
<br />
<br />If you want to go over the install you have first then go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.

<p>Sorry for your predicament. I'd be upset too at that cost &amp; bother.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(1) This may be overly simplistic. But have you tried moving the computer closer to the router or vice versa? If that is a cure, then Greg's suggestion to contact your ISP may be the good one. They may have a device that boosts the signal. Also, if like
 Verizon, the ISP's site has a way to switch the router to a faster channel &amp; an optimizer to download for the NET connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(2) What is the computer model?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(a) Its site may have a driver for Wi-Fi that is tailor made &amp; more suitable than the one you got from the Wi-Fi manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(b) Also, there must be an Owner's Manual at the site. It may be (theoretically) easy to get at the Wi-Fi card. Then, un/re-plug its little wire antenna &amp; un/re-plug the card from its slot. Looks easy enough in my own manual anyhow.</p>

    <title>System freeze with Event 7009 - timeout - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            System freeze with Event 7009 - timeout</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>

<p><strong>Basic Spec - AMD Phenom™ II X4 820 Quad-Core processor, 4G DDR3, HD 5670, 1TB Caviar Green HD, running</strong><strong>Windows 7 home premium 64 bit, MSE (AV).</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Every so often, and it can happen after a few days or even weeks, my PC will 'freeze' for 30 secs. This is accompanied by an event report:</strong></p>
</span>



<p><strong>example:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Event 7009, Source = Service Control Manager, "A timeout was reached (30000 milliseconds) while waiting for the Windows Error Reporting Service service to connect."</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Event has reported other services such as 'Steam Client Service'</strong></p>


Once it froze for about 20 secs, but no event report was produced.
<p>When this freeze happens, you can move the mouse and click but nothing happens. Once the freeze has timed-out all the click actions occur, i.e. if you clicked to close a window and open the menu, which was ignored at the time, this now happens.</p>
<p>The PC will then work normally for days even weeks and then it will happen again. In my case its usually soon after booting up.</p>
<p>A friend has the same make/model of PC and its happened on that PC as well.</p>
<p>If you click the help in the event report, it seems to suggest using RegEdit to change the timeout value, but I dont see how this will fix anything other than make the PC wait for a longer or shorter time. If Ive understood that correctly, isnt making the
 time out shorter just 'masking' the problem but making it less annoying I guess?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas please?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apologies if this question is in the wrong section 'performance and maintenance'</p>
<p>This is an advert to the PC spec etc for full details - http://www.aldi.medion.com/md8855/uk/ (it seems mainly to be a good PC).</p>

<p><span>Hi George_222,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps listed below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Resolution to the error is to increase the service timeout period.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Service Control Manager will generate an event if a service does not&nbsp;respond within the defined timeout period (the default timeout period
 is 30000 milliseconds). To resolve this problem, use the Registry Editor to change the default timeout value for all services.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Important</span></strong><span> This section, method, or task contains steps
 that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can
 restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>How to back up and restore the registry in Windows</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756/</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To change the service timeout period:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 the&nbsp; <strong>Start</strong> button, then click <strong>Run</strong>, type <strong>
regedit</strong>, and click&nbsp; <strong>OK</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In
 the&nbsp; <strong>Registry Editor</strong>, navigate to the following registry subkey:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In
 the details pane, locate the&nbsp; <strong>ServicesPipeTimeout </strong>entry, right-click that entry and then select&nbsp;<strong>Modify</strong>.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> If the&nbsp;<strong>ServicesPipeTimeout</strong>
 entry does not exist, you must create it by selecting&nbsp;<strong>New</strong> on the
<strong>Edit</strong> menu, followed by the <strong>DWORD Value</strong>, then typing&nbsp;<strong>ServicesPipeTimeout</strong>, and clicking
<strong>Enter</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click&nbsp;<strong>Decimal</strong>,
 enter the new timeout value in milliseconds, and then click<strong>OK</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Restart
 the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>With respect to the system freezing issue, I’d suggest you to boot your computer in a clean boot state and check if the issue disappears.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Booting the computer in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. If yes, you
 may have to contact the program manufacturer for any updates or uninstall and re-install the program.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the following Microsoft KB article for more information on how to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in
 Windows 7:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> After troubleshooting, make sure to put the computer
 to start as usual as mentioned in <strong>Step 7</strong> in the above KB article.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Hope this information helps.</span></p>

<p>Gokul T,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks for that, I'll have a more detailed read later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It may take some time to fully test, as it can take a week or more before a freeze occurs sometimes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the timeout issue, is it OK to just increase the timeout? I mean (I'm not expert so please be patient :-) ) I assume its set to 30000 for a reason, and if I increase it without finding and clearing the actual reason to say 40000, then won't I just be
 waiting 40 secs with a freeze?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            Its possible you might have installed Windows 10 on a recovery partition, resulting in two installations.
<br />
<br />Are you able to boot into both installations?
<br />
<br />If so, you will need to boot into the one you want to use then delete the other and ensure you are not deleting the one with important files on the drive.

<p>Thanks Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've installed on the c disk and that should have erased all data, that's why I don't understand why it came up with this screen.<br />
The other win 10 version, if I choose that to start up with it just ends on a black screen and doesn't anything, so I have to reboot.</p>

            Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

<p>Hello Levente,</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the reasons why the bluetooth mouse keeps on appearing under the device manager is because the network keeps on installing it back in. For us to provide you the most appropriate resolution, kindly answer the questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Is your PC connected to a domain?</li><li>Are you using a Windows Server? If so, which version are you using?</li><li>Are you getting any error messages?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We'll wait for your response so we can further assist you.</p>

<p>Hi Jennifer,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for replying. This is definitely not the case. The mouse is not paired with the PC, and despite the fact, that I am trying to remove it from device manager, moreover I have deleted the mouse's registry entries, it keeps re detecting (or just redisplaying
 it) under device manager. It will not detect the mouse when the pairing button is pressed. It doesn't detect any of those devices like phones that were previously paired. It's definitely something with the bluetooth stack.<br />
I am not in a situation to reinstall the whole PC, I might just forget using BT from now on. This is very annoying in 2017....</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PC is connected to a domain, I believe there has to be a Windows Server 2012....?!? No error messages whatsoever. I can delete it, then it just reappears after searching for the new HW components.&nbsp;</p>

            I have tried everything I could, including removing the Intel software and drivers for the BT and wifi cards. It did not change anything, so I went for a reinstall. Unfortunatelly this took me more than a day to reinstall every bit.

            <p>Hi Sree, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for the post on it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It looks that you get error regarding missing csrss.exe file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me ask you a question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>• When do you get this error?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the methods given here to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: Run sfc scan. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>System File Checker gives an administrator the ability to scan all protected files to verify their
</p>
<p>versions. If System File Checker discovers that a protected file has been overwritten, it retrieves the correct version of the file from the cache folder (%Systemroot%\System32\Dllcache) or the Windows
</p>
<p>installation source files, and then replaces the incorrect file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the steps give here. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310747" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310747</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: if it prompts for the service pack CD, follow the steps from the link: You are prompted to
</p>
<p>insert a Windows XP SP2 CD when you try to run the System File Checker tool on a Windows XP SP2-based computer:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/900910" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/900910</a> (Holds good for Service pack 3)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: Perform a system restore. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This article describes how to use the System Restore tool to return your computer to a previous state. System Restore takes "snapshots" of critical system files and some program files and registry settings, and then it stores this information as restore
 points.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try restoring the computer to an earlier point and check if it helps:<br />
<br />

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this resolves your issue. Please feel free to write back to us if you face any other issue.<br />

<h2>            Windows Media Player will not allow me to add video folders to the library, nor change anything currently in the library.</h2>
                    I was trying to set up my laptop to stream media to my ps3, but when I tried to add a folder to windows media player I found my default folders are unresponsive and it does not allow me to add any new folders to the video folder. When I tried to delete
 the unresponsive folders or add a folder the player says it is updating the library but then proceeds to&nbsp;hold in this position forever. By forever I mean I let it run, went to work for 11 hours, and when I returned it was still updating the library.&nbsp;I searched
 through previous forum questions and have uninstalled and reinstalled windows media player, I have cleared my cache files, and I have run windows media player troubleshooter for both the library and settings. The troubleshooters said my library was corrupted
 and the settings were reset. After all of that nothing has changed. I am at a loss as to what to do from here. My computer originally ran Vista but I have upgraded to Windows 7 and I have Norton 360 as my anti-virus so

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you made any changes prior to the issue?</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>I would suggest you manually delete the library and restart the Windows Media player to take effect the changes and check if it helps:</p>
<p>
<span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Close Windows Media Player. 
</p>
<p>
<span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Stop the media sharing service.
</p>
<p>
<span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Go to Start; type Services.msc</p>
<p>
<span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Right-click on the “Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service” and select Stop.</p>
<p>
<span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Navigate to “c:\Users\&lt;your username&gt;\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Media Player.
</p>
<p>
<span><span>f)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Change the folder name to Media Player Old.</p>
<p>
<span><span>g)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Restart the computer and let it rebuild the library and check what happens.</p>

            I had not made any changes prior to the issue. I never even knew I had an issue until I tried to stream material. The only changes I had made was upgrading from Vista 64-Bit to Windows 7 Home Premium 64-Bit. Thanks for the suggestion. I had seen the advice
 to find the AppData folder and I searched for it before. However, I do not seem to have that folder anywhere on my computer. I've searched all over for it and I cannot seem to find it. Is that the cause of my problem? And, if I do not possess that folder,
 where can I get it from. As I've said, WMP plays the files in the library fine, I just cannot seem to add&nbsp;folders to the library.
