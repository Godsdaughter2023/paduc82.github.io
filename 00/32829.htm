<h2>            Windows 10 Upgrade - stuck</h2>
                    <p>I have been waiting for my turn to upgrade from Windows 7 to 10. &nbsp;Today I am finally able to do so. &nbsp;At some point past the 58%, my screen went dormant due to inactivity. &nbsp;Since then all I see is a blue circle with a white shape going round and round. &nbsp;I
 guess this is in lieu of the old "hour glass"showing the machine is working. &nbsp; It has been more than 5 hours and the last message I recall seeing is something along the lines of "this is taking longer than expected but should be done soon". &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone advise what to do here as I recall seeing a message not to shut down the PC until</p>
<p>this completed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you&nbsp;</p>

            <div>Hi Rascalin,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Welcome to Microsoft Community.<br />
I appreciate your interest in windows 10. I understand the inconvenience you faced. I will certainly help you with this.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I want to inform you Some PCs may need a long time to download Windows 10, depending on the quality of the internet connection, the amount of data to move and the computer’s speed.&nbsp; In some cases, it may take as long as 24 hours, so please be patient.&nbsp;
 If your hard drive is still flashing, there’s a good chance it is still making progress.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
There are a few points in particular where the progress bar may slow down significantly enough that you may believe that progress has stopped:<br />
• At the black screen with a blue circle at the 30-39% range, while Windows is downloading all dynamic updates for Windows 10<br />
• Again at 96%, when Windows is busy backing up your data<br />
• And at the message “It's taking a bit longer than usual to set up your device, but it should be ready soon”</div>
<div>If you are not able to install windows 10 by windows 10 upgrade app so&nbsp; I would suggest you to download windows 10.</div>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;For more information follow the below link:</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/the-windows-10-upgrade-appears-to-hang/a3359013-80a7-4a25-a75d-1c828e576c40"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/the-windows-10-upgrade-appears-to-hang/a3359013-80a7-4a25-a75d-1c828e576c40</span></a></p>
<div>
<p>The fastest way to get the upgrade is to download the ISO.<br />
Follow the link to download windows 10 ISO.<br />

<br />
Disclaimer:<br />
DO NOT USE THESE TO DO A CLEAN INSTALL.&nbsp; If you do you will not be able to activate it unless you have previously upgraded to win 10 and activated it.&nbsp; You then will be forced to re-install your previous OS before upgrading to win 10.</p>
<p><br />
I hope this helps.<br />
Let us know the status of the issue so that we can assist you better.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</p>

            <p>I too had this issue recently and found that I had to unplug my Brother USB printer to allow the upgrade to proceed. &nbsp;I think it may be driver related. If that doesn't work try unplugging all external devices like scanner, web cam, etc... &nbsp;Good luck.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Izza,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue happens when the proxy settings is enabled on the computer or there are missing components on the Windows Store. We can resolve this issue by performing these methods:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: </strong><strong>Checking the proxy settings.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong> and type in <strong>inetcpl.cpl</strong> and press
<strong>Enter</strong>. This will open the <strong>Internet Options</strong> window.</li><li>Under <strong>Connections</strong> tab, click on <strong>LAN settings</strong>.</li><li>Remove the check beside <strong>Use a proxy server for your LAN (These settings will not apply to dial-up or VPN connections).
</strong>and click OK.</li><li>Launch Windows Store again and check if the issue persist.</li><li>If there's no check beside <strong>Use a proxy server for your LAN</strong>, proceed to method 2.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: </strong><strong>Repair Windows Store using Powershell.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong> and type in <strong>powershell </strong>and press
<strong>Enter.</strong></li><li>Copy and paste this <strong>Get-AppxPackage | % { Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppxManifest.xml" -verbose }</strong> on Powershell and press
<strong>Enter</strong>. </li><li>Restart your device and launch Windows Store again.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if the steps above were able to resolve the issue on your Windows Store app.</p>

<p>You, me, along with many Linux users loose Skype for Linux this weekend. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On many threads Microsoft claim that they are listening, yet this skeleton Skype for Linux debacle clearly shows that Microsoft are not listening, or only listening for the answers that they want to hear, that are different to the views of a large segment
 of the Linux community; to the point that they close a forum in preference to entertain the opinion of the community, just as when Mac users were forced off the elegant and effective version 2.8 onto a Windowsesgue bloated interface that used far too much
 screen space, a very big problem for users a smaller screen laptops, or those multi-tasking whilst Skyping. &nbsp;In preference to consider the flood of requests from new forum members who were so unhappy with the new version that they sought out the forum, and
 make requests for a better more space efficient interface, the forum was closed losing years &amp; years of collective wisdom of the Skype community, a similar response here with the 'development' of the Skype for Linux replacement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the major benefits of Linux and the light resource footprint is that Linux offers acceptable computing long long long after computers pass the point where they can run a supported Microsoft operating system, it would appear that Microsoft object to
 this great benefit of Linux. &nbsp;Perhaps these developers are still in the Ballimer mindset that Linux is a cancer?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I don't think there is anything you can do, practically speaking. Skype for Linux Beta has a core of Chromium and electron, in 64 bit flavours. the WebApp guts are all 64 bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe your only option is to run Skype from the web, in an appropriate browser (even this might not work, I have not tested it).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Got to:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://web.skype.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>and see if you can login, using your normal Skype credentials. Then try to send message and call someone to see if it all works.</p>

<p>Skype for web is a skeleton version of Skype, the features that so many of us use all the time, every day, with calls dependent on these features are not included in Skype for web. &nbsp;It is like comparing a BMW car with a bicycle</p>

            I think all electron-based apps now require a 64-bit OS and 4Gb RAM minimum (if you know what I mean ;). And almost every popular messanger is based on Electron. Howewer, from https://electron.atom.io/docs/tutorial/supported-platforms/ : "T<span style="color: rgba(50, 77, 82, 1)">he

 IF we had access to the Skype 5.3 source code, many things could be done and perhaps it would be possible to recompile to work on 32-bit (not guaranteed, but something that could be looked-at). Practically speaking, however, Skype is closed. So neither you
 nor I could investigate it. It is in the realm of possibility to incorporate the ia32 binaries and test. I'm not holding my breath that Skype will go open source, nor that this would actually work, though.</span></span>Less than 20 hours to go until 4.3 is

            <p>Though windows 10 will only be released after 29th July, and anyone (even those who don't have get windows 10app ) who has a genuine version of windows 7/8 will get upgrade, I want to do it in a easy way. I've got win 7 ultimate set as dual boot (which too
 is genuine). The get windows 10 app works fine and I've reserved my free upgrade in it. It works totally fine with. Then why mess my head as I have all drivers up to date in both versions of windows. I've not reserved my free upgrade for win 7 pro but it shows
 you've reserved your fee upgrade in win update. I've been an insider in windows insider program and apperitiate the efforts put by Microsoft. But I want my computer to be up to date with both OS. Hence I sincerely request to help me in this condition.</p>

            Thanks - unfortunately that doesn't in any way explain why the Get Windows 10 application on Windows 7 Ultimate and Pro seems to have broken. Not happening on Win8.1 system. Right clicking on Taskbar Icon and selecting "Check Your Upgrade Status" (which
 admittedly should just say "Yeah, you've reserved it, now *&amp;!^ off") just shows the "Please Wait..." window. Which can remain on the screen for over 2 days.

Finally, after so many difficulties, I've finally found the way out of this problem. I had left many updates like security updates and internet explorer 11 as I knew they were completely useless and can only waste the data. I had also installed the required
 updates for get windows 10 app from external sources like seven form, etc. Recently (about four to five days ago), I updated all the updates available which clearly exhausted my data pack. But the result was amazing. The app was working, finally! I left the
 computer on for to the days with a new internet pack of 4GB. And yesterday night I got the w10 update. Now Using Windows 10. It's completely amazing

<p>I don't see that update but it's try to install at three times today and every time it's fail.</p>
<p>Why my update client try to install that update without asking me. Last time when Get Windows 10 app work, it say my Intel graphics card isn't work on Windows 10. I don't upgrade my laptop on Windows 10, if my display don't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read that if you delete some Internet explorer version it maybe help, but because i have Windows 8.1, i can't delete Windows explorer 11.</p>

    <title>The day I say goodbye to Halo, and Microsoft&#47;343 Industries&#58; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            The day I say goodbye to Halo, and Microsoft&#47;343 Industries&#58;</h2>
                    <p>This is a bit of a rant, and probably a boring one at that, so feel free to skip it. Or, at the very least, fix yourself a cup of coffee first!&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>



<p>I
 want to take you back to the year 2002, right around when I turned 
thirteen. I hadn't owned a console since the NES, and was in the market 
for something to occupy my weekend downtime. I'd been saving al my 
birthday/Christmas money all my life, and decided to drop about 900 
Australian dollars on a 51cm analogue television, an X-Box, and a single
 game. I was told "Halo" was the newest and most popular, which was all 
an impressionable thirteen-year-old like me needed to hear. </p><p><br /></p>



<p>As
 soon as I took my prize home and set it all up, I was blown away. The 
graphics in Halo were unlike anything I'd ever seen. I honestly thought 
Captain Keyes in the opening scene boar an uncanny resemblance to 
Harrison Ford, and could barely tell the difference between this 
cutscene and live action. Needless to say, these were simpler times.... 
Once immersed in the Haloverse, I was hooked. I spent every weekend [and
 many a weeknight] playing through the campaign, over and over again. I 
learnt new tricks, set myself additional objectives [i.e; save all 
marines, par times, zero deaths, etc.]  and, on rare occasion, invited a
 friend over for some splitscreen.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>



<p>In my 
early teens, I played other games too, such as Fable, Morrowind, and 
Vice City - but none of these held a candle to Halo. Not in my eyes. For
 so long, I prayed for a sequel. The phrase "I think we're just getting 
started" had echoed endlessly inside my head until, one day, the 
announcement was made: Halo 2. There were, however, delays, but I hung 
in there. I preordered the deluxe edition, which I continued to do for 
every other release, and proceeded to wait. About three weeks before the
 eventual release, one of my friends grabbed his mitts on a leaked copy.
 It was in French, but I had a few years of classes under my belt and 
couldn't hold out any longer. We had the most memorable LAN night of my 
life. Four of us in total, dual-wielding new weapons into the next 
afternoon. There were, however, some glitches, but my addiction had been
 satisfied enough to hold me over until the official release date.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>



<p>I
 of course went to a midnight launch for Halo 2, picked up my deluxe 
copy, my bonus disc, and stayed up all night playing through the 
campaign, in a language I could better-understand. The glitches were 
still there. Rushed cutscenes, with one vital one missing all together. 
Thankfully, the bonus disc explained how Johnson went from "brute 
prisoner" to "scarab owner" in such a short window. It turns out, 
despite the delays, Halo 2 wasn't ready for release. Regardless, I 
shrugged it off and continued to play through the most unfairly skewed 
Legendary campaign in existence, where a super soldier, humanity's last 
hope, was the weakest being in the galaxy - second only to infection 
form flood, which were essentially parasitic balloons.  I could go on, 
but the fond memories far outweigh the negatives, so I'll leave it at 
that.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>



<p>After ending on a painstaking 
cliffhanger, the premise had been set for Halo 3; finish the fight! But 
wait, a new X-Box had been released. So, I bought it. The Halo-skinned 
version, of course. UNSC green, with a matching controller and a pissy 
20GB HDD. Halo 3 is the first game I took online. I'm sure many readers 
will be familiar with the laughing stock which is Australian Internet, 
so WiFi [despite being invented by an Australian] wasn't going to cut 
it. Up in the ceiling I went to lay down some Ethernet! Shortly 
thereafter, I had to learn all about NAT settings....but it was all 
worth it. Halo 3 was probably the pinnacle of online multiplayer in the franchise, from maps, to forge, to gametypes and my beloved Infection.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>



<p>Halo
 Wars came next, and, for a console-based RTS, it exceeded all my 
expectations. At first. The balancing updates eventually stopped, until 
all that remained was a dwindling few players at the mercy of the next 
OP tank/banshee rush. And so sealed the fate of Halo Wars. Halo Wars 
also gave me my first taste of DLC. In this case, I feel the new maps 
and game types were justified as an additional cost, so&nbsp;I&nbsp;downloaded them. I'll be damned if many others did though, so they were barely used.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>



<p>Halo
 3: ODST. Wow. Amazing. I've always had a soft spot in the Haloverse for
 ODSTs, so off to yet another midnight launch I went. Playing this game,
 I felt like an ODST; despite my vulnerabilities, no enemy would trump 
my resolve! The feel of an ODST was perfectly captured. Yes, I was 
disappointed that the suppressed weapons weren't completely silenced for
 stealth options, as stealth seemed to be a reliant factor for a 
stranded ODST rookie, but everything else made up for it. Firefight, 
VISR, stamina....everything. To this day, I dare say some of the most 
fun I've had playing Halo is thanks to ODST.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>



<p>Because
 I had purchased ODST, I was granted access to a two week beta of the 
next Halo instalment, Halo: Reach. I was pumped! I even took a couple of
 weeks off from work - something I'd never done before [and haven't 
since]. Anyway, I&nbsp;was prepared to completely emerge myself in the latest
 title - right up until the night before, when my 360 was struck down by
 the Red Ring of Death. I'd heard about this before. We all had. But 
"not my X-Box," I always told myself. "I have one of the newer ones!" 
Not so lucky, unfortunately. After punching my serial number into a 
Microsoft support site, I&nbsp;was told mine was out of warranty, and I'd 
need to buy another, or pay for repairs. Being the industrious character
 I am, and left with little alternative,&nbsp;I&nbsp;decided to take a stab at 
fixing it myself. No luck. So, with the two week beta ticking away, 
I&nbsp;was forced to buy a new one. I later discovered that I&nbsp;had been 
misinformed, and my 360 was in fact under warranty for the Red Ring of 
Death. But after taking it apart in a desperate attempt to fix the error
 the night before the Halo:&nbsp;Reach beta release, my warranty was voided. 
Fun. <br /></p>

<p>I loved Invasion. Oh, how I loved Invasion. But 
that was about it. When Halo: Reach was released, I noticed the same 
flaws in Invasion that were present in the beta. Oh, and those bloody 
spawn-campers.... No patches or fixes for that, but DLC was available 
after a month for the "real" multiplayer maps. As soon as I had played 
through the campaign and was ready to take the fight online, I noticed 
that every map, except two, were lazy, unoriginal, "forge-themed" maps; 
the same sterile, bland, an unimaginative constructs riddled each and 
every one. The two exceptions, being "Sword Base" and another [it seems 
to have been purged from my memory] were cut straight out of the 
campaign. I knew this was a precursor for immediate DLC, and, sure 
enough, a month or so after the release, DLC was made available for some
 "real" multiplayer maps. I was livid. Ropeable. I honestly felt 
betrayed. </p>

<p>Having previously read the Halo novels by Eric
 Nylund, I noticed several plot holes throughout the campaign [I really 
don't want to be <em>that</em> <em>guy</em>, but I take my Halo pretty damn seriously]. Not only that, but this was the first Halo game&nbsp;where I didn't <em>feel</em>
 like the character I was playing. At the appropriate difficulty 
settings throughout the CE, 2, and 3 campaigns, I felt like a Sparta. In
 Halo 3: ODST, I felt like an ODST. But Halo: Reach failed to capture 
the essence of a Spartan - even if I&nbsp;<em>was</em> only a Spartan III. 
So yeah, after playing through an otherwise alright campaign,&nbsp;an influx
 of completely unnecessary weapons, ridiculously unnecessary armour customisations, stupidly unnecessary Covenant classes [why do the grunts look so stupid now?], buyiing the massive box set with the action figures and all, 
and then being told I had to pay extra for maps which I'm certain were 
intentionally left out of the original release, I pretty much just stuck
 to the flawed, and very laggy, Invasion.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>



<p>Halo: CE Anniversary came next.  Despite having played Halo CE inside and out, I couldn't let a Halo release go by without owning it [2600 excluded - if that even counts].
 Playing that campaign into the ground in my youth has unfortunately 
ruined CE for me - a mistake which I didn't repeat for later releases. As a result, I played this game very little, and bought it mainly as a gesture of love to my favourite franchise.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>



<p>
 Halo 4 was okay. New life had been breathed into Cortana, as a 
forbidden love story unfolded into an ever-daring and unusual chapter. 
With the extermination of the flood, and the departure of the brutes, a 
void in the cannon fodder needed to be filled....and the Prometheans 
failed to fill it. The campaign wasn't very memorable, or interesting, 
but I appreciate the efforts 343 Industries went to. I understand the 
same game can't be released over and over again, but the typical "Halo 
feel" seems to have died with the original trilogy. Spartan Ops was a 
great edition, and I was saddened not to see something similar in Halo 
5. It's also the last Halo FPS I took to multiplayer. That said, I still
 really enjoyed my time on multiplayer. The weapons were also a big 
improvement over Halo:&nbsp;Reach. But, to be fair, I've crapped out objects which could share that sentiment.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>



<p>Halo
 5: Guardians. Another new console. By this stage, I had completely 
stopped playing any game that didn't have "Halo" in the title. In fact, 
my 360 had gone most of the prior two years&nbsp;just collecting dust. This 
is probably a consequence of being an adult, and nothing to do with 
Halo. But, I bought an Xbone solely to play the new release. And it was 
of course the Halo-themed one which came with an included download of 
the game. Regardless, there was a shinier version of the game, that came
 in a big box, with I-can't-even-remember-what-else, so I bought that as
 well. With it, I bought a copy of The Master Chief Collection, which is
 what is prompting this very drawn-out recollection of events. By this 
stage, I felt like I was just going through the motions of buying a new 
Halo game. However, this is the first campaign that I didn't knock out 
overnight. I played Halo 5 like a boring adult: A level here and there, 
after work, if I had it in me. The graphics were amazing. The scenery 
was beautiful. The storyline was captivating. The Prometheans were 
balanced. This was also the first game where I felt like I was seeing 
human presence in the Halo Universe; something which had been overlooked
 in previous titles. I felt a real sense of exploration, traversing 
through these new worlds. I felt as though my lavish purchases were 
justified. As mentioned earlier, I never took this game to multiplayer 
matchmaking. I never felt the need to. Again, that's probably me just 
showing my age, but I now only play Halo for the story.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>



<p>Since
 about 2010, a friend and I had been dreaming of a new Halo Wars game. 
We'd discussed stor lines, characters, enemies....the works, until one 
day, news broke that a sequel was in the making. Despite my new Xbone 
collecting dust, like my second 360 before it, I was genuinely excited 
for this release. I was too caught up in life to realise a beta had come
 and gone before being informed of a second one. The second beta focused
 on an entirely new gametype, called "Blitz". While addictively fun, I 
noticed a fatal flaw.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Each player of this gametype will 
select a character. That character will have a set of units and 
abilities - some generic, some unique to the character. The player will 
compile an army of up to twelve of these units and abilities. The 
objective is essentially a "King of the Hill" style battle with armies 
made up of only units pre-selected by the player, but each unit comes at
 a resource cost to summon, which slowly accumulates throughout the 
game. The stronger the unit or ability, the higher the cost. The in 
itself is fine, until I learned the units can be levelled up with 
experience. This created scenarios where, although I might have 
outplayed my opponent, I would still lose, due to weaker troops. For 
casual gamers like myself, I was likely to always be up against stronger
 units. Anyway, this was a beta, and surely such kinks would be flagged 
and ironed out. Unlike Reach. Right? Wrong. </p>

<p>As always, I
 preordered the most expensive option, the one with all the bells and 
whistles, and I waited. I took note of a "season pass" which came 
included. Not only did I have to pay for an incomplete game, and a 
subscription to play it to its full potential, but now I was paying for 
privilege to have the remainder of the game downloaded to my console for
 an unspecified period of time. And I quote, "<em>The Halo Wars 2 Season Pass delivers regular content updates that span more than six months, including: new leaders with abilities 
that change the course of multiplayer battles, new units that add to 
your multiplayer arsenal, and a new campaign expansion featuring 
exclusive missions. Available as part of the Halo Wars 2: Ultimate Edition, or available separately for $29.99 USD, the Halo Wars 2 Season Pass will offer incredible value for fans, extending long after launch.</em>"
 How many "updates" would this cover? How long would the season pass 
last? How much would the next one cost? How much of this content has 
already been developed, and is intentionally being withheld from the 
game? Who knows. Anyway, I digress.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Upon taking the game
 home, I noticed the issues in "Blitz" were still there, but upgrades 
for the units could be purchased. It had become very clear to me that 
this game was nothing but a "pay to win" shell of its predecessor. And, 
soon enough, the new characters were introduced, leaving the base stock 
in the dust. They were intentionally overpowered, and players utilising 
them made short work of the rest. In short, the game was no longer fun 
to play online unless you were willing to cough up extra cash, to level 
the playing field. How much extra cash depended on the gametype. After a
 while, It turns out the sales clerk had given me the wrong copy of Halo
 Wars 2, and I didn't have the season pass after all, so I witnessed 
first hand what it was like to only have the starting characters. 
Anyway, my month of Gold membership had expired by the time I sorted out
 my season pass issues, and I carried on with my life.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While I&nbsp;liked the storyline of "The Banished,"
 the campaign hardly captivated me. I think the biggest flaw was trying 
to do too much; the original was created solely for X-Box, and was 
brilliant in its simplicity. Sure, it might not have competed with a top PC&nbsp;RTS,
 but that wasn't the point, nor was it the market. By opening Halo Wars 2
 up to the PCs, the game had to work hard to capture the attention of a 
new market, and, in doing so, I&nbsp;think sold out the console players. The end result was average gameplay across both platforms. But that's just my two cents.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>



<p>Towards
 the end of 2017, I finally roped a friend into playing The Master Chief
 Collection with me. These days, unless I'm achievement hunting, I only 
play Halo with friends. And this is where my story nears its end. I 
bought a few months of Gold from the Microsoft website, and upon 
entering the code into my Xbone, I noticed the auto-renew option ticked,
 complete with the credit card details I used from the website purchase.
 Very sneaky and easy to miss. I can't begin to explain how much that 
pissed me off. Anyway, when the Master Chief Collection wasn't an 
option, I decided to call upon another friend for some Halo Wars 2. He'd
 been raving about some new expansion, so I thought it'd be a good time 
to finally try out this season pass. No luck. Despite having only just 
entered it, and the game having only been released earlier in the year, 
this new expansion and set of characters was not included. The "<em>content updates that span more than six months</em>" didn't cover any of this - even if I had waited until now to activate it, the "<em>new leaders with abilities that change the course of multiplayer battles</em>" were already outdated by the <em>newer</em> wave of OP leaders, and the "<em>new campaign expansion featuring exclusive missions</em>"
 was a boring two levels that I've already forgotten. I'm sure the new 
leaders and campaign missions are fun, but I guess I'll never know.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>

<p>
   Back to the Master Chief Collection I went, whenever my schedule 
managed to line up with that of my friend's. I noticed no difference 
between CE Anniversary and CE in the MCC, but wasn't expecting anything;
 I had my hopes set on Halo 2. Although we sacrificed a level of 
enjoyment for the sake of completing the campaign on Legendary, and 
reverting a previous checkpoint whenever one of us died [usually him, 
because I'm awesome] I was hoping that after all this time, I could 
experience a completed campaign. But no luck. The infamously 
skipped-over scene where Johnson escapes his brute captors and 
commandeers a scarab remains ever-elusive. I know part of the charm was 
to keep the in-game glitches [although I seem to have lost the ability 
to fly through levels while wielding an energy sword] but would it have 
killed anyone to include that scene? The audio has already been recorded
 a decade ago; why not use it? But this is still not my biggest gripe.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Upon
 reaching Halo 3, my friend and I were shocked to notice a tab for ODST.
 It was a very welcomed surprise. And, as I started tracking my Halo 3 
achievements, I noticed ODST ones too. Thankfully there was nothing for 
firefight, as I don't think I have the energy for that these days [some 
of the achievements from the original release involved a lot of hours]. 
However, after completing Halo 3, we were again shocked to be directed 
to the Microsoft Marketplace to purchase ODST. The achievements were 
there, but it was an add-on. Both of us still had the original disc, but
 apparently, it isn't backwards compatible, so we were told we'd need to
 purchase it again. And that was the proverbial straw which broke this 
camel's back.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>



<p>I own the MCC, I own 
ODST, but I'm told that if I want to complete the MCC, which I already 
own, I need to pay for ODST again - which I already own! The 5 USD cost 
is completely irrelevant! I spoke to support staff on numerous 
occasions, and despite being initially told I was in the right and the 
issue would be resolved for me, I was later advised that wasn't the 
case, and I should write the issue on a forum somewhere. So, here I am. 
 Now, since writing up what has now been roughly a three hour trip down 
memory lane, I think it's clear to see that I've put up with a lot, but I
 haven't explained just how much of a Halo fan I am:&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>



<ul><li>I've preorded every deluxe edition of every new title possible, and have only updated my consoles for the sake of Halo. </li><li>I've read the books and comics. I even suffered through the painfully boring "Forerunner trilogy" by Greg Bear.&nbsp;</li><li>I
 lost count of the number of McFarlane action figures I accumulated once
 I surpassed 100. To this day, it **** me that the ODST line-up was 
never completed. Wherefore art thou Romeo!?&nbsp;</li><li>I even built a diorama to pose some of my action figures&nbsp;</li><li>I constructed my own ODST armour out of cardstock and fibreglass - and it actually looks pretty cool&nbsp;</li><li>I've drafted my own fanfiction&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><br /></p><p>Despite
 all this, and despite Halo having been with me for what is now the 
majority of my life, I think I'm done. Yes, I'm aware of the value of 
time, and how easy it would've been to just pay the $5.00 [or $6.65 
Australian]. I'm paid exceptionally well and have been out-earning my 
parents' combined income since my mid-twenties. I've done well in the 
stock exchange and have a property portfolio. My point is, I'm not short
 of money. But, looking at the true progression of how 343 Industries 
has been operating, I no longer feel as though I'm valued as a customer.
 Add-ons, pay to win, immediately available DLC, right after a new 
release....all of this seems to be a higher priority to 343 Industries 
than simply pleasing the fanbase with a solid game. Sure, it's only 
$5.00 for<em> this</em> game. Thankfully I never bothered with 
Guardians' multiplayer, but the "requisition packs" smell like another 
"pay to win" scam. Not even the prestige "Season Pass' gave the player 
access to everything Halo 2 had to offer, so, you know what? At this 
stage, I'm not even going to bother with Halo 6.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>To those who stuck through my essay, you have my thanks. In a way, this was very therapeutic for me to write, so, regardless of the outcome, I would not consider it time wasted.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>



<p>The ball's in your court, Microsoft/343. Give us ODST, stop the madness, and start treating us like human beings again.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>



<p>Sincerely, <br /></p>

<p>An&nbsp;ex-Halo fan.

            <p>Try this if it suits you:<br />
1.&nbsp; open an instance of the specific folder&nbsp; you want in Normal mode (not maximized).<br />
2.&nbsp; adjust the size of the window by dragging its edges to your liking.<br />
3.&nbsp; click&nbsp; and drag the title of the window (blue bar) to a position you would like it to appear with other open windows.<br />
4. hold down the "Alt" key then click on the close button on the upper right corner (red x) to close the window.<br />
5.&nbsp; reopen the folder window, when it opens, it should assume the size and position when it was closed.<br />
6.&nbsp; now click on the Maximize button (square, top right), the window becomes full screen<br />
7.&nbsp; hold down the "Alt" key then click on the close button (red x) to close the window.
</p>
<p>When you reopen that particular folder window it shoul open in "Maximize" mode and when you click on the "Restore down" button (middle button) it should shrink down in the position and size described on the previous steps.</p>
<p>Repeat the procedure for other folder windows you want to set. For example, you want the Picture folder to be positioned on the left at half the screen size and the Music folder half screen on the right, when you click on their respective "Restore down"
 button they will show side by side.</p>
<p>Windows will remember the size and position the folders when closed. If you closed the window maximized, it should open maximized. If you close the window half screen on the left, it will reopen in that size and position.<br />

<h2>            Cannot open msconfig, regedit or .exe files</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is simply the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot open <strong>msconfig, regedit </strong>or <strong>.exe</strong> files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to open them, they open for a second and then they close automatically. I've tried some of the solutions online such changing the files directory and renaming them or by typing some commands in the command screen but it did not work. I also tried
 the Microsoft automatic fix and it also didn't work for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other solutions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks! :)</p>
<p />

<h2>            Batch files run very slow</h2>
                    Original Title: Batch files do not run!<br />
Recently whenever I try to run a .bat (batch file) it will slow down my computer until it reaches the point where I can ONLY move the cursor. If I am lucky I can sometimes get it to open but it does not do anything and again I have to force restart to get my
 computer to respond. If I open CMD directly and type in what manualy what it is supposed to do it will work. I need to be able to run batch files for some programs I run. I cannot even get "start iexplore.exe" as a batch file to run. If anyone can help that
 would be greatly appreciated. Right now I have to run batch files on my ancient laptop that can barely work and they take FOREVER. Thanks for the help!

<h2>            Can&#39;t Get Past &#34;Automatic Repair&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Last week I downloaded some HP Updates that were available (something to do with graphics, possibly one to do with audio. Not sure.) Then I got a series of blue screens. First said "Stop Code: KERNEL SECURITY CHECK FAILURE". Then, "Stop Code: DRIVER VERIFIER

<p>I'm running Windows 10. Any step by step instructions to try and fix this would be greatly appreciated!!</p>

            Hi Kay.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Use whichever method works here to get into Repair Mode so you can run a System Restore to a point before this problem began:   <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>
<br />
<br />If necessary you may need to create bootable media to access the Repair Mode.  
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on second screen choose  Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Troubleshoot Options, then System Restore.  
<br />
<br />
<br />If it will start immediately Update your drivers from the Hp Driver Downloads page here: <a href="http://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers</a>  using the full model number or preferably Serial Number  on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />Updating drivers from the Device Manager or Windows Update is rarely enough. 
<br />
<br />If that fails go back to Troubleshoot Options to Reset.  
<br />
<br />If all else fails choose Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is a step included to rescue your files first if they are not backed up using the bootable media here:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi, KayLG612
<br />
<br />My name is Phillip and I am an Independent Advisor. I hope it helps.
<br />
<br />Try to enter Safe Mode  to repair Windows.
<br />Interrupt the normal boot process of your Windows 10 PC
<br />If Windows 10 fails to boot normally three times over, the fourth time it enters by default in an Automatic Repair mode. Using this mode, you can boot into Safe Mode. To trigger the Automatic Repair mode, you must interrupt the normal boot process three consecutive times: use the reset or the power button on your Windows 10 PC to stop it during boot, before it finishes loading Windows 10. If you use the power button, you might have to keep it pressed for at least 4 seconds to force the power off
<br />Then you proceed to repair the computer:
<br />With a reset, all of your Installed applications are lost, but you get an option to save your files if you want. If a system image from the OEM exists-called a recovery partition, then it also gives you an option to restore it. It would make your PC load to default factory settings.
<br />Navigate to Troubleshooting section, again.
<br />Select Reset.
<br />If you select keep my files, your files would be kept. You might also get the third option-restore to factory settings-which isn’t applicable on the PC.
<br />After selecting the desired options, you are presented with a confirmation, something like this- This indicates what you have chosen. 
<br />Click on Reset and the resetting should begin.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps. Keep us posted on the status for further assistance.

<p>Hi Greg, thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>I got to System Repair by going through Troubleshoot&gt;Advanced options. There were three restore points: 2 earlier "automatic restore points" and the latest one "Windows Update. Type: Critical Update". Chose that one. Said it was completed successfully and
 restarted. Went to hp splash screens "Preparing Automatic Repair", "Diagnosing your PC", "Attempting Repairs". Then back to the same automatic repair blue screen. Went back to restore points, the earliest one is gone. Chose the other automatic restore point.
 Started, then this popped up : "System Restore did not complete successfully...Restore failed while scanning the file system on the drive C:\. The drive might be corrupt. You might want to try System Restore after running chkdsk /R on this disk. An unspecified
 error occurred during System Restore. (0x80070571)"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have access to another PC right now, so I won't be able to follow the other suggestions.</p>

            Hi again Kay -
<br />
<br />Restart PC and press the ESC key to try to trigger HP Diagnostics which should test the hard drive adequately so you'll know it's condition. 
<br />
<br />If not Test the hard drive with diagnostics:  <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testing-programs-2626183" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testin...</a>.  Best is Seatools bootable Long Test which works on all models: 
<br /><a href="http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seatools-off-of-a-usb-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seat...</a>.
<br /><a href="https://www.seagate.com/manuals/software/seatools-bootable/using-seatools/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.seagate.com/manuals/software/seatoo...</a>
<br />
<br />Follow that up with a full Disk Check, from the Command Prompt if necessary:   <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-drive-fix-failures-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-dri...</a>
<br />
<br />If the drive has failed I'd replace it with an SSD which is the best Upgrade one can have - lightning fast, faster than a new higher-end PC without one, especially if you do the gold standard Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If the drive tests OK then I'd try to get into Safe Mode to update your Drivers with the latest from HP Downloads page for your serial.  
<br />If you can get the crash reports from the blue screen crashes we can also analyze the exact drivers causing them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/blue-screen-of-death-bsod/1939df35-283f-4830-a4dd-e95ee5d8669d">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also start over fresh by running HP Factory Restore:

</p>
<p>LIKES: I love the ability&nbsp;to detach the keyboard. This brings a new level of versatility to the surface. For example, I can quickly pick up the surface when I want to switch from laptop to tablet mode without flipping the cover around. This may not seem
 like a big deal, but it really makes working with the surface more seamless than before. Also, I can put the Surface on a nearby table and put the keyboard/wireless adapter on my lap to type. This makes it much easier to use when not at a desk (ie chair in
 a café, on the couch with a coffee table, etc.) If it were up to me, the future power cover would have Bluetooth built-in.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>NEEDS: My biggest concern with the wireless adapter is the batter life. The battery in the wireless adapter does not last as link as the batter in my original Surface Pro. I would be interested in anyone is having similar experiences with this. Other Bluetooth
 keyboards I have used last for several weeks before recharging. I hope this is just a software issues that will be fixed in a future update.&nbsp; A minor issue is the inability to have the Bluetooth adapter in place AND use the keyboard cover as a cover. I think
 there is a missed opportunity here. I would love for the adapter to simply fit into the surface connector between the keyboard cover and the surface connector. Even better would be the ability to charge the wireless adapter in this way (using the connector
 at the bottom of the surface.)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>QUESTION: What should I expect for the battery life of the Bluetooth wireless adapter for the type/touch keyboard?</p>

            <p>Hi Nadeem,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That does not sound like it's working properly. Although we don't have specs on how long it should actually last due to different levels of usage, it should still last longer than 2-3 hrs.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest either taking it back to the point of purchase, or contacting <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/support/contact-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Surface Technical Support</a> and see about getting it replaced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know if you need any further help with this matter.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Modern Keyboard with Fingerprint ID &#40;EKZ-00002&#41; - Bluetooth not working</h2>
                    <p>Hello Microsoft community. I recently bought the Microsoft modern mouse and modern keyboard to have a nice simple aesthetic setup. The Microsoft Modern Mouse has Bluetooth 4.0 capability and connects to my computer without any problems. The keyboard on the
 other hand not so much. The keyboard, along with the fingerprint scanner,&nbsp; will work when it is plugged in but not when it is unplugged (Even when the charging led above the up arrow is fully solid). I am also wondering why in my Bluetooth settings it shows
 the "Microsoft Modern Mouse" and its battery levels but for the Modern Keyboard it just shows "USB Keyboard with Fingerprint ID". This keyboard is brand new. The operating system I am running is Windows 10 and I have recently restarted it and updated it. I
 have also tried download the drivers for this keyboard from here&nbsp;https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-ca/products/keyboards/microsoft-modern-keyboard-with-fingerprint-id to no avail. I have also tried plugging the USB in to another port also to no avail.
 Another thing I can add in here is when I remove the device, power it off, and then power it back on, In the bottom right it it shows the # of notifications but it doesn't show anything when I click on it (Screenshots posted below) . This was apart&nbsp; of the
 apparent setup process. I have tried running an sfc scan but it unfortunately gets stuck at 97% which is pretty odd. Specs and operating system are shown below. I don't think the specs will be relevant in this situation but usually for troubleshooting it is
 good to see what the user is running. Thanks for taking the time to read this and I look forward to hearing your response. Thanks ,</p>
<p>Seth</p>

<p><span><span>Hi GaDawgzFan,</span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span>If you are unable to login or unable to gain access to your computer via safe mode, you can try "last known good configuration". If that
 doesn't work and assuming that there are no hardware issues, you can follow the directions below to get access to your computer.</span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span>If you have any errors we could start there though. You mentioned that the computer beeps at you, can you define that? Like short and
 long beeps, how many of each and do they repeat?<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>Please let us know.</p>
<p><span><span><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can upgrade in-place, which means you can install Windows Vista and retain your applications, files, and settings as they were in
 your previous edition of Windows. An In-Place upgrade is actually a repair installation using the upgrade option. If you have installed Service Pack 1 for Windows Vista and your original Windows Vista DVD does not include this Service Pack, then the Upgrade
 option will be disabled, thus preventing you from doing an in place upgrade. The reason for this is that, by installing Service Pack 1 your system is, in effect, newer than that of your original Vista DVD (the only exception to this is if you have a slipstreamed
 copy of Windows Vista including Service pack 1).</span> </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>So, if your original Windows Vista DVD does not contain Service Pack 1 you will need to Uninstall Service Pack 1 from your PC prior to
 attempting the upgrade.</span> </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Note: After performing In-Place Upgrade, your personal data and installed programs will not be removed but we may need to run Windows
 Update to install all the available updates for your system to update these system files to the current version. This troubleshooting process is time consuming and may take several hours to complete.<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you would like to perform the In-place Upgrade, refer to the following steps.</span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Start the computer by using the current Operating System.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Insert the Windows Vista DVD in the computer's DVD drive.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Use one of the following procedures, as appropriate:</span>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>• <span><span><span>If Windows automatically detects the DVD, the Install now screen appears. Click Install now.
</span></span></span></p>
<p>• <span><span><span>If Windows does not automatically detect the DVD, follow these steps:</span>
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a. Click Start, click Run, type Drive:\setup.exe, and then click OK. Note Drive is the drive letter of the computer's DVD drive.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. Click Install now.
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>4. When you reach the "Which type of installation do you want?" screen, click Upgrade to upgrade the current operating system to Windows
 Vista.</span> </span></p>
<p><span><span>5. Please run Windows Update again as you will need to download and install the most current updates.</span>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>If you do not have the Windows Vista Installation DVD, I suggest contacting your PC manufacturer or our Customer Service to order a backup
 disk.</span> </span></p>

            Hi <span>Codice Sconto</span>,<br />
<br />
If you uninstall&nbsp;your Windows Live Writer, you&nbsp;will loose all your blog setups on it. There's no way to backup the settings though.<br />
<br />
To address your original concern about removing tags in Windows Live Writer, please follow these steps:<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li>Delete the tags in <strong>Wordpress</strong>. </li><li>Open your <strong>Windows Live Writer</strong>. </li><li>Go to the <strong>Home</strong> tab.&nbsp;It is located on the upper part of Windows Live Writer.
</li><li>View the <strong>Publish</strong> category and locate the name of your blog. Click on the
<strong>drop down</strong> arrow beside it. </li><li>A <strong>drop down menu</strong> will appear. Click on <strong>Manage blogs</strong>.
</li><li>Click the blog where the tags&nbsp;are associated and click on the <strong>Remove</strong> button.
</li><li>Restart Writer and then re-add the deleted blog again.&nbsp;When you're done, you'll no longer see the tag in Windows Live Writer.</li></ol>
Thanks,<br />
<p><span>Windows Live Allan I.<br />

<h2>            Where to find the Hardware Compatibility List for Windows XP&#63;</h2>
                    I am doing a hands on project for school and the book gives the following link http://testedproducts.windowsmarketplace.com/ except that the link is broken. Going to www.marketplace.com all I could find was Windows 7 hardware compatibility list but I could
 not change it to windows xp. According to the book, I am supposed to click on components under hardware and choose the manufacturer and make/model. I have searched for hours and would appreciate any feedback on where to find this info. Thanks in advance.

<h2>            Xbox One Narrator with Microsoft Edge</h2>
                    I am blind, and I use narrator on Xbox with pretty much everything, except Microsoft Edge. Narrator will not navigate properly in Edge. I'm not sure if narrator is Edge compatible or if I just don't know how to use narrator with this particular web browser.
 How do I navigate from link to link, headings, radio buttons, etc? Also, how do I activate a link or button on a page. The only thing that narrator seems to navigate through in edge is Edge's internal buttons, such as new tab, refresh, address bar, etc. Thanks.
