<p>I received the update on the 27th also. &nbsp;I have three xboxes, one 360 s, one 360 elite, and an older 360 with a 20gig hardrive. &nbsp;All of them updated without issue and I have not noticed any problems with any of them so far.</p>
<p>So maybe the problem is in your network, or in your Xbox itself. &nbsp; Now if you have any special settings in your router, for your Xbox (like Port forwarding or DMZ settings) that are based on an IP address, the update may have caused &nbsp;your Xbox to change
 its IP address and those settings won't work. &nbsp;So &nbsp;you might check to be sure any settings in your router that use your Xbox's IP address are pointing at the right address.</p>

<p><span><span>Hello,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>It is normal for&nbsp;</span></span>$Recycle.bin and System Volume Information<span><span>to be present on all fixed drives and partitions. You cannot permanently remove them. These are normally hidden system files. It is
 possible you have somehow made them visible. We recommend to apply the settings below:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Open <strong><em>This PC</em></strong> or <strong><em>File Explorer</em></strong>.</p>
<p>2. Click <strong><em>View </em></strong>in the menu and select <strong><em>Options</em></strong>, then click
<strong><em>Change folder and search options</em></strong>.</p>
<p>3. On the <strong><em>View </em></strong>tab select <strong><em>Hide Protected operating system files</em></strong> and change the Hidden Files and folders option to "<strong><em>Don't show hidden files, folders, or drives".</em></strong></p>
<p>4. Click <strong><em>Apply </em></strong>and click <strong><em>OK</em></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/2d13b840-b528-4515-8145-b0b475720d1f" title="steste123">steste123</a><span>,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting here in Microsoft Community Forum.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Based on your post, It seems that the paint of the magnet at the bottom is getting removed from scratches and because it's iron, it causing rust. If the spine or magnetic connections of your type cover get dirty or stained, we suggest to apply a small
 amount isopropyl alcohol (also called rubbing alcohol) to a soft, lint-free cloth to clean. Also, can you send us a sample snipshot of your Surface device having a burn on the spine or magnetic connections to confirm if this is a burn issue or a cosmetic concern.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Looking forward for your response,</em></p>
<p><span><em>Loyd G.</em></span></p>

<p>Hello yes I have sent photos already. I will try to use what you have suggested and see if it works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But if thats the case with the magnets causing rust and scratching my computer&nbsp; this is a design fault that should be fixed , or reported to someone higher up in microsoft. ( As noone should pay alot of money for a computer to have to deal with rusting and
 scratches appearing randomly. ( Never happened with any other products I have bought)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try rubbing alcohol in a few days and see if it helps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Changes to registry entry not saved on restart</h2>
                    
<p>Hope this is the right forum. I'm trying to change the DWORD (32-bit) value of StartMenuInit from 4 to 3, but a restart/relogin changes it back to 3. Is the fact that I'm running a Win7-64bit relevant?</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Updated, now my computer freezes</h2>
                    <p>After this update, "Update for Windows 10 Version 1607 for x64-based Systems (KB3211320)" on 1/25/2017, my computer started freezing about every five minutes. The update can't be uninstalled, I can't get rid of Windows 10 (which I hate), and none of the

            After installing Anniversary Update 1607/KB3211320 on 2/17/17 my system would freeze randomly and Task Manager would not open, and if it did open it would stall and "not respond". It gotten so bad to the point that when I attempted to log back into Windows
 after restarting, it wouldn't show a cursor/field for me to type in or my name on the Login screen. I wasn't able to restore my computer to a different state b/c System Restore was coincidentally turned off and when trying to use the Windows installation CD,
 there was no option to change startup behavior to login to safe mode nor would it work by holsing SHIFT+restart, talk a/b kick a man when he's down. Even using "Roll back to previous build" wouldn't work. I had read somewhere that creating a bootable USB disk
 will allow you to "Roll back to previous build" so I tried that and to my surprise it worked. So the lesson I learned is that until M$ get's its $h!7 together I will stay put at version 1511 as long as possible.

<p>The machine that is giving me the Error 1632 messages is a Toshiba Satellie S55-C laptop PC, with Windows 10 Home, current OS build is 15063.674. I receive the error message while in the middle of installing updates to Java and the video app Camtasia (version
 9).&nbsp; </p>
<p>When trying to install the current update to Java, all I receive in the error message is "Error 1632."
</p>
<p>When trying to unstall the current update to Camtasia, the message I receive includes "Error 1632" and a statement that either there is not sufficient free space on the computer or I do not have access to the Temp folder. Both of these are wrong. The laptop's
 hard drive has 808 GBs of free space (with 122 GBs used). I have verified several times that I do have administrator rights to the Temp folder (and I am the only user of this laptop, and I do administrator rights for it).

<p>Hi Stephen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error <strong>1632</strong> may arise if there's a corrupted file in the temp folder that's conflicting with the update process. As an initial step to rule out your concern, we suggest that you clear the temp folder. To do this, here are the steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Windows </strong>+ <strong>R </strong>key to open the run command window.</li><li>Type <strong>%temp%</strong> in the search box and press <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Press the <strong>CTRL </strong>+ <strong>A </strong>key to select all files.</li><li>Click the <strong>Del </strong>key or right-click, then select <strong>Delete</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, you may want to disable your firewall settings before updating your applications. You can follow the steps provided on this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028544/windows-turn-windows-firewall-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> on how to disable firewall. Once you're done, enable your firewall settings again and check if the issue persists.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know should you need further assistance.</p>

            Thank you for with the instructions for emptying the Temp folder and disabling the Windows Firewall. I really do appreciate the help. Unfortunately these 2 things did not solve the problem. I made sure the Temp folder was completely empty, and then disabled
 the Windows firewal, then downloaded a new copy of the Camtasia update file and trying to install it--but I still received the Error 1632 message, at the same point in the middle of trying to install the update. I then tried to install the update to Java,
 but received the Error 1632 message in the middle of that, too. (Windows, itself, is still able to install upgrades, though.) I just realized, too, that there is another piece of info that might be helpful, though I'm grabbing at straws here. I have no idea
 if it's related to the Error 1632 situation. This additional info is: When booting up the laptop, before my desktop screen appears and the login option is available, I receive a message at the bottom of the screen saying "Scanning and repairing drive \\?\Volume..."
 This appears in a screen that is otherwise black except for "Toshiba" in large red letters in the middle of it. I'm not sure about the full name of the referenced drive because I haven't had a chance to write down the entire thing, but it may be \\?\Volume(3867f7b8-a2bb-b9b5-c1725bc94228)\.
 I took from that drive name from the list of drives in the Windows defrag program that I use daily. This "Scanning and repairing" message started appearing several weeks before the first occurrence of the Error 1632 message, but that may only be because I
 might not have had any app updates to install for a while after the first occurrence of the "Scanning and repairing" message.

<p>We appreciate the information that you're provided. If you still encounter the same error after clearing the temp folder, our next step is to run a full scan (<strong>SFC</strong>) and

<p>Thank you for these suggestions. I tried both, but they did not solve the problem.&nbsp; When I ran the scannow job, it reported that it did not find any integrity violations.&nbsp; Then I ran the DISM job, and it completed successfully. I then ran the scan job again,
 and it again reported not integrity violations. So next I tried installing the Camtasia update, but ran into the Error 1632 message again in the middle of that process. I then tried shutting down the laptop and rebooting. The "Scanning and repairing drive
 \\?Volume\..." message no longer appears, so whatever that was about has been resolved (yay--some progress, even it it's with not the essential problem). But trying to install the Camtasia upgradess still ran into the Error 1632 problem, as also did another
 attempt to install the Java update.&nbsp; Any other ideas I could try, please? Thank you again for your continuing help. I really do appreciate it.</p>

            Hi steve. I do have the same problem with error 1632 message. I've just solved it. Check ur folder in C:\windows\installer. Is the folder "installer" exist? If there was not, just create new "installer" folder. It will ask for permission, just click ok.
 Try to install ur program again. Good luck

<p>Amazing how fast we forget - my Toshiba died about 1 year ago but I believe it was Fn+ some of the F keys to do same.</p>

                    <p>Original Title:Verified Working USB Storage Device not Recognised</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an 8GB USB Flash drive that has, until recently, worked flawlessly on multiple Operating Systems including Windows 7 and 8. Recently the drive does not seem to want to work on one of my Windows 7 installations on one PC (HP EliteBook 8470p).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried reinstalling device drivers for it on my specific windows 7 machine that it does not work on. Device Manager gives me "This device cannot start. (Code 10)" even after reinstalling drivers and restarting multiple times. I am also running a few
 virtual machines of Windows 7 and 8 on this same PC, and when virtually connecting the USB drive to the Windows 7 virtual machine, i cannot detect it. When connecting the device to the Windows 8 virtual machine, i can access the files, and even format it,
 thus the USB ports on my computer are all functional. </p>
<p>
</p><p>To summarize, the device works in Windows 7 and 8 installations separate of this particular computer, yet does not work on 7 on my it, whether the main OS or virtualized. The Windows 8 virtual machine on this computer can recognize the device.</p>

 accessible. Thanks anyway.<br />

    <title>Windows 8&#47;8.1 touchscreen not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sarahwombat  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8&#47;8.1 touchscreen not working</h2>
                    <p>I have an Asus S400C notebook, which came pre-installed with Windows 8. I have had it for about eleven months. A few weeks ago I turned it on one morning, to find the touchscreen completely unresponsive. The night before the touchscreen had been working
 perfectly, and it had never had any problems whatsoever previously. I searched the Microsoft community, but other people seem to have had problems after a history of the touchscreen malfunctioning or upgrading from Windows 7. The computer had recently installed
 updates, but had worked as normal for several days afterwards. Control Panel no longer shows the touchscreen calibration tool, and the 'View basic information about your computer' screen says 'no pen or touch input is available for this display'.</p>
<p>I ran the troubleshooters recommended on other Windows community conversations, but they found no issues. I refreshed the Human Interface Driver as well, but that didn't help either.</p>
<p>The only indication of any problem Windows provided was a balloon saying 'USB device has malfunctioned', several times in quick succession, which then disappeared and has not re-appeared since. At the time when the balloon appeared, no external USB device
 was connected to the computer, and none had been that session.</p>
<p>Other than the unresponsive touchscreen, the computer is running completely normally. The touch pad and keyboard are normal and the screen, in terms of display, is also working perfectly.</p>
<p>My friend, who is trained in IT, did all he could think of to the computer. He recommended that I upgrade to Windows 8.1. I did, but that didn't solve the problem either, although I like the upgrade.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">I also contacted Asus support, and they suggested I 'Click uninstall the HID-compliant device in human input device of device manager, and then click Scan for hardware changes to load a usable driver for a try'. I'm not entirely
 sure what they mean by that. Could anyone explain what I'm supposed to do in clearer terms? If that doesn't fix the problem, they recommend I reset the OS, but since I'd rather not have to re-install all my programs I'd like to try other possible solutions
 first.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">I wanted to try refreshing the OS, but the Microsoft site says that if you upgraded your PC from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1 and it has a Windows 8 recovery partition refreshing or resetting it will revert it to Windows 8. How do I
 know if my pc has a 'Windows 8 recovery partition'? Internet here is neither fast nor particularly cheap, so I'd prefer not to have to re-upgrade to Windows 8.1.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">Thanks!</p>

            Thanks for your help, everyone. After several weeks of no functionality from the touchscreen, I turned it on today to find the touchscreen working again, with no problems at all as far as I can see. I had tried lots of things to fix the problem, but I
 hadn't done anything related to the touchscreen between when I last found it to be not working and today when it started working again. I'll see if it continues working reliably, but for the moment it looks pretty good.

<h2>            system.unauthorizedaccess from Peachtree Premium 2011 on XP Pro SP3</h2>
                    Hi there, I have been working feverishly for the last few days trying to get an XP pseudo-server-machine running after having been nominally messed up by a recent Peachtree Update. I have managed to get the most necessary applications up and running (ShipGear,
 UPS WorldShip) -- all except for Peachtree Premium 2011.
<div>It is rather important that this is resolved as there is a large amount of information and business transactions dependent on Peachtree being functional on this system.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>A system restore to a point before the Peachtree updates has helped to resolve the problems with the other programs on the computer, but for some reason Peachtree refuses to run correctly....
</div>
<div>Anytime Peachtree is started, it hangs for about 30 seconds, then displays a blank window ("* Peachtree" is the title. It stops responding after about 5 seconds) then proceeds to crash, telling me that "Peachtree Accounting has encountered a problem and
 needs to close" etc, etc....</div>
<div>I have a hunch that this is related to .NET Framework, but I have tried&nbsp;just&nbsp;about everything I can think of to repair it....</div>
<div>I've tried using the dotnetfx cleanup tool; I've tried uninstalling all versions of .NET framework and clean installing them back in; I've tried a clean reinstallation of Peachtree, but all to no avail.</div>

                    <p>Has anyone found a replacement for the Windows 7 DVD Maker on Windows 10? &nbsp;I am upset to say the least that I lost it in the upgrade. &nbsp;I've been using a friend's pc that still had Windows 7, but now that I have fixed Windows Movie Maker on my Windows 10

            I found my answer after months of searching around on the internet in a third party program called Wondershare. I paid for it, but it works with Windows Movie Maker. &nbsp;I can now convert and burn DVD's to play on a DVD player. &nbsp;Not happy with any of the
 answers or guidance from Microsoft as to why they didn't support all the Windows Essentials Programs in Windows 10. &nbsp;I'm also having trouble editing photos as before on Windows Photo Gallery (another part of Windows Essentials), so I can't use it to edit my
 photos anymore. &nbsp;I get an error code of access denied (0x80070005). &nbsp;I have worked with the chat team a couple of times. &nbsp;No fix found. The upfront agreement to upgrade should have stated very plainly that these programs would not be supported,not function
 as before, and not be usable in Windows 10. &nbsp;Speak the truth please. &nbsp;I would have never upgraded from Windows 7.

            I had to take that risk on third party software and not happy about it. I couldn't get an answer on what to do from Microsoft. Please let me know what app from the Windows store supports Movie Maker and converting (photos and videos) and burning DVDs to
 play on a regular DVD or Blue Ray player. &nbsp;Thank you.

    <title>Windows 10 Internal Speakers not working suddenly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stephanier8  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Internal Speakers not working suddenly</h2>
                    <p>I installed Windows 10 weeks ago, and everything was running fine, but last week the sound suddenly stopped coming out of the internal speakers. It worked fine through the headphones, but it was
<em>just</em> the internal speakers that weren't working. I sent it in for repairs since I had my laptop was on warranty, and a they had to do a complete reset on my laptop in order to fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is, was windows 10 what caused it? I'm doubtful that it was, since my speakers were absolutely fine for weeks and weeks, but since they work after a wipe it seems possible that windows 10 caused it. Any thoughts?</p>

<p>If you need to reset the family passcode, you actually need to contact Xbox Hardware support. They'll have you register the serial number and can provide you a reset code. This call (maybe chat?) must be done by the adult that setup the passcode.

<p>I assume that last bit is just to prevent kids from going around mom and dad's restrictions :)</p>
