    <title>Filter a report using a combo box - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Filter a report using a combo box</h2>
                    I have been trying to filter a report using a combo box on a form and have had little success.&nbsp; The combo box is pulling from a table that just contains manager name data and the report is pulling from a table that contains manager names as well as many
 other fields.&nbsp; I have attempted to use the Where Condition in the macro tools as well as Apply Filter and any other option I could find that looked like it might work.&nbsp; I know this has to be something easy, but I have been unable to find anything that gives
 me instructions or code on how to do this.&nbsp; Thanks in advance for any assistance.

            No, the combo box doesn't have to be based on the same table, but its bound column should correspond to the manager name field. What is the Column Count of your combo box? If it is 2, the actual bound column may not be the manager name.

            <p>Does the table you're using in the report contain the manager <strong>name</strong>, or a numeric manager
<strong>ID</strong> (perhaps concealed from your view by Microsoft's infuriating Lookup Field misfeature)? Please post the RowSource property of the combo and the Recordsource of the Report - my guess is that you need a numeric ID.</p>

<h2>            Java windows not showing window is too low POGO Games</h2>
                    Hi when I play on POGO.com games the start window is too far down and I can not start the game. I tried it on my computer that is running Windows XP and it is just fine but when I use my computer that is running Windows 7 and Internet Explorer 9 the start
 box is below where the bottom of screen is. How can I fix it? I even put bottom task bar to the left and still same thing. It was working up to about 3 weeks ago when there was an update for Internet Explorer 9 HELP!!!

            <p><span>Hi,
</span></p>
<p><span>Which update did you install recently?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Try these steps.</span></p>
<p><span>1- Magnify the browser window. In Internet Explorer 9, click the gear-shaped button in the upper-right corner of the screen,
 and click "Zoom" and "Zoom In."</span></p>
<p><span>2- Browse in full screen mode. In Internet Explorer 9, press the "F11" key to enter this mode, and press "F11" again to
 leave it.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span>3- Lower the screen resolution. In Windows 7, minimize the browser, right-click the desktop and select "Screen Resolution."
 Click the drop-down menu next to "Resolution," and select a lower resolution than the one currently displayed. Because a lower resolution uses less pixels to display the information on the screen, this has the effect of making the Pogo game box larger. Remember
 to change the resolution back when you are done playing.</span></p>
<p><span>4- Disable the address and status bars in Internet Explorer 9 if a portion of the game window is cut off. Click the gear-shaped
 button, and then click "Internet Options." Click the "Security" tab, and then click the "Custom Level" button. Click the "Enable" radio button next to "Allow websites to open windows without address or status bars," then click "OK" twice. Close and re-open
 your Pogo game window.</span></p>
<p><span>5- Press the "F4" key. Some Pogo games enter full-screen mode when this key is pressed.</span></p>

<h3> cjw81  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Mobile 6.5, connection to hands-free in car slows phone significantly down</h2>
                    
<p>When connection my Windows Mobile 6.5 phone to an in-car handsfree system (factory, OEM, not after market) my phone slows down significantly. When typing or selecting menu items, the phone is extremely sluggish. If I open Task Manager, however, the CPU utilization
 is generally low (less than 50%).</p>
<p>Further, when answering a call utilizing the answer button on my steering wheel, it seems to take up to 5 seconds before the phone finally answers. Hence, it appears the phone is slow in receiving the car's request to answer the call, probably because the
 phone "appears" to bogged down. If I initiate the call on the phone and hit dial on the phone, my in-car system receives the audio immediately.</p>
<p>Curiously, once the phone is connected to a call, there are no further hicups or slow-downs.</p>
<p>Anything I can do to resolve this? The phone is a Samsung SCH-i220 (CODE).</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I noticed exactly the same. When I connected my HD2 to a Bury carkit, it was getting extremely slow when it was syncing the phonebook. After that it was normally responsive. After changing the carkit to another brand, my phone is only slow for about 10 seconds.
 It seems that the implementation of the bluetooth protocol is not done correct for some manufacturers. Other than trying to change the bluetooth stack (not user upgradable) is there not very much you can do with it.</p>

<h2>            E72 and BirdStep SmartConnect</h2>
                    <b>Technical Level</b> : Intermediate
<br /><br /><b>Summary</b><br />
<br /><b>Details</b><br />
<p>BirdStep SmartConnect (see <a href="http://www.birdstep.com/Products/Birdstep/SmartConnect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.birdstep.com/Products/Birdstep/SmartConnect/</a>) is an application that's designed to provide network-aware applications with a feature similar to Symbian's "destinations" when those network-aware applications only support connectivity via a specific
 network access point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It creates a new access point that you can place in any of your destinations, but when invoked, it walks through a prioritised list of access points, establishing the connection that's the highest possible on your list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One example of such an application is the Nokia Messaging application that ships with the E72. The E72 is a S60v3FP2 device that supports destinations, but it is only possible to specify a particular access point to use in order to synchronize your e-mail,
 for example.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BirdStep SmartConnect works on the E72 with firmware versions up to and including V023. V031 includes SmartConnect in the ROM image, but the version supplied doesn't actually work (d'oh!).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BirdStep have released a patch to install on V031, which gets the whole thing working again. See at the bottom of this page:</p>

    <title>Dynamically enable&#47;disable custom ribbon buttons based on - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alison s 42  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dynamically enable&#47;disable custom ribbon buttons based on selection</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to enable/disable custom ribbon buttons based on whether or not the cursor is in a table (ie, I want them context sensitive like Microsoft's buttons). I am using the application WindowSelectionChange event to do the test and invalidate the ribbon.
 This works fine if all the files I have open are attached to the same template. However, if I have files attached to different templates, then it doesn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The callback code is in a global template (which is in my startup folder) and then I have a portrait template and a landscape one. They both use the same code from the global for various tools. If I create a new portrait file, then the buttons enable/disable
 as they should, and continue to do so if I create many portrait files. Each time I switch documents, or change the selection, the ribbon is invalidated and the getEnabled callback runs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I then create a new landscape file, the first time I activate the ribbon tab the code runs as it should. Thereafter, the&nbsp;getEnabled callback does not run. The ribbon is still being invalidated, but the&nbsp;getEnabled code is not triggered. If I switch window
 back to one of the portrait files, they still work fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I start with landscape, then that works and the portrait doesn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried individually invalidating the controls in question; I've tried adding separate callback subs for the portrait and landscape ribbons.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is for a client, so it needs to work reliably, if I'm going to use it. Any help would been gratefully received.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Alison</p>

<h2>            How to print consecutive numbering on small documents 10-to-a-page</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I am trying to make a document that is busness-card-size, which will have consecutive numbering. One number on each card, numbered from 1 to 120. Does anyone know how to do that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought perhaps to make the document design as a background, and to make the numbering a foreground.&nbsp; Or perhaps forget that and make the numbering a page number... does that make sense?</p>

<h2>            Unable to receive emails due to sync issues &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hey everyone ! Lately I haven't been able to receive any outlook email through the mailing app of my computer (acer aspire E11). Whenever I try to refresh or synchronize, it tells me that my account is unavailable, so I haven't received any mail for 2 weeks.
 I have to go through firefox to check my mailbox ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on how I can fix this?</p>

                    I'm using Windows Mobile 6.1 on an HTC Tilt. When I dial a phone number, I always have to enter the area code. Is there a way for me to set a default area code so I don't always have to dial one? Thanks!

<h2>            Possible solutions for marketplace connection issues</h2>
                    
<p>I know this seems rather obvious, but download and reinstall the the marketplace software first. You can find it here:<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/en-us/downloads/default.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Marketplace Download</a></p>
<br />
<br />
<p>Tilt 2 users (and possibly other HTC phones) should open up their Tools folder. Find the folder labeled Proxy Manager, open it. Click the icon that says "Restore Proxy". Now go back and run marketplace to see if this works.</p>

<h2>            I NEED to access a partiular website or I may have to switch to Android, help&#33;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>A friend of mine loves WinPhone 8. But as we are all painfully aware,&nbsp;a few&nbsp;quality apps are MIA.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>He needs to access the real estate MLS. It is this site: fll.fusionmls.com</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you go to the site you first get prompted with an Adobe flash error.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This company has built apps for Iphone and Android, but not WinPho.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Can anyone in here think of a way to get this site up on WinPhone 8? another browser?
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'd hate to see the entire real estate industry shy away from WinPhone.&nbsp;that a big big market.</p>

            Adobe has stopped making Flash for mobile devices. The solution sadly, is on the website's end. They must either switch to full HTML5 for their website or make an app for Windows Phone. There's nothing you can do.<br />

            Format tab is a context sensitive menu and appears when right context is there.
<br />For example, if you insert a picture / shape / Text box (or later select it), Format tab will appear immediately.
<br />You can force it to appear always.

            Try repairing your Office installation. First try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)

<br />If the above doesn't work, you will need to reinstall the Office again.

    <title>When you send an e-mail message from a shared mailbox in Outlook 2010, - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> axmanz  say:</h3>
<h2>            When you send an e-mail message from a shared mailbox in Outlook 2010, the sent message is not saved in the Sent Items folder of the shared mailbox</h2>
                    <p>I have a user who is a PA for two executives. She has access to both their mailboxes in her Outlook 2010. She has full access and Send-As permissions on both mailboxes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When she sends mail as Exec#1 - the sent items go to&nbsp;Exec#1's sent items folder.</p>
<p>When she sends mail as Exec#2 - the sent items go to&nbsp;the PA's&nbsp;own sent items folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I too have access to&nbsp;a shared Helpdesk mailbox. When I send as Helpdesk, they show up in MY sent tiems folder.</p>
<p>So I&nbsp;tried the 'DelegateSentItemsStyle' Reg key fix (plus required hotfix: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/KB/2459115" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/KB/2459115</a>)</p>
<p>Interestingly,&nbsp;with this reg key in place,&nbsp;the sent items from the&nbsp;Helpdesk mailbox disappear! They dont show up in any folder. Bizzare.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I checked the Exec's mailbox types.&nbsp;Exec#1 is classified as a 'shared mailbox' and&nbsp;exec#2 is a 'User mailbox.</p>
<p>(Our exchange was upgraded from 2003 to 2010 and some mailboxes became 'shared mailbox' and other 'user mailbox. this is also a known issue).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I changed the account type for Exec#2 to match Exec#1 as&nbsp;a Shared Mailbox. </p>
<p>Removed it from the PA's&nbsp;Outlook (Automated in Exchange 2010 by removing her permissions to that mailbox) and then re-added.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now Exec#1 and Exec#2's mailboxes are setup the same&nbsp;but the problem remains.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have i missed something obvious here?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

    <title>Disable Office 365 mailbox - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Disable Office 365 mailbox</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Is there any way to disable mailboxes which are automatically created when you assign Office 365 licence to a users? Our email system is currently hosted by another company and so far we are not looking to migrate to Office 365. Problem is that users get
 some emails to Office 365 mailbox such as sharepoint invitation etc which is really annoying. Is there any way to prevent this? Maybe to disable automatically created mailbox?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>hi roksaje6071，</p>
<p><em>question: is there any way to disable mailboxes which are automatically created when you assign office 365 licence to a users?</em></p>
<p>the answer is no. it is not feasible to disable automatically created mailbox when you assign office 365 licenses to users.</p>
<p>based on your description, may i know whether you don’t want to use mailbox? if yes, there is a workaround. you can uncheck the single exchange license when you assign office 365 license to a user. after that, users will not have any exchange features (such
 as mailbox), but they can use other features (such as sharepoint, onedrive.) like the screenshot shows below.</p>

    <title>Office 2016 - Unable to set default for Word 2016 or Excel 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 2016 - Unable to set default for Word 2016 or Excel 2016</h2>
                    
<p>MY SITUATION: I have an Office 365 business account which I use purely for my home PC and laptop. Office 2016 is installed on my PC and laptop on both of which I am running Windows 10 with latest updates installed. My wife and I each have an account on the
 PC, but only I am registered with an Office 365 account. Because of this I have left Office 2010 on the PC as I am concerned that if I remove it my wife might not be able to use Word 2016. She also works from home, either on the PC or laptop and MUST have
 access to Word (of some description).</p>
<p>WHAT I CAN DO: I only use Word and Excel from the Office Suite. Both are present in the taskbar at the bottom. I can open them both without problem. The point is that I don't want to have to open the application, then go looking for the file. I would like
 the defaults (in my account at least) to be Word 2016 &amp; Excel 2016.</p>
<p>WHAT I CAN'T DO (and would like to be able to do!): I want to be able to click on my word or excel files and for the files to open in the Office 2016 versions. My problems are different for Word and Excel so I will explain one at a time:</p>

<p>Before I go on, I will mention that the file location for the executable Word 2016 program does appear to be in the x86 program files location. I wonder whether that might be the problem. But WHY did it install the 32 bit version? It still appears to work
 when I open it directly....I certainly wouldn't have knowingly chosen x86/32 bit when I was installing it.</p>
<p>1. MY PROBLEM WITH WORD 2016: If I right click on a word file and go to OPEN WITH, there are these selections: WORD2010/SEARCH THE STORE/CHOOSE ANOTHER APP. Clearly I don't want to use Word 2010, so I try CHOOSE ANOTHER APP. &nbsp;Word 2010 again is listed, along
 with 'Look for an app in the store' &nbsp;and &nbsp;'Choose another app'. I look everywhere but no joy. So I went to Start&gt;All Apps to see if it is there. Word 2016 is listed there in all its glory. Right click&gt;More&gt;Open file location. This shows me a shortcut icon
 for Word at the bottom of the list. I click on the peach coloured Shortcut Tools and click on 'Open location'. &nbsp;This show me that This PC&gt;OS(C:)&gt;Program Files (x86) &gt; Microsoft Office &gt; root &gt; Office16 &gt; WINDWORD.EXE is the location. It certainly seems to
 be the right program as the icon is that distinctive dark blue blocky book with a white W on the front! So I think to myself. I know the file location so let's try to set the default or at least open the file with... So I do exactly that. I locate the WINWORD.EXE
 prgram as per the file path given above and.....oh! It opens in Windows 2010 again! Control Panel &gt; Programs &gt; Default Programs &gt; Set your default programs. Then I select Word 2016 (which incidentally appears to be using the Windows 2010 icon. I also did the
 same for Excel at this stage by the way (which does have the blocky green icon). Try to open them and STILL 2010!!! Arrrrgh!</p>
<p>2. MY PROBLEM WITH EXCEL 2016: All excel files (for instance a spreadsheet I use all the time is shortcut on my desktop) show up as the blocky green 2016 icon. If I try to open them, they open in 2010. If I right click, the green icon with the words EXCEL2016
 next to it is one of the choices. Choose it and.....still opens in 2010. I went through the same process to set the default. Very annoying.</p>
<p>Now. Just to reiterate. My wife DOES NOT HAVE A 365 ACCOUNT. HOWEVER I DO. I don't want to uninstall Office 2010 from the PC because I'm worried that she will have no access to Word. If anyone out there can categorically confirm for me that removing Office
 2010 and removing Office 2016 x86 then installing the 64 bit version will resolve the problem AND THAT MY WIFE WILL BE ABLE TO USE OFFICE 2016 WITHOUT AN ACCOUNT then I will. I CANNOT be left without word. Both of us have deadlines to make for numerous very
 important reports!</p>
<p>Sorry it's so long winded but the more information I give, the better a picture I have painted and the less to'ing and fro'ing that is necessary with your questions and suggestions of what to try.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi. I've just found out in a Word 2010 document that my Office 2010 installation is 32 bit (File&gt;Help). It's a licensed copy obviously. When I open Word 2016 directly and go to File&gt;Account it says that Version 16.0.6769.2017 is installed. I can't see whether
 it is x86 or 64 bit install, but from my last post it would see that I have Office 2016 installed as x86 32 bit. Which is a conflict isn't it? With Word 2016 open I go to Account then I see 'Manage account' which takes me to my account portal &gt;Manage Installs
 and I see that I have 2 detected installs, one on my PC and one on my Laptop. If I click on 'Install Desktop Applications' I see 'Install Office 365 Business with the new 2016 apps (Recommended)'. Language is English (United States) (for some reason there
 doesn't appear to be an English (UK) selection (Hmmmm!) and the version says 32-bit (Recommended). If I click Advanced I can change it to 64 bit. I guess I could uninstall Office2016 from both the PC and laptop and reinstall using 64 bit. But...I really would
 like some opinion from you clever lot out there first! Thanks.</p>

<p>dear daren,</p>

<h2>            simultaneous editing capability in Word&#63;</h2>
                    Hi,&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>is it possible to edit simultaneously with Word. To give some more detail. &nbsp;I have a co-author in Arizona. &nbsp;I live in New York. &nbsp;We're both working on a document. &nbsp;It has lots of tracked changes. &nbsp;Is there anyway we can work on it at the same time as we
 go through the edits on the phone?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>

            Hi Matthewlm,
<div><br />
<div>Co-authoring on a document, is one of the coolest new features in Microsoft Word 2010. &nbsp;There was even a nice
<a href="http://blogs.office.com/b/microsoft-word/archive/2009/09/09/co-authoring-in-word-2010.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
blog post</a> explaining how it worked. &nbsp;Documents can be co-authored on either SharePoint 2010 or SkyDrive, so long as both authors have edit permissions on the document. &nbsp;Co-authoring is
<a href="http://blog.officeformac.com/office-for-mac-2011-behind-the-scenes-co-authoring-office-web-apps-scheduling-assistant-broadcast-slideshow/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
also supported</a> on Word 2011 for Mac.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Recently, co-authoring <a href="http://blogs.office.com/b/officewebapps/archive/2011/07/07/now-available-co-author-documents-in-the-word-web-app.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
was added</a> to the Word Web App on SkyDrive. &nbsp;While this does work cross platform and cross browser, it is subject to any limitations of the Word Web App. &nbsp;Since the Word Web App cannot edit documents with tracked changes (or comments), you would need to
 resolve all tracked content (either accept or reject the change) and remove all comments in order to simultaneously edit the document your co-author in Arizona. &nbsp;After comments and tracked content is removed, the Word Web App will happily open (and co-author)
 the document.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope that helps,</div>

    <title>N95 Sat Nav Memory card change - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> golledge  say:</h3>
<h2>            N95 Sat Nav Memory card change</h2>
                    Hi<br />
I have recently got a N95 and upgraded the memory card from the 1gb that came with the phone to a 4gb one.<br />
<br />
The problem is that the upgrade is SanDisk and not a Nokia so certain sat nav/ map features are missing.<br />
<br />
I want to purchase navigation but am reluctant to do so until I have got everything on to my new memory card first.<br />
<br />
I have tried simply to copy files but have been told the memory card needs re formatting.<br />
<br />
I have also contacted ALK UK who do the co piolet for the GPS and they have advised me to download a SIS file but this is now all getting complicated and i feel I am digging a bigger hole.<br />
<br />
My service provider will not help - O2 , and I can't get through to Nokia tehnical support on the telephone.<br />
<br />
Help!!

            Hi golledge<br />
<br />
I know that o2 provided a microSD with pre-installed maps, but Nokia Maps application on N95 is not dependent upon this memory card.<br />
<br />
If you put your 1Gb microSD in card reader on PC and enable "show hidden and system files" you can transfer content to new folder on desktop; then copy it back onto your new 4Gb microSDHC.<br />
<br />
You could have downloaded extra maps or voices to your 1Gb card using Maploader application on your PC anyway.:(

<h2>            Could some be hacking my Skype&#63;  windows 7</h2>
                    <p>A while back I posted a question about the timestamp on voicemail . .how it was way off.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I noticed that the time on my computer keeps getting set somehow.&nbsp;&nbsp; Like yesterday it was 3 days behind and 2 hours later in the day.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have also noticed that
 one number registers as a call to me every day.&nbsp;&nbsp; I never hear it ring, but it is always there in my recent call notifications.&nbsp; It has never left a message and there is no answer if I try to call it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Yesterday, I was watching a video and noticed that I was getting that small popup window notifying me that one of my contacts was online.&nbsp; It happened a few times.&nbsp; Later that day, I heard my skype shut down and I was unable to log into it.&nbsp; I do know my
 username and password but it was not accepting them.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I haven't turned that computer on yet today.&nbsp; I am wondering what to do and if this sounds familiar to anyone.&nbsp; How can I stop it?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;Bandituk,</p>
<p>This issue occurs when instead of downloading the actual Word document, &nbsp;Microsoft Word pulls down a .srf file from SkyDrive. &nbsp;A .srf or "server response file" is not a supported Microsoft Word document. &nbsp;In this case, it is actually a website response saying
 something along the lines of "Javascript Required to Sign-In."</p>
<p>When trying to open the file in Microsoft Word, were you prompted to provide your Windows Live ID credentials?</p>
<p>Regardless, several different threads have suggested responses in the past. &nbsp;Since different threads have different posts marked as answers, I'll share numerous possibilities. &nbsp;Ocassionally this comes up with Microsoft Excel too, so where necessary replaces
 Microsoft Excel with Microsoft Word in these suggestions.</p>
<p>-------</p>
<p><strong>One Thread: &nbsp;<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/officewebapps/thread/072127a0-7bb0-4987-8764-857d1cea5341" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SkyDrive cannot open doc in Word2007 - javascript required to sign in??</a></strong></p>
<p>Had the following suggestion</p>
<blockquote>I had the same issue and obviously the given answers here were no help.&nbsp; I was finally able to resolve this by getting the error in Excel...<br />
<br />
1) Going to File-&gt;"Open from Office Live" -&gt; "Sign Out"<br />
<br />
2) Going to IE and Signing Out<br />
<br />
3) Going back to Excel and repeating Step 1<br />
<br />
4)Closing Word<br />
<br />
5)Opening Word and going to File -&gt; "Open from Office Live" -&gt; "Sign In"<br />
<br />
6)Leave it open, go back to IE and Sign In to SkyDrive<br />
<br />
7) Open in Word from SkyDrive and the file&nbsp;opened in Word properly finally<br />
<br />
Hope this helps, it seemed like it was a matter of the sign-in process&nbsp;</blockquote>

<p>Internet Explorer settings/cookies/etc. is not the problem.&nbsp; SkyDrive requires Live-ID (Passport)&nbsp;authentication to access documents, but when you signed in to the web app you only gave Internet Explorer your password.&nbsp;&nbsp;Word also needs that information which
 is why it's showing the .NET Passport Wizard.&nbsp; It is possible to disable this dialog as noted in&nbsp;<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa384067(VS.85).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this MSDN article</a>.&nbsp; Save the bolded text below as a ".reg" file and apply it to the
 machines:</p>
<p><strong>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00</strong></p>
<p><strong>[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\Passport]<br />
"NumRegistrationRuns"=dword:00000006</strong></p>
<p>That said, this only disables the wizard.&nbsp;&nbsp;When you click "Open in Word", Word is still going to ask you for your Live-ID/Passport username and password - without it SkyDrive will not let Word access the document.&nbsp; So you'll need to enter your credentials
 again.&nbsp; Although the Sign-In Assistant is supposed to bridge this gap, I'm not sure it works with Office 2007.</p>
<p>Regardless, I don't think a public terminal with a generic Windows account is very reliable or secure.&nbsp; As soon as somebody (say, Bob) clicks the "remember me" checkbox when signing in to SkyDrive, that account is stuck there and it's tricky to get off.&nbsp;
 If somebody else tries to use that machine (say, Alice) she'll have access to Bob's files and difficulty getting to her own.&nbsp;&nbsp;A domain or workgroup with individual Windows accounts will be more reliable and secure: once Bob logs off the machine that will lock
 Alice out of his SkyDrive.</p>

 required to sign in</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;(yes they had the same name) both seem to be confusing Java and Javascript.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>I've also seen suggestions that clearing your browser cache, stored passwords, and cookies can work. &nbsp;Most browsers allow you to get to this functionality by hitting ctrl+shift+delete. &nbsp;Keep in mind that clearing your cookies will sign you out of any website
 that maintains your credentials between visits.</p>
<p>Finally, I've heard that going: "start --&gt; run --&gt; control keymgr.dll", and clearing any credentials that reference passport, live, or hotmail... and then rebooting your computer, can work.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>As you can imagine, with so many different suggestions (and so many different people saying that one or the other worked for them), it is hard to give a definitive answer to this problem.</p>
<p>That said, the fact that the Word Web App almost certainly means that Javascript is running on your computer.</p>

            Try performing a soft reset (insert stylus in small reset hole) to see if that resolves your memory issue.<br />
