<p>when click on ok it says 'infopath cannot access the specified web service description' and hitting on show details says</p>

<p>From the URL, we can see it contains "_vti_" which is reserved by SharePoint and isn't support, so you got the above error message.<br />
<br />

<h2>            Outlook 2010 never completes indexing.</h2>
                    <p>I have a client that relies heavily on indexing to search her 7GB email file.&nbsp; I have already tried the following:</p>
<p>1) Delete email profile and created a new one.</p>
<p>2) Repair installion of Office&nbsp;2010.</p>
<p>3) Repaired Inbox&nbsp;using "Inbox Repair Tool".</p>
<p>4) Compacted Inbox (from 9.5GB down to 7.4GB).</p>
<p>5) Rebuilt Indexes and allowed an entire weekend for indexing to complete ... but it never does.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a ton of hits on Google about this very problem, but I have yet to find a successful answer.</p>
<p>She is running Windows 7 (64-bit) with Office 2010 (32-bit).</p>

            <p><span>On paper, outlook 2010 should be able to handle 7GB PST file, but in practice users face a lot of issues if PST file size exceeds 1.5 – 2 GB mark.
</span></p>
<p><span>In these cases, indexing will never end or just restarts without warning.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would recommend you to split the PST file into smaller PST file and check outlook.

<h2>            Can the present windows 10 pro 10130 be upgraded to 10162 or not&#63;</h2>
                    <p>* Original Title: Build 1062 more headaches</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trying to upgrade to the latest build 1062 on an x64 system. Downloaded the ISO from MS. Made a bootable disk. Booted the disk. Pick upgrade option. Tells me to start windows normally. And install from disk after log-in. Did so. Now it only gives me option
 to "KEEP NOTHING". Now running 10130 pro build. So this should be an upgrade. If windows update can install this WITHOUT deleting everything. Then what's MS's issue. Doing upgrade from disk because it seems everyone is having trouble with doing from windows
 update. If the only option MS is going to leave me with is clean install. Then windows 10 for me is dead. Not going to do a reinstall of everything again. I have my Windows 7 hard drive and will just unplug this one and plug that one in. Already got rid of
 the MS nagware on it. Sometimes wonder if MS hires crack heads to build their programs. Can't think of a single other software company that puts out such garbage software continuously and gets away with it. Should not have to be a software engineer to install
 and run software made for general public use. And yes I am logged into MS account and yes I do have the current serial, and yes I do have Windows 10 currently installed, and yes my computer is turned on, and yes am running as Administrator, and yes the Windows
 10 1062 disk is bootable, and yes I am launching setup from media disk, and yes this is an English version, and yes I can read (and most times speak) English. Does that about cover all the rhetorical questions MS staff love to ask. All I need to know is can
 the present windows 10 pro 10130 be upgraded to 1062 or not?</p>

            True that! Clean install was better. Every time I perform an upgrade something is always broken once I boot into the new desktop. That's not acceptable. MS needs to correct this.

            Let's get real here. Were talking MS software. Has MS EVER put out an OS that wasn't BETA. Just take a look at any other software developer, including Apple's OS. Not that I support apple's over inflated price for an over glorified windows clone, with
 a different logo. Those that do put out software in the condition MS does, are put out of business.
<br />
MS may SAY it's finished, but finished means at least 80% of bugs are gone. With MS it's the opposite 20% of bugs are gone. And the general public then finds the rest for them to fix (beta testing). What these builds are in reality are alpha test, meaning the
 software is still being designed, developed, and added to. Beta software is finished and just needs bugs found and fixed. If you doubt me, just ask any software development engineer (other than MS developers) and they'll tell you the same. BTW, I have beta
 tested for quite a few of them over the past 25 years, so have a little knowledge in this area. And I'm not disagreeing that a clean install would be best, I'm just not willing to go through all the hassle of reinstalling all my software, for a product that
 clearly is not going to be truly finished by the 29 of July. Which means, once again, the general public becomes their beta testers. Same story, different day. I just upgraded to 7 pro 8 months ago. I follow a simple rule since Windows ME. Don't install a
 new MS OS until MS announces it longer will support that OS. Then you will find about 80% of bugs gone. Rule # 2 is, never do a windows update until at least 5 days after it is released. I've seen the problems people have gone through with new MS OS's over
 the years, and the patches gone bad headaches. Most of which I avoided by following these 2 rules. That's the reason I have 7 on another disk, ready to be plugged back in. I did the Windows 7 upgrade at the same time as I had my "Enterprise", (since only MS
 can be called a Corporation),upgrade from XP. At this point seems like 10 is going to be another Vista or 8 in a shiny new box. I can be wrong, but it's going to take MS a lot of work, (not fancy words) for that to happen.

            <p>Wicked Action:</p>
<p>First thing, if you were just updating from window 7, 8 or 8.1 you should have been given three options (one of those 3 option would be install and keep all personal files-incl apps).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If from another w10 preview build I do not believe you could count on having same choices when your updating from one w10 build to another w10 build</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you get iso file through Gabe Aul tweet:</p>
<p style="color: rgba(17, 17, 17, 1)">
Earlier today, Microsoft's head of Windows Insider Program, Gabriel Aul&nbsp;announced that&nbsp;the latest build is now&nbsp;also available as an ISO for users who wish to install it through other media devices such as a DVD or a USB drive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We decided to go ahead and release the 10162 ISOs to&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WindowsInsiders?src=hash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">#WindowsInsiders</a>&nbsp;ahead
 of Slow ring release. Available now at&nbsp;<a href="http://t.co/LOuJOruJUQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://t.co/LOuJOruJUQ</a></p>

 3, 2015</a></blockquote>
<p>check product key from the website that you got your iso file from and see if that key matches Gabe Aul's directed site product key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you installed build 10130 with iso file you could very well have screwed-up install. A lot of insiders have had problems with build 10130.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest getting build 10162 iso file and installing that build. &nbsp;</p>

<p>First, this is my 3rd build install on this machine.</p>
<p>Second, the other 2 builds had no issues with install.</p>
<p>Therefore machine model (which is a professional custom build) is not issue.</p>
<p>Or it would have been on other build installs.</p>

            <p>Downloaded ISO from MS site and had no issue with product key entry.</p>
<p>Had 10130 installed and it was NOT a screwed up install.</p>
<p>Did you even read my post.</p>
<p>Been installing programs since windows ME. And have been a beta tester for many company's for the past</p>
<p>25 years. I can handle putting media on disk. And the disk booted fine and was able to enter serial fine.</p>
<p>So bootable dvd is not the issue. The issue is why we can upgrade this build from windows update and can only</p>
<p>do a clean install from DVD. And as I stated. I agree a clean install is great if your intending a long term engagement of this OS. I'm testing it in order to see if it's going to be actually a finished OS when it's released to public. Or same as it has
 always been, where their finished is really not finished. All other software developers call it finished when it's at least 80% bug free not 20% bug free. MS has a history of doing public releases of OS's as finished. But based on industry standards it's actually
 a beta version. And the public has paid MS to beta test their OS. That is the reason I follow rule 1. This rule helped me avoid all the hassles Vista and 8 users went through. And why I went from XP to 7. Skipped Vista altogether. And will skip 8 also. XP
 worked for me and my "Enterprise" for over 10 years. Maybe I'll end up doing same with 7. Which now sits on a hard drive just waiting to be plugged back in. At least I'm still willing to try a MS OS first, before denouncing it. I believe that people, and company's,
 can correct themselves, if they choose to. But honesty has never been a strong point of the MS Corporation. And that opinion is based on experience acquired since 1988.

</p><p>Skype contacts are tied to the account and are saved on Skype's servers, which is why you can access them on any supported platform
<strong>as long as you are signed in to the correct account</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>There are two reasons why you do not see the contacts you are looking for on your account. It is either you have removed them from your contact list or you are accessing a different account. I strongly suggest that you sign out and make sure to sign back
 in using the credentials you used to initially create your account. You can use the
<strong><a href="https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Accounts Diagnostic link</a></strong> to determine whether you have multiple accounts or not. Enter the email address associated with your account and click Continue.

<h2>            Switching from Office 365 to Office 2016</h2>
                    I purchased Office 365 a year ago. It has expired. I want to know, if I decide to purchase Office 2016, can I transfer my work from Office 365 (excel spread sheets) to Office 2016? Or, do I have to purchase Office 365 to keep on working with my old spread
 sheets?

            Office 365 and 2016 are essentially one and same thing. The only difference is that "Office 365" is the name given to the subscription version of Office 2016.

            Office 365 is mainly a marketing name for the rental / 'subscription' way of selling Office 2016.  
<br />
<br />The files created by both are interchangeable. 
<br />
<br />The is one significant difference. Office 365 gets new features periodically that 2016 did not.  Here is a link to a blog listing the new features as they were released
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/what-s-new-in-office-365-95c8d81d-08ba-42c1-914f-bca4603e1426?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/what-s...</a>
<br />
<br />Many / most ? of these new features will be included in 2019. There is no official notice yet exactly which will make the code.
<br />
<br />
<br />OFFICE 2019 FREE UPGRADE OFFER OPTION
<br />MS wants us to switch to 365 away from the 1-time payment licenses.  They made a number of changes to the license terms to make 365 a better deal for some people. But for others, one-time payment licenses are still better. 
<br />
<br />MS has announced that 2019 will be released "some time second half this year". Well we are there, now! The specific date is still unknown. In the past, when they finally got around to announcing the general availability release date they also had a “free upgrade offer” to keep money coming in during the last couple of months. In the past the offer was buy the current Office during the “qualifying period” and you will get a “free upgrade” to equivalent bundle of the new release of Office. Long ago there was an “upgrade” license that depended on and replaced the older version, but MS discontinued that "upgrade" type license in 2010. So if we are lucky the "free upgrade" will give you a standalone license for 2019.  That would give you both the 2016 and 2019 licenses continuing to work.
<br />
<br />Can you make due with the Online version of Outlook till that offer is made? If not you could get the monthly subscription to 365 until the offer is made. 
<br />
<br />You can also get a free 30 day evaluation of 2016 Pro from technet: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-office-365-proplus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/eval...</a> 
<br />
<br />that may be just enough time to get to the offer.
<br />
<br />2012 09 19 EXAMPLE: OFFICE 2013 “PRE-LAUNCH OFFER” TERMS - EXPIRED MAY 31 2013
<br /><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/offer/pre-launch-offer-details-and-terms-FX102902434.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/offer/pre-lau...</a> 
<br /> 
<br />    •	Eligibility: You must purchase, install, and activate your Office 2010 or Office for Mac 2011 product from October 19, 2012 to April 30, 2013.
<br />    •	Redemption Period: You must redeem the offer at Office.com/offer before May 31, 2013.
<br />
<br />IS THE 2010 TO 2013 “PRE-LAUNCH OFFER” AN “UPGRADE” LICENSE THAT REPLACES THE 2010 LICENSE, OR IS IT A “FREE, ADDITIONAL” FULL LICENSE
<br />
<br />I was given a full, standalone Office 2013 Home &amp; Student Product key when I redeemed the “free upgrade offer”.  I have no way of knowing if that will apply this time.

            Hi Elizabeth,
<br />
<br />Your documents will be unaffected by going form one version of Office to the other!
<br />
<br />Before installing Office 2016, use this tool from Microsoft to remove all remnants of the previous Office 365 Installation:

            Hello Elizabeth
<br />
<br />If your files are stored locally any of the subscriptions you decide to buy can use your documents without problems.
<br />
<br />With the Office 365 subscription service, you will always have the most up-to-date Microsoft tools.
<br />
<br />All Office 365 plans for home and personal use include Office 2016 with the Office applications you are familiar with fully installed, such as Word, PowerPoint, and Excel, plus additional online storage, ongoing technical support at no additional cost, and many more. advantage. You can choose to pay a subscription on a monthly or annual basis. In addition, the Office 365 Home plan allows you to share the subscription with up to four family members.
<br />
<br />With Office 2016 Single-payment purchases do not have an upgrade option, which means that if you plan to upgrade to the next major version, you will have to buy it at your full price.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let me know how it goes.
<br />
<br />Best Regards

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On my Lumia 625 I preset the volume to a number (as you do) and after a while it changes to a lower number by itself. Is there any way I can make sure this doesn't happen?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>- Opened the backup again; saved As “! Playbook Database”</p>

<p>- Attempted to open the form again (crash)</p>

<p>- Opened the backup again; saved As “! Playbook Database”; compacted and repaired database</p>

<p>- Attempted to open the form again (crash)</p>

<p>- Opened the backup again; saved As “! Playbook Database”; opened “T_Playbook_Main” (okay)</p>

<p>- Attempted to open the form again (crash)</p>

<p>- Closed my programs and logged off the VPN.</p>

<div>I would have to see the entire SQL for the query and know how you're opening it. &nbsp;Is it the Record Source of a Report? &nbsp;The Report engine can need multiple passes, so you get prompted on each pass. &nbsp;Why not use a parameter that points to a value on an
 open form? &nbsp;The syntax for a parameter that points to a control on a form is:</div>
<div><br />

<h2>            Access files will not send in e-mail attachment.  &#40;RESOLVED&#41;</h2>
                    I am attaching a frontend and a backend, zipped and attached to e-mail. The e-mail and zipped attachment are not leaving the orgainization. Is there an issue for any zipped files under Access 2007 that would not allow for sending those files to a business
 for analysis through the businesses e-mail address???<br />
<br />
Found out I had to add another character to the mdb or the mde extension in order to get outside our organization's firewall, due to Zip file extensions are not allowed with executables.&nbsp; Once I added the characters to Access file extensions. the e-mail program
 would send out the Access files under Zip format. Just have to tell everybody to take the extra character off the access extensions.<br />

            <p>It sounds to me like the email application you are using or the email application the person you are sending it is blocking certain file extension and / or the file size is
 too large.<span>&nbsp; </span>You will need to talk to the person that administers your email to see if these files extensions are being blocked.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You could also try changing the file extensions of the database files to something else (ex. .txt) before you zip them and then if the files go through, have the other person change the file extension back.</p>

            First are you using Exchange? If so, have you checked with your e-mail admin to make sure the files are being sent from the Exchange server. If you aren't using Exchange, you need to check with your e-mail service.<br />
<br />
If they are leaving, then you need to check with the recipient. If they aren't being received, they need to check their spam or danger filters to see if they are being blocked.<br />
<br />
By the way, this is not really an Access issue, but an e-mail issue.<br />

<h2>            Outlook 2016 - Signatures showing as attachments.</h2>
                    <p>Hi All.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have 5 new machines, and have just had a refresh from win 7 /office 2007 -</p>
<p>We name have Win 10 Pro and Office 2016 Prof.</p>
<p>We use an "IMAP" connection string.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our signatures include our contact details and our logo</p>
<p>The logo is an embedded picture, with is located on our web-site. We have done that by using an "Http link"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have a problem , with Outlook- Sent items , showing our "logo" as an attachment , so all our sent items have the paper clip, which makes it is impossible to see any items we sent , which has a real file attached.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I posted this problem a few weeks ago, and got some advice, but that did not resolve the issue. However I have done a bit more investigation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On one of the machines , I created a new user account and set up the outlook profile, using an existing email address, and can send emails with our "Logo" , without it showing up as an attachment.</p>
<p>The only difference I can see is that . with the new user , does not have a "PST" file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As part of the upgrade I transferred the existing users', had local "pst" files, for contacts and calendars.</p>
<p>Therefore the only difference I can see is that , each user has local "pst" file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I can see, the problem is down to having a local PST file, so would be grateful for any input / advice.<br />
</p>
<p>Or it is something else?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

<p>Hi Thanks for the Quick reply</p>
<p>
</p><p>For clarification.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Mail format is HTML</p>
<p>2. Yes Imap does store data in *.ost file, but you can also have a local pst to hold calendar and contacts. Even an Archive file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. We had 5 machines , with users data. We have got 5 new machines, so the Users data , documents etc., was copied from their old machine to the new machine. The outlook profiles , were created from scratch, on the new machines. Being IMAP , their email
 PST file, so they had access to their Contacts and Calendars.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To clarify</p>
<p>1.</p>
<p>new machines with Windows 10.</p>
<p>new installation of office 2016.</p>
<p>created a user "Jim"</p>
<p>jim was a user on the old kit.</p>
<p>created. An outlook profile for "Jim"</p>
<p>created a new signature with a logo.</p>
<p>copied Jim's pst &nbsp;file from the old machine to new machine.</p>
<p>that pst file is opened in jim's outlook environment.</p>
<p>When an email is sent. </p>
<p>In the &nbsp; List of emails sent a paper clip is shown. Next to the message</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>2. To try and identify the problem.</p>
<p>I created a new user on the pc.</p>
<p>logged on to the pc as the new user</p>
<p>created a new outlook profile.</p>
<p>created a new signature with logo using the same technique.</p>
<p>all worked as it should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can only think the difference is the pst file</p>

            If you make a new profile in jim's user account that doesn't have the pst, does it send the image as an attachment? 
<br />
<br />Did you move any registry settings from the old computer?  The  'Send Pictures With Document' registry value is no longer needed. You only need to insert the image by clicking on the Picture button, paste the url,  expand the Insert button and choose Link to file.

<p>Hi&nbsp; Diane.</p>
<p>Thanks for the response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp;<span>If you make a new profile in jim's user account that doesn't have the pst, does it send the image as an attachment? &nbsp; . No.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2.I did not move any registry settings. I created all accounts and profiles from Scratch. All I did was copy the data and the pst files from the old PC's to the new PC's.&nbsp; The other piece of data&nbsp; I copied was the NK2s</span></p>
<p>3. I created the signatures from scratch, which included a logo. Which is achieved by inserting a Http link from the website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I can determine. I have two different user accounts on the same pc, therefore running the same operating system and the same version of office.</p>
<p>The only difference I can see , is that one user has an additional PST file. This user has a paperclip symbol when sending an email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other user, does not have any additional pst, and no paperclip when sending</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both are setup with a signature, which has a logo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Makes no sense to me , why having a PST file should make any difference.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Jim</p>

            It makes no sense to me either - but I'm looking into it. So far I can't repro, which is why I asked about the key. 
<br />
<br />did you try removing the pst from the original profile? or a new profile with an empty pst?

</p><p>Previously there was an setting to choose wether it was always on while charging or would go off after a set amount of time but this option has disappeared and so my phone since the last update has been displaying it for the entire night while charging which
 is&nbsp; worrying considoring my 950's OLED screen would be susceptible to burn in..</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is a workaround for this issue I would love to know - if not&nbsp; someone in the team please alert the engineers at work on WM10 to this issue! One workaround I found was to put the phone face down triggering the proximity sensor which will switch the
 glance screen off but obviously this is less than ideal with the clutter on my bedside table ^^</p>

            <p>Hi again Sujata,</p>
<p>
</p><p>No; as of the last update, 'extras' has Advanced Info, Colour Profile, Equaliser, Lumia Motion Data, Network Services and Touch, none of which contain any settings to do with Glance; all of its settings are now under&nbsp; Personalisation&gt;Glance Screen, and the
 option to set any sort of timeframe for it is only possible for "On battery, show Glance screen for"</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no more settings than this, and its behaviour here&nbsp; as well as with everyone else with the latest windows 10 mobile update&nbsp; is that glance screen stays on all the time while charging, which will cause burn in issues with OLED phones if the issue
 persist.. </p>

<h2>            Can I lock outlook email folders so they cannot be moved&#63;</h2>
                    My mother is 92 years old and still enjoys using Email.&nbsp;I have tried to help her&nbsp;organize her emails by setting up folders for her to&nbsp;move them into.&nbsp; But when she moves an email into a folder, inevitably she moves that folder or another one.&nbsp; The result
 is she&nbsp;cannot even find the folder let alone find&nbsp;the email&nbsp;she is looking for.&nbsp; I can usually find them for her using Remote Assistance. But she gets so frustrated!!&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there a way to lock her outlook folders so that she cannot move them?&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to
 make it easier for her to keep using her computer.&nbsp; Thanks.

            <p>Not an option. One alternative is to get her used to right-clicking on an email message --&gt; Move to folder --&gt; Select the folder.</p>
<p>It's more steps and certainly not as convenient as "Drag 'n Drop" but it will avoid the inadvertent movement of a folder. Just a matter&nbsp;of getting used to it which also realize is "easier said then done" in all kinds of legitimate situations.</p>

<p>How do I get Outlook to stop adding a "+1" in front of a telephone number that has an extension.&nbsp; It does not do this for phone numbers added that have no extension.<br />
When I synch Outlook to my HTC Ozone Mobile, look up a contact and press enter to dial a phone number the HTC is interpreting the "+1" as country code 011 and dialing that before the telephone number.</p>
<p>I.e. if the phone number represented in Outlook is <br />
+1 (401) 270-1099 x 405<br />
My mobile is dialing: 0114012701099405</p>

            Are you hitting the button (Busines..., Home... ) in Outlook to open the check number dialog? Don't! The +1 should not be added if you just type 2025551212x1234 but as soon as you use the check phone number dialog, it will be added.

<p>Thanks Diane, that did it.&nbsp; When I've entered a new contacts information I've been entering the phone number (2025551212), clicked anywhere else on the contact form and then double clicked the phone number so that it opened the "check phone number box" and
 then I would enter the extension and click ok.&nbsp; This is when it was adding the +1 to the begining of the phone number.</p>
<p>I did not know you could enter the phone # and then x and extension and it would all be placed properly into the correct fields.&nbsp; Mystery and problem solved.</p>
<p>Can't thank you enough!&nbsp; And thank you as well Russ.</p>

<h3> ed nottingham  say:</h3>
<h2>            embedded video information&#47;name</h2>
                    <p>Moved from Office (PPT) 2007 to 2010.&nbsp; My presentation include a number of embedded videos, and in PPT 2007 it was possible to click on "information" (I think or something like that), and have access to *.wmv, *.mpg file name, duration, etc.</p>
<p>I'm sure there's a way to get this information in PPT 2010, but I've spent way too much time searching and have come up empty (even something about "extracting" did not work).</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Thanks so much for the quick and helpful input.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the videos I'm looking at (right now in fact), the "Trim Video" section is grayed out and no info.</p>
<p>STOP THE PRESSES ...</p>
<p>I just tried "upgrade media object" and after that all the info and trimming capacity is there!</p>
<p>Mystery solved and without your input, I'd still be stuck!</p>

            <p>An update and FYI:&nbsp; Good news is that I can identify the name.</p>
<p><br />
Bad News:&nbsp; When the PPT files were converted to PPTX and then "Upgrade Media Object," when I ran the new version it crashed continuously.&nbsp; I did some detective work and it seems that it happened after "Upgrade Media Object," not just conversion to PPTX.</p>
<p>So be careful.&nbsp; I wasted a lot of time getting my presentations back in working condition.</p>

            That is a question you will have to ask the makers of your MP3 player Vickie.&nbsp;
<p>I've never participated in their forums but my guess is that you should get some help there.&nbsp;

<p>I right clicked the speaker icon ( lenovo windows 7 64-bit), then i went to playback and set headset as default, and i did the same for recording. &nbsp;Problem resolved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Specifically, the problem i was having went like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;I struggled initialy to install bluetooth drivers ( woulden't install because it said no bluetooth device).</p>
<p>Then i went into bios and enabled the bluetooth... Duh. &nbsp;(took 2 weeks to discover that).</p>
<p>After bluetooth successfuly installed, i successfully paired my device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I opened skype and made voice call... It worked perfectly.</p>
<p>However, when i attenpted to listen to music, it didn't quite work.</p>
<p>The headset controls could remote control the itunes app, but audio did not transfer to headset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then i made the above mentioned adjustments and now everything works perfect.</p>

<p>I bought BH-505 today and this is how I made it work.</p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong></p>
<p>I paired it, but windows did not recognize it as a sound device. No sound via headphone.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>I updated my bluetooth software via my notebook manufacturer's page. Then I could "show bluetooth devices" via right clicking bluetooth icon in the taskbar notification area. When I left clicked on the BH-505 icon for the first time, Windows could control
 it, and install it as a sound device.</p>
<p>Now it works for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>

            Can you check if your time is correct? Go to Settings &gt; date and time. If your phone has an auto time update you can just enable that as well.
