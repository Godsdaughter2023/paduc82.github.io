<h2>            Where are my old emails&#63;</h2>
                    I've been searching for emails that are very important to me from years past and realised that none of my emails from roughly 2008 and back are showing up on my Outlook account - I created a Hotmail account in 1997. Where have my old emails gone and can
 I get them back?? This is very upsetting. I thought my Hotmail emails would always be there, or I would be told so I could at least download them.

            <p>Hi Kaiberlan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to Microsoft Community. I apologize that it took us more time than usual to reply to your question. I understand that you're searching for your old emails from the past years and none of your emails from roughly 2008 and back are showing
 up. Let me assist you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to inform you that there are some reasons why you can't see some of your old emails. And the reasons are the following:</p>
<p><br />
1. Due to inactivity in account.<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If your emails were over 365 days old, you may have lost them due to inactivity in account even before you renamed the account.<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you were accessing your emails on a mail client such as Windows Live Mail or through your mobile device, but didn’t log into your web account.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If your account was hacked and the hacker had already deleted emails in your account.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the feature Conversation Threading feature is turned on.&nbsp; <br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you use Sweep to schedule a cleanup. Go to this <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/outlook/clean-inbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<u>link</u> </a>to see what Sweep can do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can follow the steps on this article<u><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/outlook/recover-deleted-messages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> "Restore deleted email messages in Outlook.com"</a></u> to try to Restore deleted email messages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, once the account was accessed via mail client or other device. POP is enabled and the option to “Do what my other program says—if it says to delete messages, then delete them.” is selected. all emails from the inbox will be downloaded to the mail client
 or other device and will be removed from the web mailbox. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For this, we cannot retrieve the emails that were lost. For future reference, we suggest you to do the following:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enable the option, Don't let another program delete messages from Outlook.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make sure that the option to “Leave a copy of message on the server.” Is enabled from your mail client.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To further investigate the issue, I will need your help by providing all the details and information of the affected account in order for us to fully diagnose what is the root cause of this issue. For the security and sensitivity of your account information,
 we will assist you privately.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will now locked this thread to avoid others from posting their personal information and encourage them to submit their own private request.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
        </p>

            I bought a new computer with Windows 8 and since then all my emails are disappearing after 2 weeks and all the old emails have disappeared too! I have a message on the bottom that says:<br />
<div>
<div>
<div>
<br />
<span>"What's in this folder? These are the messages that you downloaded to another program using POP.
<br />
If you'd like downloaded messages to be permanently deleted, you can <a href="https://blu179.mail.live.com/mail/#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
change your settings</a>"<br />
<br />
Why are you doing this to us?!?!?!?!!? <br />
I didn't downloaded my emails to nowhere!!!<br />
How can I retrieve my old emails?<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />
If this problem is not resolved I will have no choice than to use a new email. <br />

            Hi Edgar,
<div><br />
<div>Thanks very much for responding to my post and I'm sorry its taken me a while to write back as I was away over the holidays. I have taken the steps you recommended but no luck and I would love your help to see if its possible to recover my old emails from
 2008 and earlier.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>My email is *** Email address is removed for privacy *** - basically when I scroll back to the earliest page in my inbox I get to page 800 with 28000 emails and the earliest one is dated 12/05/2008. Where are the earlier ones and is there any way to recover them? I've had
 my account since 1997.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Please let me know what other information you require in order to search. All the lost emails were in my inbox and not deleted, just to let you know.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Many thanks,</div>
<div><br />
<div>Kind regards,</div>
<div><br />
<div>Antonia</div>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same problem but none of the reasons you list above are applicable.</p>
<p>- I have held the hotmail account for many years before 2008</p>
<p>- I only access it through the hotmail url - until about 2 years ago when I started accessing through a POP client on my phone which only downloads the most recent 30 or so emails, so emails prior to 2008 have never been downloaded to the POP client.</p>
<p>- I don't have conversation threading turned on (wasn't aware this was available through the hotmail url)</p>
<p>- I've never used any sweep facility on my otmail account</p>
<p>- So far (touch wood), my account has never been hacked, and if it had been, to only delete ancient emails would be bizarre behaviour in the extreme.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there some automatic archiving process in place?&nbsp; As per the original question, I would hope (and expect) to have been warned if my emails were going to be deleted, so that I could do my own backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope you can help, as I really need to get to some old emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards</p>
<p>
</p><p>Amina</p>

            <p>After Office 2010 MS has really messed around with their licensing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They no longer offer "upgrades" for the one-time-payment licenses, like Office 2010 and Office 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They also have switched their marketing focus to Office 365, away from one-time-payment licenses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bottom line there is no direct license upgrade from 2010 to 2013 or 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will have to buy a new license, either one-time-payment one for 2016 or a 365 subscription (rental).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>365 does include "free" upgrade", aka "new features" during the life of the subscription and "free upgrade" to the new version of Office whenever it comes out.

<h2>            Trouble downloading and installing Microsoft Office 2010 student version Colorado Technical University sent me</h2>
                    I sent you this problem before why aren't you answering me or paying attention. I told you before that the online school I am taking courses in Colorado Technical University gives out their students free of charge the Microsoft Office Professional Plus
 2010 Student version. I followed the exact directions for the downloading and installation, but all I got was an error message saying Something went wrong, try repairing office from the Programs and Features in the control panel. I don't have any type of office
 in the control panel, so can you please help or tell me what the problem is?

            <p>Hello Carmen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We know how frustrating it is when Office does not install or work properly. I will be helping you with this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The ‘Something went wrong error message’ appears due to the presence of Office 2013 or Office 365 components on your computer. Note, this error could arise even if you do not have Office 2013 or Office 365 version showing in the list of your Programs (Programs
 and Features menu) or the Start Menu, as there may be some remnants of the Office 2013/365 software on your computer from a previous installation or installation attempt.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To resolve this issue I would suggest you to run the following Microsoft FIXITs:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We shall un-install Office 2010 or the remnants of Office 2010 which might still be present on your computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>We shall un-install Office 2010 completely by running the Office 2010 FIXIT tool.</li><li>Download/install and run the Office 2010 FIXIT tool from the following link: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971179" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971179</a>&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>Now we shall run the Office 2013 FIXIT: </p>
<ul>
<li><span>In order to un-install Office remnants from your computer, you will have to install and run the Office 2013 FIXIT tool. Please run the tool even if you do not have Office 2013 showing in your list of programs at present – as there may be remnants
 of a previous installation of Office on your computer. </span></li><li><span>Download / Install and run the Office 2013 FIXIT tool again from the following link:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501</a></span><span>&nbsp;</span></li></ul>
<p><span>After the above step is completed make sure to restart your computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Now, try downloading Office Professional Plus 2010 and save the download to the desktop on your computer (Saving the installation file is an important step). Try running the installation file to install Office Professional Plus 2010.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the above step and let me know the result. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
<span>Thank you.</span></p>

<h2>            I can&#39;t call USA numbers covered by my subscription from my Skype app on my Android phone any more. It used to work fine.</h2>
                    I can't call USA numbers covered by my USA subscription from my Skype app on my Android phone any more. It used to work fine. My version is 8.42.0.77. When i dial the number (it says covered by subscription) after I press call the screen switches and at
 the top left corner it shows the chat icon - ths is the only thing that seems a bit odd (as I use the keypad to type in the number to call) and then the call just cuts out with the call cut noise which happens before any ringtone. I can call the same number
 using skype on my laptop, but its more convenient using the mobile for making calls. The chat support could not solve the issue and was a waste of time, to chat again will likely be another wasted effort as he/she just going through every single setting, redundant
 questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Having just lashed up a merge document in Publisher I found no problem merging to the printer, using either PrimoPDF as suggested by DavidF2 or PDFCreator.&nbsp; The merge does however produce only one large PDF containing all the records.
<br />
<br />
I doubt that it is possible to produce separate merged PDF documents for each record without the help of VBA.<br />
<br />
If you can create your newsletter in Word, you could use instead <a href="http://www.gmayor.com/ManyToOne.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.gmayor.com/ManyToOne.htm</a> which will not only create the newsletters as PDFs but will email them to the recipients.<br />

            If you want a macro to split the merge, then merge to a new document, set the printer to PDFCreator change the path where indicated in bold to where you wish to save the files and run the Splitmerge macro. The macro assumes the newsletters are one page.
 You would have to adjust the counter for multi-page newsletters.<br />

Congrats on finding a workaround, but it suggests to me that perhaps your file is larger than it need be. If you have not compressed your images you might try that and see if that helps.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 keeps reinstalling the wrong driver</h2>
                    <p>Every time my computer does its update cycle it, without asking (and without any way to change this), forces a download and install of the most 'recent' touchpad driver for my laptop. However, this driver does not work. The driver that does work is a slightly
 older one that I have to reinstall after every single Windows update cycle. Is there any way to stop it constantly reinstalling the same driver over and over again? Why can't I have the options to; A) Not automatically download and install updates, B) Unschedule
 a specific update, C) Stop Windows from updating a certain device... I'm being pigeon-holed so much I feel like I've installed iOS on my computer.</p>

            <p>Automatic driver updates are often problematic on some configurations they should default to off<br />
or present a choice on OS installation/configuration &nbsp;or an on /off function in &nbsp;setting app &gt;win update&nbsp;or update permissions should be like win 7 &nbsp;but it's not the fix is below &nbsp;:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
right click start button &gt; select control panel &gt;System &gt;advanced system settings &gt; hardware&gt;<br />
device installation settings &gt; Select "No let me choose what to do " &gt; Select "Never &nbsp;install driver software &nbsp;from windows update" &nbsp;&gt; save changes and exit . ☺<br />
</p>
<p>Note : you &nbsp;still may still have to manually update (roll back ) your affected driver *if* windows installs it concurrently with each &nbsp;update if not in any event before that takes place or in between (new builds) this will disable automatic updates .</p>
<p>
</p><p>&lt;this setting is *not retained* &nbsp;with a new build update and must be enabled (preferably right away ) with each new install &gt;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How to hide Sender and Return-Path in mail header&#63;</h2>
                    <p>On my mail-account I have many different aliases for the same domain. When I write mails, I set the from-address by hand every time and send the mail via standard server with a single account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is, that Outlook (Office 365) always sets two fields "Sender" and "Return-Path" into the mail header which shows the main-address of the account. So I wish that Outlook does not even set these fields at all or set them to the individual address
 I wrote to the from-field of that single mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any tweak for doing that? If not I need to keep doing my mail on Thunderbird.</p>

            <p>Short answer is "you can't" on any count.</p>
<p>- cannot change the name of any existing standard Outlook field - ever, under any circumstances<br />
- cannot change the "field name" of a user-defined field via the Outlook UI<br />
- cannot change the "field type" of an existing user-defined field (whether added to the item using standard messageclass (IPM.Contact) or a custom form name (IPM.Contact.SomeFormName)</p>
<p>If you are in custom form mode - you &lt;can&gt; change the field caption which appears on the form but &lt;cannot&gt; change the underlying field name (field caption and field name are two different items which "appear" to be the same since Outlook assigns the name
 you enter to both by default.</p>
<p>What you also &lt;can&gt; do is create a user-defined field at the folder level (for standard contacts), assign it any property type, delete it at any point, re-add the same field name and assign it a different property type. This is fine if you have not added
 to the individual contact items that already have the field and thus may have a value which does not correspond to the new field type definition found at the &lt;folder level&gt;</p>

(CTK has special functions specifically for user-defined fields that enable the above capability to cover both the folder definition as well as any contact items that&nbsp;also have the same UDF field - however, changing a field type from&nbsp;&lt;text&gt;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&lt;date&gt;&nbsp;(as a
 for instance) and the field value&nbsp;does not&nbsp;contain a valid date value is not going to be productive resulting in&nbsp;loss of info).<br />

            Currently the Windows Marketplace for Mobile is supported in 31 countries/regions. Unfortunatly Malaysia isn't listed as one of the supported regions. So you'll be unable to purchase from the Marketplace for now. Microsoft is said to be expanding the regions
 in which the Marketplace is available and will make announcements as new regions are added.

<h2>            IE on Mobile5</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a Dell X51 with Mobile 5.0.&nbsp; It is about 2yrs old and I have never been able to access a particular website with it.&nbsp; I always get the message...I believe from the site host...that says
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The minimum browser requirements for ***** are as follows: Internet Explorer 5.0 or later&nbsp;&nbsp; or&nbsp;&nbsp; Netscape 6.0 or later.&nbsp;&nbsp; Please update your browser..."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I assumed there is a security level that my current mobile browser will not support.&nbsp; Is there an IE update that I can get that will allow me to access this website?&nbsp;</p>
<p>thx</p>

<p>No, sorry but the version of Pocket IE that comes on your phone is the only version of Pocket IE available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically, they don't relate.&nbsp; There is something in the version information of Pocket IE that makes it stand out.&nbsp; For example, you can go to
<a href="http://www.weather.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.weather.com</a> on your phone with Pocket IE and you will be automatically redirected to the mobile version of weather.com, which is much, much smaller than the full blown
<a href="http://www.weather.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.weather.com</a> you get on your computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can try one of the other browsers that are available for Windows Mobile if you would like, such as Opera and see if they can browse to that site.&nbsp; Based on the feedback though, it sounds like they only accept IE 5 or later, and Netscape
 5.0 or later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looks like you can try this software for free, for 30 days.</p>

 you can get this app. Ask a parent to go to windows.com/family on their computer, sign in with their Microsoft account, and set up My Family." So, I go to the link given and it leads me to my My Family page and does not give me any more prompts or agreements
 or anything else that I need to do to finish setting up. How should I go and install apps? (Btw I have a Nokia Lumia 1020)

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I recently purchased Office 365 and used my usual email address and created a password.&nbsp; It seemed to work ok (eventually) and got an activation email. Using the same email and password now I am told the account does not
 exist. I can't even use the "forgot password" option as is says the account does not exist regardless of the fact that I successfully loaded Office 365 on the first of 5 computers?&nbsp; Where do I go from here?</span></p>

            The posting here is really confusing. It took me a half hour to figure out how to post a question. Obviously Microsoft doesn't really test there stuff before releasing it...
<div><br />

            Dan,
<div><br />
<div>I am having a similar issue. I downloaded my subscription from OnTheHub used by Embry-Riddle University. I paid the price both ways. The customer service at Microsoft is absolutely deplorable and inept. Constant phone transfer drops and nobody calls back
 after they asked for my phone number in case the call drops. It's bad enough waiting 30 to 40 minutes to end up back in that classic telephone loop where the customer has to start back at square one. The issues that I am having is with my Office Account not
 being setup. I get the message to check back later, I don't recall seeing an error code like yours. What I notice is that my icon for my Windows Live and Outlook accounts does not show up in my Office account and so I'm sure it's tied to the idiots that work
 the activation issues at Microsoft. I really needed access to Office for my mid-term coursework that is due this weekend. When I was promised that Level 2 Tech Support would contact me today, I knew I was getting the runaround because I had to call up seeing
 how the business day was about to end here on the West Coast. They never intended to make any effort to contact me. All I remember from the get go was try a different browser, did that and yet on Microsoft's Office 365 compatibility page it states there are
 no issues with using Chrome which may in fact be a lie and deceiving customers who prefer to use Google Chrome. In addition, I called back again and was informed "Oh they are having activation issues." Then why was I not told this only a half-hour earlier?
 The customer service representatives lie because they can't figure it out and today I was lied to about the rep not being able to get a hold of anybody at Level 2 Tech Support - which is mysteriously unreachable or maybe does not exist at all. Who knows! I
 really didn't want Office 365 University but I am forced to use it as most students are.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I just recently when into my account profile and looked for transactions, the purchase does show up and I ensured to save a .PDF file of the document knowing that Microsoft Support will lose stuff such as uninstalling my trial edition of Office 365 Home
 Premium and making access to all my reports due for the mid-term unreadable. Luckily I backed up the files on Google Drive and was able to restore them. If I did not have another computer with the Office Suite installed that would have meant at least 20 hours
 of research gone out the window! I pressed Google to take advantage of this issue to finally cut Microsoft's throat for good (sadly I own stock in Microsoft and I'm willing to take the losses after the decades of long hours of fixing bugs and all sorts of
 nasty issues that are inherent in Microsoft products. Hopefully the morons at Microsoft will get your issue resolved by getting their act together As for me, I'm probably out of luck and will never see my $80.00 again. It's a lesson learned. My only hope might
 be to contact my credit card company and tell them that I am being charged for a product not delivered and a service not rendered. Short of that, I guess it's small claims court. I could certainly use the money and would love to earn some extra money based
 on pain and suffering, loss of time, and money.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also, I am having the same issues with accessing office 365 support forums which requires the ridiculous lengthy .onmicrosoft.com domain. I established one and for some reason Microsoft completely kludged up the account so it's not accessible anymore.
 Why am I not surprised??? What a complete mess, no wonder why people were leaving Microsoft just before Windows 8 was released. Eegads man, nothing but problems with installs on that product too but it's not something anybody should be surprised about especially
 with Windows Vista. Now it's just relived in a touchscreen large tile format but remains the same old garbage as yesterday.</div>
<div><br />
<div>In case anybody wants to be a smart alec about it. Yes, I installed the crapware using Internet Exploder 10.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks, for nothing. Microsoft!</div>

            Welcome to ****! Seriously, this is the end-user experience I have dealt with ever since owning a PC running Microsoft's Operating Systems and Office. I would love to go back to the days of DOS and maybe stand a fighting chance of having something work properly. Microsoft does not test any of its products, you the consumer = guinea pig!

            Don't uninstall your Microsoft Office 2007 product! It is the only thing you might have on your computer to access your documents, spreadsheets, etc. I would forgo the Office 365 install. I understand you paid money for your product like many of us have
 but honestly you will be left without anything, especially if you don't have the install discs or it was downloaded electronically - even extended download options have a time limit and you will be hosed!&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Tell Microsoft you want your money back for Office 365 and stick with what works. Luckily I have a new computer and was using the trial edition. I panicked when the alleged tech support person was trying to resolve my case and the moron deleted my Office
 365 and so now I can't install any Office product without making a new purchase. In my case I already made a purchase that will not install, shame on me if I fall for that again!
<div><br />
<div>Definitely do not uninstall your Office 2007! Uninstall Office 365 and demand a refund!</div>

    <title>POP setting get changed for Microsoft account while using Thunderbird - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> steve-garry  say:</h3>
<h2>            POP setting get changed for Microsoft account while using Thunderbird</h2>
                    <p>Original title: &nbsp;What was changed, and why?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I have a significant number of mail accounts across a number of servers that I collect regularly using Thunderbird.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, my microsoft live account is not collecting, and the error message is not exactly helpful, but it's telling me that it has a problem authenticating me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I do some investigating, and having successfully signed into the account via Firefox web browser, proving that my account and password are both good, I do some more in depth investigating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I look at the settings, and discover that for some reason, and nothing to do with anything I've done, my account settings are not lining up with what's needed for Thunderbird to access the account, specifically, the POP option has been disabled, and as Thunderbird
 is set to use POP3, that's not exactly helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I have reset the POP option on again, and tried logging in through Thunderbird, and it's working again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That raises a very important issue.</p>
<p>Why did my POP setting get changed, and how did it get changed?</p>
<p>Did Microsoft make changes that were not fully checked, and as a result, block access to the account?</p>
<p>Has someone else been able to get into the account and compromised the security of the account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I changed nothing from this end prior to finding out that the POP setting had been changed (It was disabled completely)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suffice to say that I am not exactly enthusiastic about this issue, as it raises a lot of questions that I'd prefer not to be having to ask, but given that something changed, and not with my consent, this hat has me very uncomfortable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else seen "issues" today?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steve</p>

            <p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be informed that Microsoft doesn't make any changes to the account in the client, the settings that you are referring to might get changed with the updates that are rolled out for the client. To get better clarity on the same, I suggest you to post
 your query on Thunderbird support and check if it helps.</p>

            <p>Well, that's me told. Microsoft's end changes, and the application that accesses the system is blamed for the problem. Talk about rank arrogance!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please read what I said. Thunderbird is configured to access outlook using POP, and NOTHING changed in my settings, but Outlook would not validate my sign in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I logged in via a web browser, which validated that my log in and password were still good, and on investigating the settings IN OUTLOOK, the POP access was disabled. Given I have been using POP access for quite some time, that means that either the setting
 was changed by some form of upgrade on the server, or the account has been compromised. I do not normally use Web browser access, and there is no way for Thunderbird to change settings at that level on the server.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, somehow, the settings on the server changed, and I didn't make the change. It IS that simple</p>

            <p>I've got the same problem, the only difference is that I'm using Office Outlook 2007 (not Thunderbird) and that I've been using it with my @hotmail.com e-mail address for years but since yesterday or Tuesday it wouldn't get new e-mails anymore.</p>
<p>I can log into outlook.live.com / hotmail.com using my e-mail address and password&nbsp;just fine and I haven't changed any settings in Outlook lately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the hint with the POP setting, mine got changed too. After changing the first setting (it still says "access denied" for the second one, which is weird) back, my Outlook is able to get the e-mails again.</p>

            <p>I had to change the setting to enable POP, then sign out, and back in again before it updated the POP settings to re enable them, at which point my Thunderbird access was restored.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's possible that having changed the option to be available, it won't update the information until a program has actually accessed the server using POP. I had a similar situation, but I don't know what I did to change it, I just know that after several
 attempts to force it to respond, it did. </p>
<p>
</p><p>What's now "interesting" is that I am not alone in seeing this change, which makes me less worried that my account had been compromised, and more suspicious that some sort of server update or maintenance has taken place, and had unplanned and unexpected
 consequences. </p>

<p>
</p><p><span>We can view .xls/.doc file in Excel/Word online, but when we click <strong>
Edit in browser </strong>to edit the file, we receive the following message. To edit the file in the browser we first have to convert it to .xlsx/.docx format, and the backup of the original file is saved in the library.</span></p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Here’s an <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/e04ddc56-d15a-44b7-91cd-1895d6b9ec68#bkmk_SupportedFileTypes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article </a>with detailed information about the file types which are supported in Office online.</span></p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><span>In your case, a user is trying to edit the .xls/.doc files in the browser which are shared by another user and the user is unable to edit the file, as the
<strong>edit in browser</strong> option is disabled. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e9069dac-6865-4de5-839e-4c680db34552" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e9069dac-6865-4de5-839e-4c680db34552" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This happens because the files are stored in the original users’ library and since the file is shared, the user is unable to convert the file in the supported format as the user do not have the access to the original library to save the backup file.
 In this case, the user has to open these files in the Office client application to edit them.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If a folder containing .xls/.doc file is shared, then it is easy for the user to edit the file in the browser because the user has the access to save the backup file in the shared folder.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let me know if you have any doubt.</span></p>
<p>

<h2>            How to create a playlist of videos on surface RT</h2>
                    <p>I have downloaded a set of videos on my surface RT 2</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I have finished playing the first video, the player has a button called "next" but when I click on it ... it just starts playing the same video rather than going to the next one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also went in the xbox app and added my directory which contains all the videos.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But still it won't move to the next video... but keep playing the same one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My ask is simple. I want to play all the videos in my directory one by one. Or even jump to an arbitrary one based on a playlist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible on surface rt 2?</p>

            <p>Hello AbhishekSrivastava2:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the follow up.&nbsp; I am a bit confused by your latest post.&nbsp; If you have added videos to your Music library and the Surface is monitoring this folder, which it does by default, the videos in this folder would be listed in the Video application.&nbsp;
 They should be listed as personal videos.&nbsp; This should allow you to go back to personal videos after each video and start the next one, no need to go back to your desktop.&nbsp; If you have the videos in another location, please consider adding that location via
 the following document.&nbsp; <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-on-other-devices/windows/how-to-add-music" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-on-other-devices/windows/how-to-add-music</a> , this article describes adding music but the process is the same for videos.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it comes to making a playlist of videos, I do not know of a software application that allows this.&nbsp; One thing that worked for some using Zune was to edit your videos into one long video using something like Windows Movie Maker,
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/Windows-Live/movie-maker#t1=overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/Windows-Live/movie-maker#t1=overview</a>&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;As you have a RT device,&nbsp;this software&nbsp;will not be able to be downloaded to the Surface.&nbsp;&nbsp;You might consider using this on a computer and then transferring the file to the Surface
 or looking in the&nbsp;Store for some equivalent application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know if you have any other questions or concerns.</p>

<h2>            Display problem through build 10158, 10159 and 10162</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have been running the Win 10 TP for a couple months now and everything was working pretty well until the 10158 build was released. I play WoW on a dual monitor setup with the game running on 1920x1080 fullscreen windowed mode on display 1 and normally
 a browser and whatever else I happen to have running on display two. Since the 10158 build if I swap from the game window to one of the other windows on the other display I'll get a blue overlay on the game that will sometimes flicker between blue and yellow
 while I am doing whatever on the second display. Once I switch back to the game though the overlay will go away and everything resumes like normal. After leaving the game though my desktop and all the icons will be yellow on display one while the desktop on
 display two will be normal. I have checked the logs and it's error free so I'm not sure where to begin to troubleshoot this issue.</p>
