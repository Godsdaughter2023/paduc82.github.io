(in Windows 10 64-bit)<br />
The home page of Windows Defender opens, message "Your PC is not monitored because the service of the application is stopped."<br />
By clicking Start now message "Unable to start the service, group or resource is not in the correct state to perform the requested operation - 0x8007139f error code".<br />
In the list of services, Windows Defender Service is absent.<br />
I would not want to reinstall the whole system.<br />
If you only have to change a setting in the registry, OK.<br />
Is it possible to download and reinstall Windows Defender? If so, thank you for giving me the way forward.<br />
Thank you for your help.</p>

<p>I have the same problem on my Asus Notebook N73S. Upgraded from Windows 7SP1 Home Edition to Windows 10 about 2 weeks ago and had no problem running it other than noticing that touchpad worked better before upgrade.
</p>
<p>I have been using AVG for years and Malwarebytes for a year or so. Today, 2 weeks after upgrade, nothing but BIG scary issues like desktop flashing when I boot up and also when I do certain things on (like a few close windows earlier). The scariest part
 is that it flashes just even faster in SAFE MODE!! Been searching for solution all day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got a notification earlier that Windows Defender was not on; went to turn it on and no can do. Same error message as above. I am getting nervous about restarting the laptop again (have done so MANY times today) as I don't know what else will go wrong.&nbsp;</p>

                    How do I send email form another address without the "sent on behalf of". I can only switch to outlook.com if can set it up to seamlessly send from another account the same way I do it with my gmail account.

<h2>            Product Key Still &#39;Invalid&#39; for Office Home and Student 2010</h2>
                    
<p><br />
I purchased Microsoft Office 2010 Home an Student about a month ago from Staples Business depot, all packaging was sealed. There is no disc with it as it is for a preloaded PC. My HP netbook had a preloaded 2007 trial version, I was advised (when the product
 key first didn't work) to get the 2010 trial online for this product key to work and did so. (okay, so this was an obvious one).<br />
<br />
The prompts for the product key came for the 2010 version and I entered the one I had bought; it said it was invalid.</p>
<p>I uninstalled everything even remotely related to office 2007.</p>
<p>I tried changing the '8' in the Product key to a 'B' and back again. There is no '0' or 'O' in it. Still it will not accept my product key.</p>
<p>I tried downloading the whole version online from microsoft, but&nbsp; the product key is still 'invadid'.</p>
<p>I've spent a riddiculous amount of time trying to sort this out! Please will you try to help me, or refer me somewhere new? I can't even contact Microsoft by phone because the activation wizard won't start without the product key and I would need it to start
 to attain the appropriate support phone number.</p>

It is not being accepted because there is still another version of Offcie on the computer. Uninstall all Office entries and start again.<br />

Have you actually followed the instructions with the package and download that particular one.<br />

<p>Fine I will not bother you any more.</p>
<p>Insulting, really? I have been in the computer field now for 45 years and 90% of the time problems are caused by someone either not reading instructions or missing something glaringly basic.</p>
<p>By the way, there is still another version on your computer otherwise the key would work, assuming you are typing it correctly of course.</p>

            Milly, are you saying that I should have bought a product key for office 2007? Because I had told the salesman at staples that I had a 2007 version, but he gave me the 2010 product key and later (when I called back because it obviously didn't work) told
 me it would work on a trial version of 2010. Is that totally wrong? Is there anything I can do to rectify this? Could I maybe delete the entire office program and have it preinstalled somehow?

<p>Ron, do you mean that I should uninstall the trial version of office 2010? I thought that having that version meant office 2010 was 'preinstalled'. Am I totally wrong here? I have already uninstalled office 2007 and tried, but that didn't do the trick.</p>
<p>I really appreciate your help by the way and certainly won't be offended if you ask me about the basics :)</p>

<blockquote>Milly, are you saying that I should have bought a product key for office 2007? Because I had told the salesman at staples that I had a 2007 version, but he gave me the 2010 product key and later (when I called back because it obviously didn't work)
 told me it would work on a trial version of 2010. Is that totally wrong? Is there anything I can do to rectify this? Could I maybe delete the entire office program and have it preinstalled somehow?</blockquote>
<br />
There are no product keys available now for 2007, so put that out of your mind please.

<p>Ron, do you mean that I should uninstall the trial version of office 2010? I thought that having that version meant office 2010 was 'preinstalled'. Am I totally wrong here? I have already uninstalled office 2007 and tried, but that didn't do the trick.</p>
<p>I really appreciate your help by the way and certainly won't be offended if you ask me about the basics :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
Uninstall the 2010 trial and all Office versions currently on the computer.</p>
<p>Follow the instructions on the Product Key Card packaging.</p>
<p>If that fails try this:https://office.getmicrosoftkey.com/</p>

<h2>            Outlook SMTP unknown</h2>
                    <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p><span>Since several weeks I gradually can no longer send mails from Thunderbird (52.3.0) under Ubuntu (14.04): the SMTP server is unknown.<br />
"L’envoi du message a échoué.<br />
Une erreur est survenue lors de l’envoi du courrier : le serveur sortant (SMTP) « smtp-mail.outlook.com » est inconnu. Le serveur est peut-être mal configuré. Veuillez vérifier que les paramètres de votre serveur sortant (SMTP) sont corrects et essayez à nouveau."<br />
My present parameters (after many other tries) are set back to:<br />
server: smtp-mail.outlook.com, port: 587, security: STARTTLS, Authentfication: Normal password<br />
The last 2 weeks, I had to systematically go through the Outlook&nbsp;</span><span>webmail to send</span><span>&nbsp;messages!&nbsp;</span><span>The
 service status says everything (including Outlook.com) is ok.&nbsp;</span><span>I would like to know if Outlook is conscious of that problem and if I can hope in a solution coming quick.</span></p>
<p><span>Many thanks in advance</span></p>

<p>After long discussion with the internet provider, they replaced the modem (actually, I also switched from ADSL to VDSL) and this solved the issue. Still don't understand why only the Outlook accounts were disturbed but at least it works. Thanks to those
 who tried to help.</p>

<p>There was a problem a while back where WDO Beta was broken as it didn't bring over the signatures when creating a new image from the Wizard.</p>
<p>Go back to the PC with the WDO wizard, run it again and insert the USB drive and it *should* update the definitions on the drive.</p>

<h2>            How to delete duplicate words in a single cell.</h2>
                    <p>I found another post with the same name but I think I require a different answer. I have over 2500 rows with 3 columns of cells filled. Some cells will have duplicates in them and I am trying to find a way to delete them rather than going through all of
 them at once. An example is pasted below.</p>
<p>

Creative, Energizing, Euphoria, Focus, Happy, Relaxing</td>

<td>Stress<br />
Headaches<br />
Depression<br />
Lack of Appetite<br />
Fatigue<br />
May Relieve<br />
Anorexia, Chronic Pain, Fatigue, Headaches, Stress</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</p><p>In the first column I would need Creative removed. In the third column, I would need Stress and Fatigue removed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any easy way to remove duplicates such as this?</p>

<p>There are two possible issues and perhaps both apply in this case.&nbsp; One is that the early builds, which came with a special product key, can only continue to be used as long as you don't do a clean installation of Windows.&nbsp; If that is your situation you<br />
need to buy Windows.&nbsp; The second is that Windows 10 that is an upgrade from Windows 7 is only activated for the life of the device and you have a new device.&nbsp; The device is the motherboard/CPU.&nbsp; Change those and you have changed the unique hardware IDs used<br />
by the licensing software to register the device with MSFT.&nbsp; This requires you to register the new device.&nbsp; That also requires buying Windows.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the record, you did not receive a free copy of Windows.&nbsp; You received a free upgrade to a copy of Windows you already owned.</p>

<h3> thor2944  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I Install Windows 10 Preview 64bit over Windows 10 Preview 32bit&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Long story short, I have been running 32bit OS on my laptop, since that is what it originally came with. &nbsp;I upgraded the processor from a Core 2 DUO 2.0GHZ to a 2.6GHZ model. &nbsp;I had no idea the 2.6GHZ processor was 64bit compatible. &nbsp;So now, I have 32bit
 OS on my laptop, and I am unsure of how to go to 64bit. &nbsp;Do I just have to do a wipe using a flash drive and the 64bit ISO? &nbsp;It says "Your PC cannot run this app" when I try to run the setup.exe on the Windows 10 64bit ISO.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks guys!</p>

</p><p>How to migrate from a 32 bit version of Windows 10 to a 64 bit version:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Is my computer 64 bit capable?</strong></p>
<p>Before you can start the process to migrate to 64 bit Windows, you need to find out if your system is 64 bit capable. If you are already running a 32 bit version of Windows&nbsp;10 on you system, you can find out by doing the following:</p>
<p>Press Windows key + X on your keyboard</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/image3.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2013%2f02%2fimage_thumb3.png%3fw%3d396%26amp%3bh%3d383" height="383" width="396" /></a></p>
<p>Click <strong>System</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/image4.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2013%2f02%2fimage_thumb4.png%3fw%3d414%26amp%3bh%3d169" height="169" width="414" /></a></p>
<p>Look under <em>System</em> &gt; <strong>System type:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>There it will list whether the processor is <strong>x64 based processor</strong> or not. In my case I have 64 bit capable processor. Once you have confirmed this, you can move on to the next step.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you attempt to start the installation of a 64 bit version of Windows from within a 32 bit version of Windows, you will receive the following error message.</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/image6.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2013%2f02%2fimage_thumb6.png%3fw%3d444%26amp%3bh%3d142" height="142" width="444" /></a></p>
<p>Which is understandable, since you are running a 32 bit version of Windows. To begin the installation, we will need to restart the computer and boot from the disc or USB thumbdrive which contains the installation files. So, click the close button.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restart your computer then load your BIOS and set it to boot from your DVD drive or USB thumb drive. You might need to consult your computer manual for instructions how to do this. See the following article for additional instructions.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>To learn how to change your BIOS options to boot from the DVD drive, the following tutorial:</strong></p>

    <title>spacing for display names when syncing Outlook to Hotmail using the - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fb10  say:</h3>
<h2>            spacing for display names when syncing Outlook to Hotmail using the connector</h2>
                    I just discovered this, and perhaps it relates to the latest Outlook Hotmail Connector update that came out circa June 2012.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Here's the issue: In Outlook, if you create a contact, the name field is really populated by a pop-up window that asks for Title, First Name, Middle Name, Last Name, Suffix.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The linking feature with Hotmail is now populating any of the above blank fields with one space, or one blank character.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If you've previously had synced to Hotmail, the spaces have been inserted into all of your contacts in Hotmail.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If you create a new contact in Outlook, mindful not to add such spaces, upon syncing, the spaces will be added to your Outlook version.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have found no way to eliminate the spaces permanently. Once the sync occurs, the spaces are back.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>These spaces are evident in such ways as:</div>
<div>1) Create an email to a contact in Outlook 2010, any contact, so long as they don't have a title listed in their contact entry. The email To line will have the display name underlined, but the first character will be an underlined space.</div>
<div>2) In the same manner as above, any contact without a middle name or initial set, will show two spaces between their first and last name.</div>
<div>3) In the Contact detail card in Outlook, in the Display As field below any given email address, you will see the same as above in 1) and 2).</div>
<div>4) In the Contact detail card in Outlook, in the Full Name field, you will not see the space for the title if missing, but you will see the two spaces between first and last name if no middle name/initial is set for that contact.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is an annoying bug, though it causes no issues with using the services provided. Poor quality control on the part of Microsoft.</div>

    <title>Opening and automatically adding an .ics appointment in Outlook 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thepolishguy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Opening and automatically adding an .ics appointment in Outlook 2010 from Chrome</h2>
                    <p>I use Outlook 2010 and have Chrome as my default browser. When I used to have IE as my default browser and I clicked on a link in an Outlook message for "add to your Outlook Calendar", IE would ask me if I want to download or open. I hit the Open button
 and it would open a new appointment window in Outlook which I can then save to put that even on my calendar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I changed to Chrome as my default browser, and repead the above process, Chrome just forces me to save the .ics file and then I have to double click the .ics file to launch in Outlook to save the appointment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So after looking high and low for a solution, here I am. The question to solve the above problem: how do I set Chrome or my Windows 8.1 computer to open the .ics file rather than save it when using Chrome as my default browser? Is there some kind of plugin
 for Chrome? I've already gone thru the Windows control panel settings for Default Programs and associations and have Outlook set as the default for .ics files.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is much appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />A lot of problems with Office 2013 are caused by third party (non-Microsoft) applications.  This is my (expanding) list of things to try when Office 2013\365 won’t start or crashes: See the Article “Why can’t I start my Office 2013 application at: <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/support/why-cant-i-start-my-office-2013-application-HA104011864.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/support/why-c...</a> For the error message Error: "Microsoft Office cannot verify the license for this product."

<br />It appears that there may be some hardware incompatibilities as well.  If you have the NVIDIA driver NVWGF2UM.DLL, try renaming it as: NVWGF2UM.oldas was mentioned in:

<br />From the File tab, select Options and then click on Advanced and then in the Display section of the dialog, check the box for Disable hardware graphics acceleration
<br />
<br />For the error message "There was a problem sending the command to the program", use Windows Explorer to access the C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office15 folder and right click on WINWORD.EXE then on Properties, go to the Compatibility tab and uncheck all the boxes.  It has also been reported that the problem can be overcome by editing the registry at HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Word.Document.12\shell\Open and deleting the ddeexec key.
<br />
<br />The ddeexec can also be deleted from
<br />
<br />HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Word.DocumentMacroEnabled.12\shell\Open.

<br />If you have a Canon 8350 printer, try using the Canon MF8000 UFRI LT XPS driver as detail in the post by Riad Amstha on April 14 in the thread at:

<br />
<br />For the problem of nothing appearing when you start typing in a blank document in Word in Office 365 Home Premium, and you hear a bell sound with each keypress, but no characters appear, disable the SMARTInk add-in for an interactive whiteboard.
<br />
<br />If none of that helps, then you might remove all traces of the Office installation by downloading the fixit from the following article:

<br /><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501</a> saving it to your computer and then running it.

<br />Then reinstall Office by logging into www.office.com/myaccountwith your registered email address and click Install Office.

    <title>Wireless charging problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bovenbaas  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wireless charging problem</h2>
                    
<p>I've got a Lumia 1020, CC-3066 charging cover and DT-900 charging plate and have problems with the wireless charging.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Firstly the wireless charging seems very dependent on exact positioning of the phone on the charging plate.&nbsp; I thought I found the optimal position (exactly centrered with bottom of phone and plate aligned), but sometimes the phone doesn't start the charging,
 charges intermittently or the charging plate keeps signalling charging error even when positioned this way. I suppose the perfect position would be with centers of the coils in charging cover and plate aligned. Does anybody know how the position the phone
 this way? Where is the center of of the charging coil positioned in the cover? Do others also experience this pickyness in positioning?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some nights I hear my phone restart charging several times when initially it started charging without problems and is (still) in the same position it charged without problems other nights. I removed all objects around it but still have my alarm clock at
 10 cm (4") distance from the plate. Is this enough distance? Or could it still interfere with the charging? I noticed lower WiFi signal strengths when the charging cover is placed on the phone. Is there a possibility that WiFi signals also can interfere with
 the charging?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last night my phone didn't start charging in any position and after multiple attempts I gave up and had to hook it up with a USB cable to charge it. The charging plate indicator was lighting up continously when the phone was placed on the plate, but the
 phone was not charging or did not indicate it was charging. Today it started charging again normally when placed on the plate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bought the plate online from a UK Ebay store at a considerably cheaper price (-30%) than what it is offered for here in the Netherlands. It only included instructions in the southern European languages, but was sold with a UK plug. The online retailer
 claims it is genuine and new but did note the original packaging was missing. It was sold in a plain plastic bag and multiple (but a limited number of) plates where offered and sold. Does anybody know whether there are counterfeit charging plates on the market?
 Or defective plates are being resold?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do others also have these problems? Could my phone, cover or plate be defective? And if so, how could I find out which? Could the contacts between cover and phone be the problem? Any suggestions or feedback is welcome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Based on other people's experience it seems the most popular case is a problem with the contact between cover and phone. If you can, take it to a shop which has both wireless charging covers and plates and try swapping them out one at a time to isolate the
 problem.</p>

<p>I had the same problem and being a scientist I did not give in to the problem but tackeled it. There is a discrepancy of about 1 tenth of a millimetre between the charging plate contact and the 1020 unit. This may be as to imprecise manufacturing by the
 now in Communist China produced product. The both units do not click into place and the disruption happens.</p>
<p>What can be done? I see several people asking the same question. Now, follow my instructions and you will have no longer the problem that I had as well with my both units:</p>
<ol>
<li>Carefully take the charging plate off the phone.</li><li>Specify inside and outside and find the connecting unit of the charging back.</li><li>Please do not bend or anything alike to the little connectors as they can get damaged.</li><li>&nbsp;You will need a hair drying unit to warm up the exact point on the back of the plate (..and not the front where the connectors are!!!)</li><li>Heat this back area&nbsp; very carefully with your hair dryer pressing with your thumb on the outside of the back plate where&nbsp; the point where the connectors are.</li><li>Warming up and holding your thumb to indent the point very carefully. Hold your thumb on the point, switch the hair dryer off, still holding with the thumb until the plate reaches room temperature.</li><li>Let go the thumb and you will find that the back plate has a very small indent exactly the amount that is needed to guide the contacts onto the main unit, the 1020.</li><li>If the back plate and the main unit are carefully connected follow the next in
<p>Simple? – Well, I did it and ever since my phone charges and there are no longer difficulties. It works all the time and without fail. If you have still difficulties try my remedy again and if that is without success return the back charging plate to your
 seller for a refund.</p>
<p>FOR SURE THE ABOVE REMEDY IS AT YOUR OWN RISK AND I DO NOT TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY IF YOU DO SOMETHING WRONG. LAST NOT LEAST IT IS THE STUPIDITY OF THE DESIGNERS AND ENGINEERS AT NOKIA COUNTING ON COMMUNIST CHINISE WORKMANSHIP TO BE AS PRECISE AS THE ORIGINAL
 EUROPEAN MANUFACTURING.&nbsp;</p>

            My wireless charger was working fine then it started making the noise, the same noise when you put it on the charger, every so often in the middle of the night. I thought it was the wireless charger, so I bought a new one. The same problem! Anybody else

<p>I have the exact same problem?&nbsp;&nbsp;I just took delivery of a CC-3066 (Black) and a new CR-201 (upgraded CR-200) Qi Wireless charging car holder to go with my Lumia 64GB 1020.&nbsp; The charging, just like your experience, is intermittent and the charging connect
 disconnect chimes are constantly chiming.&nbsp; Exactly as they would if you were to constantly connect and disconnect the normal USB charger?&nbsp; I can't even blame the problem on&nbsp;it being a bumpy road or anything as sitting with the car stationary produces exactly
 the same issue :-(&nbsp; So it has to be either the shell, the car kit or the phone... :-( &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried all sorts of positions in CR-201 holder in case there is little tolerance with positioning on the charging plate, but no joy.&nbsp; I've not tried the heating and pressing the shell trick discussed here yet and not sure I will.&nbsp; The shell connecting
 pins are making contact and I've checked there is no dirt in the contacts on the phone.&nbsp; Am I doing anything wrong surely these products should would as designed wittout these issues..?&nbsp; All purchased from Amazon, so I'm assuming all genuine products, if worst
 comes to the worst I'll have to return them.&nbsp; I've messaged Nokia via their Twitter and Facebook accounts as I don't expect anyone from&nbsp;Nokia support actually reads these posts..... &nbsp; I could be wrong of course! ;-)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suggestions on a post card please</p>

<p>DT-900 wireless charging plate works fine with a Lumia 920 but does not work at all with a Lumia 1020 phone&nbsp;or any of the Nokia&nbsp;wireless charging cases CC-3066 or PD-95G.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Called Nokia Technical Support on 3/7/2014 they claim their DT-900 is compatible.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is&nbsp;does not work!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Phone + mentioned accessaries are brand new and can reproduce your problem.</p>

<p>Are you trying to charge the 1020 direct on the DT-900 ? That will not work, since the 1020 does not have built-in wireless charging like the 920 - you will need to attach the CC-3066 to the 1020 and then charge on the DT-900. You cannot charge the CC-3066
 on its own either. The PD-95G does not have wireless charging built-in and cannot be charged in this way, neither separately nor attached to the 1020.</p>

<p>The problem is most definitely between the 1020 and the CC-3066 wireless charging cover.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a DC-900, a DC-50 and a CR-201, and the 1020's charging is intermittent on all three but my Nexus 7 charges (on the 900 and the 50) without any problems at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I followed profgyland's suggestion of using a hairdrier to gently remould the shape of the over to ensure a tighter contact between the cover's pins and the phone's contacts. IT WORKED!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I rested a glass bottle of water (0.5L) on the back of the cover and used the hairdrier (on hot) in close proximity for about two minutes. After allowing the case to cool to room temperature I found that the fit of the case to the phone was a litle more
 snug than previously and most importantly the charging has been consistent since.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Great fix!</p>

<p>WD40 works!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried the hairdryer solution having started to get problems with my wireless charging but it did not work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use the car charger (which has a fault meaning it doesnt hold the phone very well but otherwise charges fine), the flat DT-900 charging plate and the upright charging stand - so the wireless charging not working was a real pain!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I have done is applied some WD-40 to the phones contacts and wiped the excess away, I did this about 4 weeks and everything has worked perfectly since until yesterday when the charging started getting intermitant. I have reapplied the WD-40 and everything
 is working fine again!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So clearly the connection between phone and shell is the issue, and WD-40 seems to solve it.</p>

<p>hi lisa,</p>
<p>after we create a custom tile and add to the app launcher, only users with <strong>
exchange online license</strong> assigned can see the newly added custom tile from their own app launcher.</p>
<p>to admins who want to create a cutom tile from <strong>admin</strong> -&gt; <strong>
company profile</strong> -&gt; <strong>custom tiles</strong>, they also need to be assigned the exchange online license, or the custom tiles option will not show even if they navigate to
<strong>admin</strong> -&gt; <strong>company profile</strong>.<br />
<br />

            Hello,<br />
<br />
I got into a similar issue. In my case, it's much worse and I couldn't see even the error code. But, anyway, I debugged it and found this is caused by "Revoke" information stored as EFI variables. It's most likely to be an OS issue.<br />
<br />
Here is the steps to delete the "Revoke" information from your PC. Once it's done, you should be able to re-install Windows 10.<br />
<br />
1. prepare a USB flash drive (with capacity less than or equal to 32GB)<br />
2. format it with FAT32 file system<br />
3. download the EFI Shell, Shell_Full.efi, from Github<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/tree/master/EdkShellBinPkg/FullShell/X64 &nbsp;(if you're using 64bit OS)<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/tree/master/EdkShellBinPkg/FullShell/Ia32 (if you're using 32bit OS)<br />
4. rename the filename of the EFI Shell<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;rename it from Shell_Full.efi to bootx64.efi &nbsp;(if you're using 64bit OS)<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;rename it from Shell_Full.efi to bootIa32.efi (if you're using 32bit OS)<br />
5. copy it to \EFI\Boot\ folder of the USB flash drive<br />
6. launch the BIOS SETUP to disable "Secure Boot", save the changes and exit the BIOS SETUP<br />
7. boot from the USB flash drive<br />
8. show EFI variables<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;dmpstore -b *Revoke* [Enter]<br />
9. you'll see "Revoke" information<br />
10. delete the "Revoke" information (in my case, I needed to delete two EFI variables below)<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; dmpstore -d RevokeSiSPolicySigners [Enter]<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; dmpstore -d RevokeSiPolicyVersion &nbsp;[Enter]<br />
11. shut down the computer from the EFI Shell<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; reset -s [Enter]<br />
12. (optional) launch the BIOS SETUP to enable "Secure Boot", save the changes and exit the BIOS SETUP<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.<br />
<p>

<p>I can Not boot, the system gives BSOD before you even get to the login screen? it just about to bring up the user login screen and it shows "This system protected buy Avast etc. and BSOD?

<p>I was able to boot and login in safe mode and run Avast and do thorough scans and found like 3 or 4 more Maulware and viruses and the only identifiable file was: (Win32:Malware-gen) I have run system repair and of course it messed up system restore to an

<p>I keep running several anti virus and Mal ware applications and now they do not find any problems but the PC will still not boot?</p>

<p>I can boot into safe mode with LAN drivers and get most everything to work and thats how I'm on-line now! This seems to be a new Mal ware or virus? and windows has been trying to fix it all day and can't I guess the only thing to do it reinstall windows?
 If anyone has a fix or an idea to try I would very much appreciate it. Thanks, Rick..
