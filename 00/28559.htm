<h2>            Outlook 2013 not receiving new Gmail messages</h2>
                    Original title: Windows Outlook 2013 stopped receiving gmail messages<br />
<br />
I use Micosoft Outlook 2013 with 4 different accounts. last week my gmail has stopped receiving emails but I can send them fine. I've tried removing it and adding back in and also tried creating a new account. The new account again willl send but not receive
 emails. My gmail is working fine in the Windows * mail app which I don't like using as much as outlook. Any ideas on what might be going on

    <title>Should I delete&#47;modify these registry entry for better - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> arupratan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Should I delete&#47;modify these registry entry for better security&#63;</h2>
                    Recently, my computer was infected by a virus called <span style="font-weight: bold">
Worm:Win32/Ainslot.A<br />
</span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/Threat/Encyclopedia/Entry.aspx?name=Worm%3aWin32%2fAinslot.A&amp;threatid=2147641238" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/Threat/Encyclopedia/Entry.aspx?name=Worm%3aWin32%2fAinslot.A&amp;threatid=2147641238</a><span style="font-weight: bold"><br />
<br />
</span>I downloaded a software from a torrent (I don't usually do that because I know it isn't safe but I had to do it for some testing purpose and I trusted MSE), and when I was installing it I saw some suspicious behavior, a file named
<span style="font-weight: bold">csrss32.exe</span> was trying to gain permission, as I thought it is part of that software I allowed
<span style="font-weight: bold">UAC</span> to permit this file. After that I saw it was slowing down my startup and was starting automatically during Windows startup. Then I checked the file properties, I found that it wasn't from Windows' own file but rather
 from an unknown publisher, then I was almost sure that this is a virus, so I uninstalled the software, after restarting computer my
<span style="font-weight: bold">Microsoft Security Essentials</span> detected a Virus named
<span style="font-weight: bold">Ainslot.A</span>. But so far MSE didn't detect any virus and surprisingly MSE was showing that the Virus
<span style="font-weight: bold">Ainslot.A</span> was allowed by MSE in the list of
<span style="font-weight: bold">All Detected Items</span>, but I never told MSE to allow anything since it didn't detect anything. It means the Virus somehow managed MSE to allow itself so that MSE can't detect it. I guess this is because the name of the file
 was <span style="font-weight: bold">csrss32.exe</span>. Since, Windows has a system file called csrss.exe, and I found in the
<span style="font-weight: bold">Registry Editor</span> that this file is already Excluded from being processing through this key entry,<span style="font-weight: bold"><br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\FTH<br />
<br />
ExclusionList<br />
</span>smss.exe<br />
csrss.exe<br />
wininit.exe<br />
services.exe<br />
lsass.exe<br />
lsm.exe<br />
svchost.exe<br />
winlogon.exe<br />
SLsvc.exe<br />
spoolsv.exe<br />
taskhost.exe<span style="font-weight: bold"><br />
<br />
</span>I think that's why MSE didn't detect it as a Virus since it is has a similar name of a system file. Am I right? If it is so, then I think this is a severe vulnerability in Windows. Now, should I delete this key? Because if I delete this key, Windows
 will process all these system files and if there are any Virus with the same name as these system files, Windows won't exclude them from processing and MSE will be able to detect them.<span style="font-weight: bold"><br />
<br />
</span>The virus<span style="font-weight: bold"> Ainslot.A </span>caused me some serious trouble, after MSE detected it, I tried to clean it by MSE, but when I tried to clean, I saw
<span style="font-weight: bold">BSOD</span> errors and my computer restarted. Then I went to
<span style="font-weight: bold">Safe Mode</span>, then manually deleted that <span style="font-weight: bold">
csrss32.exe</span> file from the <span style="font-weight: bold">"C:\Users"</span> folder and also deleted the Registry Keys which were modified by the Virus (as mentioned in the link provided above from Microsoft Security Portal Encyclopedia Entry).<span style="font-weight: bold"><br />
<br />
Now, my question is, should I delete the registry key of the <span style="font-style: italic">
ExclusionList</span>? If I keep this key unchanged then is there any chance that the same type of virus issue may occur again? Please help me with this and if possible inform Microsoft about this problem. Thank you in advance.<br />
<br />

            <p>Hi Arup,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do not delete anything in the registry or do anything else until you've completed all of the following INCLUDING obtaining assistance from Microsoft Support.&nbsp; You may do far more harm than good and using normal procedures and resolving it with expert advice
 is MUCH safer.&nbsp; You can try the suggested programs first or skip right to the bold section and start with expert help right from the start (which is faster, safer, easier, better, more likely to work and be more thorough, and be confirmed by a specialist in
 malware-removal - so I recommend you do that - though there's probably little harm in trying the other options if you want but you'll still need to contact support even if they seem to have worked to get it verified anyway).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, try the following programs if you haven't as they may help. I recommend you download, install, update, and run full scans with Malwarebytes:<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a> and SuperAntiSpyware:<a href="http://superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://superantispyware.com/</span></a>
 and then run a full ESET online scan: <a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner</a>. This may or may not remove the infections, but will probably not repair any damage caused by them. Even if they or your current AV software seem to work or indicate you aren't infected or the problem goes away, you
 shouldn't completely trust them and need to continue with the recommendations that follow (so it's up to you if you want to try them first or just skip over all of this and get the expert help you really need as described below).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Properly and completely removing such infections can be complex and often require manual removal procedures (which may or may not be entirely effective either). Even if they work, I'd suggest the following anyway, so we may as well start there (you can ignore
 the above removal methods if you want as this is really the way to go, but it won't hurt to try them).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please follow these recommendations compliments of Stephen Boots - MVP:</p>

<p><b>Start here - </b><a href="https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/</span></b></a><b> and select the link that says - I think my computer is infected - and then select the

</p><p>2. I have not made any changes and do not believe Win 10's auto update feature has made any changes to PPT. I have not updated anything about PPT. I run O-365.

<p>
</p><p>3. I have not experienced the same concern with other Office application.</p>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>Just a guess, do you have defined a secondary monitor. configured as extended?</p>
<p>When Outlook is open click this shortcut (Windows + &lt;-)</p>
<p>You may have also defined outlook to "Hide when minimized", Rigth Click Outlook near the clock and deactivate that options, see what is the behavior now</p>

<h3> damianj65  say:</h3>
<h2>            Huge issue with windows updates for tablets</h2>
                    <p>I have a variety of devices, they run Windows 10, Linux, Android &amp; iOS, each has there own issues, but not usually the app &amp; system updates, except the windows tablets that is. Unless you basically don't use you tablet &amp; keep most of the memory free, just
 in case Microsoft issues any updates, then you will have a problem when it come to downloading &amp; installing said updates. All other operating system providers have addressed the issue of smaller amounts of spare memory and my other devices always update without
 any problems. Microsoft doesn't even acknowledge there's an issue let alone that they've dropped the ball on this matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Literally every single windows 10 update, on my windows tablets, has failed, or taken a huge amount of effort to run - that's not how personal computing is supposed to work - YOU, Microsoft, have an obligation to ensure that equipment &amp; updates work as seamlessly
 as possible &amp; your end users do not have to waste many hours &amp; sometimes days fixing an issue that you have been too lazy to address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please don't tell me that this isn't an issue, there's hundreds of references to failed updates, due to lack of tablet memory &amp; having searched through pages &amp; pages of complaints &amp; "solutions" there's not one satisfactory answer among them &amp; certainly nothing
 constructive form Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seriously, all the other providers can get their act together, why not the biggest off them? An update, especially a required update, due to a flaw, that you built into the previous version, should not render a machine obsolete.</p>

            This is a very accurate description of what I also experience on my 8" tablets with modest memory and disk space. It is related to the uncaring attitude Microsoft seems to have towards the smaller consumer market as was also seen with Windows phone. Sometimes
 some updates work and sometimes they don't due to small system constraints. My thinking is that this is poor judgement on part of MS upper management since over time it can snowball into serious bias towards MS as consumers carry this kind of experience in
 the back of their mind when they have to make personal or business choices.

<h2>            Cannot access XBox Enforcement forums for suspended XBox accounts.</h2>
                    <p>Hi.&nbsp; My XBox Live account is suspended until 12/28/14.&nbsp; I've made three phone calls trying to find out why and have been given three different answers.&nbsp; I'm a 6 year paying member and have never been in trouble.&nbsp; I believe someone made a false complaint
 against me.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried from different devices to get to the Enforcement Forums, but the links on the website are broken and take me to the following page:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://forums.xbox.com/?xr=shellnav</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried one desktop computer with two different browsers; a different desktop computer with yet a different browser; and an ipad.&nbsp; I'm taken to the same "Oops, what happened to this page?" message.&nbsp; Customer Support says the only way to reinstate my account
 is to visit the Enforcement Forum.&nbsp; There is no one I can call or email.&nbsp; But I can't reach the Enforcement Forum from any of our three devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done nothing to deserve account suspension.&nbsp; Is there anyone at all who can help me?&nbsp; I know this isn't the right forum, but I don't know where else to turn for help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<h3> dvb2015  say:</h3>
<h2>            Project 2013&#58; Level only within available slack changes project date</h2>
                    <p>I teach a project mgmt. section of a class using MS Project 2013 and demonstrate how to do leveling using a textbook problem. I have used this problem in prior semesters and Project worked fine but this semester, it seems something has changed in Project
 2013 and I don't know why.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The project has an unleveled length of 530 days with many overallocated tasks and resources. Leveling using the options below used to keep the project at 530 days and resolve several but not all the overallocations. However, using the exact files from before,
 now leveling with the options below resolves all overallocations and the project goes to 735 days. If the option for Leveling only within slack is unchecked, the solution goes to 725 days with no overallocations, which is expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone run into this or know why this has changed? I have run this on several different machines on Windows 8.1 and 10, where all the machines have Project 2013 and full updates from MS.
</p>
<p>

            I am having the same problem with the same project file - Conveyor Belt Project, and I cannot find a reason. Also weird that I have this problem on one of my computer, but the leveling within slack works just fine with my other computer. Waiting for someone
 to provide a solution...

            <p>The first advice will be to make sure that your software MSP2010 and/or 2013 is fully updated with the cumulative updates. Assuming that...</p>
<p>Try using a test file which is known to work, ie one that with certain leveling options produces a known result.</p>
<p>The residential construction template is a good example.</p>
<p>Set the project start date 1st of July 2015, overall duration is 152 days and finish is 28/01/2016 17:00.</p>
<p>In that template there are two tasks which do not have successors, and those blanks should be filled in first.</p>
<p>However, just to test, without this correction, go to file, new, open the template, level with the options "day by day" and "only within available slack".</p>
<p>My result with MSP2010 is that duration and finish do not change, which is as expected, and all over-allocation is solved except one resource is left over-allocated.</p>
<p>Does the leveling work like this as expected with this file, and what version of MSP is that with?</p>

            I have Project 2013. I am using a project file that I have been using for years, and my last use was in July this year, and it was all good. But then now, I am doing "level only within available slack" on this file using the same computer (a desktop),
 and all of the sudden, it changed the duration of the project. More weird, I used my old laptop and ran it again, and it did the work correctly. The program on my desktop should be updated, while I am not sure about the old laptop as I didn't use it for a
 long while. The only thing I can think of that might be related, is that when I installed the program the first time, it showed some conflict with the other Microsoft programs, and I had to uninstall the other programs to have MS Project 2013 installed. Is
 this a problem?

            Yes, but have you tried a different file, the suggested residential construction template? If we both do the same thing with the same file, but with different software, yours MSP2013 and mine MSP2010, and if we both get the same result, and the result
 is what it is known it should be, then your problem is in your file, not in your hardware or software.<br />

            <p>I had tried the same file with my two computers, and saw different results, one with correct leveling within slack, and one with extended project duration. So I think it is not a problem with the file, but with the program.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>This is the same for me (the original poster). I have used the same file on two different machines sitting side by side and the leveling comes up differently. One, keeps the project date the same, the other lengthens the project date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question for you...are you using a DreamSpark download? The machine that performed incorrectly is a new (August 2015) download while the correct machine is an old DreamSpark download. I am becoming convinced there is something wrong with this DreamSpark
 distribution only. The commercial version is not seeing this otherwise, more people would be saying...what the heck?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another item I have noticed....when first assigning resources using the split-screen Details View method, the duration of a task should not change given the defaults used. However, with this new DreamSpark distribution, if the Resource Sheet has a Max% greater
 than 100% and you try to assign that resource at 100% to a task, that task duration changes....incorrectly. If the Resource Sheet has the Max% at 100%, though, it does not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another item...when using the Details View method, you could not specify the percent at which a resource is being assigned to a task and it would default to 100%. However, with this new DreamSpark distribution it now assigns the resource at whatever the
 Max% is on the Resource Sheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I going crazy here? Or is this a real problem with the DreamSpark distribution?</p>

            <p>Yes, I am using the DreamSpark download, and Yes, the new download has this problem and my old download works just fine. For the resource leveling within slack problem, I reinstalled the whole MS Project 2013 program, and it seems work right now. I didn't
 notice the other problem you mentioned. One of the following replies mentioned the recent updates. It probably has handled the other issues for me.&nbsp;</p>

<br />
<p><span>Let’s start Excel in safe mode following the below mentioned steps and then try opening the password protected file from within it and verify the result:</span></p>
<p><span>a) Hold Windows key + R. <br />
b) Copy and paste, or type the following command in the Open box, and then press Enter:</span></p>
<p><span>Excel /safe<br />
Note: There is space between Excel and /</span></p>
<span>If Excel safe works, disable the add-ins following steps mentioned below and determine the problem causing add-in:
<br />
<br />
a) Click on File menu, click Options, Add-ins, Go button besides Manage: Com-in Add.
<br />
b) Check if there are add-ins listed, clear the checkbox. <br />
c) Close the Office program and restart it. <br />
d) Disable each add-in one at a time, restart the Excel, and repeat the above procedure. If the issue reappears again, it will help you to determine which add-in is causing this issue.<br />

    <title>Lookup list for custom field works in filter, but is empty in report - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alangopin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lookup list for custom field works in filter, but is empty in report</h2>
                    <p>I have created a lookup list for a custom text field in MS Project 2010 Standard SP1.</p>
<p>The field is Text10 and it has been renamed to Dept.</p>
<p>A filter that filters by that field gives a drop down list and works to find entries that have the field value selected in the drop down list:</p>
<p>The definition of the filter is as follows:</p>
<p>Field Name: Dept&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Test: Contains&nbsp;&nbsp; Value(s): "Enter Dept:"?</p>
<p>A report that uses the same filter shows the drop down arrow when it is run, but the drop down list is empty.</p>
<p>The report works if the user types the value when requested.</p>
<p>The report definition is as follows:</p>
<p>Name: Resource Usage For Dept</p>
<p>Crosstab</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Column: 1 Weeks</p>
<p>Row: Resources&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Work</p>
<p>And task assignments is checked</p>
<p>Filter: Dept</p>
<p>How do I get the drop down list to appear when the report is run?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Alan Gopin, PMP</p>

            Alan,
<div>You are looking at the difference between an auto-filter, which does provide a drop down, and a custom filter, which is more flexible but does not provide for variable input other then via an interactive filter criteria, which you are already doing.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Since auto-filters only apply to views, they cannot be used for reports.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Bottom line, you can't get there from here. Sorry.</div>

    <title>Creating an Outlook.com email account through Office 365 PERSONAL - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> catjax17  say:</h3>
<h2>            Creating an Outlook.com email account through Office 365 PERSONAL version in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I purchased the Office 365 PERSONAL version for the sole purpose of being able to use outlook.com in the office suite to create an outlook account. A REAL outlook.com account, not the free web based account that was once Hotmail and live.com. I can no information
 that even gives me a HINT about how to do that. I am retired, and work at home, ergo, PERSONAL version. I did not want to buy the Home version, as it did not offer very many of the other programs under the office 365 suite. I used outlook.com for years at
 work and at home, while still working, and even after until I had to uninstall and reinstall outlook back on my PC, and I couldn't do it of course, because my email address it was under was my work email address, so I decided to go ahead and upgrade to 365.
 I wish I had never done it. I am beginning to believe that I CANNOT create an outlook .com account using Office 365 unless I create and Enterprise account (which I DO NOT NEED) or it seems to force you to either enter in a school or work email account. I was
 not told this when I purchased the Office 365 PERSONAL once I had to now purchase that separately (which is another thing I am NOT HAPPY about by the way). What bothers me as well, is that I rarely get any help from MS about these things, and I am left to
 the Community, which may or may not be able to help me. I am hoping someone can. If I am unable to create an outlook.com email address through the Office 365 PERSONAL version of the software, then I purchased it for nothing. Using a non web based outlook.com
 email account is much better than using the other outlook.com email address, as there are a lot of company's and businesses that feel more comfortable with a more reputable email address behind that @sign. I have an @att.net address, and I am forced to use
 it too much because it too is considerable a reputable email address, just as outlook.com. I don't know how they can tell if it's a webmail outlook.com, but they can and this causes me many issues. I know have managed to create 3 different outlook.com (formerly
 Hotmail and live.com) addresses, I say different, they really aren't. They are all the SAME EMAIL ADDRESS, with different passwords. This was done when I kept trying to create an outlook.com address through the Office 365 PERSONAL version. Now I have to deal
 with that big ol' mess. Great. Any assistance would be appreciated. I will keep checking back for an answer. Thank you, Maggie the Cat</p>

<p>Hello CatJax17,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Office subscription cannot be transferred over to another Microsoft account. Once you associate it to an email address, this cannot be transferred. If you wish not to use your work email, you can
 create a new email address, check out this <a href="https://outlook.live.com/owa/?bFS=1#nlp=1&amp;signup=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> on how to. Once you have created a new email, you can now purchase an Office subscription but make sure to use the email that you created.
</p>
<p>

<p>According to what I've read, Office 365 Personal and Home are hosted by Outlook.com mailboxes, so they are "real" Outlook.com accounts. What makes you think they're not?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The free Outlook.com accounts are also "real" Outlook.com/Microsoft accounts. So, too, are addresses ending in @msn.com, @hotmail.com, and @live.com.</p>

                    I've recently installed microsoft office 2010 32bit version on my laptop which runs on windows 7 32bit version. However, whenever I open up Words, User Account keeps asking for permission to make changes to the hard drive. I opened up Excel, Powerpoint

            if you loose the battery or the charge dont work for Communicator 9000/9000i you can use this circuit here to power on the device
<a href="http://shaddack.twibright.com/projects/hw_nokiabat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://shaddack.twibright.com/projects/hw_nokiabat/</a><br />
(use the circuit without the 2 diodes and without the capacitor) connect 5 volts to the circuit input and connect circuit's output to the device's battery pins<br />
you can find phone's - volt pin with a buzzer connected on the first left pin and phone's chasis, the + volt pin is the last opposite pin... - and + are the two edge pins (find the&nbsp; BID-BSI pins according on the circuit shematics)

<h2>            PC Suite 6.84, Restore crash under Vista x64 Ultimate</h2>
                    Hello, there. I have PC Suite 6.84 and, of course contents copier V4.0 on Vista Ultimate x64. Backup went very well with both N73ME or 6267. However, on Restore part, when go to part that ask us which Backup you want to restore, it crashs and Windows has
 to close program.<br />
PS. Not a problem with WinXP. All with USB connection.<br />
<br />
What should I do? Any suggestion??<br />
<br />
Also, N-Series PC suite have had the similar problem but right from start Contents Copier V3.0. Is there any bugs in program or it just Winows Vista?

<p>I hardwire my laptop after class or am on a private wireless network N. &nbsp;Network speeds 20 Mbps down, 7Mbps Upload</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am constantly getting messages that the notebooks are not in synch and content is not visible both in class and after I add notes in class. &nbsp;Some of this looks like overnight is not long enough to synch the original notes that I print from PDF into OneNote.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Originally, some of the .one files were 100Mb. &nbsp;I have now divided up my notes so that I have multiple indepent notebooks for class lectures instead of one big class notebook with tabs for each lecture.\</p>
<p>
</p><p>This makes my largest .one file about 10 - 20 Mb. &nbsp;The notes from the PDF's are picture intensive. I still can't reliably load and synch a 20 Mb notebook without doing them 1 at a time and waiting for one to synch before loading another. I had to create
 them all locally while offline since I didn't want any synching during the process where I copied sections of my original large notebooks to new individual notebooks. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point 3 or 4 notebooks is more like 12 and I am spending a day resynching them all. &nbsp;I have no way to know what a teacher will create as notes and very little confidence I won't have a future notebook that's too big to synch overnight. &nbsp;I use Windows
 10 on a new pentium laptop with an SSD hard drive. &nbsp;I don't think onedrive can handle managing class notes. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone suggest something different? &nbsp;Is it the images or file size? &nbsp;If it is I can't user OneNote for school.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>I can only synch a notebook if it's open as far as I can tell. &nbsp;These synchs are all from the PC. &nbsp;When they don't finish my tablet (IPad) gets a message that a page isn't availabe and then I can't edit the page in class. &nbsp;For the pages that do synch and
 I can edit, I get the same message on my PC when I try to open them and see my notes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe this is all due to size and synch limits on normal cable modem attached systems and also some very extensive processing from the Print to One Note driver. &nbsp;I was hoping there would be options in that driver to make the notebooks smaller or more
 efficient but it's a very basic set of options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I finished dividing my one notebook into 9. &nbsp;All are a max of 20 MB. &nbsp;I created them locally by copying the content out of the original big notebook into multiple new notebooks. &nbsp;I can't wait the unpredictably long times it takes to synch a big notebook.
 I now have multiple notebooks and they will all "Resynch" with not changes in a couple minutes. &nbsp;It was the first "sharing to OneDrive" and the subsequent first Synch that took the couple hours to complete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is that this is only the first 2 weeks of classes. &nbsp;I have not idea how many notebooks I could end up with or how big they might get. &nbsp;I really was hoping for guidance on size of OneNote notebooks or better ways to print to onenote to synch. &nbsp;My
 PDF's from professors range from sub 1 MB to 5 MB. &nbsp;It isn't practical for me to have a class split across a dozen notebooks by year end (my best guess at this rate). &nbsp;I wanted / hoped for 1 notebook per class and I need to know if the incremental synchs are
 always going to be faster and how much time I should expect to need to synch up the first time I print notes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm still getting class material and I really don't have much time to make the decision to go back to paper or taking notes in Word or maybe trying a competitor product. &nbsp;My two newest PDF's for classes are 5 MB and 14 MB in size but cover multiple lessons.
 &nbsp;Think of them as a sylabus with all the details. &nbsp;Do I need to print them to multiple notebooks with no more than a certain number of pages? &nbsp;Someone must know if I"m beating my head against a wall or not. &nbsp;Incremental synch sounded great but the intial shareing
 is killing me so badly &nbsp;and even the print to OneNote takes long enough that I am afraid to go forward. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Update. &nbsp;I decided to start again from another computer. &nbsp;Network connection is better than previously since this machine is wired to the network and no wireless is involved. &nbsp;Speedtest. net shows 100Mbps Upload and 30 Mbps download so a couple times faster
 than I saw on wireless.</p>
<p>Created 4 new local notebooks from single PDF presentations.</p>
<p>1 ended up with a *.one file of 5Mb</p>
<p>1 was 18 Mb</p>
<p>2 are 30 Mb.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Local print to OneNote processes each took less than 30 minutes but the larger files were longest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then shared the Notebooks to OneDrive to make them accessible from other devices. &nbsp;That process went quickly and the synch status looks like it completes quickly but the notebook is not fully synched. &nbsp;The synch setting for OneNote is manual to let me
 control when the synchs happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then hit Synch Now button for each of the 4 new Notebooks.</p>
<p>The 5 Mb notebook first synch is complete in 30 min.</p>
<p>2 hours later the other three Notebooks are all still synching. &nbsp;Looking at Windows Resource Monitor for Windows 7 (I am using OneNote 2013) I see oOneNote as the top network traffic application for the entire period but the traffic reported under "SEND
 Bytes" &nbsp;ranges from 90,000 B/sec to 600,000B/sec with I would guess an average around 300,000B/Sec.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it would appear that this traffic rate for OneNote synch does not take advantage of my faster connection by very much and that there is some processing with setting up the initial shared Notebooks that is making the first Synchs go so slow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know if starting with a locally loaded notebook and then sharing in OneDrive is somehow the problem. &nbsp;I could have physically copied these notebooks to Onedrive multiple times by now. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>OneDrive does not appear to be a solution for a student to organize class notes. &nbsp;I don't have time to micro manage this synch process. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went ahead and copied the files to both OneDrive and Google Drive by moving them into the appropriate local folders. In two separate steps after I stopped the Manual OneNote synch. &nbsp;Google Drive synchs aggressively and quickly pushing my resource manager
 network traffic to 3,000,000 +B/sec and moves the files in a few minutes. &nbsp;OneDrive appears to be less aggressive in using bandwidth or the OneDrive servers are slower. &nbsp;The transfers of the same files barely hit 1,000,000 B/Sec. &nbsp;It was still faster than
 OneNote but the Onedrive synch also spent a lot of time under 1MB/Sec which the Google client never did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also noticed that for short periods OneNote will open 2 or 3 threads but each stays around the 300,000B/sec traffic rate and usually only 1 of them runs at that speed. &nbsp;It's a short term boost from threading that I don't understand why it's not bigger
 and more sustained.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is either some sort of throttling to index an upload the notebooks or it's a limitation of OneDrive to allow support for more users. &nbsp;In either case it's a losing situation for my class notes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I did try the option mentioned of closing the OneNote notebook that is not synch.ing. &nbsp;If the Notebook is not finished synching onenote tries to force the synch before it closes the book and usually becomes unresponsive. &nbsp;Either than or a differnt OneNote
 is syncing changes dialog just sits on the screen. &nbsp;The progress bar gradually fills up but it doesn't complete any faster than the prior synch. &nbsp;Only the smallest of the 4 test notebooks completed in under an hour the others are still trying to synch 3 hours
 later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had one question. &nbsp;I use a free OneDrive account. &nbsp;If those are throttled to prefer the for pay OneDrive users that would explain this behavior. &nbsp;I will try to research this since it would be worth getting this limit removed if that is all it takes and
 OneDrive just isn't bad at synch.</p>

            <p>I received a polite note asking if my questions inactivity meant that it was answered, resolved or unresolved. &nbsp;I have supplied a ton of data and my question:</p>
<p>
</p><p>IS NOT RESOLVED. &nbsp;I have received no response and I have to conclude that OneNote synching to OneDrive is unable to handle file or notebook sizes in excess of 5 MB. &nbsp;This is approximately 8 - 10 pages of a PDF file printed to the OneNote driver. &nbsp;This size
 synchs and works ok but increasing this to 10 MB shows a steady degradation of the initial synch time and a high probability that when I try to work on my IPAD the data will not be up to date online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am working with third party PDF editor / management tools with file level backup to OneDrive or GoogleDrive. &nbsp;I find GoogleDrive to be faster but I have a OneDrive account and I am trying to make that work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can build large OneNote notebooks locally from class PDF materials and as long as I don't share them to OneDrive and try to synch I can work with OneNote as a kind of final repository for PDF's that I work with and annotate in class in their native PDF
 format with a PDF editor. &nbsp;So I might use OneDrive as a local file cabinet but that is a very disappointing and limited use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I expanded my test of PDF synching to a business class network with 100 Mbps Up / Down speeds and I can sometimes get a PDF to be 20 MB but that is only 4 classroom PDF handouts and a class has 5 times that many regularly and even in a business class connection
 OneNote can't handle it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I can get past the first Synch to the cloud, I can usually get incremental changes to synch, even with large notebooks. &nbsp;It's just too hard to get the first synch done and I can't use a crazy multi notebook setup just to get incremental updates "some
 of the time" with OneNote. &nbsp; It kills me that students using the Macintosh Notability product can seem to do what I can't very easily on the same school wireless networks. &nbsp;This is a big letdown for me for Microsoft products and the cloud.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope I am clear that my issue was not resolved and that I am forced to pick an alternative that lets me continue my class work. &nbsp;I don't have time for OneNote.</p>

            <p>I took a simpler path. &nbsp;I invested a small amount in Foxit PDF since most of my documents are PDF's and Foxit offers a sync module for both Google Drive. &nbsp;I don't recall if they have a synch module for Onedrive. &nbsp;My dissatisfaction with One Note and OneDrive
 moved me to Google drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still don't let a terms worth of classes equate to one giant PDF. &nbsp;I have folders by class and keep the PDF &nbsp;a manageable size. &nbsp;Size will depend on the network speed of your campus wireless but if you read my detailed posts above I do better with Google
 drive than ONeDrive in all circumstances.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I edit and synch from mainly my laptop and then have what I need on the tablet. &nbsp;Tablet changes can also be synched but it's not the same kind of issue as with onedrive and onenote. &nbsp;It's more like a complete copy rather than searching for deltas. &nbsp;At
 least it appears that way. &nbsp;YOu need to get used to the Foxit PDF editor and there may be others that work too. &nbsp;I'm successful like this for over a year and one thing I also do is I move completed classes out of the synch folders. &nbsp;I actually just copy them
 to Onedrive with a local laptop backup. &nbsp;That makes my synch workload much smaller by limiting the data to active classes. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Zune Won&#39;t turn on, install APX driver&#63;</h2>
                    So I am seeing a trend here in topics.&nbsp; My Zune HD 32GB, which I've had for under a year suddenly stopped working.&nbsp; It was playing a podcast just fine, and then the screen went black, the podcast kept playing, and then it all went dead.&nbsp; I tried turning
 it back on and got the "Please connect to PC", I did that but when I connected it, a screen popped up that said install APX driver, I tried installing but it failed to install and asked for a disc (clearly there is no disc).&nbsp; Manually installing does not work
 either.&nbsp; Now my zune won't turn on at all.&nbsp; I tried holding down the reset buttons four separate times, but that did not work. I currently have it plugged in hoping after 30 minutes it will come back on, but I notice a few other threads have this theme.&nbsp; Can
 someone from Microsoft please get on here and tell us what the APX driver is, why are our Zune HD's becoming paperweights, and what can we do to fix this?&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Okay, just tried charging it for 30 minutes, and still no response.<br />
