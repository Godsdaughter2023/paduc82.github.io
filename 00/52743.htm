<h2>            Password Reset Wizard Problems &#34;an error occurred while the wizard was attempting to set the password for this user account&#34;.</h2>
                    I have my normal Microsoft account and a local administrator account on my laptop. However, I've forgotten the password to the admin account and whenever I attempted to use a password reset disk, it said "an error occurred while the wizard was attempting
 to set the password for this user account." I don't know what's wrong with the disk and I need help figuring out why it's doing that and how I can reset the admin password.

<p>Don't waste your time following instructions posted by "Microsoft" database operators.&nbsp; They will get you nowhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A Password reset disk will only work if it is </p>
<ul>
<li>the latest one that has been made </li><li>on the same computer&nbsp;</li><li>within the same OS installation&nbsp;</li><li>within the same user account in which you are now trying to use it.&nbsp; </li></ul>
<p>It will give you that error message if it is not the latest one, if it has been made by a different user account, if it was made within a different OS installation&nbsp;or if it has been made on another computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have forgotten the password for the only Admin account on the computer and if that Admin user account is a local user account [not one linked to an online MSAccount as they have their own
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/sign-in-cant" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
online password reset procedures</a>] then the only advice we are allowed to give in this forum is to reinstall Windows.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, when you have resolved this problem, do note that a Password reset disk is no more effective than simply writing the password down somewhere secure.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft wireless mobile mouse 3000 stopped working</h2>
                    I have this mouse for a while, one day the red light is on, I thought is time to change the battery, so I did. Right after i change the battery, it turns green, but after 2-3 mins, it will turn back to red. I tried with brand new batteries a few times
 already. Every time I put the receiver back to the mouse and take it out again, it will repeat the situations, from green to red in a few minutes. So can you tell me what is wrong with the mouse? It is fixable? Thanks.&nbsp;

<p>Ciao, durante il download puoi spegnere sia la tv che la xbox (la xbox continuerà ad andare in modalità apposta per il download fino a suo completamento e poi si arresterà del tutto), puoi giocare a giochi ma non online, altrimenti si interromperà il download
 (non perdi niente va solo in pausa), riguardo al canale tv non saprei ma swe4condo me si interromperebbe</p>

<p>Well here is my dilema. Microsoft is dealing with a service upgrade which interferes with EVERYTHING I want to buy from the marketplace. I don't know if this still is going on but when I downloaded Rain, an error message popped up and then all of a sudden
 I got him for free but &nbsp;NO RAIN! I called Xbox live twice about this and they said that they are still upgrading and it may last til tomorrow! Microosft had this planned so we can pay more money for a dlc character. What the HECK!</p>

<p>Hm, odd. Out of all the complaints for the DLC, I haven't really had any problems like the people keep stating. Kenshi being a day late wasn't a problem, so relax. This save erasing issue or not being able to download the next character doesn't make any
 sense, really. The Season Pass and even the characters state to buy through the in-game store and download from there to avoid being charged twice. Also, it doesn't help people complain about a problem but they don't exactly clarify what it is. Draft, what's
 your issue? You say you downloaded Rain...but didn't? Or are you meaning you got the compatibility pack for him? Did you have the Season Pass to get him? Calm down and explain it slowly.</p>

<p>The only problem I had with downloading Rain was that when I was playing ladder waiting for him to download, there would be a long pause between battles and it kept telling me that download has stopped for Rain. Before I would play a ladder match while I
 was downloading Skarlet and Kenshi and no problems. So I finally decided to download him again and just wait for him to download instead of doing anythnig else and now I can play him with no problems.</p>

<p>I downloaded the season pass and got skarlet, kenshi and freddy but not rain. I downloaded everything through the in game store too. I tried to download rain several times... and waited several times. All other dlc (including the klassic skins and fatalities)
 downloaded within 5 seconds. Rain just won't download for some reason. :(</p>

            My gadgets also disappeared and when I would right click and go to gadgets gallery it would say " Gadgets gallery is controlled by system administrator" I tried everything and nothing worked then I went to one of the Microsoft help pages on the net and
 found out that there was an update that disabled gadgets because of security threats-anyways they have 2 things Microsoft fix it to disable desktop gadgets and side bar and&nbsp; Microsoft fix it to fix the gadgets n sidebar and its a perm. fix works perfect now
 just download the Microsoft Fix It--there are so many people with this issue I don't know why Microsoft isn't telling people about it!!!

<h2>            microphone wont work its detected but no programs will work.</h2>
                    <p>hello. i was using my microphones just fine an hour ago and suddenly it stopped working. i use a windows 10 pro laptop and it just stopped with no explanation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have tried running troubleshooters, updating drivers, allowing my mic for use in privacy settings. a few other things but nothing works so far. the microphone works by the way. the strange thing is even my laptop build in mic does not work.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>now you might thing of a laptop hardware problem but there actually is a single thing within windows that actually seems to reconize&nbsp; my microphone. when i right click my volume icon in the bottom left corner and click sounds, i&nbsp; can click on the recording
 tab and see the bar indicating that both my plugged in microphone and my laptop microphones still function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have tried many sugestions this is so puzzling. as i said, even my computer seems to know that my mics work but no apps do. i went to provacy settings and enabled mic for all my apps.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows Currency Settings</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running an application on Windows 7 and, for some reason, it started showing the invoices in Euros instead of Dollars. I checked the Regional Settings and everything looks good in the keyboard and currency configurations. I also contacted the application
 vendor and they checked the database and everything is configured to show in dollars as well. It is happening only in one machine, if I log in to another machine with the same Windows and application credentials, the invoices are in dollars.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any other place on windows where we can change the currency format or any other thing that I should check?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

            <p>Hi Fabio,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the description, I understand that you are facing some issues on your Windows 7 using an application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This might have occurred due to some system conflicts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to follow the steps to check whether the currency settings in the computer is set perfect or not.</p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong>“Windows + R”</strong> and <strong>press enter.</strong></li><li>Type <strong>Control panel.</strong></li><li>In the control panel, click on <strong>large icons</strong> on the <strong>right hand side.</strong></li><li>Click on <strong>Region.</strong></li><li>Click on <strong>Format tab</strong> and then click on <strong>Additional settings.</strong></li><li>In the <strong>Customize format Window</strong>, click on <strong>Currency.</strong></li><li>Then scroll down the option which says <strong>currency symbol</strong> and <strong>
set to Dollar ($).</strong></li><li>And then click on <strong>Apply</strong> and <strong>ok.</strong></li></ol>

            <p>Hello Mayank,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply. Actually the Regional Settings / Currency was the first thing that I checked, everything is in dollars ($) over there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any other place where we can set the currency format that could be in conflict with the Regional Settings? Is there a place to set the currency directly in the Microsoft Office (Word and Excel) as well?</p>
<p>

            Hi sandeep, 
<br />
<br />If you keep your system up to date with Windows 10 Automatic updates, your system should automatically go from one version to the next automatically
<br />
<br />Each of the versions you have listed are major upgrades to the Windows 10 operating system, which are now released twice yearly . . 
<br />
<br />
<br />1803 has been released, you should go straight to that version to bring your system up to date and make all previous updates obsolete . . .
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Uninstall any 3rd party Anti-virus - this is a known issue with 1803
<br />
<br />Then, double click it and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

            Hi Sandeep.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You need to have the latest version as soon as possible after it's release, to be fully up to date and secure.  Only if your hardware no longer Supports that version or if it is presently causing you problems that a Clean Install cannot fix would I go back to a prior version using media available from <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>
<br />
<br />What I'd do is install Media Creation Tool from this link, choosing the button to Install Tool Now and then open the installed app and choose Upgrade This PC Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the latest version 1803 (which you need anyway) and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during install then these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If these do not help then report back any verbatim error message or behavior.  
<br />
<br />If you want to temporarily block the update then try running the Hide Updates tool downloaded and installed from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />If it wont' find and hide the Update then you can set a Metered Connection to turn off Windows Updates for awhile until the version matures and you can try again using the method I suggest which always works best:   <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />Almost everyone with major version upgrade problems who Clean installs the same version does not have those problems.  This Clean Install should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            It would honestly take a great American Novel to list whats different between all the feature updates. 
<br />
<br />Some versions contain improved security, usability improvements and changes to the interface and under the hood intelligence. 
<br />
<br />If you want to know whats known, go to the Update Security page for Windows and go through the cumulative update security list for each version.

            See the other replies you've gotten, and let me add that the first two digits of the version number is the year of the update (so 17 is 2017, 18 is 2018, etc.) and the last two digits are the month. So 1803, the current version, is March 2018.<br />

            MS has made a fundamental change in the way it develops Windows.  
<br />
<br />Before Windows 10 they would release a 'new version', like XP, Vista, Win 7, Win 8 then in 2-3 years they would either release a "Service Pack" or another new Major version with new features and major changes to the underlying structure. In between they would release security patches and only minor new features.
<br />
<br />Starting with Win 10 MS switched to a "Software As A Service" , or SaaS, model. Rather than waiting 2 or 3 years for new features they now release them twice a year. The numbers you listed are called "Version numbers" for these semi annual "updates"
<br />Version 1507
<br />Version 1511
<br />Version 1607
<br />Version 1703
<br />Version 1709
<br />Version 1803
<br />Version 1809
<br />
<br />The naming convention they use is the first 2 char are the year, 2015, 2016 etc.
<br />The last 2 char are supposed to be the month they are released, 07=July, 11=Nov, etc
<br />
<br />Within a build, MS keeps working on development. They create "builds" to test changes as they are finished. Then they release updates containing security and bug fixes on roughly a monthly schedule. More if required.  These  builds are identified with 2 part numbers, ie 16299.431.  
<br />
<br />The first part represents corresponding the the Version number, 1709 in this case.  
<br />
<br />The second part represents individual builds that are compiled and tested, ie since Version 1709 / 16299 was created they created and tested 431 subsequent small builds in this case.  The general public will see large jumps in the second part counter between most of the releases they see.
<br />
<br />MS has promised to support a specific Version for only 18 months, roughly until the 3rd subsequent Version is released.  After that, the old version will no longer get any updates at all. 
<br />
<br />Andre already gave you the link to the update history page:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4099479/windows-10-update-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/409947...</a>
<br />
<br />It lists the builds as they are released to the general public. They contain a brief, incomplete list of changes made to the that build.  The general public never gets to see the full list of changes and "improvements". MS likes to keep a few "surprises" "secret" ... &lt;sarcasm&gt;.

<p>So various versions mentioned by me will have different feature set. But I want to know, does patch released for windows-10 will be different for each version number ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>e.g. I do have 3 OS setup : 1507, 1607, 1709</p>
<p>So if I patch 1507 , then it will get upgrade to the latest version, correct ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>And does Microsoft release new version specific updates every month ? e.g. 1507, there will be some separate updates as compared to other version ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can we avoid upgrade of version during patch update process ?</p>

            <p><span>Hi Jorge,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>From your issue description, I understand you are having some issues with a program.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Kindly answer these questions so I can get a better understanding of the issue<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>a. What is the
<span>&nbsp;</span>make/model computer are you running? 
</span></p>
<span>b. Have you run the Windows 8 Upgrade assistant tool?<br />
c. Are you using any third party security software?</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Kindly try these methods to check if the issue can be resolved</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: Run the Safety Scanner</span></strong></p>
<p><b><span><br />
</span></b><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Note: Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means
 there is a potential for data loss.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Method 2:Run a system file checker scan and check if that helps.</strong></span><strong>
</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Refer to the following steps to run SFC scan.</span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>a)Move the mouse pointer to bottom left of the screen where you see preview of start menu and Right-click to bring up a
</span><span>list of Windows settings.</span>
</p>
<p><span>b)Click on ‘Command Prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated command prompt. Note: Click ‘Yes’ if it prompts for permission.</span></p>
<span>c)In the command prompt type in the following command: ‘sfc /scannow’.</span>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>If a Windows Resource Protection (WRP) file is missing or is corrupted, Windows may not behave as expected. For
 example, </span><span>some Windows functions may not work, or Windows may crash. The System File Checker tool (SFC.exe) scans for missing or
</span><span>corrupted system files and repairs them.</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3 :
</span></strong></p>
<p><b><span><br />
</span></b><span>Place the computer in clean boot and check if the issue persists. You may follow the article mentioned to perform a clean boot.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Perform a Clean Boot</span></strong></p>
<p><b><span><br />
</span></b><span>Follow the instructions (Step 1 for Windows 8) given in this link to perform a clean boot:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Note: After performing the troubleshooting steps in clean boot, follow these steps to return the computer
 to Normal startup mode.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>a. On the Start screen, type msconfig, and then press Enter.<br />
b. On the General tab, tap or click the Normal Startup option, and then tap or clickOK.<br />
c. When you are prompted to restart the computer, tap or click Restart.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope it helps. For any further Windows related assistance, feel free to contact us and we will be glad
 to help</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
Are you using any third party security software?<br />
<br />
I suggest you to try the troubleshooting steps mentioned in the thread by me ( Karthik Vengaloor replied on
<br />
January 15, 2013) and check if it helps.</p>
<p>If the issue persists, I suggest you to Follow these methods.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong> Disconnect all the external devices except keyboard and mouse and try installing Windows 8.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2: Disable the security software temporarily.</strong><br />
<br />
Note: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you should not disable your antivirus software. If you do have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as
 soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network during the time your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</p>

<h2>            SO, how do I access my account that I&#38;&#35;39&#59;ve already accesses&#63; Tough to explain...</h2>
                    
<p>My son was using my Xbox 360 primarily. &nbsp;I got a Netflix account. &nbsp;Then, last week I got a Gold Membership. &nbsp;I cannot get my Gold Membership to work. &nbsp;I have input my email address, user name, and password in about 100 times. Each time, I get a pop up stating
 that I'm using an account that is already in use (YEAH, IT'S MINE).. &nbsp;This is all happening while I'm in
<em>MY</em> Xbox.com account.</p>
<p>I created a brand new profile, typed exactly how my xbox.com account shows it. &nbsp;I then deleted my old profile, as well as my son's to see if that would solve anything, but, not so far.</p>
<p>I'm so confused I dont even know if this is making sense.</p>
<p>Bottom line. I can't get into Netflix becasue I cant switch/download a profile. &nbsp;All my profile information is correct on the machine and my xbox.com account.</p>

<p>How I can I use MY Account? &nbsp;anybody have any clue's? I'll type up step by step tomorrow, with the pop-ups. I'm mentally fired right now.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for any help! &nbsp;</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>A few questions.<br />
<br />
1.Did you wish to keep your original account and turn that into gold or did you want to create a brand new account and turn that into gold?<br />
<br />
2.This gold membership you bought, is this a redemption code card that you bought at gamestop or at any retail store?<br />
<br />
I'm gonna toss out a bit of info so that could help you out with your issue and probably help you out with any future issue too...and some things you might already know.<br />
<br />
First things first. Your account on the XBOX and XBOX.com are one in the same.<br />
Lets pretend your gamertag is XBOXFAN and when you created this account, you used the email *** Email address is removed for privacy *** with a password of 123456<br />
<br />
That will now be your Microsoft account and it will be universal between all MS products. (this used to be known as your MS passport I.D)<br />
<br />
Let's say you wanted to create a 2nd/brand new gamertag. While creating this new account, you would not be able to use the email address *** Email address is removed for privacy *** because that email is already tied to a different account. Each new gamertag you create will also require
 a unique email address.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now lets go into your current gamertags on the console. Right now, are there any gamertags available right now? You said you deleted yours and your son's.<br />
The first thing you will want to do is recover your original gamertag. <br />
<br />
follow this link for a step by step guide on how to recover your existing gamertag to your console.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/profile-move-delete" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/profile-move-delete</a><br />
<br />
when following those steps, you will enter the gamertag you created, the email address you tied to it and the password you used when you created the account. (not your password that you used when accessing your email...unless they are one in the same, if so,
 you should change them both eventually)<br />
<br />
Also, for whatever reasons, never post your email address or password you have tied to your gamertag and never give it out to anyone.<br />
<br />
<br />
So you recovered your first tag. If you also had a 2nd tag that worked, you can also recover that one too.
<br />
<br />
Now to redeem your code. The important thing is to log into the account you wish to upgrade to gold while on the xbox console.<br />
When you are at the dashboard, while signed into XBL, press the guide (silver button on the controller)<br />
Press left once and at the bottom of that page you will see an option to redeem code.<br />
Select that and a giant key pad should appear. This is where you will enter the code that you bought from the store.<br />
<br />
Once you have entered the code, you will receive a message that says something along the lines of. "This code is for 3, 6 or 12 months of xbox live" (depending on which card you bought)
<br />
Select ok to redeem and it will say "congratulations on redeeming your code"<br />
<br />
You might have to sign out and sign back into XBL in order for the gold to take its course.</p>

<p>Thanks for the awesome response. I'll try to figure this out.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;I intended on keeping my original account. &nbsp;Each time I tried to log in or use it, the Xbox said it was already in user, under my personal email account. I honestly cannot explain it, because I don't know what it's "seeing". &nbsp;Make sense? In other words,
 it's telling me I have an account under my email address. &nbsp;But when I use my username, it tells me it's under another name. I dont have another username. &nbsp;It's always been SLEPE67. &nbsp;Profile HAS changed, but I have never used my stuff online. &nbsp;My son has, but
 under HIS email and username, with store bought memberships.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;The Gold Membership I purchased was purchased in here.</p>
<p>My brain is mush. I'll re-read your reply a few times and try your instructions and let you know how they helped. Thanks once again!</p>

<p>yeah, just keep posting here and i'll keep checking back.<br />
<br />
So slepe67 is your gamertag and your son has his own gamertag too correct?<br />
<br />
<br />
When you log onto this web site, does it automatically load up with your user account signed in or does it ask you to enter you email and password each time?<br />
<br />
If you are entering your email and password each time and then being logged in as Slepe67, everything should be fine when you follow the steps to recovering your profile in that link.<br />
<br />
<br />
Another question. Did you happen to have a account on your xbox that was never connected to xbox live with the name Slepe67?</p>
<p>that could have been a problem there.<br />
<br />
Lets say you had your xbox, created a profile and used it without ever having it connected to the internet.<br />
Then while on the computer, you create an online profile on this site, with the same exact name.<br />
If you went back to the console and tried to recover that account you just created on the PC, nothing would happen since there is still an offline account with that same gamertag.<br />
<br />
Heck, the same thing would happen If you created a gamertag while not connected to the internet and then tried to make an XBL account while using that same exact name.<br />
<br />
The console would not let you create 2 different profiles with the same exact gamertag...and I remember 9 years ago when my cousin and I got our XBOX 360 something like this happened.<br />
<br />
We went to my cousin's and we played for a bit.He created an account offline and a few weeks later when he got his broadband set up in his new place, there was no way to convert his profile that was created offline. He had to delete the offline gamertag, kept
 his save file, created the online associated gamertag under the same exact name. He was able to use his save files but none of the achievements were going to carry over.</p>

<p>When you log onto this web site, does it automatically load up with your user account signed in or does it ask you to enter you email and password each time?</p>
<p>IT AUTOMATICALLY LOADS THE SLEPE67 PROFILE</p>
<p>Another question. Did you happen to have a account on your xbox that was never connected to xbox live with the name Slepe67? &nbsp;</p>
<p>NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE..IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME. &nbsp;I TRIED IT ABOUT 3 YEARS AGO, COULDN'T GET IT TO WORK. &nbsp;MY WIRELESS WASN'T UP TO SNUFF BACK THEN.</p>
<p>PROFILES:</p>
<p>I had an OFFLINE profile I used "Dirt" &nbsp;Never went online with it. Again, dont recall if I tried to. I deleted my "Dirt" (offline) profile and my son's profile. &nbsp;He's got his own machine now. &nbsp;The only profile on there is SLEPE67.</p>
<p>AS IT STANDS: when I fire up the XBOX &amp; go to NETFLIX, it immediately taks me to "Upgrade to Xbox LIVE Gold". &nbsp;Bottom right, there are 2 boxes. &nbsp;One says UPGRADE TO GOLD (which I cannot click on), the other says SWITCH PROFILES. &nbsp;When I click that, the SIGN
 IN Box opens. My options are CREATE PROFILE &amp; DOWNLOAD PROFILE.</p>
<p>CREATE PROFILE is what is is. I dont want to do that, right? &nbsp; When I click DOWNLOAD PROFILE, it takes me to the screen where I input my Microsoft Account with email address &amp; password. (NOTE: my controller keypad quit working, typing with the conrtoller
 sucks after about 5 attempts) I loads for about 5 seconds and I get " HI SLEPE 67! Downloading your profile." It thinks again and then I get a pop up that shows "Sorry, Xbox LIVE profiles can't be downloaded &nbsp;tight now. Try again later. &nbsp; 80151011." &nbsp;I cannot
 find that code.</p>
<p>Each and every time try to download my profile, I get the exact same message.</p>
<p>Should i just wipe my machine clean and start over? IF so, got a link on how to do that?</p>
<p>THANKS AGAIN for all your help! &nbsp; I'm 40 &amp; pulling my hair out! &nbsp;My son could figure this out in a heartbeat, but I'm stubborn &amp; dont want to ask for help. &nbsp;:)</p>

    <title>How to tell if user has administrative rights&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stuffy9911  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to tell if user has administrative rights&#63;</h2>
                    Hello all!<br />
<br />
My job requires me to help customers install software.&nbsp; One of the requirements of the software is the user must have administrative rights to the computer.&nbsp;
<br />
<ol>
<li>How can I tell if the user is part of the Administrative group?</li><li>Whats the deal with "Admin" vs "Administrator" user names?&nbsp; More specifically, which is the actual "default" administrator and which one is 'made up'.</li></ol>
Thanks.<br />
<br />

            Open Computer Management;Start - right click Computer - select Manage. Expand Local User and Groups, and in the Groups Folder you'll be able to add users to the Administrators group.
<div><br />
<div>Administrator is the built-in administrator account and is normally disabled by default. During the&nbsp;installation of&nbsp;Windows 7 it will ask for an account to be created, and as Administrator has already been taken some will put in Admin for this. This account
 will also be an administrator for the machine.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You can also manage user accounts from "User Accounts" in the control panel, but I find it easier to see what's going from Computer Management.</div>

    <title>Can I uninstall Advanced Audio FX Engine and Advanced Video FX Engine - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> psalim  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I uninstall Advanced Audio FX Engine and Advanced Video FX Engine from from Vista 32 Home Basic&#63; Does vista has equivalent software installed in its place in the laptop&#63;</h2>
                    I have Vista Home Basic-32 bit Lap top. Advanced Audio FX Engine and Advanced Video FX Engine&nbsp; are seen installed in it&nbsp;quite late after its purchase. Publisher's name is kept blank in the Programmes and Features list. I doubt whether this installation
 helps in any way right now. I&nbsp; believe that the Vista 32 laptop might have its own built in software to do the functions of Advanced Audio FX Engine and Advanced Video FX Engine. For that reason, is it wise to uninstall and save discspace?

<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Is Dell the manufacturer of the laptop?</p>
<p>Advanced audio and video FX engines are used to control webcam and audio on Dell computers.
<span>&nbsp;</span>If you do not require the webcam control, then it is safe to uninstall it.</p>

<h3> beckame  say:</h3>
<h2>            2009 disc won&#39;t run on Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    I've searched everywhere and did find a couple of answers, but none of the fixes helped.&nbsp; I'm still having trouble getting a 2009 disc to start, it just spins and stops over and over, but never actually starts up.&nbsp; I have it set to Auto-Play, but it didn't
 help.&nbsp; Before I bought this software, I had asked the person if it would run on Win10 and they said other people didn't have trouble running it, but I just can't get it to open.&nbsp; What else can I do?&nbsp; Or will no media from 2009 every run?&nbsp; I have an HP Paviallion
 All-in-One PC that is about 4 years old which came with Win7 I believe (or 8.1) which naturally upgraded to Win10.&nbsp; Thank you for any help with this.

            Hi Beckame
<br />
<br />The year is immaterial, what matters is what is on the disk . . .
<br />
<br />Is that a software installation disk?
<br />
<br />If so, browse that disk and fins Setup.exe or Install.exe and double click that to install the software
<br />
<br />Then if you get an error installing the software, please report the error you see . . .       
        </p>

            1. This is more likely to be a hardware issue or CD/DVD issue. Please check your CD/DVDs are not scratched and in good shape. 
<br />
<br />2. Try to clean your CD/DVD with a clean cloth to remove dirt etc. Also clean the lens of the CD/DVD drive.
<br />
<br />3. From Windows side, you should try following -
<br />
<br />A. Use the Hardware &amp; Devices Troubleshooter
<br />Type Troubleshoot in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Scroll down &amp; Click Hardware &amp; Devices &gt; Click Run the Troubleshooter &amp; follow on-screen directions &gt; Restart the computer after troubleshooting is completed
<br />
<br />B. Uninstall &amp; reinstall driver
<br />Windows Key+X (Or right click on Start) &gt; Click Device Manager &gt; View tab &gt; Show Hidden Devices &gt; Expand DVD/CD Drives &gt; Right click on entry below &gt; Uninstall Device &gt; Reboot your computer
<br />
<br />C. Review following Microsoft Help

            The discs are brand new, I cleaned the lens recently.&nbsp; So far, oddly the Level 3 of disc 2 and Level 2 of disc 1 (they're Instant Immersion Language discs) ran fine, just asked me to install QuickTime, which I did.&nbsp; I thought after that the other discs
 would run, but they still won't.&nbsp; I tried the troubleshoot before I wrote, no help there.&nbsp; I guess I'll try the uninstall and reinstall driver. I'm not to savvy to be honest, so I'm a bit hesitant to do that.&nbsp; Thank you so much for this advice.

            I'm sorry, no, they aren't install discs, they're supposed to auto play I believe (which I did change in Hardware and Sound).&nbsp; But they just spin and whir when I put them in the DVD drive.&nbsp; When I right click on that in&nbsp; File Explorer, it freezes and I
 end up having to open Task Manager to close that, it won't stop at all by itself.

            It won't let me right-click, as soon as I put the disc in the drive, it starts spinning, so I go to File Explorer, right click on "DVD RW Drive and it freezes up, keeps working over and over, but won't bring up another window.&nbsp;&nbsp; If it does finally show
 an "open" button or properties, it won't open these either, so I can't get to the Compatibility Tab (I also tried this before I wrote).&nbsp; I'm stuck.

            I did what you suggested, uninstalled and reinstalled the driver and still 4 of the discs won't play.&nbsp; The others thankfully still work, but I'm still baffled, because they're a series, it just doesn't make sense to me.&nbsp; I there anything else I can try
 to get these other discs to run?&nbsp; I'm still waiting on the support from the company, I'll bug them again.&nbsp; Thank you to anyone who can figure this out for me.

<h2>            Windows Update issues after system restore</h2>
                    <p>I was having an issues with windows 10 while on AC the computer becomes very slow and almost unbearable to use. If am viewing a video or listening to a song it becomes all scratchy (I use VLC and WMP). If I unplug the AC the problem stops after a few seconds.
 Anyway I did a system restore trying to solve the issue since it started from about February this year.(I did not solve the issue anyway)</p>
<p>Since then I have been trying to update windows and its not updating. I downloaded the troubleshooting tool and gave me the message on the screenshot. Any ideas.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1bd1d478-9480-4ca9-93e4-2b453dbe4d6b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1bd1d478-9480-4ca9-93e4-2b453dbe4d6b" /></a></p>

            Thanks for the help. It took me some days to reply because I wanted to check if your solution was working on multiple networks(My network has a proxy). Unfortunately I don't think your solution worked. Windows update is stuck at checking for updates while
 the store is shows 3 apps at 0.1 MBs while the rest pending. For the clean boot the computer performs very well in the clean boot. Looking at the apps I stopped it is HP protect tools and the intel graphics of which not have received any updates for the past
 couple of months. Any more help will be appreciated

    <title>Lost my Gamertag. Can I recover it&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shinerbock88  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lost my Gamertag. Can I recover it&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I haven't been able to play my 360 in 8 months due to an injury. I had my Gamertag on a memory card because I wanted it to be portable. I'm about to start 360 gaming again but now I have a problem: I've lost that memory card that holds my Gamertag. I've
 no idea what happened to it. I still have the case for the memory card, but the memory card is not with it. I've moved during my 8 month away from my 360, so it's very possible I lost the card during the move.</p>
<p>Is there any way I can recover my Gamertag? Or do I have to start over again?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would greatly appreciate any help remedying this situation or if someone can direct me to some helpful info then that'd be great too. Thanks.</p>

<p>If you know your windows live id and password to your account you should be able to recover it. NOTE: If you have gotten any achievements offline you will not keep them when you recover your tag.</p>

<p>Yeah...all you should have to do is recover it, but if you have forgotten the Live ID and password, then that will further complicate your situation and will call for the now-infamous "account verification" process.</p>
