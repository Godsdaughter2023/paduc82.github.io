<h2>            Surface Go Kickstand replacement</h2>
                    <p>I left my pretty surface in my bag with sharp stuff wich scratched the surface kickstand pretty bad.</p>
<p>So i thought I could replace that kickstand quickly (just 4 screws) and grab a case, but....</p>
<p>I wasnt able to find any replacement parts for the surface go in the internet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any idea where i could buy that kickstand part?</p>

<h2>            Windows 8 backup failed 0x80070015 Device is not ready</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm using the windows 7 backup utility that is in windows 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did a backup to an usb drive that went Ok, but this drive suddenly stopped working for some reason, so I swopped it for another drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I tried doing a backup it failed with the above message. I reformatted the new drive and rebooted but still I get the above message. The drive shows up Ok in my computer and I have used the backup program that came with my machine and that worked fine.
 File history works Ok as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone advise how I either</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Sort out whatever the problem is, or</li><li>Tell me how I turn off the constant nagging from the action centre telling me the backup has failed?</li></ul>
<p>Thanks</p>
                </div>

            <p><span>Hi Tom,<br />
Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
To fix this issue you can follow these steps:<br />
<b>Method 1:</b> perform check disk<br />
Check disk is a command-line tool that checks volumes on your hard disk drive for problems. The tool then tries to repair any problems that it finds. For example, Chkdsk can repair problems related to bad sectors, lost clusters, cross-linked files, and directory
 errors.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Steps to perform check disk:</span></b><span><br />
a) Press” windows + R” key to open run window<br />
b) In search filed type cmd and select ok, to open command prompt.<br />
c) Type chkdsk C: and hit enter to run Check Disk<br />
d) Once the above command does the check disk, proceed further by typing this command chkdsk /f C: (This command finds and repair errors on drive C)</span></p>
<p><span>(When you use this command, Check Disk performs an analysis of the disk and then repairs any errors it finds, provided that the disk isn’t in use. If the disk is in use,
 Check Disk displays a prompt that asks whether you want to schedule the disk to be checked the next time you restart the system. Click yes to schedule this check.)</span></p>
<p><span>The options for Check Disk are used as follows:
<br />
/F command + Name of the drive you want to check (e.g: /f c) Fixes errors on the disk<br />
/V command + Name of the drive you want to check Displays the full path and name of every file on the disk (FAT16 and FAT32); displays cleanup messages if any (NTFS)<br />
/R command + Name of the drive you want to check Locates bad sectors and recovers readable information
<br />
/X command + Name of the drive you want to check Forces the volume to dismount first if necessary (implies /F)<br />
/I command + Name of the drive you want to check Performs a minimum check of index entries (NTFS only)<br />
/C Skips checking of cycles within the folder structure (NTFS only)<br />
/B command + Name of the drive you want to check Re-evaluates bad clusters on the volume (NTFS only; implies /R)</span></p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b> If you have a third party security program, then I would suggest you to contact the technical support of the Security program and temporarily disable the software.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Antivirus software can help protect the computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you should not disable the antivirus software. If you do have
 to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network during the time the antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 3:</span></b><span> Perform Clean Boot.<br />
To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows 8 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.<span><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></span></span></p>
<p><span>Important: Reset the computer to start as usual.<br />
<b>Note:</b> After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.<br />
a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.<br />
b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.<br />
c) On the ‘General’ tab, click the ‘Normal Startup’ option, and then click ‘OK’.<br />
d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click ‘Restart’.</span></p>

            <p>hi, thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should I just check the C drive for errors or should I also check the drive I'm backing up to&nbsp; (even though I'm able to back ok using a third party package)?

            I have followed all of the step including the clean boot and I still get the error. This just started on the backup scheduled for last night 3/2/13. I have changed external drives and the USB port that they are plugged into. I then tried a network drive
 and it gave the same error including the same device not ready. <br />
<br />
If I do not include a system image it will backup files (with the Let me choose option).
<br />
<br />
It will not backup if I choose "Let Windows choose (recommended)" or if I "Include a system image of drives.." in "Let me choose".<br />
<br />
I can create a system image if I do it by the task on the left called "Create a system image".<br />
<br />
I have search different forums and haven't found a solution yet.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Mike<br />

<div><span><font color="#37414b">I started to use the "Create System Image" of the "Windows 7 File Recovery" on my Windows 8 laptop. But after the screen which flashes the total size that would be required, when I ask
 it to start the process expecting it to prompt me for the 1st DVD, it flashes the message, - "The back-up failed. The system is not ready. (0x80070015) " . I am trying this on an out-of-the-box laptop with pre-installed Windows 8. Also tried it by disabling
 the anti-virus, but to no avail.&nbsp;Then I tried to start the process with a 4.7 GB blank DVD already in place. Then it flashed the message "Insert a blank media bigger than 1 GB". Since I expected it take anywhere between 3-8 DVDs, I kept about 9 DVDs ready.
 I also inserted a USB pen-drive of 16 GB and tried to create the system image. Again it flashed the same message of insert a blank media greater than 1 GB in F:\ (same drive as USB) -??????? &nbsp;This has me totally puzzled and I would be obliged&nbsp;if this can be
 clarified. I am using Windows 8 Single Language. I was able create a repair disc without issues, though.</font></span><br />

<h2>            Monitor Goes to sleep &#38; won&#39;t wake up</h2>
                    So I have a HP m8000e with windows vista on it. My problem is the monitor randomly goes to sleep and won't wake up. I have to unplug the tower to the PC and hold to power button for it to work again.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tried everything I've read on here to fix them problem. I've obviously done the Unplug/hold power button for 30secs option. It only works temporarily. I've updated the monitor driver. It didn't work. I walked away from the computer &amp; bam! The monitor
 was asleep(Keep in mind, I've shut those options off. So the monitor shouldn't even go to sleep). I've even tried going back to default settings and still no good. Now, More recently I restored the computer to its factory settings doing a system restore, Since
 doing that the monitor going to sleep does it MUCH More often. So much that I can't even get passed the Startup screen before the monitor goes to sleep. It tells me no signal and goes to sleep. What do I do from here? PLEASE HELP ME!&nbsp;</div>

<p>Chooose 'High Performance' - then click 'Change plan'</p>
<p>Click the down arrow&nbsp;in each box and select&nbsp; 'Never&nbsp; --</p>

<p>Check your screen saver settings &gt; by&nbsp; right click empty space on desktop choose 'Properties'</p>
<p>select&nbsp; 'screensaver' .--- if you already have a screensaver enabled, untick&nbsp; 'On resume , display logon screen'</p>
<p>Good luck, its worth a try.</p>

            <p>Hello KyleButler'</p>
<p>Your problem could be one of many, including the graphics card etc;&nbsp; or more simply perhaps, the screen resolution has been set too high and the computer just cannot display. If you have no other suggestions try the following.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you Start the laptop ? in&nbsp; 'Safe Mode' ---to do this,&nbsp;Switch&nbsp;on power button and then as soon as the screen lights up -press F8 ( on top row) repeatedly and screen should&nbsp; open in 'safe mode' ---from the options given select &gt;&nbsp;'start Windows Normally&nbsp;'&nbsp;&gt;
 and &nbsp;click enter, and just see what happens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If no joy with that - start over again as before booting into safe mode. Select 'Start' &gt; Control panel&gt; personalize &gt; Scroll down to Display Options and choose a lower resolution on the slider bar - set at 1024-768&nbsp; or 1280-1024 click apply confirm' yes'</p>
<p>Shut down as normal then restart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You could of course, try switching off the Power supply at the plug&nbsp; and remove - disconnect the computer lead-turn laptop over release the battery compartment sliders and remove the battery by sliding it out. Wait about 10 minutes replace battery reconnect
 main plug and power lead..</p>
<p>Check all connections to Router, <strong>be sure it is fully on</strong> - check ethernet lead connections to PC and switch on as usual.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Using &#39;Backup and Restore - Windows 7&#39; on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am stumped and would be most grateful for advice. In order to update to the most recent version of Windows 10, I was forced to reload the operating system on my computer, which I have successfully done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am attempting to restore my user data files from an external drive backup made using 'Backup and Restore Windows 7'. The external drive (F:) is properly installed and I can locate the backup files using File Explorer.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Sucks,  and now the touchpad and click buttons do not work...</h2>
                    <p>after being forced to upgrade to windows 10&nbsp;I am&nbsp;having nothing but trouble.&nbsp;&nbsp; At first it was just performance issues.&nbsp; Presently the mouse button are dead.&nbsp; I tried a Windows 10 reinstall/reset 3 times, the latest Synaptic drivers, default drivers, nothing
 works,&nbsp; support sucks, I GIVE UP!!!.&nbsp; </p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Neal,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We apologize for the inconvenience caused and will assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To narrow down the issue, I would like to ask some questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the model&nbsp;number of your computer?</p>
<p>What is the system specifications?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform that once the system is upgraded to Windows 10, a backup folder "<strong>Windows.old</strong>" will be created so that&nbsp;you can go back to the previous Operating System within 30 days from the date of upgrade. If you have crossed the
 30 days time limit, the backup folder will be deleted automatically.&nbsp;Then will have to download the&nbsp;ISO for the previous Operating System and perform a Clean Install. If you have not exceeded the 30 days grace period, then follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span> Start by opening Settings – Click
<strong>Start</strong> &gt; <strong>Settings</strong> or type Settings in the search bar and click it or press
<strong>Windows key + I.</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span> Click <strong>Update and Security.</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 3</strong>: Click <strong>Recovery </strong>then click
<strong>Get started</strong> under&nbsp;Go back to Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 (depending on the previous version you running). Here you can make multiple selections why are going back to your previous version of Windows along with additional details or you can choose
 just one and click Next. The process can take a while depending on the amount data, applications and settings.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Step 4:</span></strong><span> Click<strong> Next</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Step 5:</span></strong><span> Click <strong>Go Back</strong> to begin the process.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Windows 10 will Restart</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>When the process is complete, you will be booted into your previous version of Windows environment.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>NOTE:</span></strong><span> Please be aware the <strong>
windows.old</strong> folder located at the root of the local disk where Windows 10 is installed will be deleted after 30 days automatically. The
<strong>windows.old</strong> folder is used to facilitate the rollback. So please perform any rollback within 30 days or this option will no longer be available. Otherwise, create a backup before upgrading to Windows 10.</span></span></span>

    <title>Block Google Chrome for Child - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> msquaredonline  say:</h3>
<h2>            Block Google Chrome for Child</h2>
                    <p>I have 5 kids to setup content restrictions for. Though I love that Microsoft gives the power to have the safety features it does, the process is RIDICULOUS if you are doing it for more than 1 child!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I attempted to setup my 3 younger kids to only have access to a couple of specific websites, but no other sites. During that process I removed Google Chrome from the blocked apps list. What I did not know was that I had to use Microsoft Edge (one of the
 worst browsers ever) to use the feature that only allows certain sites. So now Google Chrome is no longer a blocked app, but yet the site has no way to just add it back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked up how to block an app and was SHOCKED by the official info from Microsoft. See Below. Basically your kid has to use an app before you can add it to the blocked list. Doesn't that defy the purpose of having safety features for a child?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides... I used my child's account and opened Chrome, yet it still DID NOT show up in their activity list in order to block it. NOW WHAT?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>FROM MICROSOFT</strong></p>
<p>Blocking specific apps is possible with the Microsoft Account's Family Safety Feature. To block a specific application on your child's account, it is a requirement that the app must be used by your child, so that it will appear in under the Recent Activity
 list. For your child's security, you can log in as the child and launch the app to satisfy this requirement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow these steps to successfully block specific applications:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Visit the&nbsp;<span><a href="https://account.microsoft.com/family/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Family website</a></span>&nbsp;and then sign in your Microsoft Account.</li><li>Click the account of the child that you want to block from using an app.</li><li>Select<span>&nbsp;Recent Activity</span>.</li><li>Click to ensure that&nbsp;<span>Activity Reporting</span>&nbsp;is turned on.</li><li>Scroll down and look for<span>&nbsp;Apps &amp; Games</span>.</li><li>Choose the apps that you want to block on your child's account.</li><li>Click&nbsp;<span>Block&nbsp;</span>to block usage of the app.</li></ol>

<h2>            Windows 10 is not allowing me to sign in and access my PC as the Administrator</h2>
                    I have a secured password lock to enter my computer. Whenever I would enter my password in the past, my computer would unlock and give me complete control as the PC's Administrator. However, when I type the password now, it takes about 3 to 5 minutes for
 a message to finally come up saying that it is having trouble recognizing my password and that I only have access as a Temporary User rather than the Administrator and that I should try to sign out which usually fixes the problem. When I click "Sign Out" it
 closes down, reboots and prompts me to sign back in using my password. When I try to sign back in using my password it happens again and only gives me access as a Temporary User rather than the Administrator. How can I fix this? I tried going to the Start
 Menu and typing in CDM + CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER to pull up the Command Prompt and then typing: net user administrator /active:yes&nbsp; which did not work. I also tried:&nbsp;net user administrator /active:no&nbsp; which also did not work

If the Admin prompt has a greyed out or missing Yes button but no password entry box, use the Built-In Admin account in Safe mode to create two new Admin accounts - Wiki</a> so that you can get into your computer if there is any recurrence.&nbsp; User account corruption

    <title>Skype has stopped regonizing my USB camera - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Skype has stopped regonizing my USB camera</h2>
                    I use a Logitech camera by USB as my laptop camera is poor quality. I have been using this for years with out any problem, however now when I switch on Skype it does not let me use the camera from the USB. I used to have an option to use either camera
 but not anymore. Skype recognizes the USB device as it lets me select it as a microphone but not as a camera. I have tried to change this in the video/camera section but the USB device is not listed. Any help would be much appreciated. Thank you

<p>Hey everyone,</p>
<p>I was wondering if there was any sort of banner you guys offered that would show off our achievement points? I saw someone on my forum have one for PS3 that shows his rank and trophy's and whatever, and was wondering if XBOX offers something similar to be
 used on forums, websites, etc.</p>

<p>Banners come from non affiliated sites such as Raptr. Unfortunately it is not a service offered by MSFT or Sony. Your best bet would be to look up the net for further information regarding these said banners.</p>

<h3> emmetth  say:</h3>
<h2>            Computer keeps getting hacked and they prevent the owner&#39;s use</h2>
                    <p>I would like to know how to close the back doors in Windows 10 so hackers cannot take control of the network and prevent the user/owner from using their own computers upgraded to Windows 10. A friend has lost 5 high end gaming systems because the punks in
 his apartment complex have gone into his apartment and stolen his password sheets each time he creates new ones. The setup a hidden share for them to use to hack into and use his network and on weekends he never was able to use his own system. The last one
 to be burned by too many people using it at the same time, had a 2Tb drive and 16 GB of on board Ram. He also had a 10/100/1gb card in the system with 5 fans keeping it cool. The manager was always in his apartment when he was gone and got caught a few times
 playing with the computer and writing down all the IP addresses and other necessary addresses to use it remotely.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;After he lost his most expensive PC because they overclocked it and burned out the CPU while he was sleeping. These people get on his system and remotely turn it on when he is or isn't there and he can't find the hidden files to shut them down. Changed
 mother boards twice and the network cards were also changed for different ones but they could still get in! How do they take over his system?</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have gone through and removed stuff he didn't install and have unhidden all the files I could to see which were needed and which were not Windows files. Also, I have looked for Keystroke monitors loaded in his system. Most recently he asked CenturyLink
 to monitor his Modem and when someone other than he is on it, he asked that they ping that person continously until they log off or until he can get their IP address. That might have worked but they refused. They gave him a passcode to use when he was on the
 PC and it worked great but somehow even with him carrying that in his pocket and not leaving it anywhere on the PC they still got the code. How can that happen? What do they teach in computer support classes that would allow these guys to destroy all your
 files so they can game instead of you being able to?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;This friend had 25 years of Rock and Roll saved on his computer and they destroyed and emptied his files. I would be mad if that was my collection. Anything you can tell me would be appreciated. Right now, he is using a Lenovo Laptop that was given to him
 to replace the system he had but they did not give him back his 2Tb drive that still worked. The gentleman is not a computer genius and does what he can. He is sarting to give up. What will work so only he can use his PC?</p>

<h2>            Can I sign out from Microsoft Mail App</h2>
                    <p><em><strong>Original Title: </strong></em>Microsoft Mail App</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a question about the Mail application, is there a way of logging off the app without having to remove/log out of the whole account? Reason being is, this is a family computer and and would like to keep my emails private, but would like to stay in
 due to being able to save everything to OneDrive, which is really handy when I'm ever out and about.</p>

<p>Hey there, xSlapMaThigh</p>
<p>The Xbox live Policy and Enforcement team review every complaint that is submitted to them through the file complaint feature on every Xbox profile, which means for them to take action, you must have done something that violated the Xbox Live Code of Conduct.
</p>
<p>There is nothing we can do on these forums, apart from pointing you in the direction of a Case Review. This option is available to players who have had an enforcement action against them (Which is longer then 24 hours), and would like the Enforcement team
 to review&nbsp;the case again. To submit a case review, you will need to head over to the Enforcement teams website at:
<a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://enforcement.xbox.com/home</a>
</p>
<p>You will need to sign into the account that has been banned from Xbox Live, and then you should see an option on your left hand side saying "Apply for a case Review". Please fill out the required information and click submit. You should allow the Xbox Live
 enforcement team time to review the case, and the case notes the previous enforcement agent had made, before taking enforcement action against your account.
</p>
<p>The Xbox Live enforcement team also send you an email notification to the Microsoft Account you have linked to the suspended Xbox Live gamertag. Please make sure you check your junk folders and inbox for that message.
</p>
<p>There is no other way to contact the enforcement team, and they do not look through these forums no more. Their old forums have been retired, and they only use them to post announcements.
</p>
<p>I hope this helps, and best of luck. <br />
Regards, </p>

<p>Hi Joey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is one of the most advanced and secure operating systems, but as with any piece of software, sometimes you'll come across concerns, in particular, blue screen errors.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, you can often narrow down the blue screen to a problem with an update for Windows or a bad driver, incompatible software, or hardware you recently configured. We'll walk you through a number of troubleshooting steps to fix a blue screen error to
 get you up and running. Simply follow the steps provided on the article below:<br />
<br />

Feel free to contact us if you need any further information.<br />

<p>Thank you for your response. The bugcheck 0x00000124 is typically related to physical hardware concerns. It can be heat related, defective hardware, memory or even a processor that is beginning to fail or has failed. If over-clocking has been enabled, try
 disabling it. Confirm that any cooling systems such as fans are functional. Run system diagnostics to confirm that the system memory is not defective. It is less likely, but possible that a driver is causing the hardware to fail with this bug check.<br />
<br />
For additional general bug check troubleshooting information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/blue-screen-data" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Battery drains ALOT when in sleep mode - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Battery drains ALOT when in sleep mode</h2>
                    <p>I use my Surface Pro a lot and in the last two weeks I've noticed the battery drains by a lot even when I put it in to sleep mode. For example, I went to bed with my computer at about 56% battery and when I woke up 8 hours later the computer was at about
 ~6%. Similarly, I had my Surface Pro charged at 100%, then I didn't use it for about 24hrs and the battery was completely dead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've looked around and I see that theres something called connected standby that might be the issue. How do I go about getting my Surface Pro to how it was prior? It's really frustrating. Also, my surface pro is completely updated to my knowledge.</p>
<p>

            Hi, there were no changes prior to this issue arising. I just used it normally then suddenly this happens. I've tried everything you've mentioned including the updates, battery settings, plans, etc. but still no changes. It may be getting worse. I kept
 my surface pro charging over night so it was 100%. I unplugged it at around 8am and at 12:30pm it had dropped down to 62%. I'll send a battery report but is there anything else I could do?

                    <p>&lt;Original title: User Permissions&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was toying with the user permissions (right click, properties, security) on the system 32 file folder to give myself ownership of the files instead of trustedinstaller so i could delete certain files. I kind of went overboard with it and gave myself access
 (full contol, disabled inheritance, and clicked on "replace all child object permission entries with inheritable permission entries from this object") to stuff that SYSTEM had permission to and to stuff that administator (my computer name) had permission to.
 I also cancelled an operation by accident and i couldn't undo it and had to keep going. After i did all this, all the names of everyone that had permissions disappeared except for mine (my user name, email, and password for my microsoft account). I shut the
 laptop down, and now i &nbsp;can't boot into windows because automatic repair starts automatically and i get stuck into a bootloop when i choose to "continue to windows 10". &nbsp;I can't reinstall win 10 either

            <p>This is why you don't mess with your system32 file like that. I'm afraid a re-installation is in order, I hope you still have the product key. You could try striking the F8 key and entering safe mode, and then restoring to a backup, but your systems seems
 a bit unhappy, so that may not happen.</p>

            Thanks re install has been a success and it's not that you can't mess with the system 32 folder it's just that i only wanted to take ownership of the files from trustedinstaller but afterward i went over board and set permissions for SYSTEM over to me
 that was the problem i wasn't thinking when i did that cuz obviously my user folder doesn't have the necessary files to execute those actions

<h2>            No sound from speakers - only headphones work</h2>
                    
<p>The speakers definitly work as i can hear the boot-up Windows rift.&nbsp; Once booted I can only get sound from headphoones.&nbsp; Been this way for about 4 months.&nbsp; Was OK with it but my kids wanted to watch a movie together and I can't do that with 1 headphone.&nbsp;
 I very computer literate.&nbsp; I tried all the basics like reinstall of drivers and checking all speaker settings. Called ASUS and the tech rep stated I'd have to do a system restore back to original, spanking new machine.&nbsp; Don't want to do that.&nbsp; What's the deal
 Microsoft?&nbsp;</p>
<p>using an ASUS laptop f50</p>
<p>Realtek drivers - All uninstalled then re-installed</p>
<p>Ran the Microsift fix-it tool for sound problems.&nbsp; It detected no issues.</p>
<p>Running Vista home premium SP2.&nbsp; All up to date on patches etc.&nbsp; I run Mcafee - no viruses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well - I ended up doing a system restrore 3x times - the last time with a Microsoft technicians help as the dang thing kept crashing.&nbsp; I did not install all the ASUS audio&nbsp;updates or Mcafee.&nbsp; Now I have sound from both headphones and speakers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will not be continuing on with mcafee on my other machines once license expires.&nbsp; Just been having too many issues.</p>
