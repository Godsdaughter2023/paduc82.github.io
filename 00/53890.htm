</p><p>Yes, that is correct, any subscriptions you purchase will not reflect in the Skype app, you can only view it in the Skype website. The only balance you can view in the Skype app is the Skype credit.</p>

<h2>            Redeem code for warthog for forza horizon 3</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been in contact with the support team through live chat and they have asked me to post on this forum as deleted messages can not be recovered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had a message from xbox live last week that had a redeem code in to get the warthog from halo on forza horizon 3. A few days ago i deleted all my messages in my xbox inbox and that also included the one from xbox live. I have not redeemed the code for
 the warthog because last week when i tried it didnt redeem so i was going to wait till the 27th september 2016 on release of the game. Is there any chance of getting the code back please. i would appreicate it very much.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time.</p>
<p>Kind Regards</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Do you have duplicate songs in Windows Explorer or Windows Media Player?</span></p>
<p><span>If the duplicate songs in Windows Explorer it can only be manual selection and deletion, if you duplicate songs in Windows Media player. I would suggest you
 to follow the steps mentioned below:</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>If only a small number of duplicate entries exist, try the following:
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the Windows "<b>Start</b>" button and select "<b>Programs</b>." Click "<b>Windows Media Player</b>" to launch the media player.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the "<b>Library</b>" tab. You should see a list of the media files uploaded to the Windows Media Player library. Scroll through and locate the duplicate files in the library.
 Duplicate files share the same name and generally are listed next to each other.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right-click the duplicate files that you want to remove and click "Delete." Repeat the steps to delete all the duplicate files from your Windows Media library.</span></p>
<p><span>For you reference remove items from the Windows Media Player Library:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Remove-items-from-the-Windows-Media-Player-Library" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Remove-items-from-the-Windows-Media-Player-Library</span></a></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>If you have a large number of duplicate entries in your library (or if your entire library is duplicated), it might be best to create a new library.</span></p>
<p><span>To resolve this problem, clear the Windows Media Player database. To do this, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Exit Windows Media Player.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click <b>
Start</b>, click Run, type <b>%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Media Player</b>, and then click OK.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select all the files in the folder, and then click Delete on the File menu.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><b><span>Note</span></b><span>: You do not have to delete the folders that are in this folder.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Restart Windows Media Player.</span></p>
<b><span>Note:
</span></b><span>Windows Media Player automatically rebuilds the database.</span>

    <title>Windows 7 Home Premium came pre-installed on my Samsung RC520. How do - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jwebb58  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Home Premium came pre-installed on my Samsung RC520. How do I do a HDD repartition and, if necessary, a &#34;Fresh Start&#34; RE-INSTALLATION of my Windows Operating System&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When my (640GB HDD)&nbsp;Laptop was first started the person who claimed to know it all put 247 GB in the&nbsp;C drive partition and 369.32 GB in D drive (which just sits there). There is an unnamed&nbsp;22.66 GB Healthy (Recovery Partition) and 100MB in a System Partition
 plus an&nbsp;F Drive&nbsp;75 MB CDFS Healthy (Primary Partition) for my Mobile Broadband.</p>
<p>Because I have noted people often encounter problems,&nbsp;when they re-partition their Hard Drives, I was hoping to find out how I can increase my C Drive by 100-150 GB and reduce my D drive by the same amount without any drama.</p>
<p>However, if I do have some problems and need to re-install Windows&nbsp;7 from scratch I need to know that this can be done&nbsp;on&nbsp;a PC with a&nbsp;pre-installed Operating System&nbsp;using only a System Restore CD and the 25 digit W7OS&nbsp;Key to help guide me.</p>
<p>I believe if the above questions can be answered, comprehensively and accurately, it will assist me and&nbsp;many other Windows 7 users.</p>

            If you want to re-allocate disk space to C:\ drive, you can do so now without having to reinstall Windows 7.
<br />
<br />
Click Start, right click Computer<br />
Click Manage<br />
Expand Disk Management<br />
<br />
Select the d:\ Partition<br />
Right click it, click 'Format'<br />
You will receive a Warning dialog, click OK to continue.<br />
<br />
The next step is to select your file system option, in this case, go with the default which is NTFS.<br />
The formatting process will now begin.<br />
Once complete, the drive will be displayed as a ‘Logical Drive’ in Disk Management.<br />
<br />
Right click the ‘Logical Drive’ in Disk Management, on the contextual menu, click the ‘Delete Volume’ option. Click ‘Yes’ when the warning dialog appears.<br />
The Volume you deleted will now appear as ‘Free space’, you will also notice that the disk icon no longer appears in the list of volumes.<br />
Right click the Free space partition, and click Delete, click Yes on the Disk Management warning that appears.<br />
<br />
<br />
The volume will now appear as Unallocated. Our next step is to merge back that unallocated free space with the system partition which is C:\ drive. Right click the System volume and click the ‘Extend Volume’ option on the contextual menu, click ‘Yes’ when the
 warning appears.<br />
<br />
A wizard will now begin that will guide through the steps to merge back the unallocated space with your system partition.<br />
<br />
The wizard provides a simple procedure to merge back the unallocated space with the system drive. Once you have selected the space, click Next, at the end of the wizard, you will see the amount allocated.<br />
<br />
----------------------<br />
<br />
You should have a total of about 616 GBs of disk space. <br />
You could use the shrink feature in Disk Management to reduce the size of the Recovery Partition, but its possible that some of it is being used for reinstalling applications. I personally would leave it as it is. But if you want to shrink it, right click the
 Recovery Partition, click Shrink, choose how much you want to shrink it to. It will create unallocated disk space so you can use the same method mentioned earlier to re-allocate to C:\ drive.
<br />
<br />
----------------------<br />
<br />
Reinstalling Windows 7 on your Samsung. Your Samsung includes a recovery partition which you should use to reinstall Windows 7 if you need to. The recovery process also gives you the option to create a set of recovery discs if needed:<br />
<br />
New computers that come preinstalled with Windows 7 often have what is called a recovery partition. This is used to reinstall the operating system in the event of a system crash. To access it, you will need to boot into when you start your computer by pressing
 a function key. This can be either F1, F2, F9, F10, F11, F12 or even DEL or Tab key. Consult the owners manual that came with your PC for instructions about how to reinstall Windows.<br />
<br />
<br />
- HP uses F9 on most of its systems<br />
<br />
- Fujitsu uses F12 on most of its systems<br />
<br />
- Acer uses F12 on most of its systems, but you often need to go into the BIOS to enable it<br />
<br />
- Dell uses F12<br />
<br />
In general, look at the screen during POST for a hint about what is possible.<br />
<br />
<br />
If your recovery partition is not available or damaged, you should contact the manufacturer of your computer and request a recovery disc set you can use to reinstall Windows 7. They might charge a small shipping and handling fee.<br />

<p>You can check if the port is being listened to by typing the command<strong>&nbsp; netstat -ao |find /I "listening"</strong> in a command window. Check the ports listed in the column appended to the IP address for 32400.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi,<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The information given in the earlier post was on how to share the internet connection using your modem through the laptop. To connect the laptop and the PS2 simultaneously to the
 modem you would need a router/switch. Once you connect both the PS2 and the laptop to the router/switch, it would automatically assign the dynamic IP address to both the machines.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may follow the link given below and follow the steps on how to ‘Connect and extender to a wired network’ and ‘Connect and extender to a wireless network’</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may follow the steps given below and check if that helps you to connect your PS2 to the internet through your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Step 1</span></p>
<p><span>Connect the PS2. Plug one end of a Cat-5 cable into your PS2 modem, and the other end into your Windows laptop.</span></p>
<p><span>Step 2</span></p>
<p><span>Click on "Manage Connections" in the Network and Sharing Center.</span></p>
<p><span>Step 3</span></p>
<p><span>Right-click on your wireless connection and choose "Properties." You may need administrative privileges to access these options.</span></p>
<p><span>Step 4</span></p>
<p><span>Click the "Sharing" tab, and check the box marked "Share this connection." Most systems only allow you to share one connection, and you may need to deselect this box for your other
 connections or disable other connections before this tab will appear.</span></p>
<p><span>Step 5</span></p>
<p><span>In the "Networking" tab, choose "Internet Protocol Version 4" and click the "Properties" button. Note the IP and DNS settings for your connection.</span></p>
<p><span>Step 6</span></p>
<p><span>Turn on your PS2. Use your modem's disc or an in-game menu to access the system's network properties. Change the IP and DNS configuration to match your laptop.</span></p>

<h2>            Minecraft for Windows 10 &#40;beta&#41; won&#39;t load</h2>
                    I tried to open Minecraft last night but it wouldn't open. I would click on it and it would go to the Mojang screen, then to the screen that says MINECRAFT, but the little loading thing with the bars underneath it will go up to the same point every time
 and then crash. I am still having that problem and am starting to panic because pretty soon I will no longer have a WiFi connection at all so I will end up dying of boredom since I will not be able to play Minecraft and I won't be able to fix it even if it
 is fixed. I have tried restarting my computer, unplugging it and plugging it back it, going into a different profile, resetting the app through Settings, uninstalled it several times, and removed all of my mods. There are no updates at all, whether I go online,
 the Xbox app, Microsoft Store. I've even cancelled playing with beta and then started playing with beta again. Xbox Insider Hub says nothing. NOTHING WORKS! I have looked everywhere and asked all of my friends if they are having the same problem but so far
 it is only me. NO suggestions are working. I know it is not my computer because there have been no changes to it at all since it was working. Even still I freed up space by deleting pictures, games I haven't played, and even some of my ts4 CC, which a big
 sacrifice on my part. Please help, and sorry for the long rant.&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/03670991-1fa2-4d8a-802a-cfca8907f205?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/03670991-1fa2-4d8a-802a-cfca8907f205?upload=true" /></a>

                    <p>I have recently upgraded to Windows 10 - so far so good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Until I connected my external hard drive. It is not recognised properly (cannot access it in any way) and in place of the correct device (Western Digital Elements 2TB USB2.0 - WDBAAU0020HBK-01) I get 'Initio Default Controller'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps taken:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have tried the usual restart first - no effect.</p>
<p>Have tried to remove Initio Default Controller and driver through the Device Manager before restarting again - no effect.</p>
<p>Have tried the power settings fix that worked for 8.1 (apparently) - removing the fast start option - no effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is an important drive so a solution would be greatly appreciated ASAP.</p>

&nbsp;Hi there, </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
I'm sorry to hear you are experiencing such issue with your WD drive. </p>
<p>
Have you tested if the drive would work on a different PC? Another thing that you can do to assure the HDD is in good health is to download and run WD DLG

<h2>            Blue Screen &#58; Plug and Play detected an error most likely caused by a faulty driver&#63;</h2>
                    Getting a Blue Screen of Death: Plug and Play detected an error most likely caused by a faulty driver?
<br />
<br />
I'm running on Windows Vista-Home Basic. I don't know what happened but this morning when I turned on my Dell Inspiron 1420 Laptop, the blue screen of death appeared saying that "Plug and Play detected an error most likely caused by a faulty driver". It also
 instructed me to "Disable BIOS memory options such as caching or shadowing" but I don't know how to do that since it doesn't show on my BIOS settings. Also, the message suggests that I go on to Safe Mode but every time I try to go on Safe Mode, the Blue Screen
 of Death just keeps re-appearing, so I can't go on to Safe Mode either. And another weird thing is that when I press F8 (the key to press for advance startup options) I get to select an operating system to start: Microsoft Windows XP Embedded which is weird
 because like I said, my OS is Windows Vista and I don't have any other OS installed in my laptop. How can I solve this problem??

<p>Use these methods along with the above and below messages to troubleshoot BlueScreens.<br />
<br />
Look in the Event Viewer to see if anything is reported about those.<br />
<a href="http://www.computerperformance.co.uk/vista/vista_event_viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.computerperformance.co.uk/vista/vista_event_viewer.htm</span></a><br />

Also do this so you can see the likely bluescreens.<br />

Windows Vista automatically restarts if your PC encounters an error that causes it to crash.<br />

<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen<br />
info that would help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other<br />
error information such as STOP codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />
<br />
As examples :<br />
<br />
BCCode: 116<br />
BCP1: 87BC9510<br />
BCP2: 8C013D80<br />
BCP3: 00000000<br />
BCP4: 00000002</p>
<p>or in this format :</p>
<p>Stop: 0x00000000 (oxoooooooo oxoooooooo oxooooooooo oxoooooooo)<br />
tcpip.sys - Address 0x00000000 base at 0x000000000 DateStamp 0x000000000<br />

<br />
Many BlueScreens are caused by old or corrupted drivers, especially video drivers however<br />
there are other causes.<br />
<br />
You can do these in Safe Mode if needed or from Command Prompt from Vista DVD or Recovery<br />

The log might give you the answer if there was a corrupted driver. (Does not tell all the possible<br />
driver issues).<br />
<br />
Also run CheckDisk so we can rule out corruption as much as possible.<br />

<br />
Often updating drivers will help, usually Video, Sound, Network Card&nbsp; (NIC), WiFi, 3rd party<br />
keyboard and mouse, as well as other major device drivers.<br />

<p>Hi,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part 3 of 3</p>
<p>Use this message along with the two above to troubleshoot BlueScreens.</p>
<p>Very often driver, BIOS, other control software updates and Memory tests are required so here<br />
are methods to perform those if the above troubleshooting methods suggests them. Not all BSOD's<br />
require these methods though they are fairly common.</p>
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For<br />
each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description,<br />
version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your<br />
video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this<br />
may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT<br />
this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their<br />
own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device Maker's site<br />
(Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software<br />
updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This<br />
is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a<br />
driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows Updates,<br />
this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be older and cause<br />
issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then go look for new ones<br />
manually if you wish.<br />

<p>Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show<br />
a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.<br />

    <title>Windows 7 keeps freezing during&#47;after login - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ryahya  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 keeps freezing during&#47;after login</h2>
                    <p>So for the past two weeks, my computer (a Dell Inspiron laptop with Windows 7) has been having this problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whenever I try to start up Windows, the computer freezes up. Most of the time, I'll be able to login first, and the desktop and taskbar will appear normal, but I won't be able to open any programs. The mouse cursor will have a "loading" circle next to it
 that won't go away,&nbsp;the start menu won't come up, and the taskbar will be completely unresponsive. When I move the cursor down to the taskbar, the arrow usually turns into a "loading" circle. Pressing Ctrl+Alt+Del during this time does nothing. The only thing
 I can do is turn the computer off by&nbsp;holding down the power button.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes I won't be able to login at all. The desktop will appear as a blank screen, either dark blue or black in color. Sometimes the mouse cursor is sometimes visible and responsive enough to be moved around the screen, sometimes it's not there or completely
 unresponsive. Either way, there's absolutely nothing I can do when the computer is in this state.&nbsp; Sometimes the desktop won't load at all, and I'll be stuck looking at the blue "Welcome" screen until I turn the computer off. Sometimes I can't even get that,
 as the computer will freeze as soon as I click my user icon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These problems occur when I log on to the Guest account too. Sometimes they occur when I try to boot the&nbsp;computer in Safe Mode, but sometimes (usually after a lot of frustrating failed attempts) I'll be able to log on to Safe Mode normally. (Right now I'm
 using Safe Mode with Networking.) When I try to log on to the Guest account in Safe Mode, it always either freezes up before logging in or displays a message saying that there's "an error with Sens service" or something like that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While in Safe Mode, I've tried going into System Configuration and turning off some of the Startup programs. That usually gets the computer working again for&nbsp;a little while, but after a few days the problems start up again. I've also tried doing a System
 Restore three times, but each time the Restore&nbsp;failed to occur because of some error (can't remember exactly what). The computer would start working again after the attempt, but once again, the problems would just start up again in a few days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What's causing this problem, and what can I do to solve it for good?</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>It could be a particularly strong virus or malware. I'd run my antivirus software from&nbsp;Safe Mode&nbsp;on a deep, boot level scan. If you don't have an antivirus, I use and recommend Avast Free Edition:&nbsp;
<a href="http://download.cnet.com/Avast-Free-Antivirus/3000-2239_4-10019223.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://download.cnet.com/Avast-Free-Antivirus/3000-2239_4-10019223.html</a>&nbsp; (use the&nbsp;Direct Download Link only).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other than your antivirus and also run from Safe Mode, the following malware scanners:</p>
<p>Malwarebytes':&nbsp;<a href="http://download.cnet.com/Malwarebytes-Anti-Malware/3000-8022_4-10804572.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.cnet.com/Malwarebytes-Anti-Malware/3000-8022_4-10804572.html</a> ;&nbsp; and,</p>
<p>SuperAntiSpyware:&nbsp;<a href="http://download.cnet.com/SuperAntiSpyware-Free-Edition/3000-8022_4-10523889.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.cnet.com/SuperAntiSpyware-Free-Edition/3000-8022_4-10523889.html</a> .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again,&nbsp;use the Direct Download Link only. Let me know if this fixes the issue for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

    <title>Xbox Live Constant Packet Loss Issues - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox Live Constant Packet Loss Issues</h2>
                    
<p>Hello all,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm new to this forum so please forgive me if I am out of line, or in the wrong section. As of about 10 days ago, I have been having packet loss issues leading to rubber-banding and lag. It is sporadic but it heavily distracts me from what I'm playing. I've
 tested out playing multiple different online games (BF4, COD, Halo, Overwatch) and I have the same problem across the board.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In terms of troubleshooting. I have reset my modem, and xbox. I have checked my detailed network statistics (67mbps download, 11mbps upload, 65 ping, and 0% packet loss). I have made sure my NAT is open and I even port forwarded my router to see if that
 would help. All of these solutions have not worked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I come here to see if anyone else has had this problem. I can sign into xbox live just fine, and join parties without any issues. The weird part for me is that I can play PC games without a hitch at all. So I am wondering if this is an issue with just my
 xbox or not.&nbsp;</p>

[/quote]</p>
<p>When you were port forwarding did you reserve an IP address for your Xbox?&nbsp; Reason I ask this is usually the Xbox IP will change when switching from wireless to wired.&nbsp; Example: 192.168.0.16 could be your Xbox IP when wireless, then could be 192.168.0.28
 when wired.&nbsp; So the port forwarding you did would have no effect on the wired connection.&nbsp; This occurs on my wireless modem so this is why I'm asking.&nbsp; The Ethernet cable had no signs of damage on the cord or anything did it?</p>

<p>The NAT was never an issue but I port forwarded just in case. Ethernet cable is in great condition so no worries there. I didn't have an issue with the IP address when wired or wireless.

<p>Here are some things to try. &nbsp;Perform a hard reset on your console EXACTLY like this. &nbsp;Hold the power button on the console for 10 seconds or until the power shuts down completely. &nbsp;Unplug the power cord from the back of the console for 5 minutes. &nbsp;Plug
 the power cord back in and restart the console. &nbsp; While the console is unplugged go ahead and unplug your network devices (modem/router) for 2 or 3 minutes too. &nbsp; Since you are port forwarding you should also reserve the IP address of you console so that it
 will always get the same IP when restarting. &nbsp;Once everything is up and operational test to see if this has helped. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know. &nbsp;Good Luck!</p>

            Hi, I know this is an old thread, but recently I've started having the same type of problem which seems to have started around when the servers went down for a couple of hours(used to be on wireless, then problems started, switched to wired and everything
 was fine for about 2 days with 0% packet loss, followed by a constant loss of upto 48%). Hard reset, manual network setup, switching between wired and and wireless all yield the same result, namely an hour or so of multiplayer gaming, followed by big packet
 loss, lag and game crashes. Downloading updates and games still work fine though. Games I experienced it in are pubg and smite. If anyone has help to offer, it would be much appreciated
        </p>

<h2>            AMD HD 7610m Graphics driver problem&#63;</h2>
                    Hi - Can someone please help. On trying to upgrade to Win 8.1, it has continuously failed when updating the drivers.&nbsp;The error message is something like Service Exception Handles/Threads .........&nbsp; and the problem file identified.<strong> atikmdag.sys</strong>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;The following Error Code <strong>0xC1900101 - 0x30018</strong>. I have contacted Microsoft support a number of times, but they have not been&nbsp;a great help. I then progressed to find that the AMD drivers were not of the most recent version. I then proceeded
 to update with my system crashing and the same file being identified. I am now at a loss of what to do and need some help to identify what this problem is. I do find it rather concerning that technical support can not localise a problem within&nbsp;a system and
 easily identify a solution.

            <p>Hi Dave,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Download and install the AMD Mobility Radeon Driver Verification tool as well as the Latest Beta Driver based on whether the system is 32 bit or 64 bit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To find out whether the system is 32 or 64 bit follow the steps provided below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Right-click or tap and hold the lower left corner of the screen, and then click or tap
<b>System</b> in the menu.</li><li>
<div>Find <b>System Type</b> in the System window, and then note whether your operating system is 32-bit or 64-bit.</div>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Example of a 64-bit Operating System type in the System window</strong></p>
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fh10025.www1.hp.com%2fewfrf-JAVA%2fDoc%2fimages%2f895%2fc03524716.gif" /></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong><u>Here are the links for the download:</u></strong></div>
<div><strong>For 64 bit Operating system:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p><a href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/download/mobile?os=Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/en-us/download/mobile?os=Windows</a> 8 - 64</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the <strong>operating system is 32 bit</strong> then you can download the drivers from the link :</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/download/mobile?os=Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/en-us/download/mobile?os=Windows</a> 8 - 32</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you download and install the drivers try to update the Windows 8 system to Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more information on updating the system to Windows 8.1 from Windows 8 check the link provided below.</p>

                    In launching one of my programs I get I tried to right click the file and change it to dot old (CSCDLL.old) but then I got the message YOU NEED PERMISSION FROM THE TRUSTINSTALLER. I went through the procedure to modify my permissions but it was fogged
 out so I couldn't make the change. What do I do now?

<p><span>Hi richswears,</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to add ‘Everyone’ to the permission list and give full permission to that particular file and check if it helps you fix the issue.
</span></p>
<p><span>To do this, follow the steps below:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Right click on the user folder you wish to open and copy files from.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Click on properties.</span></li><li><span>Click on “Security” tab.</span></li><li><span>Click on Edit button.</span></li><li><span>Click on Add, type “Everyone” (without quotes) in the Objects name box and click on Ok.</span></li><li><span>Under permission for system select Full control for every one and click on OK</span></li><li><span>Click on “Advanced” button at the bottom.</span></li><li><span>In Advanced Security Dialog window, click on “Owner” tab.</span></li><li><span>Here you will be able to see current owner (i.e. TrustedInstaller).</span></li><li><span>To take ownership of the object, click on the Edit button. Then highlight the user name in the “Change owner to” box that you want to assign as
 the owner for the object. Click “OK” to finish the process.</span></li><li><span>Back in Advanced Security Settings window, you will see the current owner has changed to the user you just selected.</span></li><li><span>Click “OK” button to exit this window.</span></li><li><span>Click “OK” again to exit completely from the Properties window.</span></li><li><span>Open the object’s Properties window again.</span></li><li><span>Back in object’s Properties window, click on Edit button.</span></li><li><span>Highlight the Administrators in the “Group or user names” box. If the user ID or group that you want to manage the permissions for the object doesn’t
 exist, click on “Add” button, and type in the user name or group name desired into the “Enter object names to select use Everyone as user Name box, and finish off by clicking on “OK”.</span></li><li><span>In the Permissions for Administrators box below (or any other user name or group name you chose), click on “Full Control” under the “Allow” column
 to assign full access rights control permissions to Administrators group.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>After granting the folders permission to everyone for the
 user folder, check if you can access the folder and copy the files. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: If you grant permission to everyone,
 the file or folder would be accessable by everyone who uses the computer. Once you complete copying the files to your computer, you may remove everyone from the permission list.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Hope this helps. Let us know the results.</span></p>

    <title>Best adhesive for reinforcing Surface Pro 3 keyboard - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Best adhesive for reinforcing Surface Pro 3 keyboard</h2>
                    <p>Where I work we recently purchased several Surface Pro 3 tablets and the keyboards that go with them are pathetic. &nbsp;I need something to reinforce them structurally to deal with the flexing problem. &nbsp;I'm a fast typist and I can feel the keyboard flexing and
 deforming under my hands as I'm typing. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone recommend an adhesive that will stick to the finish on the keyboard so I can glue a piece of plywood to the thing to reinforce it? &nbsp;It's not usable in its current state. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Failing that, does anyone know if Microsoft ever plans to offer a higher quality keyboard to replace this pathetic piece of garbage they're shipping now?&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Thanks for stopping by the Microsoft Surface community forum. Sorry to hear about the issue you're having with your accessories. Rest assured we'll try and help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You've mentioned at the beginning of your post that your&nbsp;employer recently made the purchases and not long after you're noticing issues with&nbsp;the type cover.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead of trying to glue the device, my best suggestion is that you reach&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/businesshttp://" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">business support here
</a>for assistance perhaps with getting it replaced.&nbsp;</p>
