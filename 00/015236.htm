<p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>don't know if this will help, but if you're having trouble with your covers, you can always install a 3rd partty freeware software to your computer, to edit all tracks' details including cover</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use mp3tag for instance</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this was of use</p>

    <title>Office apps take up to 30 sec to open - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Office apps take up to 30 sec to open</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Office 365 ProPlus (Click to Run) on the current channel - all updates applied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have noticed over the past couple of weeks that the office apps take up to 30 seconds to load (typically about 15 seconds). For the first 10 seconds or so there is no splash screen but in task manager the app is open and using about 30 % CPU.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked in event viewer and there are no errors, the only thing I can find related to the program is that it does a licence check - entries from Security-SPP saying it has completed a licence check, then another event saying the Software Protection
 service has stopped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>Repairing office</li><li>Uninstalling and reinstalling (including using the manual Click to Run uninstaller from the Microsoft website</li></ul>
<p>Any help would be appreciated as I am considering asking to have my computer reimaged (it is on a domain)</p>

<p>Correct, I do not know of any way of blocking MS's corporate paranoia for license checking.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try to find the ip it is using and block it. 2 things are going to happen. Either it will immediately go into limited function mode, or you may have up to a 30 day "grace period". At the end of the grace period you would have to let the check complete.

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Based on your description, the issue disappear when you open Office on Safe Mode.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The issue may be related to add-ins.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I suggest you try disabling all add-ins to check if the issue disappears.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 open multiple shared calendars at startup</h2>
                    <p>We have configured Outlook 2016 to open the calendar at startup. Is it possible to open multiple shared calendars automatically when we<br />
start Outlook. When we open a shared calendars and restart Outlook it still only shows my own calendar. It doesn't seem to remember this settings.</p>
<p><br />
Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Hi Stephen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had the same problem and I found the way around it was to create a new calendar group and add the required extra calendars to that group.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So in Calendar view, right-click on My Calendars in the left-hand column and select New Calendar Group. I called my group Default Calendars.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then right-click on the new group, Add Calendar and select the appropriate option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any calendars in this group that were ticked (visible) when Outlook closed would be visible when it opened again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However - there's always a gotcha - for some reason ticking the same calendar in My Calendars now appears to remember this selection - I'm sure it didn't before otherwise I wouldn't have had to create my new Default Calendars group. Ah well, as long as it
 works one way or the other...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate this reply is quite a few weeks after your question, hopefully you have found the solution already but maybe my post will help others in the future.</p>

<p>The letter I received was sent to an end user, not to the address of record.&nbsp; That email account is only a few months old.&nbsp; Our last Microsoft purchase pre-dates that account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why would I need to click a link to see a clarification of my service agreement?&nbsp; The heading is "Your Services Agreement made clearer".&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of the links go to https://go.microsoft.com, with a link number.&nbsp; That seems legitimate but then again, why is all of this necessary?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is mention of the address where this was sent or how to opt out of mailings.&nbsp; That makes it even more suspicious.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I knew what to look for I would log into the Microsoft site.&nbsp; Finding ones way around there can be a bit frustrating and when I have no idea what I am looking for.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            Hola, ante todo pido disculpas pero mi inglés no es bueno, debo escribir en español. Recién recibí el mismo correo al que se hace referencia. También me resultó sospechoso. Busqué en internet y encontré varios grupos o chats donde se habla del tema, y
 ya aparece el texto de ese correo desde el año 2014. Mi sentido común me dice que si a mucha gente le ha resultado extraño, o poco seguro, habría que prestarle la debida atención. Si uno acepta los términos y condiciones cuando suscribe cualquier producto
 de Microsoft, por qué habría que hacer algo más. Además, me llama la atención porque todas las comunicaciones que recibo de Microsoft son en español. Y esta viene en inglés. No me arriesgaría a entrar en los enlaces que figuran en el correo recibido.&nbsp;

<p>I also received this email and, regardless of the previous replies, there is definitely something fishy about it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, I didn't receive it until yesterday afternoon (Sunday, March 25, 2018 at 2:55 pm).&nbsp; If it was legit, why wouldn't I have received it on March 14, or at least around that time?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, the email was delivered to my junk mailbox (which was strange but I didn't think much about it at the time) and I clicked that it wasn't junk and sent it to my inbox.&nbsp; I have had the same email address for about 15 years and have been very diligent
 about what I allow in my inbox.&nbsp; I go through my junk mail several times a day and report every bit of spam that I get.&nbsp; By doing that, I use my junk mailbox kind of like a temporary place for email that I do want to see, but that is not important enough to
 put in my inbox or save somewhere else.&nbsp; Only email from the most important senders are allowed to go directly to my inbox, and absolutely NO junk mail has made it's way into my inbox for many years.&nbsp; However, since this email was received and I directed it
 to my inbox, several pieces of spam have been sent to directly to my inbox, and that is what roused my suspicions and made me take a closer look at this email.&nbsp; According to the message source info, it appears that this message was received from a Microsoft
 IP address, and it says that it is designated "as a permitted sender".&nbsp; Presumably, that is because I clicked that it was not junk and sent it to my inbox.&nbsp; Having already reported all of the others that had been sent to my inbox, I went to my deleted mail
 and checked the message source on those as well.&nbsp; Every one had the same designation "as a permitted sender", even though other info in the message source data indicated that the original source was anonymous, etc.&nbsp; I find it very odd that one email that should
 have gone to my inbox was sent to junk and, immediately after clicking that it was safe, I suddenly started getting spam in my inbox that was also designated as safe.<br />
</p>
<p>And third, upon looking back at the message itself, I realized that some of the graphics in this email look strange.&nbsp; For example, the text in the blue boxes with links to the Privacy Statement, Services Agreement and FAQ is blurry.&nbsp; Hovering over the links
 seems to indicate that the links are legitimate, but I can't be sure of that and I'm certainly not going to click on any of them to find out.&nbsp; The bottom line is that, even if this particular email is legitimate, there are too many other factors that indicate
 some kind of connection between this email and all the spam that is suddenly being sent to my inbox.&nbsp; At this point, I'm seriously considering reporting it and deleting Microsoft from my allowed senders.</p>

<p>I have a signed BAA with a Microsoft Partner who provides a number of services to us, including Office365. I read that Microsoft offers a signed BAA for HIPAA compliance for the Office 365 product. How do I get a signed BAA directly from Microsoft? Or, do

<p>If you bought Office 365 services from a Microsoft Partner, then you will not be able to get a signed BAA directly from Microsoft and you don't need another one since you have one from the Microsoft Partner.</p>

 down to what your security needs may be and level of skill setting up &nbsp;a firewall. &nbsp;Sorry no links as that would violate the CoC. &nbsp;But a simple search in your browser will help you in finding right software for you.</p>

            <p>It didn't use to act as an antivirus, this is true. &nbsp;Version 4 has integrated Bitdefender (which is an actual antivirus). &nbsp;I did not include a link because I didn't want to advert for them. &nbsp;Just works for me. &nbsp;That's what I want to get across, everyone
 should find what works best for them, even if that turns out to be Defender. &nbsp;There is no one size fits all protective software, including Defender. &nbsp;I never intended to ignite the passions of those who don't like any specific publisher. &nbsp;I think you'll find
 that any given software has a plethora of dissenters for any number of reasons. &nbsp;That includes the OS we are testing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hello rshoulla</span><span>,</span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Thank you for visiting the Microsoft Windows Vista Community site.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I think you actually intended Privacy :</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
IE8 and Privacy</p>
<p>As others have written here before, users should be in control of their information. That’s at the core of privacy. Privacy has two aspects: disclosure and choice. Disclosure means informing
 users in plain language about the data collected about them and how it’s used. Choice means putting users in control of their data and giving them tools to protect it.</p>
<p>Have you ever wanted to take your web browsing “off the record”? Perhaps you’re using someone else’s computer and you don’t want them to know which sites you visited. Maybe you need to buy
 a gift for a loved one without ruining the surprise. Maybe you’re at an Internet kiosk and don’t want the next person using it to know at which website you bank.</p>
<p>What if you want to delete your browsing history after the fact, but you don’t want to lose your preferences at websites that you use frequently?</p>
<p>When we began planning IE8, we took a hard look at our customers’ concerns about privacy on the web. As evidenced by some of the comments on this blog during the IE7 days, many users are concerned
 about so-called “over-the-shoulder privacy”, or the ability to control what their spouses, friends, kids, and co-workers might see.</p>
<p>What about your privacy as you browse the web? As Dean outlined is his post earlier today, there is so-called “3rd-party” content on websites, some of which can gather data about how you browse
 the web. How do you know what that is, or how to control it?</p>
<p>With respect to privacy, IE8 gives users more choice about controlling what information they keep and exchange. In the first part of this post I’ll describe two Internet Explorer 8 features
 that help you control your history, cookies, and other information that Internet Explorer stores on your behalf. In the latter part, I’ll describe two more features that can help you control how your browsing history is shared by websites. By default, IE8
 browses the web the same way IE7 does.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold">InPrivate™ Browsing</span><span> lets you control whether
 or not IE saves your browsing history, cookies, and other data </span></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold">Delete Browsing History</span><span> helps you control your
 browsing history after you’ve visited websites. </span></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold">InPrivate™ Blocking</span><span> informs you about content
 that is in a position to observe your browsing history, and allows you to block it
</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold">InPrivate Subscriptions</span><span> allow you to augment
 the capability of InPrivate Blocking by subscribing to lists of websites to block or allow.
</span></li></ul>
<p>
InPrivate Browsing</p>
<p>If you are using a shared PC, a borrowed laptop from a friend, or a public PC, sometimes you don’t want other people to know where you’ve been on the web. Internet Explorer 8’s InPrivate Browsing
 makes that “over the shoulder” privacy easy by not storing history, cookies, temporary Internet files, or other data.</p>
<p>Using InPrivate Browsing is as easy as launching a new InPrivate Browsing window. When you’re done, just close the window and IE will take care of the rest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While InPrivate Browsing is active, the following takes place:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>New cookies are not stored
</span>
<ul>
<li><span>All new cookies become “session” cookies
</span></li><li><span>Existing cookies can still be read
</span></li><li><span>The new DOM storage feature behaves the same way
</span></li></ul>
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li><span>New history entries will not be recorded
</span></li><li><span>New temporary Internet files will be deleted after the Private Browsing window is closed
</span></li><li><span>Form data is not stored
</span></li><li><span>Passwords are not stored
</span></li><li><span>Addresses typed into the address bar are not stored
</span></li><li><span>Queries entered into the search box are not stored
</span></li><li><span>Visited links will not be stored
</span></li></ul>
<p>
Delete Browsing History</p>
<p>In Internet Explorer 7, we added a feature called Delete Browsing History that lets you delete in one click all of the information that IE saves. This is a necessary tool that is a standard
 feature in all modern web browsers. If there are things in your web browsing past that you want to erase, you can do that easily.</p>
<p>The problem is that usually you don’t want to delete everything! Cookies, in particular, are really useful for storing preferences on websites that you use frequently. Many sites have a “remember
 me” option, which stores a cookie on your PC and identifies your user account. Other sites, particularly financial websites, will store a cookie on each computer that you use to eliminate extra challenge questions (i.e. “What was your high school mascot?”).</p>
<p>IE8 solves this problem by adding an option that lets you keep cookies and temporary Internet files from websites saved in your Favorites list:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To avoid having your favorite sites “forget you”, simply add them to your Favorites, and make sure the “Preserve Favorites website data” checkbox is selected. IE will preserve any cookies
 or cache files that were created by websites in your favorites.</p>
<p>Oh – and by the way – we heard your feedback about checkboxes! Now Delete Browsing History will remember your preferences. We also added a “Delete Browsing History on Exit” feature if you
 really want to keep your history squeaky-clean! To do so, click Tools-&gt;Internet Options:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In his post earlier today, Dean outlined some of the privacy issues surrounding third-party content, which powers some of the rich experiences you get on the web today, such as interactive
 maps and social networking shortcuts (“add to Digg”).</p>
<p>Some third-party content is
 a profile of which websites you go to, what links you click on, etc. It’s hard to know exactly how your data will be used and with whom it will be shared without reading and understanding the privacy policy of each third-party site providing content to the
 website you visit,.</p>
<p>Consider this hypothetical example. You walk into a shopping mall. In the middle of the shopping mall, there is someone in front of a kiosk who asks you if he can record what stores you visit
 while you’re there as part of a survey. In order to do so, he writes down a description of what you look like – not your name – but what you’re wearing, your height, etc. In several of the stores throughout the mall, there are people who identify you based
 on this data, and record whether or not you visit a particular store. When the mall closes, the surveyors in the store report their tallies back to the kiosk. What the surveyor ends up with is a list of some of the stores you visit while you’re at the mall.</p>
<p>This is analogous to how some third-party content works on the web today. Again, without reading specific privacy policies, it’s hard to say in general what third-parties do with the data
 (or whether or not they record it at all).</p>
<p>The first difference between this mall example and the real world is that the mall survey is hypothetical. Again, different third-party sites do different things with the data they can collect,
 and the best way to understand what they actually do is reading their privacy policy. The other major difference between this example and the web is how explicitly users are presented with a choice about sharing their information. Clearly there are benefits
 to sharing your information, starting with richer experiences. Many web sites rely on third-parties to provide content and services like interactive maps and financial data, or analytics and advertising in order to operate effectively. These third-party services
 often collect information in order to do their jobs. There are also potential drawbacks, such as privacy risks (who has what information?) and increased exposure to malicious content. Put simply, the web relies on a trade, or value exchange, between users
 and sites. Information goes back and forth: in exchange for “free” services and content, users “pay” with information, not money. There is nothing wrong with such a trade, as long as users are informed and are in control of the choice.</p>
<p>
<span>InPrivate Blocking</span></p>
<p>InPrivate Blocking is a feature designed to help give you information about third-party content that has a line of sight into your web browsing, and gives you a choice about what information
 you share with these sites. As Dean mentioned in his post, it’s possible for sites to track users without cookies. The only way to ensure that your data is not disclosed is to block content and prevent communication to sites.</p>
<p>While you browse the web, your IE keeps a local record of which third-party items your browser accesses, and where they were accessed from.InPrivate Blocking keeps a record of third-party
 items like the one above as you browse. When you choose to browse with InPrivate, IE automatically blocks sites that have “seen” you across more than ten sites.</p>
<p>You can also manually choose items to block or allow, or obtain information about the third-party content directly from the site by clicking the “More information from this website” link.
 Note that Internet Explorer will only record data for InPrivate Blocking when you are in “regular” browsing mode, as no browsing history is retained while browsing InPrivate. An easy way to think of it is that your normal browsing determines which items to
 block when you browse InPrivate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
InPrivate Subscriptions</p>
<p>Users can augment the capability of InPrivate Blocking with InPrivate Subscriptions. Some users want to protect their privacy, but don’t want to make granular decisions about content to block
 or allow. Users can delegate these decisions to publishers of InPrivate Subscriptions. Users can subscribe to a list the same way they add an Accelerator, Web Slice, or search provider to IE: by clicking a link on a web page and confirming that they want this
 functionality:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under the covers, InPrivate Subscriptions are simply RSS feeds of Regular Expressions that specify sub-downloads to block or allow. Anyone can publish an InPrivate Subscription on their website,
 just as they can offer an Accelerator or Web Slice on their website. We’ll post details about the file format as part of the updated IE8 Developer’s Guide with Beta 2.</p>
<p>
Conclusion</p>
<p>IE8 helps put you in control of your data, both on your PC and on the Web. IE8 Beta 2 is coming soon, and I encourage you to download it and give us feedback.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Let us know if these steps resolve your problem.&nbsp; I hope the information is useful.</p>

            Hi 
<br />
<br />Outside of these warnings though, did the applications run normally or got errors when using Word or Excel? 
<br />
<br />Part of the issue too is, Microsoft is optimizing Office 365 more for Windows 10. It appears that subscription model might not be jiving well with a nearly 10 year old operating system. 
<br />
<br />That said, the perpetual suite is probably the best for your configuration or consider upgrading to Windows 10.

            Are you using a regular windows user account (that has some admin rights) or the limited account?  
<br />
<br />As an FYI, if you choose to go with a perpetual suite, do not get Office 2019 - it is limited to Windows 10.  (This requirement will eventually make it into the subscription - at that time it will stop updating on older OSs - best guess is 1 -2 years in the future.)

<br />
<br />I am trying to help you, but if you mark my replies as unhelpful, it makes it even more difficult to do so. Others will also be less willing to help you with your problem too. 
<br />
<br />I also asked an important question, are the applications working normally?

<br />Event Viewer will always show errors that the operating system will resolve itself.

<p>Diane - This is on my Win 7 Pro 64-bit machine, and I don't think there is a difference between "a regular windows user account (that has some admin rights) or the limited account".&nbsp; Anyway, I am the only "User Account" on that machine, and my user has full

            Hi,
<br />It occurs for a different Office version registers. What does it means? You have installed a 32 bit version before, then you installed a 64 bits version. 
<br />You should remove manually some registers, but Office could not response well. Sometimes you have to reinstall your application.
<br />Go to :
<br />Start&gt;Run and typing "regedit"
<br />UNder: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\
<br />"-9.0 is Office 2000 
<br />-10.0 is Office XP 
<br />-11.0 is Office 2003 
<br />-12.0 is Office 2007 
<br />-14.0 is Office 2010"
<br />You should remove the files associated.
<br />
<br />Sincerely       
        </p>

<p>lionsot - at your suggested registry key and its subkeys, there are references to ONLY 15 and 16, not earlier.&nbsp; Almost all the references are to 16, with only a few at 15.</p>

<br />This would be the regular user account.

<br />&gt;&gt;  FYI - my wife is the principal owner-user of the O365 Home
<br />This would not have an affect. 
<br />
<br />Have you used to "Easy fix" utility to remove office and then reinstall it? That should remove all office registry keys, all office files and if the issues is due to issues upgrading from 32 to 64bit office, should fix the problem. 
<br />
<br />the utility will delete all office folders, including outlook data files in %localappdata%\Microsoft\outlook (but not files in your documents). If you have an imap account with calendar and contacts in 'this computer only' folders export them to a CSV first.

<p>Sometimes trouble shooting in Windows / Office requires the brute force approach, uninstall and re-install.&nbsp; So I will second Diane's suggestion to do a "full" uninstall using the "Easy Fix" tool in Option 2 of the uninstall link that she provided.&nbsp; This
 is supposed to delete all registry entries and files associated with Office. But in this case, follow up running the script by checking for those 7 registry entries specifically and any other registry entries referring to Office. If they are still there, delete
 (ie export them first!) them.&nbsp; Restart the computer and re-install Office. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Andre was just trying to give you a heads up on an upcoming potential problem in the no longer so distant future (holy cow, it's already 2019!). In 2020 MS will end support for Windows 7!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS can be ham handed at times, so I could see them doing what Andre suggested, adding code to all of a sudden not allow you to run or install Office 365 on anything other than Windows 10. &nbsp; As he pointed out they have already done that with Office 2019 one-time
 payment. They would do it without warning.&nbsp; All of a sudden Office 365 would stop working on Windows 7.&nbsp; Sure, they are supposed to test before releasing updates, but we have all see examples of gross oversights in that testing process. The October 2018 Windows
 Update that they had to call back TWICE to re-release after fixing gross problems.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>For example, they did something like that when 365/2016 was initially released. They added code to automatically uninstall all older versions of Office, without any warning to the user (some of like to have multiple versions because we provide to support
 to users still using older versions). At the same time the "improvement" prevented "consumers" (365 Home owners) from installing Visio and Project on their computers because MS considered those 2 programs a "business class".&nbsp; It was a dumb move that took them
 a year to fix! </p>

<p>Diane - yes, I've tried that "Easy Fix" a number of times!&nbsp; It downloads a file called o15-ctrremove.diagcab.&nbsp; Not only have I run that before, but I've even gone into its code and changed some of its "Force" lines from "false" to "true".</p>
<p>
</p><p>No luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On only one occasion, I deleted the seven registry keys, but that caused problems, so I restored to a restore point.</p>
<p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
We understand that you'd like to set the Report Message add-in to use <strong>Always send a copy of the message to Microsoft</strong> as the default option, and disable the other options.<br />
<br />
We'd like to inform you that if you're email account is connected to an <strong>Exchange Server</strong>, this settings may have been locked by the administrator. If you want to make any changes in the settings, you may need to contact the
<strong>Exchange administrator</strong>.<br />
<br />
Kindly post back if you have further concerns.

<h2>            OneNote App not installing to Apple Watch</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;Hi guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've recently installed OneNote on IOS 12.03, running Apple Watch 4. It's Feb 6, 2019. No matter what I do, OneNote is not showing up on my watch as an app, and it's not in the list of installed Watch Apps either. I've reinstalled and even enabled Experimental
 Features in the iphone IOS settings. I've restarted the watch, made sure I'm on WiFi. Going crazy, my business partner and I are trying to move away from Evernote. What could the issue be? Anyone else run into this?</p>
<p>

<p>I actually solved this! I had several apps that for some reason hadn't sync'd from the iphone. The solution was a reboot of the phone, and they showed up in the Watch app available for installation to the Watch.</p>
<p>

    <title>Incoming Skype Calls Going Imediately To Voice Mail - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Incoming Skype Calls Going Imediately To Voice Mail</h2>
                    <p>(First of all, I'm <strong>VERY</strong> unhappy that the<strong> ONLY</strong> "support" option I can access is this forum... I am not being given an option to do an on-line chat or even to send an email...but that's another discussion.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have my Skype setting for inbound calls for my Skype numbers set to 20 seconds, but since yesterday, the calls have been going immediately to voice mail, giving me no opportunity to answer the calls. Is this some kind of a current system-wide problem that
 will be fixed without my doing anything, or is there something I need to do on my end, or something in my account that a Skype technition needs to take a look at?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<h3> sbjones71  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2016 saving documents as .doc</h2>
                    &nbsp;One of my colleagues is experiencing an issue saving in the correct format in Word 2016.&nbsp; Her Word saving option is set to default to saving as .docx and our Normal template and all other startup templates are all .dotm or .dotx&nbsp;format.&nbsp; However, if she
 launches a new blank document by opening Word, when she saves the document, it is defaulting to save as .doc format.&nbsp; This only appears to be happening for her.

            Please try these options one by one and check after each option. 
<br />
<br />1. Try repairing your office installation (Quick repair is good enough). Try repairing your Office installation. First try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start your application in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. 
<br />
<br />To start in Safe Mode -
<br />
<br />Hold CTRL key and click on application icon and don't release the CTRL key till it asks you for Safe mode confirmation.
<br />
<br />If yes, then start application normally and disable add-ins one by one and start application again every time you disable an add-in to determine the culprit add-in.
<br />To disable add-in &gt; File &gt; Options &gt; Add-ins &gt; Down below you have Manage: Com Add-in : Press Go &gt; Untick the Add-ins to disable and tick to enable them
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help. If above didn't work, I will supply more troubleshooting steps to solve this problem.

            Hello SBJones71. Let's try an easy solution to see if that fixes the Word issue. It sounds like you already verified File &gt; Options &gt; Save is set to .docx. 
<br />We have a couple other options. I would try this first. 
<br />
<br />1.	Exit Word.
<br />2.	Copy and Paste this w/o the quotes “%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates”
<br />3.	Press Win+R to open Run.
<br />4.	Paste and press ENTER
<br />5.	Right-click and Rename Normal.dotm (possible Normal-old.dotm as the name)
<br />6.	Restart MS Word
<br />
<br />I'm hoping resetting the Normal template in MS Word fixes the issue. The next step would be to repair Office it if doesn't. One screenshot attached.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d8c7a27a-97e0-48a9-8ab5-652a04e1ae7e?upload=true" />

<p>Are you sure that File&gt;Options&gt;Save, the setting from the "Save files in this format:" dropdown, is set to Word Document (*.docx).</p>
<p>

            Yes, I'm sure it is set to .docx.&nbsp; It's the first thing I checked.&nbsp; I will have her start Word in safe mode and see what happens.

<p>Should also have said, Doug, it does display in compatibility mode when she creates a new blank document, but that seems to be because our Normal template is a Word 2010 template and not a Word 2016 template.&nbsp; My new blank docs are also showing in compatibility
 mode, however my documents are saving as expected, as .docx format, whilst her documents are saving as .doc format.</p>

            Let's check to see if an Add-In is causing the issue. Close Word. Hold down CTRL and start Word. Don't let go of CTRL until you see the screenshot attached (#1). Start a new doc. Type one letter. Save As and see if Word has the correct format. If yes, that means an Add-in is causing the issue. 
<br />
<br />If no, close Word, and go to Control Panel &gt; Programs &gt; Uninstall. Click MS Office and click Change. Don't worry we are NOT uninstalling MS Office. Try a quick repair first (screenshot 2)<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1d49475c-d1a9-435b-b5b7-bad187f1a161?upload=true" />

<h2>            Outlook app for Android not accepting One-time password&#47;app specific password</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently purchased 'Galaxy Note 4' (Android 4.4.4) and installed Outlook app from Google play store. Installation went fine. I created an app specific password for my Outlook app, as I am using two factor authentication for my<strong> live.in
</strong>email account. After creating the app password, I tried to login my email account via Outlook app which I have installed on my Galaxy note 4. But unfortunately, I am unable to login my account. I tried many times, but all in vain. Then I uninstalled
 the app and re-installed it once again, but nothing happened. I was unable to login my account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After many attempts, I used the original password which I am using to login my account on browsers and found that I am able to login via outlook app using my original password. Outlook app asked me to enter my two factor authentication code and then everything
 went smooth and I was able to see and send emails. </p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT my question is: WHY I am unable to use app specific password for Outlook app (from Microsoft)? I DO NOT want to use the original password for privacy and security reasons. SO can you please let me know why WE CANNOT use app specific password for Outlook
 app. What is the use of App specific password when we cannot use it on mobile. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to let you know, I am able to use APP specific password for Mail applications (from Windows Store) installed on my Windows 8.1 but cannot able to use it on my Android 4.4.4.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Look forward to hearing from MS guys, soon. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            onenote 2016 screen clippings not appearing in onenote</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I take a screen clip, it no longer automatically opens OneNote to place the clip in a new page as it used to. &nbsp;I've tried reinstalling Office, changing the options of where to send the clipping, and toggling the OneNote icon off and on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas? &nbsp;I love this feature and depend on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

            <p>FIXED IT - UPDATE:</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I did to restore the WIN+Shift+S OneNote functionality - with automatic dropping of the screen clip into OneNote, was this, plus a reboot:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">First need to disable the WIN+S search shortcut that Windows 10 defaults to. To do so, go to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced and either edit "DisabledHotkeys"
 or, if it does not already exist, create a new&nbsp;</span><strong>string value</strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;named "DisabledHotkeys" and set it to "S."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This fixed it. &nbsp;Had to disable the Windows hotkey first, then assign that hotkey to OneNote.</p>

                    <p>The previous fix of clearing the value of PREFERREDMETADATAPROVIDER in Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\MediaPlayer\TunerConfig is not working time. There was a recent update to Windows that broke several of my customizations

<h2>            Full scan took over 10 hours&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>The time taken for MSE to complete a full scan is&nbsp;far too&nbsp;long! Mine's been running constantly&nbsp;for 10hrs 27mins - and it still hasn't finished! That is ridiculous! None of my previous Internet Security Suites took anywhere near that length of time to do
 a full scan. Okay so they were not free! But I can buy a full legal copy Macafee or Kaspersky for about £16. And as a Virgin Media customer,&nbsp;I&nbsp;can&nbsp;get&nbsp;their PC Guard free. The only reason I don't like PC Guard is because it iinstalls so many different "bits"
 and it&nbsp;hogs system resources too much.</p>
<p>MSE is great apart from the time it takes to do a full scan.&nbsp;So come on you guys, please&nbsp;please PLEASE shorten the&nbsp;scan times on&nbsp;MSE!</p>

<p><span>Of course you can very easily turn off “deep scanning” (Scan archive files) in the “Advanced” settings, in order to shave some time off of the scan. Also, specifically excluding (by
 “location” or “type”) any large collections of media or other types of files can have a noticeable impact on the duration of the scan. Cleaning up with the Disk Cleanup Wizard, especially the System Restore Cleanup (in the “More Options” tab) also helps.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To clarify the situation with regard to CPU throttling, the “Scan-now” scans in the main interface already run at full tilt, so there’s no way to accelerate them, other than by excluding
 or deleting files, as mentioned above. It’s only the scheduled scan that’s throttled, and you can get around that by setting up your own&nbsp;scan task in Task Scheduler; which will cut the scan time for the scheduled scan about in half. A scan task that you set
 up yourself also has the advantage of not interacting with the main interface (like the MP Scheduled Scan does), which makes it easier to use the “Wake the computer to run this task” setting for your scan.</span></p>

            The big deal is that I didn't want to have to leave my computer on for 10 or 11 hours at a time, just because MSE took that long to do a full scan! So after my last clean re-install of Windows 7, I&nbsp;decided to give Norton Internet Security 2010 a try instead&nbsp;&nbsp;and
 thankfully, I have&nbsp;experienced no problems whatsoever with that. In fact,&nbsp;Norton has improved dramatically since&nbsp;I last tried it&nbsp;ten years ago and no longer hogs system resources or takes over your entire PC, as it used to. It incorporates an excellent password
 manager now too, so I am very&nbsp;glad that I decided to&nbsp;give it another try and that I&nbsp;no longer have to wait 10 hours for a full scan to complete.

<h2>            Ignore directories...</h2>
                    I was just wondering if the feature to choose directories for MyPhone to ignore was going to be added to the application.&nbsp; I know that this was requested and discussed previously, with many users showing support for this feature.&nbsp; I'm finding a lot of
 stuff in my MyPhone account that I would never have wanted to back up, so the ability to mark directories as ignored by MyPhone would be a REALLY nice feature.<br />

I Wonder this too, but in my case, marking folders as read only would mess up my IE six and Marketplace installs, as that crud is what MyPhone is archiving in my case. Would really like to be able to specify to MyPhone where my photos are held on my device.

            Hi there -<br />
<br />
Marking individual files as 'Read Only' will prevent those files from being backed up.&nbsp; Marking a folder as 'Read Only', but not its contents, will still upload the contents to the My Phone portal.<br />
<br />
Sorry for this inconvenience.&nbsp; I'm forwarding this idea to the product team for further investigation.&nbsp; ("Users want to mark folders as "Read Only" as a method for not synchronizing any content in that folder to the My Phone portal.")<br />
<br />
