<li>−1.064,40 probably doesn't comply with your regional settings so remove the . (dot) after 1</li><li>More importantly the first character isn't a minus sign (-) but a&nbsp;<strong>− </strong>
that probably results from a copy/paste from another application</li></ol>
<p>So:</p>
<ol>
<li>Clear the content of E16</li><li>Keep E16 selected</li><li>Copy this <strong>-1064,4</strong></li><li>Paste it into the formula bar</li><li>Validate</li></ol>

<p>
</p><p>Anyway, interesting thought. I started with that idea. But when I tried retyping&nbsp;what appeared to be "-" with my own "-", nothing changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I realized: the numbers (in my view of them) also appear to have an extraneous comma, to wit: −1.064,40 in E16, −1.064,40 in G16, −1.161,78 in G20, and −212,32 in G26.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Changing period to comma and comma to period (e.g. -1,064.40)&nbsp;__and__ retyping the "-" converted the values to numeric.</p>
<p>
</p><p>@Maria: For future reference, use formulas of the form =ISTEXT(E16) to determine that type of the cell value is text, not numeric. Note that the format of the cell (Number) does not determine the type of the cell value.</p>

</p><p>I think I know what happened. Because of the Unicode "-", the data type was text, notwithstanding the cell format (Number). When I retyped the "-",&nbsp;the data&nbsp;type remained text because the data entry was now -1.064,40, which is not recognized as a number
 in __my__ region.</p>

    <title>N95 8GB Broke Down - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> intel__  say:</h3>
<h2>            N95 8GB Broke Down</h2>
                    I got my N95 8GB in January.It was working fine till June.One day I made a call and then put my phone back on my pocket. After a while I realised that the phones' screen was black and the phone was not working.I supposed that the battery was over, so i
 tried to charge it.But even when i plugged the phone in the charger it didn't respond at all. I was forced to get the phone to a Nokia Store where they told me it was going to be fixed in approximately 2 weeks. They didn't call me at all. Instead i called
 them and learnt that my phone was sent to Finland! It had a really serious issue. So they told me they are replacing it with a brand new one which i am still waiting....Does anybody have an idea about what caused this problem? Also should i have any worries
 about the new one i am getting soon? Is it a common issue of N95 8GB or just my phones' malfunction?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks, Argiris

            The phone must have got bent and LCD panel must have cracked up. That is why you got a black screen<br />

            It doesn't sound like a cracked LCD. If it was, they would have repaired if for you without having to send it to finland and also done a lot quicker.<br />
<br />
Sounds more like a coincidence.<br />
<br />
I and many of my friends have N95 8gb's and love them! With anything electrical and mass produced, you will get the odd glitch here and there, just a shame it's worried you. If they replace it for you, I am sure you won't have any other drastic problems!

            Nope it was not a Screen problem beacuse also the keypad had no light and the Nokia Salesman told me he could find the problem that's why it was sent to Finland. But overall i was very happy with my phone till this thing happened!

<h2>            Rsap compatibility</h2>
                    I have recently got a VW Passat with a built-in Bluetooth car kit (I think it's supplied by Nokia). It requires a phone that is rsap compatible (remote sim access profile) which my Sony Ericcsson's K800i and K810i aren't. Is there a list of Nokia phones
 that are definitely rsap compatible?? Thanks in advance . . . Brownie

            I know that the N95 is. I suspect many S60 handsets are.

            Thanks very much for your swift response. Looks like it may be a N95 then when it's contrct-renewal time!!!!!!

            If you can, go for the N95 8GB (aka N95-2), or better still the N96 if it's available when your contract is up for renewal. I can't see any online documnentation to confirm that the N96 does RSAP (I'd be surprised if it didn't) but can confirm that the
 N95-2 does.<br />

<p>Hi There,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a Passat CC with (i guess) the 510 Premium Bluethooth Phone Kit included. In order to get things working i had to sell my Toshiba Windows mobile phone because it was not working at all. Instead I bought a Nokia E71 and it works like a charm. No problem
 what so ever. I really can recommend the E71, because apart from the VW compatibility, it has a lot of other nice featuers and a very long battery life.</p>

<p>Does the new E72 also supports rSAP?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am thinking of buying that phone and I want it to be compatible with a possible future VW</p>

<br />
SAP is listed in the supported bluetooth profiles, and "Remote SIM mode" is listed in the bluetooth options, so yes.<br />
<br />
I think all S60v3 FP1 and FP2, and S60v5 phones support it.

<h2>            Time Range Formulas</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I am currently trying to identify times an event has occurred into time ranges such as 7:00AM - 8:00AM for analysis of data in a Pivot Table, but am having trouble finding the appropriate formula. I have tried nested IF statements (64+ in Excel 2010)
 as well as including VLOOKUPs and table_array with no luck. Can someone please tell me which, if any of the following formulas are close or need adjustment for what I am after?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Current Data:</p>
<p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td style="text-align: center">A</td>
<td style="text-align: center">B</td>
<td style="text-align: center">C</td>
<td style="text-align: center">D</td>
<td style="text-align: center">E</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center">1</td>
<td style="text-align: center"><strong>Day</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: center"><strong>Date</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: center"><strong>Time</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: center"><strong>Date</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: center"><strong>Time Range</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td style="text-align: center">=TEXT(D2,"ddd")</td>
<td style="text-align: center">=TEXT(D2,"dd/mm/yy")</td>
<td style="text-align: center">=TEXT(D2,"hh:mm")</td>
<td style="text-align: center">Original Data</td>
<td style="text-align: center">Desired Answer</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center">2</td>
<td>Sun</td>
<td>01/06/14</td>
<td>10:03</td>
<td>01/06/14 10:03 AM</td>
<td>10:00 AM - 11:00 AM</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I am using Text formulas to break down the original data (sourced from an auto date&nbsp;webform)&nbsp;into segments for further analysis and dividing time into 24 hours to try to make the nested&nbsp;IF formulas work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Current attempts are:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1) </strong>=IF(C2&gt;=7,"7:00AM - 8:00AM",IF(C2&gt;=8,"8:00AM - 9:00AM",IF(C2&gt;=9,"9:00AM - 10:00AM",IF(C2&gt;=10,"10:00AM - 11:00AM",IF(C2&gt;=11,"11:00AM - 12:00PM",IF(C2&gt;=12,"12:00PM - 1:00PM",IF(C2&gt;=13,"1:00PM - 2:00PM",IF(C2&gt;=14,"2:00PM - 3:00PM",IF(C2&gt;=15,"3:00PM
 - 4:00PM",IF(C2&gt;=16,"4:00PM - 5:00PM",IF(C2&gt;=17,"5:00PM - 6:00PM",IF(C2&gt;=18,"6:00PM - 7:00PM",IF(C2&gt;=19,"7:00PM - 8:00PM",IF(C2&gt;=20,"8:00PM - 9:00PM",FALSE))))))))))))))</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it always returns 7:00AM - 8:00AM because it sees all times in this formula as &gt;7.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2) </strong>=IF(C20=7,"7:00AM - 8:00AM",IF(C20=8,"8:00AM - 9:00AM",IF(C20=9,"9:00AM - 10:00AM",IF(C20=10,"10:00AM - 11:00AM",IF(C20=11,"11:00AM - 12:00PM",IF(C20=12,"12:00PM - 1:00PM",IF(C20=13,"1:00PM - 2:00PM",IF(C20=14,"2:00PM - 3:00PM",IF(C20=15,"3:00PM
 - 4:00PM",IF(C20=16,"4:00PM - 5:00PM",IF(C20=17,"5:00PM - 6:00PM",IF(C20=18,"6:00PM - 7:00PM",IF(C20=19,"7:00PM - 8:00PM",IF(C20=20,"8:00PM - 9:00PM",FALSE))))))))))))))</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which is technically the same as attempt no.1, however without the &gt; option, the returned result is FALSE. I believe this is because it cannot find the exact format of a single digit;&nbsp;for example looking at 07:30, but looking for just "7".</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>3) </strong>=IFERROR(VLOOKUP(C2,TIME_RANGE,2,FALSE),"")</p>
<p>
</p><p>TIME_RANGE is on the same sheet displayed as: Column 1&nbsp;= 7; Column 2 = 7:00AM - 8:00AM and so on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is where the 24 hour time is necessary to distinguish between 7am &amp; 7pm (Col1: 19 = Col2: 7:00PM - 8:00PM)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The result of this formula is a blank cell, due to the end of the IFERROR being "".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope I've provided sufficient information and I believe that I'm on the right track, I just have been looking at it for too long to find the answer I'm looking for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance!</p>
<p>

<p>As per screen shot, your Time Range like column G should be a Text format with 2 characters, Also change your formula from False to TRUE.</p>

<h2>            Cortana unable to connect to internet on Windows 8.1 Nokia Lumia 635</h2>
                    <p>I've tried all the usual fixes (including a hard reset) for the Cortana "I can't connect to the internet. Please try again in a little bit" problem, but to no avail. Cortana was working just fine last week over WiFi and my phone's data connection, but now
 she'll only respond to voice commands to open apps. Does anyone know if Cortana support has been completely phased out for Windows mobile 8.1?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, are any Windows 10 mobile users experiencing this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            Thanks for suggestion, it is not a memory issue, the phone cannot be upgraded, it is a company phone now impacting on conducting business, company now switching to Samsung and Andriod. &nbsp;Another Microsoft loss, such a loss making business practice how Microsoft
 ruined the Nokia business. &nbsp;Wonder how many of the business development “good ideas” are loss earners.

<p>
</p><p>Free up as much memory as you can by deleting unnecessary data or moving what you can from phone memory to memory card, failing that a hard reset should clear the memory and you can update if you do not restore from backup which would probably fill up your
 memory again. After updating you can reset again and then restore from backup. You could also decide to build up your phone from scratch and only install what you actually need and use, up to you.</p>

            Hi Jake da jugg,<br />
<br />
a) Are you using a third party tool for downloading from the websites?<br />
<br />
<br />
When you download program files from the internet, by default all the downloaded files go to C drive &gt;&gt; Favorites &gt;&gt; Downloads. Check if the downloaded files are listed there.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong><br />
You may try using the Internet Explorer Performance troubleshooter. This can be done by:</strong>
<br />
<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start<br />
<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type Troubleshooting into the search box<br />
<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Press Enter on your keyboard<br />
<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click View all (on the left column)<br />
<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Internet Explorer Performance<br />
<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Next<br />
<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow instructions of Troubleshooter<br />
<br />
<br />
You may also try right clicking on the program that you want to download &gt;&gt; and select "Save Target as" you may select the location of where you want to save the program. Save it on the desktop and check what happens.<br />
<br />
Also <strong>reset IE</strong> to the defaults as it may remove any custom settings made to a different folder.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
click Tools&gt; Internet Options, then go to the Advanced tab. Click on the reset button at the bottom of the Advanced tab and select the options you would like to keep from the list.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Refer the link below to reset Internet Explorer settings:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737</a>
<br />

<h2>            Stuck on &#34;creating outlook data file&#34; or welcome screen if I turn down safe mode.</h2>
                    <p>So I have a clean install of Windows 10. Disabled updates until I am done setting everything up - don't want 120 updates kicking in at an inconvenient time and going on for hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installed Office 2007 - went great, works great. No updates here, either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I went to get a very legit program (imgburn) from their official website, downloaded from the top mirror link (which was Digital Digest), and I guess I lowered my guard a little bit. It kept making me click on the same page several times, or so I thought.
 Then I realized it was getting permission to install a bunch of programs (Web discovery, Web companion, Lavasoft, some search toolbar etc). One of them hijacked both FF and Edge. Right away I uninstall all of them, run Mbam, Spybot, and Zemana. By the time
 I was done, I couldn't get into Outlook except in safe mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what I have tried so far:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- disabled all add-ins</p>
<p>- uninstalled and reinstalled Office suite</p>
<p>- uninstalled Office and installed Outlook only</p>
<p>- uninstalled, then manually deleted a bunch of Office and Outlook files and folders, then repaired Office.</p>
<p>- used office diagnostics</p>
<p>- fixed PST file with scanpst</p>
<p>- replaced extend.DAT and PST files with earlier, known good versions (didn't see OST file or outcmd.DAT, are they missing?)</p>
<p>- created a second email profile and tried to use that</p>
<p>- deleted the original profile</p>
<p>- logged in under a different windows user</p>
<p>- deleted a bunch of Outlook-related registry entries and folders...</p>
<p>- Event viewer doesn't seem to have anything other than my attempts to fix the situation</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing has worked. It asks if I wanna start in safe mode. If I say no, it just hangs on the welcome screen. when I try a new profile, it hangs on "creating outlook data file". If I delete or move the PST file, it asks me for it , I point to the location,
 and then it hangs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you think some file or setting is missing, or corrupted?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help! I really don't want to copy 600gb data back to a different hard drive and start over.</p>

<p>It was a mistake to clean install win and not then allow winupdate to do its thing, before attempting to install anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 2007 went out of support Oct 17 and as such there are no security updates via win update</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your system has been compromised in the downloads from that third party software. (You could have installed direct from Imagburn rather than the third party)</p>

<p>Thank you, Palcouk. </p>
<p>
</p><p>About the imgburn thing: I did go to their website, and hit download, which took me to mirror links, so I thought those were reputable. That's why I am so pissed at them. It's ridiculous how seemingly reputable places like CNET or Majorgeeks offer links
 to malware. It's one thing to be slightly deceptive and trick me into downloading something I didn't want, but if that spamware is impossible to remove and causes almost irreversible damage to computers, CNET or Softonics should stop doing business with them
 and everyone should blacklist them. And don't even get me started on dozens of green "Download" buttons that put you a click away from malware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Okay, enough ranting. I wanna take one last shot at it. I have another hard drive with identical Win10 installation. I could install Outlook on that drive, and try to:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Note all main registry items and copy them over (create a restore pt before that)</p>
<p>2. Find and copy every folder/file that is related to Outlook and see if my bad Outlook is missing any files or folders</p>
<p>3. If that doesn't work, copy the good files/folders and overwrite my corrupt ones</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could that solve what I suspect to be a case of missing/corrupted files, or folders, or settings?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do you guys think?</p>
<p>

<p>After reinstalling, copied a bunch of files containing "outlook" in their name from the other machine. Copied the entire contents of every folder named "outlook".&nbsp; Now I don't get the "creating outlook data file", but "configuring outlook accounts", and
 it's also stuck. I'll try Offcat (still available from third party sites), but after that will start copying registry items.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fact that the program is stuck on usually means that it's looking for a certain file or a setting, and not finding it, right?</p>

            Accessing OneDrive as you suggested through Office&gt;OneDrive works. Glad there is a workaround. However, I would like to be able to access it through the OneDrive app directly. Any suggestions?

<h2>            Outlook Signatue image resizing</h2>
                    
<p>My outlook has sudenly stopped me from adjusting the size on images in the Signature creation panel. Whatever size image I insert Outlook renders it at the&nbsp;size&nbsp;it wants. This has not happened before and signatures created some time ago remain as I created
 them. I have tried dragging the image corner tags but they are frozen. I have created images at the size in PaintShopPro&nbsp;I want but Outlook still downsizes them with no possiblity of resizing in the Signature panel.<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Help
 please</span>. I am using Win7 64bit with Office 2007 Enterprise</p>

<p>Have you tried editing your signature files outside of Outlook?&nbsp; See if you can find them and edit the files in their native language (i.e. Word for .rtf files and .htm files).&nbsp; Then see if they look the way you want them to in Outlook.</p>
<p>Signature files should be stored in C:\Documents and Settings\yourusernamehere\Application Data\Microsoft\Signatures</p>

<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>One possible reason why you are seeing two accounts under one email address is because you might have signed in to Skype using your account's associated email address instead of your Skype Name without merging them first, thus resulting to a new Skype account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can only redeem the free minutes on your Skype account if it is merge/link with your Microsoft account (the email you used to purchase for office 365). All Skype accounts were transitioned to basic Microsoft accounts last October 2016, although users
 with legacy accounts (Skype Name-created accounts) still need to fully update their accounts to enjoy the benefits of a full Microsoft account and this includes your concern. I suggest you to merge your Skype account first, simply access this link to your
 browser: <strong>login.live.com</strong>, then sign in with your Skype name (username) and password. Follow the steps that will prompt to your screen. Once you successfully migrate your Skype account to Microsoft account (merge), you can proceed to redeem
 the minutes on your Skype account, the steps are indicated on this FAQ link: <strong>
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12230/how-do-i-activate-my-office-365-skype-minutes?q=365" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How do I activate my Office 365 Skype minutes?
</a></strong></p>
<p><br />
In the event that the system detects your email address is<strong> already linked with another Microsoft account</strong>, you will need to create a new email account to link with your Skype account, with that being said, it is not possible to redeem the free
 minutes on your Skype account and can only be redeemed to your Microsoft account.</p>

                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>Hello, I'm just curious about how long Security Essentials takes to install normally because mine is taking forever.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>I began installing at about 2am this morning, woke up at 10AM and it hadn't finished. I stopped the installation and restarted it again, it has now been running for four hours with the message, 'Installing Microsoft Security Essentials Components.'</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Currently i am running Windows Vista SP1 and i've recently had to uninstall OneCare with deleting files from the registry and running the OneCare cleanup tool. The computer is currently disconnected from the internet
 as i'm unprotected because i had to disable Windows Defender to be able to uninstall OneCare.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Any help would be appreciated.</span></strong></p>

<p>I suggest to do as these steps:</p>
<p>Stop MSE installation, then run this tools :</p>
<p><span><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/4/c/b/4cb845e7-1076-437b-852a-7842a8ab13c8/OneCareCleanUp.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>http://download.microsoft.com/download/4/c/b/4cb845e7-1076-437b-852a-7842a8ab13c8/OneCareCleanUp.exe</span></span></a></span></p>
<p><span>to remove OneCare.</span></p>
<p><span>Then try to install MSE</span></p>
<p><span>Also you have Windows Vista SP1&nbsp; I suggest to update Windows and install SP2.</span></p>
<p><span>Make sure you get MSE from:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx</a></span></p>
<p><span>MSE install should happen fast but it connect to internet to download other components and update that will take time depend of speed of your network.</span></p>

<h3> dmerg59  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I format Visio Task Panes&#63;</h2>
                    I like to use the Pan &amp; Zoom window. Normally it appears as a square in the lower right side of the screen and disappears after a few seconds of non-use. Now it is a page wide rectangle on the bottom or side of the screen and stays pinned.

<div>How do I format not only that window, but the size and position window and the rest of the task panes to their original format?</div>
<div><br />

            When the Pan &amp; Zoom window is floating it has a pin to control autohide. Drag the window into the middle of the screen, right-click its header, then select Anchor Window. Now you can see the pin to control Autohide.<br />

            Hi Paul, Thanks for your response.
<div><br />
<div>I cannot drag the window, it stays locked into place and when I right click the only options are
<i>Float Window</i> and<i> Close. </i>So the formatting of the pane itself is broken, but I can't figure out where those settings are.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Any help finding them would be very much appreciated.</div>

            There's no such thing as formatting for these windowa.<br />
Select Float Window.<br />
When you've done that you will find a different option, Anchor Window.<br />

    <title>Continuum tablet mode&#58; what works and what doesn&#39;t - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chrismichaelgardner  say:</h3>
<h2>            Continuum tablet mode&#58; what works and what doesn&#39;t</h2>
                    <p>I posted some of this in the feedback app but figured I'd post here as well.&nbsp; I've been a diehard Surface Pro user for all 3 generations as well as a desktop user.&nbsp; The new continuum mode, while a step in the right direction, is flawed in a few ways.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, what works:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>(At least on the SP3) it reliably shifts back and forth.</li><li>Full screen in tablet versus regular windows in desktop mode works well.</li><li>The option to force flip tablet mode from the notification center is a nice touch.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>What doesn't work:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Tablet mode jarringly throws you into a world where you have a darkened desktop and nothing else.&nbsp; It should immediately show the start menu in full screen.</li><li>The "additions" to the Windows 8.1 start menu (the taskbar, places/most used) are awkward at best and unnecessary as worse.&nbsp; The taskbar especially makes it look like a desktop that just happens to have touch features, rather than a full tablet.</li><li>As others have said, there should be an option to automatically switch (instead of asking me to switch).</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>The best way I can describe it: Windows 10 in tablet mode should be more like Windows 8.&nbsp; Windows 10 in desktop mode should be more like Windows 7.</p>

            <p>I agree, the Start Screen in Win8.1 was just right for tablets and any touch environment. &nbsp;Expanding the Start Menu to full screen is not going go over well as a replacement for the previous Start Screen. &nbsp;I really hope they are not killing off the Start

            <p>Fully agree.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;<strong>I JUST THINK 8.1 MODERN START SCREEN IS BETTER</strong>: I think the new lifting for Desktop users with mouse+keyboards it's ok overall, and I like the reborn of Start Menu for those users...but entering "Tablet Mode" (both with Continuum or Manually)
 I expected an experience similar to my actual Windows 8.1 Pro fully updated, but unfortunately I just found myselft to have a much MUCH worse one:
</p><p>
</p><div>-Modern Start Screen is now too small, with too useless clutter caused by Start Menu items list on the left;</div>
<div>-Live Tiles are smaller, uglier (much more pixelated, especially the small-sized one), confusing with too many Tiles Groups and wasted blank spaces between them, and it's very bad to scroll them vertically now instead of real Full-Screen, horizontal scroll;</div>
<div>-Having the "Start Bar" on the bottom even in Tablet Mode, and even in Full Screen, is absolutely ugly, inconsistent, and space wasting;</div>
<div>-In "Tablet Mode" the Full screen apps should realy be FULL screen, and not a maximized window on desktop...</div>
<div>
<p>-The whole "Metro Environment" (especially Multitasking, app switching, and resizing the apps opened simultaneously) is now somewhat downgraded to Desktop mode even on Surface Pro 3 without keyboard, or in Tablet Mode, and it shouldn't be the case;
</p>
<p>-Missing Charms bar and new Multitasking, Multi-Desktop Gestures are a huge downgrade in usability in Tablet Mode;</p>
<div>-It is much less "Touch Friendly" and Clean. Yes, it was so much Clean, intuitive, fluid, and Perfect on metro side on my Windows 8.1, and now it's NOT.</div>
<p>
</p><div>I just want my "Metro" experience like it was before, at least in Tablet mode on my...Tablet?</div>
<p>
</p><div>I really hope this Consumer Preview still focuses on "Desktop side of things", and that the Tablet experience is stil very very in Alpha Stage, because it is a big downgrade of the Tablet experience right now for Surface Pro 3 and hybrid devices in general...</div>
<div>Hope to see the real Metro 2.0 Experience by the final build this summer/fall, otherwise me and so MANY Others will stick to Windows 8.1. Just easy as that.</div>

            Looking at this further, if they intend to keep the taskbar and frequently used programs list in tablet mode,&nbsp;they're going to need to&nbsp;increase the size of the icons you can touch.&nbsp; Trying to tap while in this mode can be extremely frustrating.

            <p>What doesn't work is the dang taskbar always on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They removed the charm bar so now they replace that with the desktop taskbar always stuck at the bottom which is stupid for a smaller tablet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They need to add the charm bar features to the Notification center and nuke the taskbar for Tablet mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is just really sad how they have messed up a really good Tablet GUI in Win 8.1 by basically forcing tablet user into the desktop even when they choose Tablet mode.</p>

            Hello stacey112,<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Thank you for your reply back!<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Since the full scan showed no issues and you are able to browse the internet with no problems (except&nbsp;urbanoutfitters.com) I would clear your cache and cookies
<br />
<br />
Open Internet Explorer-&gt; Select 'Tools'-&gt; 'Internet Options'-&gt; Then select 'Delete' for browser history.<br />
If you want you can Delete all but you will lose passwords you have stored.&nbsp; Delete temporary internet files, cookies, and history.<br />
<br />
After you have done this close out all Internet Explorer pages and then re-open.&nbsp; Another option for this is when you go to
<a href="http://www.urbanoutfitters.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.urbanoutfitters.com</a> if you select 'Help' at the top/middle of page you can then select contact them.&nbsp; I would suggest asking if the site itself was having the problem and cut and paste your error message in the
 note.&nbsp; I was unable to find any support for the site itself so I would assume you would have to submit it.&nbsp; Please let us know status!&nbsp; Thanks<br />

<h2>            Nokia PC Suite causes Vista to hang at &#38;quot&#59;Shutting down...&#38;quot&#59; page&#63;</h2>
                    I have Nokia PC Suite 7.0 and Windows Vista Home Premium 64x installed on my computer. But sometimes when I try to turn off the computer, the screen just hangs at the blue "Shutting down..." page. Such as this morning I woke up and found my computer hanging
 at that page (after 8 hours). The same instance has happened numerous times. I am fairly sure it's PC suite that's causing the problem, since the hanging occurred shortly after the suite's installation. Could you guys please help me with this? Many thanks.

            Hmm, you could be right for that's a 64bit os. Vista 64 fails to close some processes that's running. Why not go to microsoft support, maybe they have a patch for that, not particularly pcsuite but some apps that prevent Vista 64 from shutting down.

            Okay, now this is weird. After a clean installation of windows and nokia pc suite, the computer still hung. Now even removing PC suite from my computer, it still hangs at shutting down page. Shutting down was never a problem for me before.

            Sorry to see others are experiencing this but in one sense, I'm relieved to see I'm not the only one experiencing this problem, but bummed about the problem all the same.<br />
<br />
I bought a new PC a couple of weeks ago (Vista OS) and in setting it up, installed Nokia PC Suite. A few days later, it realkly started to hang when shutting down and very slow in booting up. Both processes were under a minute out of the box.<br />
<br />
Ended up doing a factory restore, not sure what was causing the problem and intending to just return the computer, but after completed, PC was back to running fine. So...I reinstalled the software I intended to use, including PC suite. Now I'm back to the same
 problem, though this time, I see an error related to Nokia software in disagnostic app. I unistalled Nokia and that's helped, but there's still some lag in shutdown and boot compared to out-of-the-box status. And hard drive seems to be constantly working.
 ???<br />
<br />
Guess I'll see if there's anything related to PC Suite left to uninstall and if so, hopefully that prevents having to do another restore. What a pain and disappointment.<br />

            I am also having shutdown/hibernate problem with PC suite 7.0/7.1 on my Vista Enterprise 32-bit laptop. However version 6.85 is working fine and these are the observed behaviors.<br />
<br />
PC suite 7.0.7.0/7.1.18.0:<br />
If there is no synchronization with my phone e51, my Vista will be able to shutdown/hibernate properly. Once I synchronized with my e51 and unplug it from the USB, the shutdown/hibernate will hang and I will have to restart the PC. I realize that even after
 I unplug my e51, the windows explorer will still show the e51 icon on "My computer".<br />
<br />
PC suite 6.85.14.1:<br />
Shutdown/hibernate are all working fine even after I synchronized with e51. The e51 icon on "My computer" will also disappear once I unplug it from USB.<br />
<br />
Hence it seems to have something to do with the phone icon in "my computer", if it is still there Vista will have problem shutting down/hibernating. Does anyone has the same experience? Can this be fix in the new version of PC suite?

<p>I also have this shut down issue on Vista Enterprise-32. As the previous poster indicated PC Suite 6.85.14.1 seems to work. My E51 re-connects when unplugged which it would not do under 7.1.18.0. Atleast with 6.85.14.1 the PC shuts down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a fix for the newer versions of PC Suite?&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm facing the same problem as well. After connecting my E71 to my laptop running Vista enterprise, the laptop failed to shutdown. Any solution so far ??</p>

<p>Please let me know how I can uninstall Office 2007 (home and student--3 license) from one computer and resintall it on another computer without losing the license? How do I let Micsrosoft know in order to be able to reactivate the product key on the new

<p>I have already used my two other licenses and do not have a spare license.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

            Whilst that is true, there is no deactivate process, so you will probably have to activate the new installation by telephone and explain the situation.

            You can transfer your Office from one machine to another without losing a licence as long as it is ONLY installed on THREE machines at any one time.

<h2>            Readiness Test Redux</h2>
                    <p>I've been so impressed with Build 10162 I thought I might try another "Readiness Test" on my main work station.&nbsp; It's not quite as foolhardy as it sounds because I've just completed my weekly backup, which I accomplish by cloning my boot hard drive.&nbsp; If
 it goes to hell in a handbasket I'll just make my clone my boot drive.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's saved my butt on more than one occasion in the past.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will be a much more interesting test than my previous one because this system is Windows 8.1, loaded with all my everyday work files and programs.&nbsp; Stay tuned.&nbsp; It's been&nbsp;chugging away for a while.&nbsp;

I got around that problem and got the install to run to completion but it WAS NOT a good experience.&nbsp; It removed Norton which I expected.&nbsp; My experience is that Norton never has a compatible package out until well after RTM for a new Windows release.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought
 about trying Avast which will install and run but I suspect interferes with updates; even if it is diabled.&nbsp; However, Windows Defender couldn't be made to run.&nbsp; It wouldn't update and it wouldn't scan.&nbsp; Surprisingly, it left Stardock's Start8 and Modern Mix
 intact and working but I immediately uninstalled them.&nbsp; It broke my Office 2013/2016 license and wouldn't let me log in to the back end to reinstall because it refused to recognize my Microsoft ID.&nbsp; I definitely didn't expect that.&nbsp; There were all kinds of
 rendering errors, especially with File Explorers navigation which made it really difficult to work with.&nbsp; Build 10162 was a nice and problem free upgrade from previous W10 Builds (10159) but it was an&nbsp;AWFUL upgrade from W8.1.&nbsp; I rolled it back.&nbsp; I may try
 again with the next release.&nbsp; Needless to say, this is not what I was hoping to report.

<h2>            How to move downloaded videos to SD Card</h2>
                    If i have downloaded any video using downloader App how to move those videos to SD card. There is no option of moving worst thing is if you connect your mobile to the PC it will not display you any downloaded video so that you can at least cut and copy
 to SD card. Don't know why the WP8 has put such restriction.

            That is not a wp8 restriction. If the app doesn't offer that functionality, its the app's restriction. Get a different app.

<h2>            Error code 80070585</h2>
                    I bought an album this morning, and have been listening to it all day. But just about 30 minutes ago, it took 12 of the 18 songs away from my collection. When I try to play the songs by searching the store for them, the error code 80070585 pops up, and
 it says it cannot play the songs on my phone. I listened to them all day, but they suddenly went away. And no&nbsp;where can I find what that error code means.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>Hello JosephGuy:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting to the forum regarding the error you are getting when attempting to playback a purchased piece of music content.&nbsp; I have not been able to find much about this error code.&nbsp; What I did find tends to indicate this is a connection or app&nbsp;related
 issue, all instances I found were on Windows 8 PCs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a few things for you to try and a handful of questions related to your experience.&nbsp; Please try all the steps outlined and let us know what your experience was when trying each.&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
<li>The first thing I would like to do is a soft reset of the phone.&nbsp; You can do this by going to the phone and tapping settings &gt; storage sense &gt; phone &gt; temporary files &gt; delete &gt; Internet Explorer settings &gt; delete history.&nbsp; Once this is completed press
 and hold the down volume button + power until the phone vibrates and then reboots.&nbsp; After the phone reboots go to settings &gt; emails + accounts &gt; tap and hold the Microsoft account.&nbsp; After the account syncs try accessing your content and playing it from the
 store again.&nbsp; If the account does not sync, what is the exact error message you receive?</li><li>The next thing to try is to go to settings &gt; time + date &gt; turn automatically set to OFF.&nbsp; Once this is OFF set the time, date and time zone manually, pay special attention to the year listed.</li><li>If you have access to a Windows 8 PC, I would like you to go to the Xbox Music application and check your collection here.&nbsp; If you still notice songs missing from your collection, go to the store and attempt to play these and see if they can be downloaded
 to your computer.</li><li>If you do not have access to Windows 8, log into <a href="http://music.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://music.xbox.com</a> and review your collection here.&nbsp; Let us know what is available, what plays and what does not.&nbsp; After you are done with this go to the marketplace and see if you can stream the content from here.</li></ul>
<p>As for the questions I have please provide all the following details.&nbsp; If anyone else is having this issue, please provide all the requested information in this post.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make and model of phone.</li><li>Current OS version on the phone.</li><li>Current firmware revision on this phone.</li><li>Regional setting on the phone.</li><li>Language setting on the phone.</li><li>Speech setting on the phone.</li><li>Name of the album you are having issues with and a list of the songs that are no longer playing.</li><li>Exact error message that you are getting along with this error code?</li><li>If you go to the store and search out this album, are you able to purchase the individual songs that have disappeared from your collection?&nbsp; Do not purchase those now, I simply want to know if you have the option to buy?</li><li>Did you initiate this purchase via the Music Deals application or did you buy this directly through the Xbox Music application?</li></ul>
<p>Please let us know if you have any other questions or concerns we can assist you with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mark W.</p>
