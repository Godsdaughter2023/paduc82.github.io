            In the Display Properties - Background tab, click the Position drop-down and select "Center" or "Stretch". Selecting "Tile" option will repeat the image over your entire screen.

<p>Hi Vicki,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Are you having trouble reinstalling the webcam driver? If so, here's how you can update drivers in Windows 10:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Select the <strong>Start</strong> button, type<strong> Device Manager</strong>, and select it from the list of results.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Expand one of the categories to find the name of your device, then right-click (or tap and hold) it, and select
<strong>Update Driver</strong>. </p>
</li><li>
<p>Select <strong>Search automatically for updated driver software</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>If Windows doesn't find a new driver, you can try looking for one on the device manufacturer's website and follow their instructions.</p>
</li><li>If&nbsp;these steps don't work,&nbsp;try reinstalling the driver:&nbsp;Open
<strong>Device Manager</strong>, right-click (or tap and hold)&nbsp;the name of the device, and select
<strong>Uninstall</strong>. Restart your PC and Windows will attempt to reinstall the driver.
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'll be waiting for your updates.</p>

<p>Hey guys,</p>

<p>I've got an important question for all of you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm playing Skyrim for almost 8 months now and its my most favorite game ever. But i want to download the DLC Hearthfire on the Xbox site. (Where you on now). And now i have two questions for you.</p>

<p>1 - Is it a cool DLC or does it rune your game?</p>
<p>2 - REALLY IMPORTANT FOR ME, does downloading DLC's on pc works?</p>

<p>Thanks in Advance!</p>
<p>(Sorry for my bad English, i'm from the Netherlands).</p>

<p>If you are playing on a PC I don't think you can download it from Xbox and play it. They are two different platforms. Maybe Steam? As for the DLC. Hearthfire doesn't ruin anything. It's fairly simple and straightforward. You are allowed to buy property and
 build a house by doing favors for the jarls of Falkreath, Morthal, and &nbsp;Dawnstar (which you're not allowed to attempt until level 20 or 22). You can also adopt children and hire some folk (which I never did). Personally, I prefer the new houses to any of the
 old ones. With the new house you can have everything crafty in one place and ample storage for everything. Of the other two dlC, I really liked Dragonborn and think it is totally worth it. I just started Dawnguard but like the Dwemer Forge quest so far though
 I'm not excited about all the vampire attacks.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Speaking of, Amazon has the Legendary Skyrim for the list price of Dawnguard right now.</p>

<p>Hearthfire is pretty good. You can make your own houses and furnishings and build them how you like. You don't have to pay for everything like you do with the other houses. You can just gather your own materials and make everything your self. Even the guy
 at the sawmill lets me cut my own sawn logs for free if I ask him :)</p>

<p>It should... but hasn't. Five different characters, and still no achievement popped when completed building all of the wings in the third house. Even the achievement for completing ONE house, popped after I had Windswept (I think that's it... the one in
 the swamp with Solitude in the background) the SECOND house I had completed.</p>

<p>I've heard of the 3 house cheevo not popping up. Never did hear of any fix for it. Winstad! The one close to solitude is actually my third house and when I added the fish pond for some reason is where the cheevo popped up for me. I remember that well because
 it made no sense at all. Windstad was all done and I thought I wasn't going to get that one either until I added the fish hatchery. Wierd glitch.</p>

            <p>There have been several articles in the press (e.g. ZDNet) which point out that Microsoft added a feature that, if turned on, automatically redistributes updates peer to peer.&nbsp; That is, your home network can get saturated by updates being sent from your
 machine to other machines.&nbsp; That includes W10 itself.&nbsp; This is the sort of thing that would make sense if we were living in a world of GB connections, but not in a world where ISPs throttle you after a certain point per month, or bandwidth costs money.&nbsp; (If
 you've designated your Wifi or wired network as a metered connection, it is not supposed to be using it, so this is irrelevant to you.)&nbsp; If you want to turn it off, it's pretty easy:</p>
<p>

</p><p>This seems to be helping my home network a lot -- I was getting dialup speeds for downloads from sites that I normally have great connectivity to, and OneDrive and OneNote had become pretty much unusable due to sync errors.&nbsp; So even if you don't have a metered
 connection, if you are seeing a slowdown after updating to W10, I'd suggest trying this out and seeing if it helps.</p>

            <p>I noticed that feature too (you can find it under Settings\ Update and Security\Windows Update click "Advanced options" - it is rather tucked away!). As far as I can see there is no way of throttling the amount of bandwidth I'm giving Microsoft permission
 to use? It would be great if that was something the user could choose, to prevent the feature slowing up their user experience, getting the user 'throttled' by their ISP, &nbsp;or costing them extra.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found myself a bit torn about whether to turn this feature on or off:</p>
<ul>
<li>The argument for leaving it 'on' - &nbsp;we all want to help each other, don't we? And sometimes the updates being circulated will be security patches, and so it's to everyone's benefit if immunity to the latest exploit gets out into the community as soon as
 possible.&nbsp;</li><li>The argument for 'off' - &nbsp;are Microsoft simply saving money by using the community as unpaid software distributors? Is that an unpaid job I want? "Save The Big Corporation Money!" is not likely to be among my favourite good causes any time soon.</li></ul>
<p>As I say, it would be easier to choose 'on' if I could control the amount of bandwidth I am donating, or, perhaps, have a setting allowing me to volunteer my resources for circulating security updates only. My system has it 'off' for now. Do other folks
 feel the same?</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, also notice that by default Windows 10 wants to send feedback to Microsoft ' Automatically' and to send 'Full usage data'. These are &nbsp;settings you can find under Settings\Privacy\Feedback &amp; Diagnostics. I'm not sure how much bandwidth THAT uses, either.
 Obviously Microsoft are going to prefer to have the maximum data - for system improvements as well as any commercial use of the user data. Sometimes users will prefer not to give so much information due to privacy concerns, or not to allow so much uploading
 (for bandwidth or performance reasons). At least here there are other settings (e.g. to send only 'basic' feedback and only once a week.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>In General, I thought the default 'Express settings' one encounters during installation were often very self-serving for Microsoft. I found this article &nbsp;http://www.howtogeek.com/224352/what%E2%80%99s-the-difference-between-windows-10%E2%80%99s-express-or-custom-setup/
 helpful to understand what I was being asked to agree to &amp; decide whether I wanted to customize things.. &nbsp;</p>

            I too can no longer tolerate the bandwidth saturation from the Windows update agent.<br />
<br />
I recently attached my desktop Win10 system to an ethernet port on my Tomato router. Tomato is a router-centric Linux distribution that is available for a number of models. I am specifically using the Shibby Tomato distribution that can be found at:<br />
<br />
http://tomato.groov.pl<br />
<br />
Some have pursued Tomato "Quality of Service" (QoS) controls, but I turned instead to the "Bandwidth Limiter" found in Shibby Tomato.<br />
<br />
I enabled the limiter globally, then also for the "Default Class for unlisted MAC / IP's in LAN (br0)" and set it for an up/download rate of 600 kbit/s, with a ceil of 800 kbit/s. This will limit bandwidth on the devices that are physically attached to the
 ethernet ports, guaranteeing remaining bandwidth for the WiFi.<br />
<br />
Win10's task manager is now reporting a download rate that hovers quite close to (and sometimes slightly over) the ceil. Now when any Windows device makes excessive bandwidth demands, I have a network available to constrain them.<br />
<br />
Tomato will run on very inexpensive routers. The Linksys WRT54G can be found for around $5, and the 200 MHz MIPS processor inside it can perform this function quite well.

<p>I hope Microsoft broke some EU law with this ridiculous stunt. A fine on Microsoft like that $2.7B fine they just levied on Google would make up for some of the hassle that having WUDO as the default setting has caused.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft KNOWS that people have limited bandwidth.</p>
<p>Microsoft KNOWS that people have to pay extra when they go over, sometimes a lot extra.</p>
<p>Microsoft KNOWS that having WUDO as the default setting, something that your average computer user is not going to know, very easily could cause somebody to go over their limit unknowingly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft SHOULD BE FINED for this. Better yet, a class action lawsuit should make Microsoft pay back their customers who have gone over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the end, I'm done with Microsoft. Looks like I'll be an Apple user starting with my next computer. Too many absolutely ridiculous stunts by Microsoft - like that horrific attempt to force people to update to Windows 10. I didn't shut my computer off for
 months for fear that it would update automatically. **** you, Microsoft.</p>

<p>YES! Microsoft should be fined. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Its quite sad to note that Microsoft will ever develop such changes to empty our pockets. Mr. Bill Gate we are not responsible for your domestic issues then why your software eager to destroy our homes? I connected internet and start typing a letter in MS
 word after&nbsp;25 minutes 1.6 GB bandwidth was used automatically its quite&nbsp;annoying.&nbsp;I&nbsp;have an expensive hp laptop where I can't install Windows7 too. Mr. Gate you shutdown our gates. Thanks&nbsp;&nbsp;

    <title>Xbox Enforcement Permanent Ban - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xfatal push  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Enforcement Permanent Ban</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just a couple of weeks ago I had received a notification on Xbox live with a little red gavel (mallet) that stated I ‘xFATAL PUSH’ have a permanent suspension on my Xbox live account. I have literally tried everything I can to contact the enforcement team
 and I am pretty sure it is 99% impossible. I was banned because I used false impersonation on another player in order to get him leave me alone and stop calling me an idiot, which I couldn’t block him for some reason, either that or a clan of his friends had
 similar names and just kept harassing me. The first one also threatened to have all of his friends file a complaint on me.. “big deal I thought.” But I thought wrong..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway I’ll continue. So.. case reviews don’t work. Period! They really don’t from all of the web searching I have done through xbox and forums. I can’t find a single person that has said their case review has gotten them unbanned. I’ve been playing xbox
 on my account for seven years! Never have I had an issue like this before. And yeah I knew there was a code of conduct when I signed up, but did I read it? No I didn’t fully read it. Does anyone actually sit and read the code of conduct in the terms and agreements?
 I’m too excited to start my first game of Halo! The point is I never received a warning, I’ve never cheated or gotten in trouble for name calling, and I’ve got an outstanding reputation. I have purchased so many games including digital games through Xbox live.
 I love Xbox I have so many great memories on Xbox, memories that my dad and I had built on Minecraft and other games before he passed away. That’s one of the greatest things I remember him by because he had so much in common with me when talking/playing video
 games. All I’m asking for is for someone from the enforcement team to accept my apology and to hear me out that it will NEVER happen again!. I wasn’t false impersonating anybody for reasons to hurt them or to hack their account by stealing their info. Yes
 I even understand that it hurts microsoft in a way, and I wish I could take it back, but I can’t because I can’t contact anyone :( In all honesty I thought it would prevent that person from doing what they were doing, but that was wrong of me and I realize
 that now. I just can’t believe I received a permanent ban after all I’ve done and all I am sorry for and all the time I’ve spent trying to fix it. It’s almost like they don’t have a soul. Seriously though? Put yourself in mine or another persons shoes for
 a minute. No matter how good of a person you are, or how much money you have invested in their products, etc. they don’t care. I just want my account back but from what I’ve been told it is gone forever... :(<br />

            Why do people keep posting about XBox Live bans here? We have no power whatsoever to address the situation! The majority of posters here are just regular, albeit knowledgeable users.

<p><span>Hi Booker T Dikes Jr,<br />
<br />
- Are you trying to play a retail DVD or a DVD you burnt using DVD burner?<br />

<h2>            Skype keeps reverting to a non-mobile number for sending SMS message</h2>
                    <p>In Skype, I can select to send to a contact via Skype or SMS (via SMS link to my mobile device, not using Skype's SMS credits) using the drop-down right above the message typing area. The phone number it shows for a contact is his work number, which doesn't
 support SMS, instead of his mobile number. I can click on the little gear icon and select the correct mobile number and send to that. That works fine, but as soon as I leave that page (close the app, or just select to Skype that same contact), when I next
 go back to SMS, it's back to the same wrong office number again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same happens on Skype on my mobile device as on Skype on my PC connected to SMS via the mobile device connection (Windows 10 mobile).</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I get Skype to save the correct SMS number that works and stop reverting to the wrong one every time I come back to it?</p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/2db058a3-9dd7-4b44-a5ac-6738ea029c84" title="GraniteStateColin">
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Can you clarify who registered the work number on your contact's profile? Was it your contact or you? If it was your contact, then you cannot change the default number on his profile information and by default, you will see that as the first number to choose
 when making a paid call or sending an SMS. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We will highly appreciate it if you can provide us a screenshot wherein the number defaults back to his work number when you close the application, as well on other platforms so we can get a better view of your concern. Please provide the
<strong>exact </strong>Skype version you are on and the Windows 10 version running on your device
<em>(Press Windows + R keys, type winver and press OK.).</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Do not hesitate to post back with additional information so we can check further.

<h2>            Had it with my avatar</h2>
                    
<p>The first time I saw avatars on the Wii, I thought they were utter rubbish. Then Microsoft trashed their interface with them. I've put up with them for years and now I've just had it with&nbsp;them. To top it all, I am 41 years old and my avatar hangs about with
 a f......... teddy bear !!!!!!!!! Microsoft, if you ever want me to buy one of your Xbox's again I suggest you either drop avatars completely or at least let us switch the abominations off !!</p>

            Hi Sergey
<br />
<br />I'm so sorry you are facing issues! 
<br />My name is Margarida, I'm an Independent Advisor.
<br />
<br />The version 7 of Skype has been disabled on Skype servers, so it is no longer possible to install it, I am sorry for that.
<br />
<br />You are correct, at this stage, with the new Skype, as the Microsoft moderator indicated in the link you mentioned, "The Skype application to do not have an option to assign or select what video card will be used. By default it's your system will assign it.".
<br />
<br />The request has been taken to the development team, so let's hope it will be available in the future!
<br />
<br />I understand it's probably not the answer you were looking for, but I hope you'll at least clarify it.
<br />If you have any further questions, I'm here to help.
<br />
<br />Thank you, have a great week! 
<br />Margarida       
        </p>

<h2>            Taskbar height&#47;width on the side</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>I'm using my taskbar at left side but I hate width of them. I don't know why are icons as Wi-Fi connection, Volume etc. in two columns which expends width of taskbar. I tried unlock taskbar and resize width manually but nothing. When I change position of
 taskbar at default option (bottom) everything is nice in one line.</p>

            The width of the Taskbar is determined by the size of the icons. Right click on the Taskbar, select Properties, Taskbar tab, check the box before
<strong>Use small taskbar buttons </strong>and click <strong>Apply</strong> and <strong>

</p><p>Following an Intel driver update failure (Intel (R) Corporation-System -2/22/2019 10.23.0.2437) I had no sound device on my PC and the speaker icon in the task bar had a red cross displayed. When I checked the audio in Device Manager is showed no drivers
 for device code 28. I initially I performed a system restore and the audio returned. When I reran the updates with others as soon as the driver installed the audio again failed. to correct the problem I have successfully reinstalled the drivers downloaded
 from HP and installed the HP audio driver (sp92732). Now the audio is working again however when I turn up the sound via either the keyboard or the Bang &amp; Olufsen controls I am occasionally getting the blue screen message:-

<br />
<br />This is all related to RTKVHD64.SYS which is Realtek HD Audio
<br />
<br />When you say you downloaded and installed the Audio drivers, was that the Realtek Audio drivers from the support page for your PC on the Hp website?

            If you are running any 7.x release you may be prompted to update to the latest classic version of Skype (7.40) or the latest version of Skype 8.x. (8.12) depending on the version already installed. A prior Microsoft Windows update issued years ago ensures
 that any Skype detected installs a 7.x release to address security concerns. This is separate from any standard Skype update process. If the Windows update is persistent on Windows 7, simply hide the update, so that it will never ask again.<br />
<br />
There are only two versions to be concerned with. This would be classic version of Skype or the new Skype for Windows.&nbsp; You have the option of updating to the new version or reverting to the classic version.&nbsp; Some people revert due to familiarity, functionality
 and stability concerns.

<p>Thank you for your reply. But, the question remains what does the latest update version 8.x have that the presumably classic versions 7.3 and 7.4 don't have or is the 8.x version just different to be different?</p>

            Older releases are never guaranteed and viewing the release logs on the Skype website, only the newer releases appear to be in active development. The 8.x/12.x versions are a new ground-up, unified, cloud approach that is more seamless across multiple
 devices with additions like theming and the ability to function in low power modes on supported hardware. The downside to that is not having the same functionality restored in the client either permanently or temporarily. In the end it is the direction they
 are going with any newer releases and the only thing that can improve it is feedback.

<p>Thank you for your answers. I currently have versions 8.13 and 7.4 installed. I am puzzled by the fact when I updated to version 8.12 version 7.3 was not replaced but remained installed. So, with both installed I guess I have the option to use one or the
 other. I just hope they can coexist without problems. The icons are the same for both so I never know which I am activating. I would suggest making a change to the icon for 8.x so the icons can be distinguished from each other.</p>

            I am experiencing the same 2 versions on my Windows 10. Skype 8.13 asking if I want to try the new skype which I did but I was disappointed that I couldn't share my screen with this version and has since revert back to 7.4.&nbsp; I am still hopeful they didn't
 remove this feature from the new Skype 8.13. That would be a let down for me. Hopefully it was just me that couldn't find the way in to sharing screen on the new Skype, or did they?

            &nbsp;Hi DebbieKeene.
<div><br />
Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft community.</div>
<div><br />
From you description I understand that you want to know how to move contacts to the People app.</div>
<div><br />
Follow the steps which will help you in moving contacts to people app.<br />
a. On Start, tap or click People<br />
b. Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap Settings.<br />
(If you're using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, and then click Settings.)<br />
c. Tap or click Accounts. <br />
d. Tap or click Add an account, select the type of account you want to add, and then follow the on-screen instructions.</div>
<div><br />
To add contacts one at a time<br />
a. On Start, tap or click People. <br />
b. Swipe up from the bottom edge.<br />
(If you're using a mouse, right-click within the app.)<br />
c. Tap or click New contact. <br />
d. Enter the info you want for this contact, and then tap or click Save.</div>
<div><br />
If you want to add several contacts at once, you can import them into one of your other accounts, and they’ll appear in the People app the next time it syncs.</div>
<div><br />
Follow the links as reference regarding People app.<br />

<p>I had already moved my e-mail addresses from AOL into Mail and a lot of them were wrong. What is now in Contact App is correct but cannot find a way to move them all as a whole into People.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also need help with printing from Adobe Reader. Can you help me with that also?</p>

            <p>Thanks for trying but that still is not what I wanted to do.&nbsp; There is an app called CONTACTS.&nbsp; I had filled in all the data like in an address book.&nbsp; I was hoping to sync it to the PEOPLE app as a hole but it does not seem to work so I am diligently adding
 my contacts one by one.</p>
<p>When it asks you "download mail from the last 3 days or 7 days,etc.&nbsp; what exactly does that mean?&nbsp; Once of the accounts I added to my MAIL app&nbsp; has been syncing all day and it will not let me use it?</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t login to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>My computer has been going crazy all through today and everything I try seems to make things worse, so I was hoping somebody here could help me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It started off with a Windows Firewall message saying that it had blocked features of windows.exe and was asking me to re-enable them. This popup isn't uncommon, but for explorer.exe? This seemed off to me, so i closed the popup and ran MalwareBytes and
 Avira scans, both found nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, me closing that popup caused windows explorer to freak out and give me an error (the rpc server is unavailable) when i tried to open it. I searched online for solutions, I found several which involved starting the service, so I opened up service
 manager to get another error (<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">An administrator has blocked you from running this app ... mmc.exe) which is very strange because I am an administrator and the only account on the PC. So I opened cmd (which
 would only open after a restart) and ran 'net user Administrator /active:yes' to show the local admin account.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">After logging into this, I could open everything again. I had no idea how to fix the mmc.exe issue though. Note that a week earlier I connected my college Microsoft account to my PC, so this may have
 applied some group policies. I can't change these though as I run home edition of Windows.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Now comes where I messed up, I opened settings and realised there was an update that failed to install and decided it would be worth it to install it aa I was running out of options. Only problem is I
 ran the update from the separate Administrator account and now after the update my account wont login at all (I sign in, it says welcome then goes back to the lock screen). I have run startup repair, which said it couldn't repair it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I'm now completely out of ideas so I was hoping someone on here could help me get out of this mess.</span></p>

<p>Hi Chris,<br />
<br />
Corrupted user profile is one of the possible reasons why you are unable to login to your account. You will need to create a local admin account without a Microsoft sign in. Then, copy the user files to this account. Then, delete the corrupted admin account.
 Once done, re-create the admin account with my Microsoft sign in, and then copy the user files. Transfer files (apps and settings) from one user account to another. You can follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows </strong>+ <strong>X </strong>keys on the keyboard, select
<strong>Control </strong><strong>Panel</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>System </strong><strong>and </strong><strong>Security, </strong>
and then <strong>System</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Advanced </strong><strong>System </strong><strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>User </strong><strong>Profiles</strong>, click <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Select the profile you want to copy.</li><li>Click Copy to, and then enter the name of, or browse to, the profile you want to overwrite. This will usually be in C:\Users\username, where username is the name of the profile to which you are copying.</li><li>Click Permitted to use, and then add all user accounts to which you want to give full profile control.</li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>

    <title>Windows 10 Anniversary Update and Fast Access Facial Recognition - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> petergaskell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Anniversary Update and Fast Access Facial Recognition</h2>
                    <p>I have a Dell XPS 13 with Fast Access facial recognition <strong>disabled</strong>. This seems to have caused a problem with the Windows 10 anniversary update which automatically installed overnight. The computer starts but hangs at the login screen with
 the default background (seascape) and the Fast Access logo visible but no other buttons or information. The SensibleVision website recommends that Fast Access is
<strong>enabled</strong> prior to installing the updates but that doesn't help me now. I have been unable to start in Safe Mode using F4, F5, F6 or F8.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suggestions?</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>

 so I will let you know how that goes. Regarding you other questions:</span>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
1. No error messages but I went to bed last night with the computer updating Windows 10 and got up this morning to the machine still hanging - circling dots icon etc. Completely unresponsive so I am afraid I powered off and restarted. Then I got the problem
 I described so I thought that the upgrade installation had completed and there was this issue with Fast Access</div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
2. I have the computer with me but I can't get further than password screen</div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
3. I don't know which drivers are updated and which aren't. When I receive a notification of an update I install updates but otherwise I don't go looking for the latest</div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
4. Creating an installation disc now - my laptop was upgraded from Windows 7 Professional to Windows 10 on-line when offered so I don't have an installation or product code.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">

            <p>The auto repair option "was unable to repair". I then tried the restore option but there were "no restore points". I then tried going back to an earlier build. This worked and enabled me to log in. I then uninstalled the Fast Access face recognition software
 and restarted successfully. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Oddly, I the first screen I see now on restart is the startup screen from the Anniversary Update, not the previous build. I click on that screen and I get the password logon screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
