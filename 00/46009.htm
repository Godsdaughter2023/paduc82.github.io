            <p>Unfortunately, although it is possible to download a clean .iso of Windows XP Home in order for you to create the installation CD you need, no one here (including myself) can recommend that you do this. Reason? Many (very likely most) of these downloads
 will contain malware. If you are posting here, then I am sure you will not know how to tell the difference between what is safe and what is unsafe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't necessarily believe it is unethical to download what you need if you ALREADY have the license for it. My objection is from a practical standpoint.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That being said, if you know a person who has a generic (i.e., non branded) version of Windows XP Home, you can certainly borrow it and even make a copy of it yourself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How exactly did you format your laptop? It might have had a recovery partition on it. If you got rid of it, you should contact the manufacturer to see if they can help you. Otherwise, this site might help:</p>

<p>The installment of what? I asked if Windows 8.1 had EVER been installed (e.g., 2-3 years ago).</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Support (and updates)&nbsp;for Windows 8 (and Internet Explorer 10) ended on 12 January 2016.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't ask if you'd ever installed a McAfee application, I asked if you've ever run the McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Chances are (99.99%) the Dell computer came with a McAfee free-trial preinstalled. Doesn't matter if you never used it.</li></ul>

            Hi naomiherbert,
<br />
<br />Make sure, if applicable, that you're on fullscreen and *not* on borderless windowed, mess around with the resolution settings on The Sims 4 and see how it goes. Does it cover the whole screen? Also be sure that the resolution is the maximum that is supported or what you're comfortable with. Alternatively, you can start it in Windowed mode and see if it does it then, here's more: <a href="https://answers.ea.com/t5/Technical-Issues-PC/How-to-start-The-Sims-4-in-Windowed-mode/m-p/3447611#U3447611" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://answers.ea.com/t5/Technical-Issues-PC/H...</a>
<br />
<br />Be sure you're up to date with patches as well that EA puts out for the game: <a href="https://help.ea.com/en-us/help/the-sims/the-sims-4/the-sims-4-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://help.ea.com/en-us/help/the-sims/the-sim...</a>

<h2>            Forza Horizon 4 - Network issues</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I play Forza Horizon 4 online I have various problems. I frequently get the "Poor network conditions. play experience may be affected." message, the game randomly slows down and then speeds up and in races the other players and AI constantly teleport
 from one place to another. I haven't found anyone else having similar problems, so I assume most people don't have them.

</p><p>I tried following this short <strong>[Mod Removed - Advertising]</strong>, but it didn't fix my issues. I wanted to see if I could change the server region, but I didn't find any such option in-game. I thought that maybe the game configures that according
 to my OS settings, so I changed it to where I live(Estonia). I don't think the issues are caused by my internet speed, since I get up to 200 Mbit up and down with my ethernet cable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>Ok, I tried a few things to fix my issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried setting my max fps to 30, as suggested in a reddit post on the forza subreddit. Unfortunately, all it seemed to do is reduce the amount of times the game slows down and speeds up. The other thing I tried is going into Horizon Solo mode, which seemed
 to basically fix my problems. Now, in freeroam, that makes sense, since in Horizon Solo all the players are replaced with bots, but for some reason, my network issues in online adventures were pretty much fixed as well. I only occasionally get the "poor network
 conditions" popup in online races now. With this fix I could also set my fps back to 72 with no problems.</p>

            Hi booklady23 
<br />
<br />Are you seeing this notice in a web browser?
<br />
<br />If so, this is a complete and absolute SCAM, your PC is not infected and your files are not being copied at all, you have nothing to worry about
<br />
<br />This is a well known Tech Support Scam, some web page you visited has a browser redirect on that page, that jumps out to this scam page, which then locks up your PC in the hope that you will click into that page . . .
<br />
<br />When this happens, open Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Del) on the processes tab of Task Manager, select your web browser and End Task on your Browser
<br />
<br />That will un-freeze your PC and allow you to continue working . . .

<br />
<br />If that does not resolve the issue, follow the instructions here.
<br />
<br />
<br />For Edge:
<br />
<br />User Scott_Ki has provided this solution.
<br />
<br />************************************************
<br />
<br />When this happened to me, I closed Microsoft Edge using the Task Manager.
<br />
<br />
<br />Then in the search bar next to the Windows 10 logo on the bottom off the screen (I call it the "Cortana Search"), I typed in google.com and hit enter.
<br />
<br />
<br />Microsoft Edge opened up with a new tab for Google.  You can see the offending site still opens in a tab that doesn't have focus.  Click the "X" to close Edge. Do not click on the offending site tab or it will get focus again.
<br />
<br />
<br />When Edge closes nicely, it won't "Restore" the sessions and the offending site tab will be gone.
<br />

After being a member for over 13 years i would have expected a lot more that mirosoft helped me with the problem because i bought it on xbox live. When i go to the store and i buy a new tv and there is something wrong with it they don,t send you to some forum and expect you to solve the problem your self NO! they fix it for you.I hung up the telephone and went to this forum to send this mail because im pissed off how im treated and i never expected to be treated like this.</p><p>I'm not asking for a full refunt only for something like a couple of months of xbox live that would allready satisfy me.</p><p><br /></p><p>My gamertag is Ramonus Nl (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p><p><br /></p><p>I hope this case can be resolved so we can both benifit, i can keep playin

            <p>Hi, sorry to hear of your issue. You could try uninstalling the game, then re-install, that sometimes works for games that crash back to the dashboard. Also contacting the developer would be a good idea, to tell them what happens so they can figure out what is causing it and release a patch to fix it.</p>

            <p>Hi. Please press and hold the power button on your console for 10 seconds to do a hard reset. Turn the console on and try again.
  </p>
<p>If that didn't work please navigate to the game under my games and apps and press the menu button and scroll down to saved data and select to delete all locally saved data. Your saved data will sync from the cloud once you open the game again</p>

    <title>Upgrading from Windows 7 to 8.1 Pro - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Upgrading from Windows 7 to 8.1 Pro</h2>
                    My Acer Aspire One D250 is running Windows 7 Starter.
<div>Can I upgrade to Windows 8.1 Pro even though the maximum screen resolution is only 1024 x 600 and Windows 8.1 requires a minimum of 1024 x 768.</div>
<div>I have had two conflicting answers from Microsoft, so I thought I would ask the community.</div>
<div>One Microsoft customer service agent said it would work but I might have a problem running some apps &amp; another said it would not work at all.</div>
<div>There were three other issues which the upgrade advisor pointed out which were:</div>
<div>Secure boot, Acer launch manager &amp; Microsoft Security Essentials not compatible</div>
<div>The reason I am contemplating upgrading to Windows 8.1 rather than 7 Ultimate, which will work without issues, is because as a student upgrading to 8.1 will cost a third of what upgrading to 7 ultimate would cost.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any advice would be appreciated.&nbsp;</div>
                </div>

            No your computer has to meet all Minimum requirements in order to be Able to run windows 8.0/8.1. The requirement you speak of is just the minimum, and some features requirements. From the sounds of it your CPU may well not meet the minimum requirements
 either. My advice either forget upgrading to Windows 8.0/8.1 or upgrade to a newer computer. Sorry. Hope this helps and if you need further assistance post and we will be glad to assist you.

<h2>            Windows 8 can&#39;t detect my graphics card &#40;Nvidia Ge-Force 555M&#41;</h2>
                    I have a Lenovo B520 desktop PC and recently upgraded to Windows 8, Since my upgrade I have lost the ability to use my dedicated graphics chip (an Nvidia Ge-force 555M), Upon trying to install drivers for this device the Nvidia installer said it could
 not find any compatible hardware (Windows 8 had not recognised the graphics card). If anyone else is having the same issue or anyone knows how to fix it then you would be of great help,
<div>Thanks,</div>

            I've experienced a similar problem with my Asus P8Z77-V motherboard and an Nvidia GTX 670. I'm getting video out to my monitor, but according to the Nvidia control panel there's no compatible hardware installed, so my games run like treacle.
<div><br />
<div>In my case, I did find a workaround which might work for you too. I noticed in Device Manager that the System Device for my PCI Express port had an issue marker against it, so it wasn't working properly. For me, the device was labelled "Xeon(R) processor
 E3-1200 v2/3rd Gen Core processor PCI Express Root Port - 0151". A right-click on that to select Disable, and then Enable again caused my card to be detected and everything worked properly again.</div>
<div><br />
<div>One snag with the above workaround, it doesn't persist through a restart so every time I boot my machine I have to do this. Not a perfect solution, but the best I can come up with at the moment.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps you out,</div>
<div>James<br />
<div><br />
<div>Edit: I've since resolved the issue permanently (fingers crossed) by updating the firmware on my motherboard to the latest version. YMMV.</div>

                    I am using Windows 7 and burning Audio (mp3) files to a CD.&nbsp; I choose the Mastered Format and then Audio Files (I also tried a 2nd disk selecting Data Files, as well).&nbsp; The burn happens successfully.&nbsp; I can play the CD on my car's CD player; however, when
 I put the CD in my computer it acts blank.&nbsp; I get the "what do you want to do with this blank CD" dialogue box.&nbsp; When I click on the CD/DVD drive, the properties make it look blank and there are no file names listed.&nbsp; However, if I try to "re-burn" to the
 disk, it won't work....as the disk has already been completed and used!&nbsp; Help!

<p>Thanks for your help. Unfortunately it did not work. I've tried a number of fixes, and nothing worked. In the end I got in touch with Microsoft, and they were unable to remove the problem. It took them two separate evenings, and finally they gave up and
 I had a clean instal.</p>
<p>C'est la vie. At least I tried everything before I called in the big guns. Everything seems to be working OK now. Thanks again.</p>

<h2>            Xbox One X - How to move Minecraft licence to another User&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am PC savvy but a total Xbox newbie who has been unable to find online how to do what I wish.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last week I gave my children an Xbox One X and set up an account for them.&nbsp; All good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My daughter then asked for Minecraft, so I went online and purchased it - using my own Microsoft account that I use for all on line shopping.&nbsp; I expected to receive a reedeemable code like for the other games I installed, but didn't.&nbsp; Instead I received
 a download link that required me to first sign in to the Xbox as me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Minecraft is now installed on the Xbox and works fine - but only when the console is logged-in with my own Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How to transfer the game licence to my children's account please?</p>
<p>I don't want them needing to know my password and I have no interest in Minecraft? :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>I think that in this case you just need to set the xbox as your home console so that you can share all the content you purchase with other people signin in on that console:</p>

<p>
</p><p>This way you'll use your account to do the shopping when needed for your children and have everything under control.</p>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Licenses are not transferable between accounts, but you can download both accounts on the console and the game will work with both profiles.&nbsp; Both profiles on the console must be connected.&nbsp;Not forgetting that you can use the

<p>Thanks again to both of you for offering advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Proving that I am a complete Xbox newbie,&nbsp;MRallamagoosa's first suggestion hit the nail on the head; logging in as me and assigning my home console has granted my children access to my Minecraft licence and anything else I buy for the Xbox with that account
 in the future.</p>
<p>

</p><p>Less happy is that my son has changed my gamertag to a variant of his sister's name and I've just found that this is a one-time-free shot, and changing it back is going to cost me £7.99.&nbsp; Smacks of any excuse to make money having paid a king's ransom for
 the console in the first place.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not so good :-(</p>
<p>
</p><p>However&nbsp; now you have set the console as the home Xbox you can remove your account if you like to prevent them using it, or put a pass code on it to stop them signing in as you and changing anything.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Computer not responding after cancelled shutdown</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday I accidentally pressed both the hibernate button and then the shutdown one. The computer hibernated and then later that day I logged back into it and was prompted with a shutdown which I cancelled. It seems that some drivers had been shut
 down but others weren't. I could use the computer like normal (except the double finger on trackpad to scroll) but when I tried shutting it down later the computer wouldn't respond. I turned it off by holding the power button until it all shut down. This morning
 when I tried to use it again the computer spent 2 hours loading to the password screen and then 3 hours on the "welcome" screen before letting me in. Right now the computer has been loading the desktop for an hour and still hasn't loaded. How do I fix this?
 I have windows 7 and am using a laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The desktop has come up but nothing will respond. Now the bottom right of the desktop says "windows 7. Build 7601. This copy of windows is not genuine."</p>

    <title>Windows update causing headphone jack on laptop to fail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> torsitano  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows update causing headphone jack on laptop to fail</h2>
                    I didn't really find anywhere to actually submit a notice to anyone mentioning the issue. It's currently resolved at the moment, but could very quickly happen again upon installing more updates. Twice now within the last few days, the headphone jack on
 my laptop has failed after installing some updates, and then started working again after updates later that day. I can't find anything online, so I feel like this might be a fairly small issue. I know that it's not my laptop, I dual boot Arch Linux and it
 works fine every single time on there. I don't have any exact evidence that it is Windows update, however the sound card drivers have not changed, and to happen twice exactly after reboot of installing updates seems like that is the only probably cause<br />
<br />
I have a Toshiba Qosmio x775. When this occurs, the speakers on the laptop still function, but when I try to plug headphones or speakers into the headphone jack on my laptop, they are both silent. Windows recognizes that something has been inserted, as it automatically
 adjusts the volume setting when I plug it in and pull it back out. If anyone has any ideas to keep this from happening again, that would be appreciated. Obviously disabling updates isn't an option, since Windows has to update constantly for it's many security
 flaws.<br />

            <p>After installing the manufacturer drivers as suggested by MM and checking that it is working correctly manually run Windows Update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the list of found updates look for any updates for the audio driver. If in the list right click and select "Hide Update". This should block them being automatically installed.</p>

            Well the weird part about this all, and why I felt the need to bring it up, was that it wasn't drivers that were causing the issue. When it had popped up the first time, it was a few days after a reformat, and I figured it could have possibly been the
 drivers. That was the first place I looked. I tried every driver I could get my hands on. Every sound driver for my model number that was available on Toshiba's site, ones from Realtek, anything I could find on Google that was related to my chipset. None of
 them worked. Of course I also removed installed drivers before trying new ones to prevent interference. On all the occasions that windows update either fixed or broke the headphone jack, sound card drivers, or any other hardware drivers for that matter, were
 not part of the update.<br />

<p><span>Hi jhighscoutdad,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>WPSM54G doesn’t have support for Windows 7. It’s compatible only with Windows 2000, XP, or Vista (32-bit Edition).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>See details here:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Getting to Know the WPSM54G</span></strong></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However here are some suggestions that seem to have helped</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>About your query, the file lknubhub.inf is located in C:\Windows\system32\drivers if that’s of any help. You should be able to find this on a computer
 where WPSM54G is installed. </span></p>

            Hi,
<div>As I understand the issue, you get blue screen of death along with the error code 0x00000101 on the computer. Please let me know if this is not correct.</div>
<div><strong>Before proceeding with the troubleshooting steps I may need a few more information to understand the issue better.<br />
</strong>1. When exactly you get this blue screen of death?</div>
<div>2. Is it while opening any particular application?</div>
<div>3. Did you make any recent changes on the computer prior to this issue?</div>
<div>I would suggest you to disconnect all the external devices other than mouse and keyboard. Then try restarting the computer and check if it helps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Give this a go; I’m confident you will find what you need here. But if you face any further issue please reply back to this post and I'll be happy to assist you further.</div>

            Hi,
<br />This can be achieved by forcing Windows to ask for the username and password on the login screen. This can be done by:
<br />
<br />Open Local Security Policy (secpol.msc in Run if you prefer) &gt; Local Policies &gt; Security Options &gt; "Interactive Logon: Don't display last signed-in".
<br />
<br />That should prompt you for a username and password during each logon. It is worth noting that this worked for me in build 1803 however the Policy name has changed with different versions of Windows 10. So your policy may be called something different if you try to set it. For example I believe the release build 1503 called it "Interactive Logon: Do not display last user name".
<br />Hopefully that helps,
<br />Will

<p>Thanks!&nbsp; Maybe I didn't explain the situation or what I was trying to achieve properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already did what you suggested, and as you said, that will work.&nbsp; However, I want the usernames to show up, but I do not want the hidden usernames to show up on the initial logon. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe I can explain it this way.&nbsp; Given the standard logon screen, how do you log into the Administrator account.&nbsp; After all, it's hidden.&nbsp; In Win7 this could be done by entering Ctrl-Alt-Delete twice.&nbsp; In Win10, this shortcut does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any ideas.</p>

<h2>            Win 8.1 upgrade - Black screen</h2>
                    <p>I'm on my third attempt to upgrade to Win 8.1 from Win 8. Each time, the screen goes black before the install completes. The issue appears to be the Intel HD graphics driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried using HP's latest Intel HD graphics driver &nbsp;Version 9.17.10.2857,&nbsp;2012-11-16. I've tried 10.18.10.3379&nbsp;12/18/2013 which is an automatic update from MS (Win 8)</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the versions of the Intel HD driver work in Windows 8</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears that many others have the same issue. What is going on with 8.1 to cause this? How do I upgrade to Win 8.1?</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would recommend that you download and run the Windows 8.1 upgrade assistant on that computer. This will provide a full compatibility report for that computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There have been some changes in the System Requirements for Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Upgrade Assistant: FAQ:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/upgrade-assistant-download-online-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/upgrade-assistant-download-online-faq</strong></a></p>

<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/system-requirements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/system-requirements</strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
If you are getting a black screen while upgrading to Windows 8.1, it could be due to an outdated or incompatible display adapter driver. Updating to the latest display driver should resolve this issue.
<p>
</p><p>Follow these methods and check if it helps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> If you are not able to boot to the desktop, I would suggest you to hard shutdown the computer by pressing the power button. Try removing all the external devices connected to the computer and then try booting the computer and check
 if it works. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If issue persists, you can try running an Automatic Repair from the Windows installation DVD/USB.</p>
<p>1. Boot from the Windows 8 DVD/USB.<br />
2. Once selecting your language, time and keyboard settings, click Next to load the next window, then click on the Repair your computer link on the bottom left corner of the window.<br />
3. You should then be presented with a Choose an Option screen, with Troubleshoot as an option to select.<br />
4. In the Troubleshoot screen, select Advanced options.<br />
5. Select Automatic Repair from the Advanced options screen and then select the target operating system to repair, which would be Windows 8 in this case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> If method 1 doesn’t help. To resolve this issue, you will need to boot into Safe Mode, and update the video card driver
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Boot the PC while holding the Shift key </li><li>Once the Recovery screen is displayed, click or tap on the See advanced repair options button.
</li><li>Next, click or tap on the Troubleshoot button. </li><li>In the troubleshoot menu, click or tap on Advanced options, </li><li>Then select Windows Startup Settings. </li><li>You will need be prompt to restart the PC.<span>&nbsp; </span>You will see a boot option screen where you can select Safe Mode with Networking.
</li><li>While in Safe Mode with Networking, you need to download and install the latest video card drivers from HP. (<a href="http://www8.hp.com/in/en/support.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www8.hp.com/in/en/support.html</a>)</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps. If you need further assistance with Windows, let us know and will be glad to help.</p>

            <p>Hi, Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The compatibility report shows no issues and states my Intel HD graphics driver is compatible. However it is not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of MS recovery methods worked for me. I tried restore point, recovery drive and safe mode. My system has a Hybrid SSD drive with Intel Rapid Storage (this caches often used files to the SSD portion of the drive). None of the recovery methods can deal
 with this and it's something MS needs to address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This machine is running Win 8. I successfully upgraded to Win 8.1 around the date of its initial release. Subsequently (about one month ago) I opted to install an optional driver from Windows update (the Intel HD graphics driver). This caused my screen to
 go blank and eventually I had to factory restore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not been able to upgrade to Win 8.1 since and this includes rolling back the Intel GD graphics driver before attempting the update. Disabling Intel HD graphics before performing the upgrade didn't work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can only assume that the build of Win 8.1 is different to that initially released and this build automatically updates the Intel HD graphics driver.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All attempts end in the same result (a black screen)</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should I try next?</p>

            <p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for getting back with the updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know – </p>
<p>
</p><p>1) What is the exact model number of your computer?</p>
<p>2) Did you try the latest drivers given in the Intel website?</p>
<p>3) Did you try booting the computer in “<strong><em>Low-Resolution Video (640*480) Mode</em></strong>”?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, I would suggest you to try booting the computer in “<strong><em>Low-Resolution Video (640*480) Mode</em></strong>” and check if you are able to login to the computer in this mode. Please follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Boot the Computer in Low-Resolution Video (640*480) Mode</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows, we can start the computer in different advanced troubleshooting modes to find and fix problems on the PC. One of such troubleshooting mode is “<strong><em>Low-Resolution Video (640*480) Mode</em></strong>”. Here, we start Windows using the current
 video driver and using low resolution and refresh rate settings. You can use this mode to reset your display settings. To access the Advanced Troubleshooting Modes (Startup Settings) on Windows 8.1, please try these suggestions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) When you boot your PC, try hitting the F8 key. This may take you to the Startup Settings that include Safe Mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>b) If hitting F8 doesn’t work, and you have media for Windows 8.1 (such as a DVD or USB), you can boot from media using the instructions
<strong><em><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/boot-install-partition-media-usb-dvd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></em></strong>. Further instructions about Safe Mode can be found
<strong><em><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></em></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>c) If you do not have media, use the power button to restart your computer during the boot process three times simultaneously (do not let it get to the end of the boot process). This should bring up the Windows Recovery Environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the recovery environment, try booting the computer in in Low-Resolution Video (640*480) Mode and check if you are able to boot and login to the computer Start Screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are able to boot the computer now, then this issue is caused due to the incorrect/corrupted graphics card drivers installed on the computer. I would suggest you to uninstall and reinstall the graphics card drivers and check if that resolves the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Uninstall and Reinstall the Graphics Card Drivers</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>a) Press “Windows Logo” + “X” keys on the keyboard.</p>
<p>b) Click on “<strong><em>Device Manager</em></strong>” from that list.</p>
<p>c) Search for the Graphics Card device from the device list, right click on it and then select “<strong><em>Uninstall</em></strong>”. On the un-installation window, if you have an option: “<strong><em>Delete the driver software for this device</em></strong>”
 you may select that and then remove the corrupted drivers from the computer.</p>
<p>d) Follow the on-screen instructions to complete it and the restart the computer if prompted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the restart, please open the <strong><em>Device Manager</em></strong> again and then click on the “<strong><em>Scan for hardware changes</em></strong>” button. Check if Windows 8.1 detects the Graphics card device and installs an appropriate driver
 automatically. If the issue still persists then you may check for the latest version from the Intel website. The drivers that you have installed and which is given in the HP website does not seem to be the latest one.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Please search for the latest drivers for your graphics card model from this link:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/Default.aspx?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Intel Download Center</a></em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
<span>Hope this is helpful. If you are unable to find the latest drivers from that link, then please get back to us with the model number of your graphics card or the computer.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Rajesh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the detailed reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) The model of my laptop is:</p>
<p><span><a href="http://h20180.www2.hp.com/apps/Nav?h_product=5273697&amp;h_client=S-A-r163-3&amp;h_lang=en&amp;h_cc=us&amp;h_pagetype=s-001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HP Pavilion dv6t-7000 CTO Entertainment Notebook PC</a>&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>Product Number: &nbsp; A5F76AV</span></p>
<p><span><br />
2) Do you mean the 8.0 drivers or 8.1 drivers?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3) It's not possible to boot into low-rez mode or access ANY form of recovery with my setup.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Here are the relevant details:<br />
</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>This machine had 8.1 installed (either on the original release date of 8.1 or within a day of original &nbsp;release)</span></li><li><span><span><span>There were no problems&nbsp;originally&nbsp;upgrading to 8.1</span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span>Sometime in February 2014, I elected to install the Intel HD graphics driver update from Windows Update</span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span>Screen went black during the install and I had to factory reset the system</span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span>I have tried three times to&nbsp;re-install 8.1 but each attempt results in a factory restore and painful rebuild of my system</span></span></span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Here is my <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-system/the-drive-where-windows-is-installed-is-locked/9fe0c708-1d03-4cab-8523-e80c9b17e124">
thread </a>on why it's not possible to boot to low-rez mode. (MS really needs to address this)</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I have tried disabling Intel Graphics driver before the 8.1 upgrade</li><li>I have rolled back the Intel Graphics driver to earlier versions (from the manufacturers website) prior to upgrading</li></ul>
<p>Both the above failed with the same black screen, I can only assume there's something in the latest Win 8.1 upgrade that is different from the original upgrade. Perhaps an updated Intel HD graphics driver is force-bundled in the install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because of the reason outlined in the thread (linked above) it's pretty time consuming to keep attempting this upgrade. It would be very useful to be able to access some form of safe mode but it's just not possible (as far as I can see) on machines with
 Hybrid SSD drives that use acceleration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to solve this, please let me know how I can help to diagnose this issue.</p>

            <p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you're having problems with your PC, you can try to refresh PC. Please follow the suggestion from this Microsoft article.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>How to restore, refresh, or reset your PC</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/restore-refresh-reset-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/restore-refresh-reset-pc</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Apps you installed from websites and DVDs will be removed. Apps that came with your PC and apps you installed from the Windows Store will be reinstalled. Windows puts a list of removed apps on your desktop after refreshing your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you upgraded your PC from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1 and your PC has a Windows 8 recovery partition, refreshing your PC will restore Windows 8. You’ll need to upgrade to Windows 8.1 after the refresh has finished.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps resolving the issue.</p>

            <p>John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply. I appreciate all input. However, this does not help. It neither helps me upgrade to 8.1 nor addresses the issue of machines with SSD acceleration enabled that (appear) unable to effect ANY form of recovery (refresh or otherwise).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have factory reset my laptop 3 times, I don't think refreshing will help - but thanks anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does MS have any ideas about how I can debug this Win 8.1 upgrade issue? I'd be happy to work with you to resolve it.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">As you have tried most of the troubleshooting steps, I would ask you to follow these methods and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">You may also run Check Disk using Command Prompt. To run “ChkDsk” utility using Command Prompt, you can follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a) Press “Windows Logo” + “X” keys on the keyboard and select “Command Prompt (Admin)” from the list.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">b) In the command prompt window, type
<strong>chkdsk /r</strong> and press “Enter” key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">c) Answer “Y” when “chkdsk” asks you if you want to check the drive next time computer boots (restarts).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Important: While performing Error-checking or ChkDsk on the hard drive, if any bad sectors are found and when attempting to repair that sector, the data available on that sector might be lost.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><em><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Run the System File Checker utility.</span></em></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">SFC (System File Checker) scan on the computer makes sure that the system files are intact. The System File Checker tool (SFC.exe) scans for missing or corrupted system files and repairs them. This will help with
 ensuring that a smooth upgrade occurs.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for the reply. I'm pretty confident there's nothing wrong with the hard drive. I have run check disk and have factory reset the drive 3 times and checked the drive after reset.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read the&nbsp;<strong><span>Update to Windows 8.1 from Windows 8 link
</span></strong><span>but don't see anything there other than basic instructions. I will point out that I have upgraded this machine to 8.1 in the past but can no longer do so. I believe this to be related to the Intel HD graphics driver.</span></p>

            <p>At the 4th attempt, using one of the earlier Intel HD Graphics drivers, I finally managed to upgrade to 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note: If rebuilding a machine from a factory restore:</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the Win 8 updates (I believe the first series) attempts to update the Intel HD graphics driver. You need to right click on that update and permanently hide it. Otherwise, it will overwrite the earlier driver and prevent Win 8.1 from installing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure why MS is forcing this Intel HD graphics driver to be installed via Windows update. Someone needs to look into why that driver causes problems on some HP and other manufacturers laptops.</p>

<p><span>Hi Akuro,<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting to the Vista Answers Forum.<br />
<br />
You can add the non-Microsoft services back one at a time to see which is causing the conflict, then update/upgrade/replace the software if you like.<br />
<br />
The blue screen is usually associated with a hardware error.<br />
Have you changed any hardware around the time the error started?<br />
<br />
Looking forward to hearing back from you.</span></p>

To see all that is loading bootup - wait a few minutes without doing anything - then Right Click TaskBar -<br />
