<h2>            Important folders to copy before resetting</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you guys know what folders (other than my personal files) are important to copy to an external hard drive before i factory reset my pc? I know the hidden folder AppData is useful, especially for gamers like myself, since many saves are stored in there.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any others that come to mind? I'm scared of forgetting something. I know there was another important one but i can't remember... thx.</p>

<p>Here are the folders you should backup before resetting. They are all located in C:\Users\&lt;your name&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; unless your user profile is stored in a drive with a different letter:</p>
<p>
</p><p>3D Objects</p>
<p>Contacts</p>
<p>Desktop</p>
<p>Documents</p>
<p>Downloads</p>
<p>Favorites</p>
<p>Music</p>
<p>Pictures</p>
<p>Saved Games</p>
<p>Searches</p>
<p>Videos</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of the other folders in your user profile, such as AppData, need to be backed up because they are tied to the current configuration and you are about to reset your configuration. If any of the above folders are empty, they need not be backed up, obviously.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You'll need to do this for each user account on your computer. Backup software makes this quick and easy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There could be other folders not in this list that you may want to backup, depending on your individual situation. For example, if you play games you may want to backup the folders that contain your settings or results. If you use Office Outlook you'll want
 to backup your .pst and .ost. You'll want to backup your browser bookmarks. You have to think through where your data is stored. For example, I would backup my Freecell score (1,300 wins, 0 losses.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you see on your desktop is a combination of 3 folders: the system desktop, your user desktop and the public user desktop. If you want to make sure you get everything, copy everything on the desktop to a folder stored under Documents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the time comes to restore your data, restore to the same folders from whence they came.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            You should copy the entire contents of your Users folder:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: %userprofile%
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Click the View tab then check 'Show hidden files and folders'
<br />
<br />Copy all folders to an external drive.
<br />
<br />Repeat the same steps for other user accounts.
<br />
<br />Also, make sure locations such as C:\Public where files might be stored are also backup.
<br />
<br />Also some apps will have their own storage folders, so make sure those are backed up too.
<br />
<br />Learn more:
<br />
<br />What you need to start this project?
<br />
<br />The first thing I recommend you do is invest in an external hard disk. I can't exhaust this enough; they are affordable and can store lots of data. You can probably get a 4TB drive for around $100.
<br />
<br />Keep in mind, if you have a complex configuration, these instructions do not delve into the nuances of multiple partitions or drives with data scattered across them although the same rules can apply in regards to backup. If you do have folders for data such as documents, music, pictures and videos stored on other partitions or drives, then I would recommend you disconnect these data drives and upgrade only the system partition. You can always reattach your data drives after setup is complete.
<br />
<br />Turn on Show Hidden Files &amp; Folders
<br />
<br />You want your backup to be as thorough as possible. Within your User folder is a hidden directory called AppData. This folder stores important settings for the apps you use, such as custom directionaries for Microsoft Word, passwords for apps like Chrome, Outlook data files and mail folders for apps like Windows Mail.
<br />
<br />To turn on Hidden Files and folders, start by opening your user folder. Press Windows key + R then type: %userprofile% then hit Enter on your keyboard.
<br />
<br />Enabling Show hidden files and Folders
<br />
<br />Windows 8/8.1/10 - Click the View tab then click Options then click the View tab. Under Advanced settings &gt; Hidden files and folders select the radio box Show hidden files and folders.
<br />
<br />AppData folder is now visible.
<br />
<br />After completing the above steps, you should now see the AppData folder appear in your user folder.
<br />
<br />Next step is to simply select all the folder. You can do this by pressing Ctrl + A or
<br />Click Home tab &gt; Select All (Windows 8/8.1/10),
<br />
<br />Selected folders
<br />
<br />Open your External hard disk then create a new folder and call it backup or a unique name. Open it then press Ctrl + V or
<br />
<br />Click Home tab &gt; Paste (Windows 8/8.1/10),
<br />
<br />Depending on the amount of data, this can take a while.
<br />
<br />If you have multiple accounts
<br />
<br />If you have more than one account on your computer, log into each account and repeat the same steps. Make sure a unique folder is created for each account you backup manually.
<br />
<br />Remember other folders you might have
<br />
<br />If you store data in folders such as Public, remember to look in there too. The Public folder is located in C:\Users\Public
<br />
<br />NOTE: Some apps will keep their own data stores within their application folders, so make sure you browse and copy those over if necessary. Some users have a tendency to store files at the root of the hard disk, normally where the operating system is installed (Local Disk c:\). Also check there for any important files and move them to Documents folder.
<br />
<br />Restoration
<br />
<br />Once your backup is complete and you have your new computer setup  and is installed and running, the next step is to copy over your files and folders from the external hard disk. You can do this two ways, you can individually copy the contents of each folder into the respective folder on the new computer from the external drive. Here is what you can easily do.
<br />
<br />Connect and turn on your external hard disk.
<br />
<br />Browse the backup folder with your backed up folders.
<br />
<br />Press Ctrl + A or Click Home tab &gt; Select All (Windows 8/8.1/10)
<br />
<br />Open your User folder on the computer
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R then type: %userprofile% then hit Enter on your keyboard.
<br />
<br />Press Ctrl + V or Home tab &gt; Paste (Windows 8/8.1/10)
<br />
<br />You will be prompted if you want to replace the folders, click Yes.
<br />
<br />Depending on the amount of data, this can take a while.
<br />
<br />If you have other accounts, make sure the respective accounts have been created and logged into then repeat the same steps.

<h2>            my surface tries to change the screen brightness depending on what is on the screen.</h2>

this thread.</a></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>I was playing a 1080p video of "Captain America: Civil War" with the "Films &amp; TV" application. My device is Surface Pro 2017 core i7 8GB. It seems this is a different issue from the random hibernation problem because,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) It's not random&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) It doesn't hibernate but the screen goes dark. It doesn't even go into standby because I can still hear the audio of the video playing, but I have to push the power button twice for the screen to come back on. Once to put the device in standby, a second
 time to bring it back on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The exact steps you have to take to cause this effect is (do it in the dark to better see the issue):</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Put up any video (Youtube for example) at FULLSCREEN and pause it.</p>
<p>2) Set brightness at 0% (auto-brightness should be off)</p>
<p>3) Play the video. After 5 to 10 seconds the display will go to a high brightness (probably maximum, you can't tell what percentage because the display percentage still shows 0%).</p>
<p>4) Now try increasing brightness ---&gt; The screen will go DARK.&nbsp;</p>
<p>5) If you lower the brightness back to 0% the screen will come back on but still at the high intensity brightness. Another way to turn the screen back on is pushing the power button twice (to go in standby and come back) and it will reset the display brightness
 back to actual 0%. The last method for getting correct brightness back is to escape fullscreen, but the moment you enter fullscreen it will come back again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is very similar to the process done by pmagix as well. I will try reinstalling the drivers and doing the two button reset Barb recommended in another thread and see if there will be any change. I'm not sure if this occurred before the firmware update
 or not or if it is a different issue. If so maybe I will make a separate thread for discussing it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In all of these tests another issue I notice is the display brightness flickering on videos as if adaptive brightness was on when it's not. I don't know if this is related to the sudden brightness or not. It seems as if the light sensor is activating when
 it's not supposed to. I'm not sure but hope Microsoft techs will inspect this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: In all of the above cases "change brightness automatically when light changes" in display settings was OFF. I have not been able to repeat the issue in that case because I believe the adaptive brightness never goes down to 0%, BUT the problem
 is when it is off the screen should NOT be adaptively changing when it actually still IS.</strong></p>

<p>I think I have a fix for both issue. I believe it has to do with intel's battery saving efforts of its display driver, which is why the brightness auto-adjusts to the content. Unfortunately this "feature" seems to have a bug when the display is already at
 its dimmest. The solution is to turn off this "feature" by editing the registry: If you navigate to the following field</p>
<p>
</p><p>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Control\Class\{4d36e968-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}\0000]</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should see a value of</p>
<p>
</p><p>"FeatureTestControl"=dword:00009240.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Change it to&nbsp; 9250 (in hex) and you should be good to go. Well, restart, and then you should be good to go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I pulled this from this blog post resolving the issue with the surface pro 4: https://mikebattistablog.wordpress.com/2016/05/27/disable-intel-dpst-on-sp4/.&nbsp; I have had the device on 0% brightness for a while now and now brightness shenanigans.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it acceptable that we need to edit the registry to get a brand new surface to work properly? not at all. MS, this is plain pathetic.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>What do you wanna see in WWE 14&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wombraider83  say:</h3>
<h2>            What do you wanna see in WWE 14&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>This is what I wanna see in WWE 14</p>
<p>You should be able to fight the diva's get them more involved with the game. It would be better because you could use Chyna and she used to fight men in WWE. The game does state on back on box if you can see it in wwe you can do it in the game, so you should
 be able to fight divas.</p>
<p>Get Kinect more into the game scan the prints on your clothes, your face into the game e.g like ea's fight nights champion.</p>
<p>Use Kinect in story to add voice, you could have moments where you have to trash&nbsp;talk through kinect, or just to add voice to scenes. Mini games like where you have to do fitness games to build up your caw (this would just be a an option for fun you could
 also use controller too)</p>
<p>Your Xbox avatar can be used in the game.</p>
<p>Bring back bra and pants mode</p>
<p>Bring back the option to go from ring to backstages areas in&nbsp;just one match.</p>
<p>More ECW Stuff like tick tacs on the ring, barbed wire match which ends up with more blood than a&nbsp;normal match would.</p>
<p>I would like the controls brought back where you use right analog stick from a grapple for the choice to do more moves, e.g you had the option to hold moes for longer before but you cant in the newer games. You used to be able to do more moves on the ropes
 to, e,g rest them on the ropes and bounce them up and down.</p>
<p>WWE Tough Enough story for your&nbsp;CAW. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you pin someone you can pull down on there tights.</p>
<p>More CAW slots about 200</p>
<p>WWE commentary mode, got bored with the same old commentary go online and when you fight some two people can join to watch and be the commenter</p>
<p>More WCW stuff like NWO and the nitro girls, maybe have the nitro girls vs divas?</p>
<p>Mud wrestling match for divas, the winner wins by holding down there oppentant for over 40 secs in the mud or have a meter they have to build up to fill.</p>
<p>Career mode could build off from WWE attitude but you have matchs where you have to change WWE History e.g what if Goldberg came to join WWE after WcW was bought out. Or what if the NWO had to fight&nbsp;a DGenX gang?</p>
<p>Dont get me wrong I love WWE 13 just thinking what else they could do?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>They will not do the diva vs men thing, it hasnt been done in years in real life and there is no reason for it to be in the game, as WWE wanted to get away from women and men wrestling against each other. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>Your avatar used in the game would not work, look at the avatar and look at the wrestlers in the game there would be no way to make that work, &nbsp;our avatars are to cartoony compared to the realism of the WWE games, if you want to use your Avatar then get
 Fire Pro Wrestling from the arcade games, it uses your avatar</p>
<p>your idea with pulling on the tights while pinning someone would be cool, &nbsp;I can see them actually being able to implement that somehow</p>
<p>WCW being involved in the game was WWE 12's theme, it was loaded with WCW stuff, wrestlers, the arenas ppv's and so on.</p>
<p>theyll say you can do all that stuff now with the Goldberg and NWO vs DX stuff, with Create a Wrestler and such.</p>

            Hello AdiHarrison
<br />
<br />Thanks for sharing your question with Microsoft Community.
<br />
<br />Please follow these steps:
<br />
<br />Click The Windows 10 Start Menu and type Netplwiz. &gt; Select the program that appears with the same name &gt; Right at the top is a checkmark next to the option labeled Users must enter a username and password to use this computer.” Uncheck that. 
<br />
<br />When you click Apply it will prompt you for your current password. Enter it twice and you’re finished. The next time you reboot, or your PC wakes up from a nap, you’ll no longer need to type in your password.
<br />
<br />I hope it helps you. Let me know if you need further assistance 
<br />
<br />Regards       
        </p>

<h2>            Deleting Files, Cookies, and History.</h2>
                    I regularly&nbsp;use Internet Options to delete my Files, Cookies, and Browsing History, especially after a lot of browsing.&nbsp;History cleared&nbsp;is confirmed&nbsp;when I click on the drop down arrow on the Address Bar, and all previous searches have been deleted.&nbsp;<br />
However,&nbsp;every time&nbsp;I click on the Address&nbsp;Bar to search for a new web page, as soon as I type in the first letter, and&nbsp;sometimes the second letter of the name,&nbsp;the drop down window comes up with a list of previous&nbsp;addresses which I have "browsed", along with
 some possible matches.&nbsp;<br />
This is telling me that my History of browsed sites has not in fact been completely deleted from the system, and will in fact provide any other user of my home computer a partial/potential list of sites I may have visited.<br />
Can anyone help this neophyte get round this potentially embarassing problem.<br />
Many thanks for any and all suggestions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>            converting mp4 to wvm for windows movie maker</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I purchased a new video/camera which records video in mp4. &nbsp;I love using windows movie maker to edit my videos for you tube.</p>
<p>Movie maker seems to like wvm format as I see my old video camera used this format.</p>
<p>I have tried 2 convertor programs that convert the video to wvm, but they seem to still give an error when I upload them to movie maker.</p>
<p>Does anyone know a convertor program that is truly compatible with windows movie maker?</p>
<p>I used YPD and RealPlayer</p>

            Hi Jacquie,<br />
<br />
There are many converters that you can use to convert MP4 file to WMV format. We suggest that you check available converters on Windows Store so that you can review first, which would be the best app that you can use.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you need further assistance.

    <title>Cannot download Max Payne 3 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danieleder  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot download Max Payne 3</h2>
                    
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>During the Xbox Super Sale I purchased Max Payne 3 for € 9,90 (I paid with Microsoft Points, wich were charged from my Account) but until today it was not possible to download the Game. The Download always stops at 0% and the Message "Cannot download Max
 Payne 3" appears on the Screen. I tried at least 10 times, but always the same Error.&nbsp;&nbsp; Very strange, I never had any Troubles downloading Games from Xbox Live, my Netword and Router Settings work just fine with any Download and Online Gaming. My Region is
 Austria, and I am operating my Xbox in Austria.</p>
<p>Any Ideas what I should do?</p>
<p>Thanks, Daniel</p>

Sorry to hear you're having trouble with downloading Max Payne 3<br />

I would check out our troubleshooting article on downloads here:&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-live/marketplace-and-purchasing/download-xbox-live-content" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../download-xbox-live-content<br />

<p>Do you have any other idea? Is it possible to get the microsoft point back on my account?</p>

<p>Hey Zeitgeist,<br />
<br />
Btw, I love your GT.<br />
<br />
Hmmm, there are a couple other things we can try if none of the above solutions helped:<br />
<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>If you are able, try downloading the game to a different storage device (a USB drive or a friend's console)
</li></ol>
<p><br />
OR<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Delete the partial Max Payne 3 download. </li><li>Download free content, like demos and game trailers, equal to the size of Max Payne 3 (maybe a little over)&nbsp;
</li><li>Redownload Max Payne from your download history. </li></ol>
<div><br />
<br />
Let us know if you get any of love from those and we'll go from there.</div>

<div>Chrome and Windows are fully updated; Windows thinks drivers are all up to date, as does Iobit Driver Booster and Drivermax for good measure.</div>
<div>I had tried upgrading the 3Gb of RAM up to 4Gb in the recent past which (almost goes without saying!) did not work, RAM replaced, I just mention this as I know dodgy sticks or socket can cause BSOD. Unsure if it started after I had the back off, it is
 possible.</div>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
The attached DMP file is of the <u><b>IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL (a)</b></u> bug check.<br />
<br />
<i>This indicates that Microsoft Windows or a kernel-mode driver accessed paged memory at DISPATCH_LEVEL or above.</i><br />
<br />
This bug check is issued if paged memory (or invalid memory) is accessed when the IRQL is too high. The error that generates this bug check usually occurs after the installation of a faulty device driver, system service, or BIOS.<br />
<br />
<i>LKbdFlt2.sys - Tue May 21 21:01:41 <u><b>2002</b></u><br />
<br />
LMouFlt2.sys - Tue May 21 21:02:00 <u><b>2002</b></u></i><br />
<br />
^^ As far as I know, these are really... really old Kaspersky drivers (2002!!!). Uninstall these ASAP -
<a href="http://support.kaspersky.com/common/service.aspx?el=1464" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.kaspersky.com/common/service.aspx?el=1464</a><br />
<br />
If the removal tool cannot find these to remove, we'll likely need to do it manually: C:\Windows\System32\Drivers find
<i>LKbdFlt2 and </i><i>LMouFlt2.sys </i>and rename both to .old after their names. This will stop them from loading.<br />
<br />
<i><b>If still crashing after the above, let's enable Driver Verifier:</b></i><br />
<br />
<br />
<b>What is Driver Verifier?</b><br />
<br />
Driver Verifier is included in Windows 8, 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 to promote stability and reliability; you can use this tool to troubleshoot driver issues. Windows kernel-mode
 components can cause system corruption or system failures as a result of an improperly written driver, such as an earlier version of a Windows Driver Model (WDM) driver.
<br />
<br />
Essentially, if there's a 3rd party driver believed to be at issue, enabling Driver Verifier will help flush out the rogue driver if it detects a violation.<br />
<br />
<b>Before enabling Driver Verifier, it is recommended to create a System Restore Point:</b><br />
<br />
Vista - START | type rstrui - create a restore point<br />
Windows 7 - START | type create | select "Create a Restore Point" <br />
Windows 8 - <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html</a><br />
<br />
<b>How to enable Driver Verifier:</b><br />
<br />
Start &gt; type "verifier" without the quotes &gt; Select the following options -<br />
<br />
1. Select - "Create custom settings (for code developers)"<br />
2. Select - "Select individual settings from a full list"<br />
3. Check the following boxes -<br />
- Special Pool<br />
- Pool Tracking<br />
- Force IRQL Checking<br />
- Deadlock Detection<br />
- Security Checks (Windows 7 &amp; 8)<br />
- DDI compliance checking (Windows 8)<br />
- Miscellaneous Checks<br />
4. Select&nbsp; - "Select driver names from a list"<br />
5. Click on the "Provider" tab. This will sort all of the drivers by the provider.<br />
6. Check EVERY box that is [B]NOT[/B] provided by Microsoft / Microsoft Corporation.<br />
7. Click on Finish.<br />
8. Restart.<br />
<br />
<b>Important information regarding Driver Verifier:</b><br />
<br />
- If Driver Verifier finds a violation, the system will BSOD.<br />
<br />
- After enabling Driver Verifier and restarting the system, depending on the culprit, if for example the driver is on start-up, you may not be able to get back into normal Windows because Driver Verifier will flag it, and as stated above, that will cause /
 force a BSOD.<br />
<br />
If this happens, do <b>not</b> panic, do the following:<br />
<br />
- Boot into Safe Mode by repeatedly tapping the F8 key during boot-up.<br />
<br />
- Once in Safe Mode - Start &gt; type "system restore" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- Choose the restore point you created earlier.<br />
If you did not set up a restore point, do not worry, you can still disable Driver Verifier to get back into normal Windows:<br />
<br />
- Start &gt; Search &gt; type "cmd" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- To turn off Driver Verifier, type in cmd "verifier /reset" without the quotes.<br />
・&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart and boot into normal Windows.<br />
<br />
<b>How long should I keep Driver Verifier enabled for?</b><br />
<br />
It varies, many experts and analysts have different recommendations. Personally, I recommend keeping it enabled for at least 24 hours. If you don't BSOD by then, disable Driver Verifier.<br />
<br />
<b>My system BSOD'd, where can I find the crash dumps?</b><br />
<br />
They will be located in %systemroot%\Minidump<br />
<br />
Any other questions can most likely be answered by this article:<br />

            <p>In addition to what Patrick has suggested and maybe he is interested in helping to confirm this:</p>
<p>you seem to having a malware issue on your system. I ran a list of the drivers that were loaded during the crash and found a couple that looked suspicious.<br />
<strong>funfrm.sys</strong></p>
<p><strong>at50am4n.SYS</strong></p>
<p><strong>b57nd60x.sys.( broadcomm driver)</strong></p>
<p>As for <strong>funfrm.sys</strong>, i've included a couple of links that might help you understand what you are dealing with. As for the othertwo, i dont know what to make of them except to say that they seem to be a collection of randomely generated letters
 and numbers and that is not good.<br />
I tried researching them but found nothing.</p>
<p>One dump file is usually not enough to confirm but just to be sure, scan your system thoroughly.</p>
<p>They are in bold letters below....FWIW</p>

    <title>Worst Customer Service Experience Ever - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Worst Customer Service Experience Ever</h2>
                    
<p>To whom this concerns,<br />
<br />
I have been waiting over a month for proper resolution for an issue that has become one of the worst customer service experiences I have ever had as a consumer.&nbsp; I have always had a loyalty to Xbox and have been a live member and purchaser for many years.&nbsp;
 Upon being asked by friends and family I have always promoted your brand and services as being better than the competition.&nbsp; But after all of the issues that I will be listing below as facts I am at the point where I will begin the process of auctioning off
 all of my games and consoles on ebay.&nbsp; To prove this point I have been a long time player of the Halo series and I sold off Halo 4 as the start to the rest of my thirty game collection with kinect.&nbsp; The main reason for my disgust is that my son for over six
 weeks has asked me Dad when can we play xbox together and I have to tell him I do not know since they won't tell me when I am going to get my controller.&nbsp; It seems that everyone I am dealing with at the call center is giving me a run around and saying there
 is nothing they can do for me other than direct me to Level 3 support who is a gentleman named Luis who has made many false representations and information to me as a loyal customer.&nbsp; I feel that I have been held hostage as a consumer and that I have no idea
 of how this many failures could happen at a world-class organization such as Microsoft.&nbsp; Hopefully someone can help me as I do not know what else to do, but to sell off all of my xbox belongings this upcoming Friday and purchase a PS3 as I have heard many
 positive experiences from people that have these systems.&nbsp; I am writing to you a detailed factual letter with all documented process failures that I have experienced with this situation, please scroll through the entire e-mail with examples below.<br />
<br />
<br />
To start I first called on Nov 8th 2012 to get resolution to a broken Kinect that died after a year and a broken Xbox 360 play and charge pictured below.&nbsp; The Kinect was not covered under warranty which I was disappointed about, but I understood the terms.&nbsp;
 My controller was covered because it fell with in the window purchase date.&nbsp; I was happy with this and the gentleman who was helping me was a real pleasure.&nbsp; He told me the process was simple but detailed I followed all of his instructions and shipped my controller
 off within a couple of days after the call.&nbsp; My controller as pictured below is a Special Edition Transforming D-pad play and charge controller $65 on Best Buy.com &nbsp;<br />

About two weeks passed by the email above clear stated that once we receive the product we will ship a replacement to you within ten working days.&nbsp; This however was never completed and I had tracking confirmation that it was sent and received by E Cantu on
 Nov 16th at 3:21pm. <br />
<br />
<br />
Nov 29th I was concerned and proceeded to call the xbox support line and I told them I believe that they lost my package at the center.&nbsp; They said do you have a tracking number I told them my they specific information signed by E Cantu on Nov 16th at 3:21pm
 and that my tracking number was at my office and I would not be back there until Monday, they said there was nothing they could do to help me without that tracking number.&nbsp; I ask if they were sure about that and can they at least start the process to find
 the misplaced package I would call back on Monday and give it to them, they said they could not set it up as misplaced.&nbsp; I later found out from a supervisor at the call center that this was not true. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
December 3rd I called back and provided the tracking number.&nbsp; I asked what the follow up process would be and the agent told me it would be 24-48 hours. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
December 6th I called back and they told me that it could take up to 12 days to get a response back from someone I asked to speak to a supervisor of the call center.&nbsp; The gentleman's name I believe was Joe, he seemed to be very knowledgable and helpful he informed
 me that that person who told me 1-2 days was not correct in the process and that it could take up to 12 days I explained to him my issues about the tracking number and the time I had to wait to start the process he said that should not of happened as well
 and was going to check the call scripts and provide training to improve customer experience. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
December 8th I received the following e-mail from Luis from Xbox Customer Care level three:<br />

<br />
I was confused on why Luis had said once it leaves our center when two days prior he said it would be sent immediately.&nbsp; This is the point where I started to get concerned with lack of urgency on Luis's end with deal with an issue that was well beyond the ten
 day promise written in the initial e-mail repair request.<br />
<br />
December 12 still no request from Luis and I am very disappointed and concern so I call the Xbox Support line again.&nbsp; Ask to be transferred to a manager in hopes I can get someone to help me.&nbsp; I get in touch with an gentleman David, has english accent who provided
 me great assurance that this was not the normal process that this was in fact very disappointing and that he would help me the best he could find resolution.&nbsp; He also noted that I should receive something as far as points or live month memberships codes in
 for my time lost with the multiple follow ups and time waiting on hold.<br />
<br />
December 13 11:30am CST - Luis gives me a call to inform me that he was out of stock of my controller and that it was not able to be sent.&nbsp; He said he had an alternative controller a wireless Call Of Duty Modern Combat 3 controller.&nbsp; I told him I really needed
 my type of my controller back as I like the feel of it, and he said there was nothing he could do, that this was the best alternative and this was a special controller offered with consoles.&nbsp; I did a quick check on Best Buy.com and found the controller was
 priced at $49.99.&nbsp; I explained that he has made me wait all this time and climb through hoops spent countless hours calling the call center for status updates and he was downgrading me on controllers when I was promised on my initial call that I would be matched
 or upgraded if it was out of stock.&nbsp; He said sir oh you have the play and charge controller, I told him yes I sent all that to them and it was noted in the first call specifically.&nbsp; I asked to then speak with Luis's supervisor and he told me that I could not
 that he was the end of the line.&nbsp; I asked him could he send me two regular wireless controllers ($39.99 at Best Buy) since this has gotten out of hand.&nbsp; He said he did not know if he could do that, he promised me he would call me back that afternoon and let
 me know the resolution.&nbsp; They day went by Luis never called me back.<br />

December 13th - Evening-&nbsp; I called the Microsoft company line back in attempt to find Luis or someone who can help me.&nbsp; Gretchen the call operator was fantastic as far as directing me to write to you at *** Email address is removed for privacy *** she ensured me that this would get
 to Microsoft executives.<br />
<br />
December 13th Evening - David told me to call him back if I had any issues.&nbsp; I spoke with the call center agent who said I could not speak with him, I told her that David said any issues I could speak with him again.&nbsp; They put me through to David who seemed
 displeased that this occurred.&nbsp; He said that he would follow up on this once again and was surprised that Luis would put his supervisor in contact with me.&nbsp; That he wish he could send me the controller, but could not from where he was.&nbsp; He said that he was
 following up on this that I would receive a follow up phone call from him to check in to see if this was resolved personally.&nbsp; I told him I was very disappointed that could I have him send me my request notes so I can copy and paste them into an e-mail to
 Microsoft as I knew this would be a lengthly process he said he could not do it but trust that everything would be documented.&nbsp; He also asked if Luis mentioned giving something for my troubles I told him he did not.&nbsp; I told David that like I told many others
 on here all I was is resolution and a controller and not be downgraded as I feel that this has been terrible as my son is asking me every day when are we going to play Xbox and I have to hell him I do not know.&nbsp; That this has upset me so much that I begun
 auction off my games and will continue to auction off my items until this upcoming Friday if this has not been resolved I will auction off my console.&nbsp; I will then take the money and buy a PS3 and multiple games proceed to take a picture and sent it to Microsoft
 and that I need to take control back as a consumer.&nbsp; That there are many choices as far as gaming and I will not choose to do business with a company that does not care about their long standing loyal customers.&nbsp; David ensured me he would contact me back.&nbsp;
 I auction off my Halo 4 game which I will not be buying maps for or spending any more money towards Microsoft I am including proof of that auction here to show that I am serious about no longer being a customer and going to a competitor.<br />

December 14th - No response<br />
<br />
December 15th - Attempted to call the customer support center for the final time.&nbsp; I asked what do I have to do to get a controller or my controller back get a lawyer and sue?&nbsp; I asked to speak with David was told that could not happen and that I can send a
 letter to Xbox Legal Group&nbsp; Attn: Xbox One Microsoft Way Redmond, WA 98052.&nbsp; I hope this is not the route I have to take and/or contact the media with this situation, but this has to be the most bizarre thing I have ever went through.<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope that that reaches the right level as I have lost all good faith in Microsoft customer service and I feel there are deceptive business practices going on in hopes that I give up and this problem will go away for your company.&nbsp; While I do know that might
 be an assumption on my part I do not know what else to think after the way I have been treated and as a father who enjoys gaming with the son and can not for over six weeks can say just wanting a quick controller swap out.&nbsp; If you feel the need to respond
 to me I would prefer a phone call from someone who can take action and give resolution, not more run around at my cell phone 630-715-4194.&nbsp; I hope this comes before Friday as that will be my drop dead date with this situation and me being a consumer of Microsoft
 products as a consumer, I do have choices.<br />

<p>[quote user="MR GRUMBLE"]I have been waiting over a month for proper resolution for an issue that has become one of the worst customer service experiences I have ever had as a consumer.[/quote]If this is the worst you've ever had, consider yourself lucky.[quote]I
 have always promoted your brand and services as being better than the competition.[/quote]Why?&nbsp;Why shill for Microsoft if you've no experience with the other players in the market.[quote]But after all of the issues that I will be listing below as facts I am
 at the point where I will begin the process of auctioning off all of my games and consoles on ebay.[/quote]Hold on, a $65 list price controller breaks and you decide to chuck a $2100 investment in games?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's not what I'd call reasonable behavior.[quote]Hopefully someone can help me as I do not know what else to do,[/quote]Buy a replacement sliver&nbsp;special edition controller from Best Buy and slap a Product&nbsp;Replacement Plan on it from Best Buy if it is
 that critical that you have the soft shell feel of that&nbsp;controller. That way when it breaks again, Best Buy will replace it without any fuss.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the vein of the transformable d-pad controllers, I own the special edition silver controller, MW3, GoW, Halo 4, and C-3PO controllers. I also own/have&nbsp;owned several original style&nbsp;controllers, including white, black w/grey, red, olive, Halo UNSC, Halo&nbsp;Covenant
 glossy, and Halo Reach. While the silver ones are unique in feel, the MW3 controller, while different, is also very comfortable. The MW3 controller happens to be my mainstay at this point.[quote] purchase a PS3 as I have heard many positive experiences from
 people that have these systems.[/quote]Heh, ok. I own two original 60GB PS3s with PS2 backwards compatability and a late model slim PS3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All original PS3s are defective in that their Bluetooth antenna gain is too low. Combine that with SIXAXIS controllers and they like to half-disconnect every so often, where that's anywhere from 45min to several hours. Sony never offered a fix. Sony never
 told people who sent in consoles in RMA (like me) that there was no fix. The only actual fix is to move to a DualShock 3 controller, something Sony never offered as free to owners of the affected consoles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The late model PS3 (was in a CoD bundle) has developed a rather annoying fan noise. It's out of warranty, and models released this year don't support Blu-ray over Component, so I'm a bit stuck with no recourse but to live with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS3 game installs are partials, not full. Play MGS4 and you'll "install" five times while playing, 10 minutes per install. DLC from the PSN marketplace? First you have to download it, then install it outside the store. It's incredibly inconvenient. PS Plus
 is practically a required add-on as both console and game updates take considerably longer than the 360.&nbsp;PS+ only covers auto-update of ONE console per account. Finally, content can only be used on two consoles at any given time..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yeah... the grass isn't greener on the other side of the fence.[quote]I am writing to you a detailed factual letter with all documented process failures that I have experienced with this situation, please scroll through the entire e-mail with examples below.[/quote]You
 know what you should do? Ask for an MW3 controller and a black P&amp;C kit to replace the Silver Special Edition. That would square things and it's something they can provide.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And ask for it in January, AFTER the holiday shipping rush is over.</p>

<p>Things happen in big companies. From the sounds of it most of the people that you've dealt with did a good job. It was the process that failed. I would not abandon Xbox Live though. It's by far the best service out of the three. If you have the means why
 not purchase two controllers so that you and your son can continue enjoying games together? Selling off your Xbox games and related equipment isn't going to change anything.</p>
<br />
Continue pursuing a resolution to this issue by first demanding that some track down the controller that you sent in. Someone signed for it and that is where they need to start.

<p>I feel for the OP. I went through a few similar experiences with Xbox's Customer Support. I also attempted to swear off Xbox forever, but I am a weak man. I am even replacing my older model with a Slim, that's how weak my will was to stay away from the siren
 like call of Xbox. (My wife laughs at me for this, throwing my quotes of rage and anger back in my face. "Oh, I'm done with Xbox he says. I'll take a blowtorch to it and be done with he says." Then she snickers as I sit a broken man, booting up my Xbox for
 cold comfort.)</p>
<p>I can understand wanting to take back some control as a consumer and wish the OP the best.</p>
<p>Now, I must return to the Xbox and the hypnotic lands of Pandora.</p>

<p>Like any company or corporation there is always a chain of command so to say, If you feel that your needs are not being met at that lvl you can always go to the next lvl above that one. Sometimes you might run into a situation were you are not being transfered
 to the supervisor or the individual you are speaking with or are being told that that is not possible, Do not frett just keep well documented copies of your conversations, be sure to include names, dates, and as much detail as to what was said. Sometimes you
 may have to skip a few steps and go over some heads to get somewhere with your issue. But I believe that Microsoft takes pride in there service, and care about the experiences of all their customers. So if it takes going strait to the top so be it you may
 not see imediate results but your issue will be taken care of in time and i would almost bet that you would be compensated for your troubles and your time spent trying to resolve your issue.

I have all three consoles. I've played all three online and used the bulk of the services that each offer. I've been a gamer since 1977 so I've been through every console generation. I've seen the industry grow by leaps and bounds with every "next gen". I was
 an original GAP member with the Playstation and a frequent contributor on the old NSider Nintendo boards. Xbox Live was the first service to get it right and it kept getting better with each iteration. Nothing is perfect but after using the services of all
 three I am more than happy with Xbox Live and will continue being a member.

After the reinstall that worked fine, however now im blocked from logging into my Xbox account, so i cant talk with friends or play xbox games...<br /><br />I get the message :We couldn't sign you in to Xbox Live; We can't sign you in to Xbox Live right now. Try again in a while. If that doesn't work, we have a few ideas that might help fix the problem."&nbsp;Error Code: 0x80070520... clicking the code directs me to the xbox code support with 0 results.

However, i had absolutely no problem logging into my alternate account, worked right off the bat!<br /><br />I know one solution is probably "reinstall windows", but seriously... how many times do i have to reinstall windows 10 before things work properly?&nbsp;Since W10 w

            <p>In the guide, with Spotify running and playing music (and maybe with a game in "focus" on screen), click on the Spotify icon and you'll get some media controls. It sounds like your volume balance is set all the way towards the music end of the scale; bring it back towards game volume (the controller icon) and you should, hopefully, start hearing game audio again.</p><p><br /></p><p>Let us know how you get on with this.</p>
