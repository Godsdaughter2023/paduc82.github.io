<h2>            Windows 7 backup is much larger than my source files.</h2>
                    
<p>I have a new Dell Precision M6500 running Windows 7 pro 64 bit. Hard drive is 500GB and I've configured the Backup and Restore feature to backup to an extrnal eSata 500GB hard drive.</p>
<p>I'm only backing up my "library" data folders which probably account for about 150GB. However, very quickly the 500GB external drive becomes full</p>
<p>After the backup apparently runs for a few hours I get the message:"</p>
<p>"Check Backup disk space - the disk that your backups are being saved on doesn't have enough free space".</p>
<p>I click options, manage backup disk space it says I can free up disk space by deleting data file backups but there is only one "backup period" listed</p>
<p>Under backup setup I have verified that only a 150GB set of data files are checked to be backed up and the "include a system image of drives" is not checked</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
<span><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Now under &nbsp;<span><strong>Data
 file backup</strong></span>, click&nbsp;<span><strong>View backups</strong></span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Now you would see list of backup set entry for each full backup, this should the entries of what was backed up.</span></p>
<p><span>You should also see the data set that was being backed up, do you find any new data that was set by the options?</span></p>

    <title>Microsoft charging for LIVE accounts you aren&#38;&#35;39&#59;t using - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microsoft charging for LIVE accounts you aren&#38;&#35;39&#59;t using and making it impossible to cancel your account online.</h2>
                    
<p>So, I canceled (or so I thought) this account ages ago. I recently noticed a charge on my credit card for $9.99 from Microsoft. It didn't take me long to realize they were "auto-charging" me for an account that I don't even have on my xbox! I tried to cancel
 it here (online), but it won't let you. You have to call to get it cancelled. Well guess what? The "help center" is closed. Some of us overseas don't have all day to try and get a hold of someone just to keep from being fleeced. If someone from LIVE SUPPORT
 (what a joke) reads this, I want this account cancelled, and a refund for tall the months you charged me when I wasn't even using this account!</p>

<p>You guys purposely make it a HUGE pain in the butt to cancel these accounts. It's borderline unethical.</p>

<p>Why should Microsoft refund you for your mistake. </p>
<p>And considering that Iraq isn't a region that supports Xbox LIVE, you should not have an Xbox LIVE account.</p>
<p>Please see this clicky for a list of supported countries:</p>

<p>Please don't accuse or assume it was this end users mistake without all the facts present and on the table.</p>
<p>I've seen varying accounts to similar problems and have personally found it very difficult to cancel auto-renewal via credit card; short of requesting an outright cancellation of a subcription without promise of refund. &nbsp;In my particular case I had to request,
 twice, a refund of a subscription cancellation request to remove the credit card on file -- as a result of what was an unauthorized access to my account. &nbsp;I had to fight for it -- simply to get MY card off of MY account because *I* didn't want it there anymore
 and I wanted the choice to let the subscription lapse when that expiration date/time arrived (a year+ from now).</p>

<p>I am not assuming anything, I am merely working on the facts:</p>
<p>Gamer Profile states he is in Iraq, a country not supported by Xbox LIVE</p>
<p>"Thinking" you have done something does not make it happen</p>
<p>Calling Microsoft "thieves", and stating that what they are doing is unethical, just because they offer Auto-Renewal to simplify the gaming experience of many gamers, is completely unjustified, just because that person did not read the LIVE TOU</p>

<p>I'm in the US and I'm finding that there are alot of hoops to jump through just to get your subscription canceled. I came here sifting through similar posts while I sit here on hold.</p>
<p>Somehow I fear that I might be another of the horror stories that I'm reading here, but reading these posts is giving me a good idea of what to be wary of.</p>
<p>Kind of annoying seeing people like mart jump in and act like he has all the answers. It's all fun any games until it happens to you.</p>
<p>This is the only thing I've ever subscribed to online that I've been unable to UNsubscribe to, and it's quite ridiculous. I can speculate why that is, but I'm not going to.</p>

<p>Sabirwolf, I am not jumping in with all the answers, it is just that the OP posted with a bit of an attitude, and I posted my first comment a bit too soon after reading it. I was going to apologize for the harshness of what I had said, but then the troll
 Assassin2900 piped up, which just got me more worked up.</p>
<p>I do agree that Microsoft make people jump through a lot of hoops when it comes to subscriptions. I originally had a card on my account, and I got it removed by phoning customer support here in the UK. I don't know how different the call centre over in the
 US is compared to here, but they would usually let you remove it without to much hassle over the phone.</p>

<p>After filing a SR/UA in September and specifically demanding the credit card be removed; all support did was 'invalidate' the credit card for puchases. &nbsp;Whatever they did in the system flagged @ XBOX.COM that I had a billing issue and also flagged on the
 console. &nbsp;Between the day this flag was set, my account was "temporarily suspended" while the UA was investigated and then lifted - the card was re-validated. &nbsp;The same day my account suspension was removed by the PET, eight hours later, my account was jacked
 again. &nbsp;This time the intruder used a card that should not have been on the account in the first place, let alone in a valid state for purchasing, to purchase points via ZUNE in order to jack my gamertag. &nbsp;Getting a card off an active auto-renewal subscription
 is not as easy as asking for it. &nbsp;If it was, the most recent breach would not have resulted in where I am today... unauthorized charges, loss of a gamertag I had for NINE years.</p>
<p>I had to demand its removal. &nbsp;The first request was met with the same "I can invalidate it but if I remove it it will cancel your subscription". &nbsp;I was then informed that if I cancel my subscription then I am not entitled to any refund on the remaining balance.
 &nbsp;After arguing that my account had been hacked, attackers used the credit card on file to do what they did, after it was explicitly requested to be removed in September, that leaving the card on the account was not an option. &nbsp;They finally cancelled the account
 and informed me that a supervisor would e-mail me "within a day" a token code for the remaining unused portion of my subscription. &nbsp;Great news! &nbsp;Unfortunately that day came and went as well as an additional week. &nbsp;When I called back in to (1) inquire on my
 open SR/UA and (2) the refund/token code I was informed that SR/request for the token had been closed. &nbsp;Sigh. &nbsp;So during this call at least the representative was more helpful (almost too helpful) and during the call engaged a supervisor 'behind the scenes'
 (or so he said -- will have to take him at his word) and issued me two token codes for the remaining balance of my subscription. &nbsp;Why wasn't this done in the first place?</p>

<h2>            Windows Live Mail - Not Responding</h2>
                    <p>A month back WLM became mildly sluggish. It's now to the point where the "not responding" takes ages. Also all past and current email have been converted to text / html attachments. I'm able to view email in webmail where all is fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've used WLM for ages. All folders contain important email. I backed up WLM (extension .fol) into a folder but have concerns that the back up contains the (botched) email containing the text / html attachments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've researched and attempted all on-line fix suggestions that aren't too geeky. None have worked. Please advise if there's something more I can try...thanks</p>

<p>A: Size = 579,680,493 Contains = 66,141 Files 858 Folders</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is as you predicted "too many". I previously already did (several times) a "delete browsing history". Why hasn't that cleaned out those 66,141 files? Or have I misunderstood?</p>

<p>You have moved TIF to a new location, then rebooted, but the program is still not working? Something else is wrong, then.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to be certain, please check that you have an (almost) empty TIF folder now: press Windows key&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eb8e8da0-771c-46ce-8fa6-61bd7bd550af" />&nbsp;+ R, type
<strong>shell:cache</strong> and press <em>Enter</em>. This should bring you to the current TIF folder - right-click on the folder name and select
<em>Properties </em>to see its size and the number of files it contains.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>A: Size = 579,680,493 Contains = 66,141 Files 858 Folders</p>
<p>It is as you predicted "too many". </p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is not 'far too many', though. I've seen cases where the affected user didn't complain until his TIF folder had reached 7
<em>giga</em>bytes and several hundred thousand files.</p>
<p>

            <p>Oh dear, I seem not to be explaining this very well. If the cache is still showing the same numbers, it must be&nbsp;the same folder as before. Because
<em>Delete browsing history </em>doesn't do a very good job of emptying the TIF folder, we have to use more extreme methods to rectify this problem. As I thought I'd made clear in my original reply, not every file in the TIF folder is the result of browsing
 the web. That's why I asked you to use the <em>Move folder </em>function, which will create a new, empty TIF folder. Reposting:

 On Windows 7, you should have Internet Explorer 11.</p>

            <p>Oh dear indeed! I followed your first steps exactly. I've "moved" them a 2nd time...allowing the system to manage the transfer right? I looked into the new location and there is nothing added. I also selected "properties / show hidden" and again nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a 3rd time to the same location to see if I got "do you want to replace files". It appears the old TIF with its history is still in the original.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows asked me "now log off to finish yes/no". So I've allowed the system to (again) re-boot. WLM still with issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope I'm not missing something obvious...</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE: the 4th "move folder/re-boot" generated a Windows update. When I opened WLM it took an eternity...far longer than it ever has and the problem still exists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE #2: The Windows update (I'm guessing) has now gone to worse. All docs spreadsheets etc are "read only" and I can't open or save. If I want to open/view I'm forced to "save as a copy"</p>

<p>Do you mean that the TIF folder isn't (almost) empty? I asked you to visit <strong>
shell:cache</strong> in an Explorer window, because this will take you to the current TIF folder wherever it may be and whatever its name. If the cache still contains tens of thousands of files, then your
<em>Move folder&nbsp;</em>has not been successful for some reason. What is the location of the TIF folder according to Internet Options &gt;
<em>General &gt; Settings &gt; </em><em>Current location</em>?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>UPDATE: the 4th "move folder/re-boot" generated a Windows update</p>
</blockquote>
<p>None of these manoeuvres has any connection to Windows Update. You may coincidentally have run into a Windows Update requiring a reboot. This shouldn't have any effect on what we're doing, unless there's a CSU for Internet Explorer involved. There shouldn't
 be ...</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>.... the problem still exists.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will persist until you clear some space in the TIF folder for the program to create its temporary files. This will only happen if you create a new, empty TIF folder by following the instructions I've given.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>All docs spreadsheets etc are "read only" and I can't open or save.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is a completely unrelated problem for which you'll have to seek a remedy in the Office forums.&nbsp; When you do, please be sure to give full details of your situation - this means spelling out which version of Office you're having trouble with, on which
 operating system, and which updates (KB numbers) were installed immediately before the error arose.</p>

            <p>1. shell:cache takes me to Lea (my name). I open and scroll down to AppData/Local/Temp. The Temp file contains over 65,000 TIF plus others. The move option was not successful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Internet Options &gt; <em>General &gt; Settings &gt; </em><em>Current location </em>

            <p>I understood your "move" directions from the beginning. I did not put the new TIF folder anywhere near the old one. I've now attempted to move it 4 times all within the AppData/Local section.

<p>4. The old TIF continues to hold 65K files</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Troubleshoot camera connection problems<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Troubleshoot-camera-connection-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Troubleshoot-camera-connection-problems</a>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
You probably need to reload the camera drivers&nbsp;and any camera control software (usually included<br />
with the drivers and&nbsp;installed at the same time).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Logon as Admin.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Imaging - write down make and model of camera - double click<br />
on it and on driver's tab get version. Now click Update Drivers (which may not do anything as MS<br />
is far behind certifying drivers). The RIGHT CLICK on the camera - UNINSTALL - REBOOT - this<br />
will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site and download the latest camera driver and other related camera<br />
software (if no newer get the same ones).<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to them and RIGHT CLICK - RUN AS ADMIN - reboot after each driver.<br />
<span><br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers.<br />

<br />
<span>Installing and updating drivers in 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above is preferred<br />
to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />

</span><span><br />
Then leave windows updates on however stop it from loading drivers which are often older than the<br />
ones you have installed. If Updates suggests a driver then HIDE it and look manually to see if their<br />
really is a newer one (at both system maker and device maker's sites).<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 development environment unavailable</h2>
                    <p>Hello team,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been trying to download Windows 10 VM for few days right now from the following link:</p>
<p>https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/virtual-machines</p>
<p>
</p><p>it keep getting the following message:</p>
<p>The Windows 10 Virtual Machines for developers are currently unavailable. We are working to quickly restore availability.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted support and they told me that it is under maintenance and there is no ETA for it to be up again.&nbsp; They also suggested to post the question here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea when it will be up again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,&nbsp;</p>

            Hi there, thanks for your question.
<br />
<br />Your guess is as good as ours! If Microsoft Support don't have an ETA then there's no real way to tell when it'll be up again.
<br />
<br />You could try contacting support again through different channels to see if you get a different answer:

<p><span>Hi Bowtynut,</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Scenario 1:</span></strong><span>To fix the issue Spooler Subsystem Application has stopped
 working</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 1:</strong> Run the Fix-it and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Printing problems and printing errors</span></span></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/printing_problems/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/mats/printing_problems/en-us</span></a></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 2:</strong></span></span><span>Follow the steps given below in order to fix
 the issue.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Go to Programs
 and Features in Control panel &gt; click Turn Windows features on or off.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click + sign
 of Print services.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Select LPD</span><span>
 (Line Printer Daemon)</span><span>and LPR (Line Printer Remote protocol). You should remove Internet Printing Client.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Restart your
 computer to ensure there is no error of spooler service.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>5.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Add your
 printer driver again.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Now, add the printer using add printer wizard. You can follow the steps in the link below.</span></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>Find and install printer drivers</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Find-and-install-printer-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Find-and-install-printer-drivers</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>You may also refer the below article for more information.</span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>Scenario 2:</span></span></strong><span><span><span>To
 empty the print queue, stop the Print Spooler service and remove all pending print files.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>You cannot delete any queued print jobs while the Print Spooler Service is running.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>To stop the Print Spooler Service:</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>Click
 Start, Run and in the box type ‘services.msc’.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>Click
 OK to open the Services Applet.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>Locate
 the Print Spooler Service, right click it and choose to stop the Service.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Using Windows Explorer, navigate to the following folder (assuming Windows is installed on your C drive):</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>C:\WINDOWS\system32\spool\PRINTERS</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>Delete
 all the queued print jobs in the PRINTERS folder (select and delete all the files) so the PRINTERS folder is devoid of pending print jobs.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>5.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>Restart
 your system to be sure everything is cleared up and that the Print Spooler Service restarts automatically on reboot.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Now that you know how to get into the Services Applet, you can check and be sure The Status column of the Print Spooler
 Service is "Started" and that the folder where spooled print jobs go is really empty (until you print something else).</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this helps!</span></span></p>

    <title>Major Graphics Bug on Windows 10 and Surface 3 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ray_ray_ray  say:</h3>
<h2>            Major Graphics Bug on Windows 10 and Surface 3</h2>
                    <p>brand new Surface 3, installed very latest windows 10, all the updates.</p>
<p>device just stands on the table, then suddenly the screes TOTALLY screws up, the screen is like moving to the right, wrapping around and reappearing from the left again! See on the photo: What should be on the very right side, is on the LEFT of the screen!!
 This changes every few seconds, and moreover the colors go crazy, again changing like every few seconds! On the photo, that picture should be blue! To move the mouse to the left portion of the screen, one has to move over the right edge so the cursor reappears
 from the left of the screen, but when using the touch, I have to tap the screen on the position where the icon actually SHOULD be positioned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is completely unusable, what is going on here???</p>
<p>

</p><p>Do you have another monitor you could attach or can you connect using Remote Desktop?&nbsp; That way you could determine where the problem symptom originates.&nbsp; I wonder what the consequence of trying to use Pen calibration when your screen is in that state would
 be.&nbsp; Perhaps it could adapt to a discrepancy that way?&nbsp; Otherwise, I don't know of any tools for the Surface which could help you adjust its Display.&nbsp; There used to be some from Intel but MS removed them.</p>

<p>Happens also when playing a local file in "movie and tv app" but not with windows media player, vlc also ok.</p>
<p>On top of it all: Happens just when using the camera app and the back camera, but not when using the front camera!</p>

            Hi Noel
<br />
<br />Can you try upgrading to Windows 10 1809 to see if this problem is resolved?
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-upgrade-to-windows-10-creators-update/617a37da-8fc0-4f33-a3eb-59fe9082f925">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />I would also try running Disk Cleanup.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: cleanmgr.exe
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Try cleaning up through there. 
<br />
<br />Also try disabling Fast startup before restarting.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Power options
<br />Click Additional power settings under Related settings
<br />Click Choose what the power button does
<br />Click Change settings that are currently unavailable
<br />Uncheck 'Turn on fast startup (recommended)
<br />
<br />Click Save changes.
<br />
<br />Click Restart now and see if it works.

<h2>            Xbox 360 Slim keeps turning off randomly during gameplay</h2>
                    
<p>Please help me I can't play for more than 15 minutes cause my 360 keeps shutting off while I play<br />
I have tried the following:</p>
<p>&gt;Removing all the wires on the 360 and power brick then putting them back on<br />
&gt;Plugging the 360 directly to the socket<br />
&gt;Plugging it to another power source</p>
<p>Note:<br />
&gt; There is no beeping sound it just suddenly turns off without warning<br />
&gt; No more warranty<br />
&gt; Power brick is cool<br />
&gt; 360 is cool<br />
&gt; The power brick is blowing and sucking air out&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Okay i know this may seem silly but do you have a Family Timer on the console? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong><strong>The
 way you can check this is by scrolling across to the Family tab on your Xbox Dashboard, click Family Settings, if the content controls are set as off then it can't be the Family Timer but if they are on then please could you scroll down to were it says Family
 timer and click on it. Once your on the Family timer tab there is 2 tabs that say Daily and Weekly and another one that says off and Family timer off and set clock and continue.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What i would like you to do is if Daily, or Weekly are checked uncheck them and click on off which is below Weekly, when i looked through the times there was one for the time slot of 15 minutes.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Please could you provide more details of how you got on and what happens when your console turns off, are you able to switch it straight back on?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Hope this helps&nbsp;</p>
<p>Happy Gaming!</p>

<p>I think it could be the Family settings as your console isn't showing no signs of needing a repair</p>
<p>Everything seems perfectly fine, so it must be the console settings.</p>

<p>Thank you for your suggestion mw x but I'm the only who uses my console and I've had it for about a year now. Fortunately I have found a fix. When my 360 turned off again I immediately removed it from the plug then pushed the power button. Then I just plugged
 it back in and I was able to play normally again. Thanks again for your help</p>

                    For the last two days when I am online my computer has been running very slowly and I get this pop up that says "msa.exe" and states that there was an error and the program must close.&nbsp; It also says that they are looking for a solution to the problem but
 nothing ever comes up.&nbsp; My internet freezes and closes unexpectedly and everything else is just really slow.&nbsp; I've run virus scans and malware scans and everything comes back clean.&nbsp; I've cleaned out my temp files and am not sure what to do now.&nbsp; Please help.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you Malkeleah, your suggestions helped and everything is fine now.&nbsp; I have changed my virus software to Avast and that seems to be working much better.&nbsp; I appreciate your help!!

            I don't know what tools you used to scan but your computer is infected. The msa.exe file belongs to the MS Antivirus rogue antivirus program.<br />
<br />
<span>It is called "rogue" because it pretends to be A Good Guy but is really Evil. Do not pay them!<br />

SuperAntiSpyware</a> will often do the job. Both have free versions and you do not need to purchase these programs.<br />
<br />
These may work for you and all may be well. However, in many cases the computer will also be infected with Zlob and/or Vundo trojans and protected by a rootkit. These machines are extremely difficult to clean.<br />
<br />
If your machine is one of these cases, either get guided help at one of the specialty forums below OR back up your data and do a clean install of Windows. It is your choice. If you are unsure how to back up your data or how to do a clean install, you can take
 your machine to a local computer professional. I don't recommend using BigComputerStore/GeekSquad types of places.<br />

<h2>            Encoding VHS videos to WMV via Avermedia Windows Media Encoder 9 audio issue</h2>
                    
<p>Shot in the dark here, but I bought an Avermedia Hybrid USB tuner/capture device to convert old VHS tapes to e format. I've tried a couple different ways but am liking the WME9, except.....</p>
<p>My Avernedia does composite, video and L&amp;R, yet when I select a audio device I only have system default, so I end up having to split the audio off and run it into line in.</p>
<p>Everything else, MCE, and Avertheater pick up audio through composite, so the device is fine.</p>
<p>Any ideas on how I can either get WME9 to see my tuner as an audio device, or force it to grab the audio along with the video?</p>

<p><span><span>Hi Thorsteenster,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Try installing the hardware and see if you are able to add the tuner as audio device.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Or you may try to add it as a device in Windows Encoder 9.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may also make the USB capture device the default audio recording device if it shows up in the Sound window from the Control
 Panel. Follow the below steps: </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click
 start, in the search box type in Sound</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Open
 the Sound tab, select Playback tab</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Right
 click on the device</span></span></p>

<p>
<span><br />
Welcome to Microsoft Answers!!!</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>You can start the Disk Cleanup tool by running Cleanmgr.exe, or by clicking
<strong>Start</strong>, pointing to <strong>Programs</strong>, pointing to <strong>
Accessories</strong>, pointing to <strong>System Tools</strong>, and then clicking
<strong>Disk Cleanup</strong>. Disk Cleanup supports the following command-line switches:
</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span>/d
<em>driveletter</em>:</span></strong><span> - This switch selects the drive that you want Disk Cleanup to clean. Note that the
<strong>/d</strong> switch is not used with <strong>/sagerun:<em>n</em></strong>.
</span></li><li><strong><span>/sageset:<em>n</em></span></strong><span> - This switch
 displays the <strong>Disk Cleanup Settings</strong> dialog box and creates a registry key to store the settings you select. The
<em>n</em> value is stored in the registry and allows you to specify different tasks for Disk Cleanup to run. The
<em>n</em> value can be any integer value from 0 to 65535. To get all the available options when you are using the
<strong>/sageset</strong> switch, you may need to specify the drive letter that contains the Windows installation.</span>
</li><li><strong><span>/sagerun:<em>n</em></span></strong><span> - This switch
 runs the specified tasks that are assigned to the <em>n</em> value by using the <strong>
\sageset</strong> switch. All drives in the computer will be enumerated, and the selected profile will be run against each drive.<br />
<br />
For example, in Scheduled Tasks, you could run the following command after running the
<strong>cleanmgr /sageset:11</strong> command:</span> </li></ul>
<p><span>cleanmgr /sagerun:11
</span></p>
<p><span>This command runs Disk Cleanup with the options that were specified with the
<strong>cleanmgr /sageset:11</strong> command. </span></p>
<p><span>The available options for Disk Cleanup that you can specify by using the
<strong>/sageset</strong> and <strong>/sagerun</strong> switches include: </span>
</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Temporary Setup Files - These files should no longer be needed. They were originally created by a Setup program that is no
 longer running.</span> </li><li><span>Downloaded Program Files - Downloaded program files are ActiveX controls and Java programs that are downloaded automatically
 from the Internet when you view certain pages. They are temporarily stored in the Downloaded Program Files folder on your hard disk. This option includes a
<strong>View Files</strong> button that allows you to see the files that would be removed. The button opens the C:\Winnt\Downloaded Program Files folder.</span>
</li><li><span>Temporary Internet Files - The Temporary Internet Files folder contains Web pages that are stored on your hard disk for quick
 viewing. Your personalized settings for Web pages are left intact. This option includes a
<strong>View Files</strong> button that displays the files to be deleted. The button opens the C:\Documents and Settings\<em>Username</em>\Local Settings\Temporary Internet Files\Content.IE5 folder.
</span></li><li><span>Old Chkdsk Files - When Chkdsk checks your disk for errors, it might save lost file fragments as files in your disk's root
 folder. These files are unnecessary and can be removed.</span> </li><li><span>Recycle Bin - The Recycle Bin contains files you have deleted from your computer. These files are not permanently removed
 until you empty the Recycle Bin. This option includes a <strong>View Files</strong> button that opens the Recycle Bin.</span>
</li><li><span>Temporary Files - Programs sometimes store temporary information in a Temp folder. Before a program quits, it usually deletes
 this information. You can safely delete temporary files that have not been modified in over a week.</span>
</li><li><span>Temporary Offline Files - Temporary offline files are local copies of recently used network files that are automatically
 cached for you so that you can use them when you are disconnected from the network. There is a
<strong>View Files</strong> button that opens the Offline Files folder.</span> </li><li><span>Offline Files - Temporary files are local copies of network files that you specifically made available offline so that you
 can use them when you are disconnected from the network. There is a <strong>View Files</strong> button that opens the Offline Files folder.</span>
</li><li><span>Compress Old Files - Windows can compress files that you have not used in a while. Compressing the files saves disk space
 while still enabling you to use them. No files are deleted. Because files are compressed at different rates, the displayed amount of disk space you will gain is approximate. There is an
<strong>Options</strong> button that you can use to specify the number of days to wait before an unused file is compressed.</span>
</li><li><span>Catalog Files for the Content Indexer - The Indexing service speeds up and improves file searches by maintaining an index
 of the files on the disk. These files are left over from a previous indexing operation and can be deleted safely.</span>
</li></ul>
<p>
<span>If you select the drive that contains the Windows installation, all of these options are available on the
<strong>Disk Cleanup</strong> tab. If you select any other drive, only the <strong>
Recycle Bin</strong> and <strong>Catalog files for content index</strong> options are available on the
<strong>Disk Cleanup</strong> tab. <br />
<br />
The <strong>More Options</strong> tab contains options for cleaning up Windows components or installed programs. You can use the
<strong>Windows Components</strong> option to create free space by removing optional Windows components that you do not use. Clicking the
<strong>Clean Up</strong> button for this option starts the Windows Components Wizard. You can use the
<strong>Installed Programs</strong> option to free more disk space by removing programs that you do not use. Clicking this
<strong>Clean Up</strong> button starts the <strong>Change or Remove Programs</strong> option in the Add/Remove Programs tool.</span></p>

<blockquote>But does running these commands only clean up the users files or does it include what pressing the "clean up system files" button on the Windows 7 version would do?</blockquote>
Hi philbill<br />
<br />
I don't think the clean up system files options&nbsp;can be supported from a scheduled task.<br />
<br />
Using the 'Clean up system files' gives you 2 extra options.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The capability to select and&nbsp;uninstall software programs and System Components&nbsp;from the Programs and Features/Uninstall or Change a Program list in the Control Panel, obviously cannot be defined in a&nbsp;scheduled task.<br />
<br />
It also gives you the option to delete all but the&nbsp;most recent&nbsp;System Restore points and Shadow Copies. Performing this procedure from a command line requires a separate set of commands using 'vssadmin delete shadows'. Using these commands would require entering
 each unique&nbsp;ID number from the current list of system restore points.<br />
<br />
<br />
Each of these options would require specific user interaction.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />
<span>Thank You for using Windows 7

<h2>            Stuck At Just A Moment&#33; Please Help&#33;</h2>
                    Hi. I have a pc that runs windows 10 and recently (and by recently I mean about 4 months ago) I deleted everything on my pc because I got many viruses on it, to the point where the pc started to slow down. After I restarted it the pc worked for a while&nbsp;but
 then took me to the troubleshooting screen every time I booted it up. I decided to reinstall everything again to make my pc work again. I went through the questions but suddenly the pc stayed on the just a moment screen. I decided to restart the laptop just
 to make it function again but sadly every time I boot up the pc now it shows the just a moment screen then turns black. Can someone please help?

<h2>            Windows 10 compatability</h2>
                    A compatability check on my Acer Aspire V3-571 tells me that I may have a problem, after upgrade to Windows 10, with connecting to the internet as it is not compatable with my Broadcom Virtual Wireless Adapter. Will there be a driver in the upgrade to
 rectify this?

</p><p>Microsoft's compatibility database is continually being updated with new data. What you can do is periodically run another scan to see if the database has updated information about your hardware. Even though you might get this message, you can always run
 Windows Update after installing Windows 10 and download the latest driver too. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently installed Windows 10 on an HP Elitebook to see how well the most recent Windows 10 build performs. The Elitebook is a fairly recent model notebook which includes an assortment of hardware technologies. Out of the box though I did not get a complete
 system, for instance the Intel HD Graphics 3000 was not detected and I was instead limited to the Microsoft Basic Display Adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apart from this, I had wi-fi ready, which meant, I could connect to the Internet right away.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Installing drivers through Windows Update</strong></p>
<p>Windows Update is the premier starting point to resolve most common driver issues you might experience immediately after installing Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simply launch it from <strong>Start </strong>&gt; <strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>
Update and Security </strong>and click <strong>Check for Updates</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Click Check for updates (make sure you have an active Internet connection). </p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/356e5aaa-e88c-420d-b273-f782bbda49bb" /></p>
<p>Immediately, Windows Update will detect your system configuration and download all the appropriate drivers for your system. As you can see in the above screenshot, my Intel HD 3000 Graphics was installed automatically. I did not even have to reboot the system.
 In addition to that other hardware components were also detected and installed which includes my LAN adapter and card reader.</p>

<p>f you've forgotten your Windows password, there are several ways to retrieve or reset it:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If your PC is on a domain, your system administrator must reset your password.</p>
</li><li>
<p>If you're using a Microsoft account, you can reset your password online. For more info, go to the
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=238656" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</li><li>
<p>If you're using a local account, use your password hint as a reminder.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>If you've tried these suggestions and still can't sign in:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you have <span>Windows&nbsp;8.1</span>, you'll need to reinstall Windows. </p>
</li><li>
<p>If you have <span>Windows&nbsp;RT&nbsp;8.1</span>, you'll need to contact your PC manufacturer.

<h2>            Halo&#58; ODST code never received for Master Chief Collection</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I purchased Halo: The Master Chief Collection on the Xbox store way back in July of 2015, but there was a period of time after when I was away from my Xbox and&nbsp;did not get a code for ODST when they were sent out. Any chance I can still get one? I have an order # for my Master Chief Collection.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Dustin</p>

<p><span>So having purchased it in July of 2015 means you were well outside the eligibility requirements to receive the DLC for free. It is available to purchase for $5 however and is well worth it at that price. :)</span></p>

    <title>upgraded intel 3945 to intel 5100, wifi disappears on existing user - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            upgraded intel 3945 to intel 5100, wifi disappears on existing user profile</h2>
                    I'm using Windows 7 Ultimate on a VAIO FE890.&nbsp; I replaced the internal Intel 3945agb card with an internal Intel 5100 card.&nbsp; When Windows starts up, the wifi light comes lights up on the physical switch on my laptop and stays until I log-in to my account,
 and then goes off.&nbsp; The troubleshooters and such tell me that the physical switch is off and it is not.&nbsp; I have toggled the switch on/off and the wifi interface does not seem to come back up.<br />
I enabled the guest account and tried from it and it works just fine, I can scan / connect just fine and the interface never goes away, until I log into my profile and then I need to restart to get wifi back.<br />
<br />
So it seems that there is some user-specific setting that is preventing me from connecting.. I guess my profile expects the card to be the 3945 and then errors out when its the 5100?&nbsp; Is there a way I can fix this without re-creating a new user profile?<br />
<br />
I guess I'll stick the old 3945 in for class tomorrow :/

            No integrity violations found.<br />
<br />
A few more symptoms:<br />
After I replaced the 3945, it did not initially work, I put my laptop to sleep and turned it on in the morning and it worked.&nbsp; After an hour of use, it disappeared--WLAN light was on, device manager showed it as enabled, but there was no signal strength in
 the taskbar/no SSIDs listed for wifi.&nbsp; I re-installed it via device manager and then ran the intel diagnostics which were not doing anything.&nbsp; Then wifi came back up for no reason that I can figure out.<br />
<br />
I have noticed one thing, after changing out the cards and booting, when I launch device manager Explorer.exe crashes and then restarts.&nbsp; Everytime.&nbsp; In fact, it happened after the wifi went down this morning.&nbsp; But I did not have to reboot to regain the WLAN
 interface.<br />
<br />
Edit: this is the entry (well like 300 entries) in the event log when Wifi goes down (with 3945)<br />
<br />
&nbsp; "The description for Event ID 5005 from source netw5v32 cannot be found. Either the component that raises this event is not installed on your local computer or the installation is corrupted. You can install or repair the component on the local computer.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; If the event originated on another computer, the display information had to be saved with the event.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; The following information was included with the event: <br />

<br />
&nbsp; The specified resource type cannot be found in the image file"<br />
<br />
Edit 2: It ended up being SONY's supplied wifi/bluetooth software switch disabling the new wifi card, uninstalled it and its working just fine.<br />
