<h2>            Pasting without line breaks</h2>
                    I'd like to copy and paste from say PDF documents to one note without preserving the line breaks.&nbsp; Pasting "keep text only" doesn't work since the line breaks count as characters.&nbsp; I'm aware there are websites which can remove them, but this is an extra
 step that seems unnecessary.&nbsp; Are there any solutions besides running it through an online tool?<br />

            Nope. There would be line breaks as the option "keep text only" removes formatting applied to the text which in turn creates that break.

<h2>            Outlook Calendar won&#39;t preview or print all  calendar items</h2>
                    <p>I am using MS Outlook Home and Student 2013, and was always able to print everything reflected on the calendar. Now, it will show calendar items, until I go to print preview, when many calendar items do not display or print.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This may be further&nbsp;complicated by being interfaced with my iPhone and AOL.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

 &nbsp;Why is only this address the only one that the message is being returned. &nbsp;

            <p>Hi bootsyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have received your private message. Since you are now having 2 issues, let's first try to resolve the message counter that you are seeing beside your Inbox folder. Yes, the message counter says that you have 1 unread message. You can try to sort your
 emails so that it would be easier to locate the specific email message. Try the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Sign in directly to https://mail.live.com</p>
<p>2. On the Inbox page, you will notice the word "View:" just below the "+New" button, click on it then select
<strong>Unread.</strong></p>
<p>3.&nbsp;It will then list all of your unread emails in that specific folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, for your bounce message:</p>
<p>
<strong>Possible Causes:</strong>
</p><ol>
<li>The message contains more than 250 attachments. More than 250 attachments cause the MAPI_E_TOO_BIG error.</li><li>Mail that had a malformed addr822 header was sent.</li></ol>
<strong>Troubleshooting:</strong>
<ol>

            <p>Hi Francis,</p>
<p>I went through all View categories as well as Unread and&nbsp;still cannot find the elusive inbox 1 message.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I haven't sent any attachments of late. Just regular email. I tried to send one out just now and still get the 'failer'</p>
<p>I honestly cannot find the 250 attachments. Could you further clarify this for me? I'm assuming 'attachments' sent to me or i've sent out are files, pictures,etc? If so I have deleted all attachments in my inbox list.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm honestly getting discouraged and would love a solution to why I cannot send out email without it bouncing back to me :(
</p>
<p>I wonder if I close this acct and remake the acct with same email address would the problem go away?</p>
<p />

            <p>Hello bootsyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We don't recommend closing your account as it will remove your emails&nbsp;and contacts. Also, you won't be able to re-create the account instantly. Let's sort this out, okay? Let me ask a few questions to further investigate. When is the last time you're able
 to send emails without getting an error? Did you make any recent changes to your account? Do you have an imported account? If yes, can you remove the imported account and try sending an email again? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll wait to your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>HI Joy, The last email I sent out without any problems would be more then a month ago.
</p>
<p>I believe it was google who imported all my accounts to this one. </p>
<p>The only changes I've made was trying to make another alias but didn't work to which i had to make another account with outlook instead of using my live acct.</p>
<p>There after I had problems thus kept on changing my password quite a few times.
</p>
<p>How do I remove the imported accts?</p>
<p>Thank you for helping me to solve my problem - it's been a while but at least we are trying to solve the problem</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

<h2>            Office 2008 migrated to new Mac won&#39;t open</h2>
                    <p>I purchased a new iMac and used the utility to move my applications and data from my old MacBook Pro to the iMac. &nbsp;The Office for Mac 2008 applications came over, but I cannot get them to run. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you initiate Word/Excel/Powerpoint you get a screen asking if you want to participate in the Customer Experience Improvement Program (I've checked Yes and No on different attempts and get the same results). &nbsp;"Continue" brings you to a Getting started
 screen with "Learn More" and "Register" choices. &nbsp;clicking "Learn More" takes you to the MS web site and gives you a "Server Error in '/mac' Application" message. &nbsp;Clicking on "Register" takes you to a "Thanks for Purchasing Office 2011" screen with a highlighted
 "Buy Now" button. &nbsp;I'm looking to use my existing 2008 version, not in buying a newer version. &nbsp;I see no link to register my Office 2008 product. &nbsp;If you go back to the Setup Asst program and click "Finish" on the "Getting Started" screen you go to a Microsoft
 Autoupdate screen. &nbsp;I check for an update, none is found, I click OK, and the updater quits but Word/ExcelPowerpoint is not running. &nbsp;No error message. No message about needing this or that. &nbsp;Just nothing. &nbsp;How do I get the applications in the Office for Mac
 2008 suite to run?</p>

            <p>What system are you using on you iMac Yosemite(10.10.02)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so you may have no choice but to bite the bullet&nbsp;and &nbsp;get a newer version. As the version numbers of Yosemite increase, so have the complaints about 2008 abilities to run. Its amazing it will even start any part. Much less to actually do anything. Technically
 2008 came out about the last quarter of 2007. That means it came out about the time when OSX.3 or 4 came out (PowerPC Machines) though Apple had just begun to switch over to intel.&nbsp;And Most applications from them needed Rosetta to operate.&nbsp;With System OSX.7
 Lion Rosetta license &nbsp;was not renewed from Developer and Most older apps quit working. Office was written in what was called Binary which meant that it was written in intel and PowerPC code so it could work on both. But because Rosetta tagged along for the
 ride They didn't necessarily have to convert 100%. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggestion though you may not like it is to subscribe to Office365 for $99.00 or $69.00 a Year. You will get Office2011, some space on OneDrive, and subscription to Skype. And when new Office 2015/(or 2016 or whatever it turns out to be) comes out you
 will automatically upgraded for free. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may or may not have to deal with Two-Factor authentication issues and periodic failure of the sign in Server, or Language and Region issues from time to time. But that's just what you have deal with with subscription service. Companies don't realize
 that it's more important than even maintain the main corporate computers to keep those
<p>
</p><p>Another alternative is learn to use Apple's on Pages, Numbers, Keynote and if you need to send to some one else export to Word, Excel, and PowerPoint Format. You will miss using niceties such as VBA and Macro's But I have survived until very recent not using
 either. And what&nbsp;I do use now I wouldn’t miss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or if you want something that looks more like Office, use one of the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Open Office</span> alternatives. &nbsp;I recommend LibreOffice and exporting to Office (docx, xlsx, pptx) Format. &nbsp;Then when Office does come on the scene if you want to avoid the subscription issue to buy permanent licensed version if you are allowed.</p>

            <p>Phillip,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply. &nbsp;The odd thing is that after upgrading my old Mac to Yosemite (10.10.2) the Office applications still run on it as they always have, they just don't run (can't get past the Set-Up and Update windows) on the new Mac those same applications
 were ported/transferred to (the new Mac is also running 10.10.2).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question on the 365 package - do you have to have an Internet connection for you applications to run (that seemed to be implied in your comments about keeping subscription servers up an running)? &nbsp;Also, I see 365 has Access in it. &nbsp;Does that now run on a
 Mac, and/or can a Mac access an Access database running on a PC?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Supposedly the way 365 is supposed to work you use the&nbsp;Internet to sign in Once a Month (not necessarily buy it again unless you pay moth to month. But The system every 30 days polls the install and receive a Phone home signal&nbsp;everything remains active.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem comes in that the activation /sig-in/phone home server from time to time dies.&nbsp;Could be for a few seconds, few minutes, few hours, day or so. If the Phone home signal is interrupted, or falls in the time this happens &nbsp;Then applications become
 deactivated and all you can do is look at your files you can't work on them.&nbsp;As for needing an&nbsp;Internet connection &nbsp;ever second supposedly not. But I've seen to many complaints that would Make it appear its realy supposed to work every second of every day.
 I read in the groups where College kids write or work on something in their room and go to class and can't use because&nbsp;there is no&nbsp;Internet in-between between the room and class to maintain connection or not in the classroom.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As For Access That strictly a Window version feature although if you have large enough Drive you can use Parallels to run windows and the windows version of Office on your Mac in which case you could use access.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the info on the license checking process. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Through less than a rigorous examination, I am coming to the conclusion that while 2008 Office applications may be able to run under Yosemite, that the Set Up program does not. &nbsp;Given the installed 2008 Office products still run on my older Mac that was
 upgraded to Yosemite, but when they were ported to my new Mac (running Yosemite from the get-go) the Set Up was initiated on the new Mac and fails. &nbsp;I ultimately had to upgrade to 365 to get the Office products working on the new Mac.</p>

<h2>            2 work numbers in contact card Skype For business</h2>
                    We have a user who has two work phone numbers listed in his contact card in Skype for Business. They are the same number but one is separated by hyphens the other is not separated at all (i.e. xxx-xxx-xxxx and xxxxxxxxxx). How can I get rid of the work
 phone number that is not separated by anything? He only has one work number listed in his Office 365 profile in the Admin Center.

            <p>That wasn't the exact answer but it did lead me to a solution so thank you!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution is in the Skype for Business app click the gear near the top left. Then select tools then options. Select "phones" on the left hand menu. If there are any phone numbers there, delete them by clicking work phone, clearing the text box, then selecting
 "ok". Select "ok" again. Close Skype for Business and make sure it is closed in the system tray as well. Then open back up and look at your contact card. It should be fixed.</p>

Hi All</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Until now it was possible to download the MSI version of Skype via the below URL:</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
<span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">http://www.skype.com/go/getskype-msi,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
<span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">But it seems like now it is not possible to download an MSI version of Skype anymore,</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
If trying to install the exe I get a message of&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">"Please install Skype from the Windows Store for the best experience",</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
How can Skype be deployed via MDT now?</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
How can I ensure that Skype will be pre-deployed for computers in my organizations?</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Thanks,</p>

<p>Hi Susan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your answer,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If using the pre-installed Skype in Windows 10, will it allow to upgrade to newer versions if the Microsoft Store is disabled/uninstalled?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why isn't it possible to continue to publish newer versions of Skype in MSI installer?</p>

<p>Are you serius?</p>
<p>We have a huge amount of Windows 7 clients running in our company.</p>
<p>Should we consider now every MSI installer as possible threat?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to the Skype Community!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes. You can delete a Skype account that you're not using. However, when you close your Skype account, the associated Microsoft account will be closed too. Detailed instructions on how to delete a Skype account can be accessed

<p>I have a similar issue, I somehow managed to created 3 accounts over the years... but what does deleting the account do to my Microsoft Office 365 membership, I totally confused. I just want to get rid off some extra account names, they all have the same
 email address. I don't want to change my email address I have been using for over 15 years... Basically I would like to have an overview of all the skype names related to the same email address.</p>

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I had my skype account and live account separately before Microsoft bought skype. Now Microsoft has opened a second skype account under my live account so if people search for me they see two accounts. How can I cancel the skype account that Microsoft opened
 under my live account while keeping my live email account open?&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>I had the same problem as Jean-Paul. I only found out because I topped up my account and then it didn't show up in my app. The Skype login page says to sign in with Skype name or email - how was I supposed to know that Microsoft had created a separate Skype
 account with the email that was linked to my normal Skype account? This is incredibly frustrating and intransparent activity from Microsoft. I have asked the support staff I was speaking with to escalate it in Microsoft so that a communication will go out
 to Skype users to make it clear that duplicate accounts have been created.</p>

<p>I have the same difficulty. I have had a Skype account I have used for years.&nbsp; However, suddenly under the same email, I have a new Skype account. I do not want to delete my associated Microsoft account, as that would delete a lot of information, as well
 as my linked accounts with XBox etc.&nbsp; I would simply like to delete a duplicate account that is somehow linked to the same email but not accessible. I have Skype on my Mac, and I found this issue when trying to use Skype on my Android phone.&nbsp; Can you please
 assist with more details?&nbsp;</p>

<p>It appears we all have the same issue. Microsoft does not appear to care about the specific issue, they would rather you just close you Microsoft account. Why do I say this, the evidence is on this page. We all have duplicate skype accounts that we created
 prior to MS acquiring this program. I am trying to delete my duplicate skype account, I cannot do it without closing my MS account so that is what I am doing. Waiting 60 days for it to close. Hopefully that will shut down the duplicate skype account. After
 that I imagine I will just start another MS account with my skype attached to that?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think if enough people gripe about this issue to MS then they will finally do something to address the issue rather than continuously point you to the same page that tells you how to delete a Skype/close your MS account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now it is now important enough to reach the radar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My suggestion to everyone facing this issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>CLOSE YOU MICROSOFT ACCOUNT</p>

<p>If I log into Skype with my e-mail, it goes to the new, undesired account.&nbsp; If I log into Skype with my ID/Name, &lt;myname&gt;.&lt;company&gt;, it goes to my older account, which I wish to keep.&nbsp; I need to get rid of the duplicate Skype account Skype Name: Live:XXXXX_###
 that got erroneously created when Skype got merged into MS accounts.&nbsp; (I may have done this in confusion logging in after you guys did us the "favor" of merging Skype into the rest of MS services.&nbsp; Could be I didn't realize what was happening and just kept
 supplying requested info.&nbsp; Then there were two.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Deleting the MS account to get rid of a duplicate (or even single) Skype account is unacceptable.&nbsp;&nbsp; Too much other stuff can be tied to it.&nbsp; My MS account is linked to various MS developer IDs.&nbsp;&nbsp; MS needs to provide a way to kill a duplicate, picking which
 Skype ID to keep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Sheesh, the duplicate accounts caused it to take forever to log in here.&nbsp; I would try to log in here with my Skype ID and it would prompt for e-mail or phone# despite&nbsp;them being in my Skype profile.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I tried to supply my e-mail, it reported a dup.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 When I tried to use phone#, it tried to send me a code via SMS.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>It's an office landline!&nbsp;
</em>So, I had to go back to the MS account with the same e-mail and then do some dances to update the information there enough to post here.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h3> needshelpww  say:</h3>
<h2>            uninstall office 2013 and use office 2010</h2>
                    I have office 2010, and I wanted to try Publisher, so I installed office 365 (which installed office 2013).&nbsp; I was not impressed with Publisher enough to continue paying on a monthly basis.&nbsp; So I cancelled my office 365 subscription , I still have office
 2013 on my computer, and I can not uninstall it using the "uninstall programs" in the control panel.&nbsp; I really do not care if it is still on my computer or not, but all of my office files are opening in 2013, and it is telling me that it is deactivated.&nbsp; I
 can go into a new 2010 doc and open a file this way and it will open in 0ffice 2010, but this is a hassle.&nbsp; Any help would be appreciated!&nbsp; Thanks!<br />

<p>You can uninstall Office by doing the following: </p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Office 365 Home Premium: Go to <a href="http://www.office.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.office.com/myaccount</a> and then, in the <strong>Current PC Installs</strong> section, click deactivate. Then, to remove Office entirely, go to your PC’s Control Panel and uninstall it.
</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Other Office 365 plans: Log into your account at <a href="http://www.office365.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.office365.com</a> to manage your installations, including deactivating Office. If you want to remove Office applications completely from your computer, you must uninstall Office from your PC’s Control Panel.</p>
<p>&lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt; <span>I found the uninstaller didn't work, and neither did uninstalling via Control Panel so this is what I did to uninstall Office 365:
</span></p>
<p><span>I rebooted my desktop, then reran the uninstaller, clicked Advanced, and unticked the "Automatically fix" setting (I can't remember what the tick box actually said!), and after a few windows popping up and closing, the
 uninstaller said it worked successfully.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Despite unticking 'automatic' I didn't need to do anything manually anyway.</span></p>
<p><span>One more reboot and Office 365 was gone. It's gone from Programs and Control Panel.&nbsp;</span>&lt;/snip&gt;</p>

<p>I here ya Whiteshoes. This is what Microsoft send me to remove it:
</p>
<p>As you are unable to uninstall Office from Control Panel, you may uninstall Office 2013 from registries and check if it helps.</p>
<p>Follow the steps mentioned below to manually remove Office 365 home preview traces completely and check if that helps:</p>
<p><b>Disclaimer:</b>&nbsp;If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry
 Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. Ensure to back up the registry before editing or deleting any keys from the registry:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Back-up-the-registry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/</a></p>
<p>1. Remove the published component registration for C2R</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Locate the package folder by looking at: HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Delete the C2RManifest*.xml files from &lt;PackageFolder&gt;\root\</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Run the integrator with the /U command from elevated cmd:</p>
<div>
<p>
&lt;PackageFolder&gt;\root\</p>
<p>2. Remove scheduled tasks from elevated cmd:</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>schtasks.exe /delete /tn "FF_INTEGRATEDstreamSchedule"</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>schtasks.exe /delete /tn "FF_INTEGRATEDUPDATEDETECTION"</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>schtasks.exe /delete /tn "FF_INTEGRATEDOffice 15 Subscription Heartbeat"</p>
<p>3. Close down any Office apps and shutdown/kill any of the following C2R processes from Task Manager:</p>
<p><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>ntegratedoffice.exe</p>
<p><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>appvshnotify.exe</p>
<p><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>ntegrator.exe</p>
<p><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>firstrun.exe</p>
<p><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>setup*.exe</p>
<p>4. Remove the Office Service from elevated cmd:</p>
<div>
<p>
sc delete OfficeSvc</p>
<p>5. Delete the Office files by removing the following files/directories:</p>
<div>
<p>
"%ProgramFiles%\Microsoft Office 15"</p>
<p>Note: If there is a lock on any of these files or directories that prevents deletion, rebooting the machine and trying again should remove any stragglers.</p>
<p>6. Delete the Office regkeys by removing these nodes:</p>
<div>
<p>
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office</p>
<p>Note: Depending on your SKU or language, you may need to delete a similar, but differently named key by changing "ProfessionalRetail" to your SKU, and "en-us" to your language</p>
<p>7. Delete the start menu shortcuts:</p>
<div>
<p>
"%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\Microsoft\</p>
<p>Note: If there are other Office products installed on the machine, you will need to go one level deeper than the above and delete the individual shortcuts with "15" in the names so as to not delete the shortcuts for the other Office products.</p>
<p>8. Uninstall the "Microsoft Office Habanero Local Components" from elevated cmd:</p>
<p><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>If running x86 Office on an x64 OS:</p>
<div>
<p>
MsiExec.exe /X{50150000-008F-0000-1000-</p>
<p><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>If running x86 Office on an x86 OS:</p>
<div>
<p>
MsiExec.exe /X{50150000-007E-0000-0000-</p>
<p><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>If running x64 Office on an x64 OS:</p>
<div>
<p>
MsiExec.exe /X{50150000-008C-0000-1000-</p>
<p>9. Uninstall the Microsoft Office Habanero Supplemental Local Components:</p>
<div>
<p>
MsiExec.exe /X{00150000-008C-0000-0000-</p>
<p>&lt;/snip&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<p>Here's what finally worked for me.&nbsp; I&nbsp;should note this is a new PC with only Windows 8 and Eset virus protection software on it.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Stopped the service "Microsoft Office Service" that was&nbsp;shown to be running&nbsp;in the Windows Task Manager.&nbsp; (I had actually tried this before so I know stopping this program&nbsp;is not enough.)</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Deleted all files from the C:\Windows\Temp folder.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp; In order to do delete all files from C:\Windows\Temp, I also had to cancel/stop the Windows Installer that was running in the Task Manager so some files that the Windows Installer&nbsp;had open could be deleted.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;The above steps allowed the re-install of Office 2013 to run.&nbsp; e.g. Last step was re-installation of&nbsp;Office 2013&nbsp;using&nbsp;the previously downloaded Office 2013&nbsp;installer program Setup.x86.en-US_ProPlusRetail-keycodegoeshere.exe
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Things I tried before these steps above:</p>
<p>1) Repair Office2013 from Control Panel-&gt;Programs and Features.&nbsp;&nbsp; Did not help.</p>
<p>2) Uninstall Office 2013 from the Control Panel.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not sure if this was necessary.</p>
<p>3) Uninstall Office 2013 using the downloaded fix-it program from <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501</a>&nbsp; Not sure if this was necessary.</p>
<p>&lt;/snip&gt;</p>

After you do successfully uninstall 2013, you will also have to do an Office repair of your 2010 installation to reset the Windows default file associations.<br />

    <title>Use of ALL CAPS in the ribbon tabs and status bar messages in Office - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> the real jaydax  say:</h3>
<h2>            Use of ALL CAPS in the ribbon tabs and status bar messages in Office 2013</h2>
                    <p>In general I'm happy with Office 2013 but someone at MS has made a serious blunder - almost as irritating as 'Clippy.' They've decided to use ALL CAPS for tab headers and messages in the status bars.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ask any educationalist and they'll tell you that makes words harder to read at a glance. The words lose their shape. They also take up more space on the screen - something which can be at a premium at times. I'm sure someone will point out that the important
 bits in legal contracts are written in upper case but those are written by lawyers and I don't think they want to make contracts easy to read or understand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now it's possible to change the text in tab headers by right clicking and renaming the tab using mixed case and a space. That doesn't change the status bar though and that extra space takes up yet more space. I'm told it's possible to change the registry
 to fix the status bar but MS are not going to tell us how. Anyone know?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's your view? Is this something which irritates? Should MS produce a fix in the form of a check-box in options?</p>

            I have not checked but would hazard a guess that renaming the tabs could cause problems with XML control over it. Maybe not, too. If the "Home" tab becomes the "Home " tab, though XML may not be happy.<br />

            <p>As I had not noticed it until you mentioned it, I can honestly say that it does not irritate me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking at it now, I think that the white on black, upper case&nbsp;in the Status bar is an improvement on the status bar in Word 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm guessing that the change to uppercase was made to offset the preponderance of smaller screens on tablet and touch devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would actually be nice if the tabs (and the ribbon contents) scaled to make use of the additional screen space on larger monitors.&nbsp; If I move a Word window to my largest monitor the tabs, which remain at their original size, take up less than a quarter
 of the screen width.&nbsp; The home tab is the only tab that makes use of the additional screen width by expanding the Quick Styles gallery to enable&nbsp; more styles to be shown on the first row.</p>

<h2>            My Microsoft Word, Excel etc all deleted</h2>
                    I refreshed my PC cause its running slow and it says no medias would be deleted and apps will be restored. But when the refreshing is done everything is gone with no word excel powerpoint or anything left. And if i want to install these apps back i have

<p>Note that if you have been running an older version of Office (one that does not come as a subscription), you can still reinstall it as long as you have the product key. If you had an OEM version (which means that it was installed by the computer manufacturer),
 you can't restore it unless you make use of whatever restore functionality was provided by the computer manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, having more information would certainly help... In your first post, you wrote that you "refreshed" your computer. How, exactly, did you do that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "reset" option that I mentioned is discussed, along with other options, in the article at

</p><p>A lot of things can be done on your Windows phone especially if you have enough space on it. To free up some space, you can move photos and other files to your PC, SD card or save it on OneDrive. You can refer to these articles for tips on how to free to
 space on your device:</p>

            <p><span>Hi Ken,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to perform a full computer virus scan using Windows Defender Offline as it can help remove hard to find malicious and potentially unwanted programs using definitions that recognize threats. Definitions are files that provide an encyclopedia
 of potential software threats. Armed with definition files, Windows Defender Offline can detect malicious and potentially unwanted software, and then notify you of the risks.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What is Windows Defender Offline?</strong>: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/what-is-windows-defender-offline" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/what-is-windows-defender-offline</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>There could be a loss of data while performing a scan using Windows Defender Offline to eliminate virus if any.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Reply with the status of the issue and we will be glad to offer our assistance.</span></p>

</p><p>Connecting your hearing aid to your Lumia 950 XL will make easier for you to make a call. Just like a Bluetooth headphone, the voice call will convert the signals to your hearing aid. The sound of the call will also be clearer because it doesn't amplify
 or include background noise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since it was mentioned in your initial post that your hearing aid disconnects from your phone, please perform a soft reset and pair your devices again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To soft reset your phone, please press the <strong>Volume down</strong> + <strong>
Power </strong>buttons for ten to fifteen seconds or until you feel a vibration.</p>
<p>

            I don't think I said anything about it saying it was compatible.&nbsp; That doesn't mean that it can't work with it.&nbsp; If they use some sort of standard for hearing aids it could work.&nbsp; I doubt ANY hearing aids say they are Windows Phone compatible. &nbsp;

    <title>Problems with page numbers in Word 2007 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problems with page numbers in Word 2007</h2>
                    
<p>I have been having some problems with page numbering in all my multi-section Word documents lately. I do know how to create sections, remove the link to previous sections in the header and footer, format the page numbers, etc.</p>
<p>1. When I format the page number to start at 1, sometimes it does not. It just keeps right on saying "5", for example.</p>
<p>2. When I number pages, sometimes it skips sections, such as a part of the document that is formatted with two columns. I don't think it should do that - I did not remove the link to the previous section.</p>
<p>3. The "page x of y" does not update when I set the document to display a page number to start counting on a page other than the first page. So, on the last page of the document, it may say something like, "page 57 of 60". I can't get it to display the right
 "y" number simply change the footer to display the section pages, because the document has several sections.</p>
<p>It seems to me that Word has some glitches going on here, and I have had lots of fun trying to get it to work correctly. If someone out there has the fix, I would sure appreciate it! I've had this problem with Windows XP professional, Windows Vista Home
 edition, and Windows 7, but always using Word 2007. Thanks!</p>

    <title>6220 classic - camera flash not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xingadora  say:</h3>
<h2>            6220 classic - camera flash not working</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a problem with the 6220 classic's camera flash. When I'm taking pictures, sometimes it does not work at all - no matter if I set the flash mode to "always on" or "red eye".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What bugs me is the fact that the flash sometimes decides to work, and sometimes it doesn't. At first, when I tried the camera, the flash was always working (IIRC). Now, it rarely works - sometimes, a photo session seems to work and flash goes off every
 time, but then, at the next session, I just can't get it to work (by session, I mean taking a bunch of pictures and then turning off the camera mode by turning the switch on the phone).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to figure out what might be going on. At first I tried the phone in a pitch dark place - still, the flash is silent. Then I tried restarting the phone. No luck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas what else I might try (maybe trying to fully-charge the phone and then test the flash, maybe reverting the phone to factory settings), before I turn the phone to service?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>or via FOTA right off your phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>make sure you always do a back up of your data before doing any of this. if this continues to happen even after update i would take it to nokia care for them to have a look. &nbsp;</p>

            First of all check whether any new software update is available for your phone or not.<br />
Just go in to the following site and enter your phone model no., etc and update via your PC.<br />

            It's likely related. What did the two rules do that you disabled? (They should be deleted). 
<br />
<br />What usually happens is the account is compromised, the hackers set up rules to forward and/or delete  messages  -they may delete mail already in the mailbox too.

            Yes, we've deleted those two suspicious rules...&nbsp; I was not onsite, so I didn't get to look at the rules.&nbsp; &nbsp;I had a similar issue a couple of years ago&nbsp; with a GMail account, and it did the very same thing.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have verified the 'send' issue has been resolved.&nbsp;
 Thank you again for your help.&nbsp; I hope you have a great weekend!&nbsp; &nbsp;-Scott

<h2>            Outlook 2010&#58;  Conversation Clean Up and Ignore only functional in Cached Exchange mode&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>When Cached Exchange mode is enabled I have the ability to use the Clean Up and Ignore Conversation buttons found&nbsp;on the Home ribbon.</p>
<p>If Cached Exchange mode is then disabled these functions are greyed out.&nbsp; I would hope that these core functions of Outlook 2010 would still be available without caching.&nbsp; Workaround?</p>

<h2>            RANDBETWEEN Problems</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having the following problems with the Excel Function of RANDBETWEEN.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>(1) After having calculated once using the function, if I do anything else anywhere on the same sheet, the function gets re-calculated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, How do I make sure that once calculated, the function remains fixed and does not change?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(2) Very often the function "returns" a Number which is one of the parameters defeating the common understanding of what is meant by .....BETWEEN.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, why is this happening? and how to prevent it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Saeed</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>How to edit a previously submitted Question?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just posted two Questions, the solution to one of them I have just worked out myself and that is that, to stop the RANDBETWEEN function being calculated whenever any action is taken anywhere else on the sheet : Go to the Calculation Option and Tick the
 Manual Option, this will stop the function from being calculated over and over again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My two other question s are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>(1) How do I calculate the RANDBETWEEN function in one cell, and, then copy / paste /
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">repeat&nbsp;</span></strong>the function in a range of adjacent cells (in a row or column) in such a way that:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) The function in each cell is calculated independently &amp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) That No Two cells contain the same number</p>
<p>
</p><p>(2) How do I prevent the Function returning a number that is the same as either of the two parameters?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Look forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Saeed</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Put this formula in <strong>A2 </strong>and array enter it, see below for how. Drag down and it will produce unique random numbers between 1 and 1000.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>=LARGE(ROW(<strong>$1:$1000</strong>)*NOT(COUNTIF(<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">$A$1:A1</span>, ROW(<strong>$1:$1000</strong>))), RANDBETWEEN(<strong>1,1000</strong>-ROW(A1)+1))</p>
<p>
</p><p>Change the 1:1000 in bold to numbers you actually want displayed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to put it in another cell change the underlined bit to the cell <strong>
above</strong> the one you put the formula in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This is an array formula which must be entered by pressing CTRL+Shift+Enter<br />
and not just Enter. If you do it correctly then Excel will put curly brackets<br />
around the formula {}. You can't type these yourself. If you edit the formula<br />
you must enter it again with CTRL+Shift+Enter.</p>

I setup the username as 'niladrisekhar'. After saving, when I edit the mail account, it is showing the username as 'niladrisekha.dey'.<br />
The '.dey' added automaically which is not required. This causing problem to send mail. Incoming mail working fine.<br />

I have configured another email account (EMail ID: '*** Email address is removed for privacy ***', username: 'www.nsdey') which is working absolutely fine.</p>

</p><p>Come on, Microsoft, fix this! It will take me all day to go into each folder individually to delete each file before I can delete a folder. How can I use OneDrive if I can't get it clean? I'm trying to delete everything so I can re-upload all my files, but
 it's impossible with this stupid set up you have.</p>

<div>Hi Craig,</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<p>This error usually happens when your OneDrive for business is on hold, which is related to data loss policy(DLP).</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, if your OneDrive for Business URL is:</p>
<p><a href="https://domain-my.sharepoint.com/personal/username_domain_onmicrosoft_com/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://domain-my.sharepoint.com/personal/username_domain_onmicrosoft_com/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx</a>,
</p>
<p>please modify it to the following:</p>
<p><a href="https://domain-my.sharepoint.com/personal/username_domain_onmicrosoft_com/_layouts/15/viewlsts.aspx?view=14" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://domain-my.sharepoint.com/personal/username_domain_onmicrosoft_com/_layouts/15/viewlsts.aspx?view=14</a>&nbsp;and
 then access this URL. Then you will log into the OneDrive site content page.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Please check if there is a library called Preservation hold library.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you can find Preservation hold library in your OneDrive for Business site, which means your Office 365 global admin made your site on hold. Please understand that when the site is on hold, documents can be deleted. When you delete them, they
 will get moved to Preservation Hold library. But if you have a folder with multiple files in it, we will not be able to delete the Folder directly.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This is how Preservation hold works to prevent the data loss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this situation, you need to collaborate with your Office 365 global admin to remove your OneDrive site from preservation hold policy. Your Office 365 admin could verify it from the Office 365 Security and Compliance center.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.Let admin browse to&nbsp;<a href="https://protection.office.com/#/homepage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://protection.office.com/#/homepage</a><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>2.Then Go to ‘Retention’ Under Data Governance and see if DLP policy is created for any preservation.</p>
<p>3.Under ‘Search &amp; Investigation’ go to eDiscovery and see if any holds are created.</p>
<p>
