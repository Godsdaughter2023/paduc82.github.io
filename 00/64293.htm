            Hi,<br />
You cannot change the settings of Windows Media Player. You may try stretching the windows media player and check if the issue gets fixed.<br />

<h2>            Account has been hacked , migrated to Russia  </h2>
                    My account has been stolen and everything is in Russian . The hacker spent 1600 ms point on some FIFA crap and 3 months of xbl gold from what I can see. They could have spent more , but I can't read the history because it's in Russian . My 12+2 gears of
 war xbl subscription was voided because they migrated to Russia . I have called xbl support and they froze my account and they said it will take 28 days or more for the investigation . 28 days might not seem long to a normal person but to a gamer is a very
 long time . The fact is that I work hard to get my rank in games I enjoy playing and now I'll be behind over 450 hrs of rank or more.. I'm a gamer and an achievement addict . I'm furious that I will miss out on exclusive events in gow 3 that will give you
 skins that you can not buy and not to mention MW3.. I know I'm not the only person with this issue. I googled this problem and it's all over the place. It's kinda funny that Xbox makes billions of dollars and suppose to protect my inf

<p>Forget immediately this magical 25-28 days. &nbsp;It's probably going to be a few months minimum. &nbsp;Everything I've been reading on the forums seems to point to the fact that accounts migrated to Russia and Brazil have other issues involved with trade practices,
 which will most likely end up with you never seeing that account again. &nbsp;While I can't say definitively whether that is the case or not, there are some people posting about Russia migrations that are at 3+ months with no end in sight.</p>
<p>Best bet is create another gold account if you are that into games and achievements. &nbsp;Don't wait around for MS to get their act together. &nbsp;</p>

<p>This happened with my account. &nbsp;My account was hacked on July 2011, and still don't have it back on December 2011. &nbsp;In the 15-20 times I've called since it happened, I've heard different things. &nbsp;The "28 days" thing is BS, if you wait 28 days they will just
 tell you 28 business days. &nbsp;Wait 28 business days, they will tell you they have no idea. &nbsp;They'll tell you that they'll call in 72 hours just to get you off the phone, then never call you. &nbsp;One guy told me it was taking so long because the hacker had gotten
 me banned from several services, and they were unbanning me from those services. &nbsp;A couple &nbsp;of people have told me that it's taking so long because they have to deal with the Brazilian government in order to get the licenses legally transferred back to a US
 account. &nbsp;Someone else told me that I was never going to get the account back, and to create a new gold account and they would transfer my licenses to the new account (did that, waited a month, got nothing).</p>
<p>This is absolutely ridiculous, and by far the worst customer service I have ever experienced. &nbsp;I have been locked out of my Live account and my game saves for five months now, and there is no end in sight. &nbsp;I cannot get a straight answer from any of the
 customer service reps, I have been told something different practically every time I call.</p>
<p>If I can give any advice on this, take notes on every call you make. &nbsp;Write down the date and time you called, the name of the customer service rep you spoke to, and a summary of what they told you. &nbsp;I have been told so many different things, I wish I had
 written it all down.</p>
<p>I am currently on the new account that the guy who told me that I was never getting my account back made me create. &nbsp;I called at a later time, and I was told that I was given false information and that I would get my account back.</p>

<p>Same thing's been happening with me. My account too was hacked in July and still haven't gotten it back. Everything you're describing is what I've been going through as well. Getting told different information by different people. Today I thought I'd try
 Xbox Support via Twitter. I was told that they don't handle these cases that is something for Phone Support. When I explained to them that I've tried Phone Support multiple times. They asked when did I report it I told them August 15th. Since that's the date
 of my last UA. They told me looks like they are still working on it. So basically they haven't told me anything. When I asked well it would be nice to get status updates instead of just being left alone in the dark. They stopped replying back. So basically
 tryng anything and everything hasn't worked. Phone Support (1-800-4MY-XBOX), emailing support, filing Better Business Bureau complaint, emailing Exception Analyst who emailed me after 3 days of filing the BBB complaint saying they'd be in contact in a week
 (no reply 3 weeks later), phoning Exceptions Analyst (doesn't answer phone or return calls/voice mail)</p>

<p>i`m at day 45, account stolen, migrated to russia, all ms points spent, ive been with xbox sincce day 1 and this is the first trouble ive ever had, what worries me is the fact that ive spent must be over £1000 on stuff on xbox live and cant access any of
 it, there is only i person ( droning silence ) who claims he got his account sorted and migrated back but i think its bull as he never answers any message and never went into any detail how it was sorted, in the us you can make a bbb claim against ms, im in
 the uk and have no idea what sort of claim i can make to speed things up, i have no hope of seeing my account for months as everyone thats had there account migrated are all in the 80+ days, one even on 116 days, come on ms, i dont care about my ms points
 just migrate my tag back to uk and give it back to me</p>

<p>They refunded my stolen points &nbsp;after 26 days and sent &nbsp;me an email stating &nbsp;that my UI was complete &nbsp;and resolved . But then I logged back on and my gamer tag is still in Russian . &nbsp; So I had to call back &nbsp;and make another UI . I'm on day 67 &nbsp;of this Russian
 attack . I have a feeling it will take a full year to get my account migrated back . Xbox will not call you during this process . They will only contact you by email . &nbsp;I would recommend &nbsp;calling &nbsp;after &nbsp; After 28 days &nbsp;and hope you get a good person on support
 &nbsp;line .. &nbsp;I've &nbsp;prolly delt with over &nbsp;20 &nbsp;different people on the support line &nbsp;and mthe minute I mention account hacked and migration &nbsp;they would make some excuse that computers are down or &nbsp;switch me to another line then I get dc. But the last person I
 talked to was very helpful and spent over an hr with me and made sure my issue would be looked at . &nbsp;I will post back once this is resolved

<p>I last contacted support dec. 16th which it was very helpful , but today ( feb 1 , 2012) I decided to call just to get an update and when I spoke to them all I got is that there has been no progress and a huge run around . The whole convo last less than
 60 seconds . I'm starting to &nbsp;lose faith ... If someone got their account migrated to another country and got it back please reply

<p>File a complaint with the Better Business Bureau, which can be done online. The BBB quotes a turn around time of 3 to 10 business days for the company involved to contact the customer with a resolution. This might also help future customers not have to suffer

            Hi fizzology,<br />
<br />
<span>There are several causes on why you encounter this issue, please check the following:<br />
</span><br />
<span><span>• Ensure you have installed the latest version of Windows Live Movie Maker</span>:
</span><span><a href="http://explore.live.com/windows-live-movie-maker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://explore.live.com/windows-live-movie-maker</span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;The
 current 2011 version: 15.4.3555.0308, Windows Live Movie Maker is not supported on Windows XP&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<span>• Check that the files you are using are of a supported format.
</span>Some file formats are not supported by Windows Live Movie Maker. A list of supported formats can be found here:&nbsp;
</span><span><a href="http://explore.live.com/windows-live-movie-maker-file-types-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://explore.live.com/windows-live-movie-maker-file-types-faq</span></a></span><span><br />
<br />
<span>• Ensure that you have the proper codecs to play your videos and audio files.
</span>Audio and <span>Video</span> require codecs to play the file and it’s important to have the right codecs installed or updated in your PC.&nbsp;<br />
- &nbsp;Try running the Microsoft <span>FixIt</span> tool for codecs:
</span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/video_freezes_or_crashes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/mats/video_freezes_or_crashes/</span></a></span><span><br />
-&nbsp;<strong><span>Media info</span></strong> will be able to identify any issues with missing or faulty codecs and whether it’s already installed in your computer or not. You can get it at&nbsp;</span><span><a href="http://mediainfo.sourceforge.net/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://mediainfo.sourceforge.net/en</span></a></span><span>
<br />
<br />
<b>Note</b>: If can't find the codec you need you may convert the video to a supported format (<span>eg</span>.
<span>wmv</span>) and then add it to your Windows Live Movie Maker project.<br />
<br />
• Movie Maker makes extensive use of the video card GPU (graphics processing unit). The display driver affects the reliability, performance, and compatibility of the video card
<span>with various software</span>.<br />
<br />
To determine the version and video card driver date, run the DirectX Diagnostic Tool (<span>dxdiag</span>):<br />
<br />
<b>DirectX Diagnostic Tool<br />
</b>• Click on Start button and type “<span>dxdiag</span>” in the Search programs and files box and press Enter key on the keyboard.<br />
• Click on the Display tab and you will see the driver details including the driver version.<br />
• If your video card driver seems outdated please go to the video card driver manufacturer and see if a newer version is available.
<br />
Example:<br />

            have discovered part of the problem. first if the films remain in the movies tv app they will work &nbsp;but if you change the properties to say vlc player then this issue remains the same . also if you use 2 different &nbsp;formats say start with a windows movie
 maker then add a video with windows media player properties it will not work..&nbsp;

            it appears the problem is movie maker wont allow 2 different formats for instance if i use a movie maker film &nbsp;with a windows media player file i have the same issue . same if i add a vlc player file or any other format . you cannot use 1 with the other.

<p>You’ve probably noticed we’ve spruced things up a bit. With the new look we’re also bringing in new content, but it’s a big job! If you think there’s troubleshooting information missing, tell us! Or better yet, strut your stuff by writing your own sticky
 post. <br />
<br />
We’re trying out more conversational, experience-based guides. Check <a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/7/t/22.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> and <a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/7/t/19.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> for examples. If you would like to add this kind of content to the forums, feel free to write something up in this format, and make your post here. Mister Gwyther and I will review the submissions and sticky the best of the best. We may do some editing
 for consistency and accuracy, but we want you to be the voice of the new forums! Consider the following when making your post:<br />
<br />
Stay away from Q&amp;As, and make it more conversational.<br />
Keep it simple. Don’t feel like you have to cover every issue in one post.<br />
Don’t be afraid to spice it up: we want YOUR voice to come through!<br />
<br />
If you have any questions about sticky submissions, feel free to PM Mister Gwyther or myself. We look forward to reading your posts!
<br />

<strong>Where'd my post go?!<br />
</strong>As we review and take action on a post in this thread, we will delete that post to make room for new suggestions and ideas. If you find that your post here is missing, please check your PMs. We will try to make sure that any post delete in this way
 will be accompanied by a direct explanation to the original poster. Thanks!</p>

<p>It would be nice if there were some full details on what this entails, and how much of your xbox it ruins. Namely, the save data? Will it be corrupted if you're the victim of one of these errors? Or can you transfer the old data to the new xbox? Also will
 MS except the broken model returned before a new one is shipped? Because if so, then it means we're essentially losing our data as well, should we fall victim...=(</p>

<p>Something "helpful" was the "unanswered posts". &nbsp;I have found "unanswered post" per topic but there use to be unanswered post over ALL of xbox.com. &nbsp;It was a very good tool to use to move over all of xbox.com to try to help people. &nbsp;Any chance of getting
 another one of those? &nbsp;Thanks for your help.</p>

<p>How about a link TO THE FORUMS... not to a "Forum Community Whoop-dee-doo" page, but a link to the actual page with the topics you can read and respond to. &nbsp; I'm old and grumpy, I still have a phone book, and having to hunt for the FORUM through fifty pages
 that all say Forum up top... but don't contain the forum actually stinks. Don't like the "conversation" style forum either... when I go to the dictionary to look up a word, I don't want to read a book that contains the word... and when I go to search a forum
 for answers - I don't want to read ten thousand "conversations" just trying to find a freaking answer. &nbsp;I can't find my old threads... I can't find relevant new threads.</p>
<p>Is Six Sigma involved in this? Sure smells like someone's Green Belt project to me... *sigh*

<p>You may want to include this "Xbox LIVE compatible hardware list" from the Support.Xbox.com website to your "Announcements" here in this particular forum,</p>
<p><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-us/pages/xbox-live/get-started/connecting/network-hardware-compatible-xbox-live.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../network-hardware-compatible-xbox-live.aspx</a></p>
<p>as it is extremely informative but a little hard to find. &nbsp;I actually printed out the old version during the Original Xbox days and took it to the store with me when purchasing my router to ensure that the router I was getting was going to work with Live.
 &nbsp;It's also very informative in terms of being able to "look up" the latest firmware for said device to make sure it's current. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh, I just noticed that my particular D-Link router (that I've had since the original XBox, as I mentioned earlier in this post) has lasted so long, it's no longer "certified."</p>
<p>Anyway, just a thought.</p>

<h2>            Broken HDR over display port 1.4</h2>
                    I have a nvidia gtx 1080ti, which is display port 1.4 and also have a display port 1.4 cable, my problem is I can run HDR over the HDMI connection but my monitor is also adaptive sync which can only be run on display port and I can not for the life of
 me get HDR to enable in windows 10 over display port 1.4 even though I purchased a display port 1.4 cable and I have all the correct gear, yes it works over HDMI but its half a job, I need to be able to run adaptive sync and HDR at the same time, I really
 need help with this one.

            Hi, I can use HDR via HDMI but not the 2 DP ports on my monitor and I think I have figured it out, the 2 DP ports on my monitor are only DP 1.2 where as the HDMI ports are HDMI 2.0.

<h2>            DVDMaker.exe and Media Center failing to burn video DVD&#39;s of recorded TV shows</h2>

<br />
I was trying to burn some recorded tv shows to dvd within media center.&nbsp;&nbsp; At first it failed, then it wrote the first one succesfully.&nbsp;&nbsp; I haven't verified it on the DVD player, but it looks like it worked.&nbsp; I moved on to the next show and I've gone through
 about 7 DVD's.&nbsp; I rebooted, stopped all programs, tried DVDMaker.exe on lowest speed, etc, etc, etc.&nbsp; Can't seem to get the movie to burn.&nbsp; I downloaded a converter and converted the recorded shows .wtv file&nbsp;to .mpg and CyberLink is able to burn that as a
 DVD movie along with some other sample videos.&nbsp;&nbsp; It appears the DVD is fine, but something with Windows is not happy.<br />

<p><span><span>Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
Welcome to Windows Vista Answers community.<br />
<br />
Windows Media Encoder can only encode source files with .asf, .avi, .bmp, .jpg, .mpg, .mp3, .wav, .wma, and .wmv file name extensions. In addition, sourcing from a file with a .mpg file name extension requires a compatible
</span><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=35805" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>DVD decoder</span></a><span> (sometimes known as an MPEG-2 decoder) on the encoding computer.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Let’s check if any of the third party software or service running in the background is behind this issue.<br />
<br />
</span><span><span>This looks like one of the third party software or the service that is causing this problem. Lets perform clean boot to check if we can resolve this issue.<br />
<br />
To perform a clean boot on a computer that is running Windows Vista, follow these steps.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. &nbsp;Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password,
 or click Continue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. &nbsp;On the General tab, click Selective Startup.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. &nbsp;Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. &nbsp;Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and
 then click Disable All.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click OK.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>6.&nbsp; When you are prompted, click Restart.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>7.&nbsp; After the computer starts, reinstall and start the program and check whether the problem
 is resolved.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Check for previous issues. If your issue is resolved, follow the How to Determine what is
 causing the Problem section in the KB article to narrow down the exact source. </span>
</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/331796" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/331796</span></a><span>
 . </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To return your computer to a Normal startup mode, follow these steps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Click Start in the Start Search box.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Type msconfig, and then press ENTER.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password,
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or click Continue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Click the General tab.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. &nbsp;Click Normal Startup - load all device drivers and services, and then click OK.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5. When you are prompted, click Restart to restart the computer.<br />
<br />
<br />
I would also suggest you to uninstall all the third party codec’s and try burning the DVD’s<br />
<br />
<br />

            Thank you for responding... I'm still stuck&nbsp; :)&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I was reading through your instructions and getting ready with msconfig and then noticed an issue with the instructions.&nbsp;&nbsp; My problem is related to Windows Media Center burning the DVD as well as DVDMaker.exe.&nbsp; Both of these are put into place during the installation
 of Vista, I cannot perform step #7 of re-installing those programs.<br />
<br />
Also, I was able to burn one dvd within Media Center, so the codec must be in place... plus media center records to it and plays it.<br />
<br />
I tried to do the recovery process today in order to roll back to a point in time prior to installing MS Office, iTunes, etc, but it failed loading the checkpoint in three different locations, so I gave up.<br />
<br />
Any other ideas?

            I have&nbsp;a similar problem.&nbsp; I've had Windows Media Center on my Dell XPS410 machine running Vista Home Premium for the last two years.&nbsp; I used to be able to burn DVD's of recorded programs in Media Center with no problem, until about a month ago.&nbsp; Now whenever
 I try to burn the DVD's of a program, I get get the following error messages:<br />
<strong>"Burn failure - an error has occurred in burning the CD/DVD"</strong>&nbsp; This message pops up in Media Center.&nbsp;
<br />
Then when I exit Media Center,&nbsp;I get the following message: <strong>"SBEServer has stopped working".</strong>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I did have to perform an In-Place Upgrade of Vista Home Premium (with help of Microsoft Vista technical support) prior to this issue because my system would not download Windows Upgrades.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I am able to burn data and photo files in other programs, namely Windows Photo Gallery and Windows DVD Maker, and Roxio.&nbsp; However, the Windows Media Center will not&nbsp;let me burn anymore, which is quite inconvenient.<br />
<br />
I am current with all Windows Updates and have tried various fixes such as disabling and removal of the other burner software and this has not resolved the issue.<br />
<br />
I do not know what the SBEServer error means.<br />
<br />
Hopefully someone can help.&nbsp; Thanks, Dan&nbsp;<br />

<p>I am on vista. My computer (dell inspiron 531) has built in bluetooth, but it isn't working. I've looked through all of the help on bluetooth, and according to it inside Hardware and Sound there should be a link called "Bluetooth Devices", but for some reason
 it is not there, so I am not able to use any of the Windows help. If anybody could tell me how to get to there that would be great!</p>

<p><span><span>OK, I’m going to append this to my reply; some Bluetooth cards do support the search feature.<span>&nbsp;
</span>However, this requires software to do so.<span>&nbsp; </span>You’re going to have to look through your list of installed software (programs) trying to find something that does some type of Bluetooth function.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You’re not likely to find it control panel.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></span></p>

<p><span>Where it seems you’re looking for a folder called:
<span>Bluetooth Software Suite</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you don’t have this folder, perhaps you can download it from Dell, or, you only have basic Bluetooth support for keyboards and mice.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You could always call Dell and ask.<span>&nbsp; </span>Or, you could read your manual.<span>&nbsp;
</span>They (Dell, or your manual) would know better than me.<br />

<p>
</p><p>1. Is it only happening on all videos?</p>
<p>2. Is the text, icons, browsers, and windows not having issues?</p>
<p>3. Did you make any changes in your computer prior to the issue?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for your response to my inquiry. It does seem to be only certain streaming videos that are magnified.&nbsp; It happens in all Netflix, Hulu, News, and Media Player, even though I was able to watch regular sized videos on&nbsp;those apps at first.&nbsp;It happens
 in Twitter, but only select tweets.&nbsp; It affects Mtv video tweets, but not those from The White House or Animal Life.&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, the videos in YouTube &amp; iTunes are unaffected.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Nothing else is affected except videos.&nbsp; At first I&nbsp;changed my screen resolution, but that wasn't it.
</p>
<p>It happened about 2 weeks after I bought this computer. I think I opened the "Action Center" &amp; accidentally changed something, but I haven't been able to figure it out.
</p>
<p>It's driving me crazy, because otherwise I am VERY happy with this new computer. I seriously love this machine.

<h2>            Outlook app missing calendar and contacts sync options</h2>
                    <p>Just switching phones and in the process of setting things up. I noticed that my contacts and calendar/reminders weren't working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After some digging I found out that the settings in outlook app for my MSA is missing Calendar and Contacts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only thing I can find different is that there is an app version difference. But even still it doesn't seem like that would be the reason those settings are missing. I have all 3 options for other accounts (gmail and outlook).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've gone to the store and tapped get updates but it says everything is up to date.&nbsp;</p>

            What phone are you using? I can see the sync options on my Lumia 950. The alternative is using a different mail app, or resetting the phone (in case this is one of those one-off issues).

<h2>            Locked out of Windows 10 tablet&#59; need help logging back in</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Windows 10 tablet. The manufacturer is Hexa Electronics. A few months back I created a Microsoft Account as I was prompted to by the tablet. But then I went offline and forgot the password. Now I have a new Microsoft Account password but the trouble
 is my tablet does not connect to WiFi. When I turn it on I am shown the login page. I am told that my tablet is offline so I must enter the old password which I forgot. I try to connect to WiFi but in vain. Please help.</p>

 to do next.</p>

    <title>Slow Down Due to Installed Games - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vigilantlattice  say:</h3>
<h2>            Slow Down Due to Installed Games</h2>
                    
<p>For the past two weeks my 360 has been having a lot of issues with slowing way down beyond an acceptable level. Such as the console taking 3-4min to turn on, then another 2-3min for the dash to pop up, and then 3-5min for a game, Netflix or any other app
 to start up. I first noticed it while playing through the GoW2 campaign as the load times after dieing got to be longer and longer with each successive one, and after some fiddling around (disconnecting and reconnecting the hard drive, clearing the cache,
 deleting unnecessary saves and games I no longer need) I found the cause of it to be the GoW2 install. Upon deleting it everything went back to normal and ran as it always did. However, any games new games I've installed since have had the same effect as well
 as arcade games I've downloaded.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>Remember:<br />
Clearing the cache does nothing, being connected or disconnecting from Live has no effect, but the system runs normally when the hard drive isn't connected.</p>

<p>well the ones you've installed can simply be uninstalled ( re-install them at a later date (but you do know that all installing them to the hard drive does is cut the load time by a bit and make less noise) and as for the arcade games just delete them and
 redownload them from the download history (located by going into my account on the dashboard)</p>

<p>I have done so and been doing so, which is how I discovered the issue in the first place. I'm fine with not installing games to the hard drive, they all run pretty much fine without. I suppose the real issue with it is the arcade games. I've tried deleting
 and redownloading all the ones causing issues with no change in the results. It would be more than just a little obnoxious to have to remove them from the hard drive, redownloading them only when I wish to play it, then deleting it afterward so then the rest
 of the system will work.</p>
<p>I dunno if I should try wiping the whole hard drive and start from scratch (might that work?) or just go get a new one, or if there's some other possible solution I'm unaware of.</p>

<p>Before investing in a new HDD, it wouldn't hurt to try formatting the hard drive. You can do so by selecting the option form the same menu where you clear the cache. This will remove all of the data from the HDD, so be sure to back up your save files first!</p>

<p>I'd forgotten entirely I could do that. It took a while to move everything I needed to to the flash drive and back, but so far as I can tell from what all I've tested as of yet, it appears to have fixed it.</p>
<p>Thank you! You saved me a good portion of this week's pay check.</p>
