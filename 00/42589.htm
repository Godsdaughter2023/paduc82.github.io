<h2>            There Was A Problem With Your Connection</h2>
                    
<p>This is the only error I get.&nbsp; "TEST FAILED:&nbsp; There's a problem with your connection.&nbsp; Select More Info for a description of the problem and how you can fix it." This has occurred in the past but I have always been able to get the XBox to connect.&nbsp; Since
 it started trying to download this latest patch, it refuses to connect to XBox Live.&nbsp; I have connection to my network and the internet but not to the service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Router: Linksys EA4500</p>
<p>Troubleshooting Performed: Everything available on the "XBox Live Connection Solution" site.&nbsp; Restarted Modem, connected Xbox directly into the modem, restarted router, switched network cables, changed router socket the cable is plugged into, reset to factory
 default and restarted Xbox, Left Xbox shut off for 2 days, unplugged network cable and plugged it back in, continually retried connecting for 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Out of all this troubleshooting, the XBox will not connect to XBox Live.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Pro 64bit cannot find PS3 on network</h2>
                    
<p>I'm having trouble getting Windows 7 to communicate with my PS3. &nbsp;When I try searching for Media Servers with my PS3 it reports: "No Media Servers were Found".</p>
<p>I've set WMP12 to "Automatically Allow Devices to Play My Media" but when I go to "More Streaming Options" and select "All Networks" my PS3 does not appear as "Unknown Device" or anything else.</p>
<p>Here are my settings:</p>
<p><strong>Windows 7 Pro 64bit laptop connected via Wifi:</strong></p>
<p>-- I've disabled my Windows Firewall (no other firewall/antivirus software is installed)</p>
<p>-- Network Discovery is enabled.</p>
<p>-- File and Print Sharing is enabled.</p>
<p>-- Public Folder Sharing is enabled</p>
<p>-- Media Streaming is on.</p>
<p>-- 128bit encryption is enabled</p>
<p>-- Password protected sharing is off.</p>
<p>-- "Allow Widows to manage homegroup connections" is enabled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Actiontec PK5000 Router:</strong></p>

<h2>            No factory image restore, what else can I do&#63;</h2>
                    Hi, lately my computer, an dell inspiron 1525 pre-installed with vista home basic keeps giving me so many problems. For one, it won't let me on the internet though I have a strong connection, second, it won't let me open any of my programs, when I click
 on program a cmd prompt comes on for less than a second with a message that says "program is to big for memory." I am so tired of hassling with it that I want to go back to factory image restore, problem is that since I have vista home basic, its not an option.
 I really don't want to have to re-install vista along with all the drivers all over again which I've had to do with another computer. Is there any other way that I can change it back to its original factory settings??? I have tried system restore which was
 no help, I also don't have any backups since all I have on my computer is programs which I can download again. Help, I'm going crazy!!!

Contact them and the will send you a set of Vista Recovery disk/s.<br />
<br />
You have to reinstall Vista&nbsp;to put it back to Factory Settings.<br />
<br />
System Restore is to put it back in time, but&nbsp;not back to&nbsp;the Factory settings.<br />
<br />

And this way if you have a Recovery partition on your Hard drive.<br />

Read the above link to see if you hav ea Recovery Partition on your Hard Drive to go back to Factory Settings.<br />

    <title>Sharing permissions are not applied to new files in a shared folder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kona-chan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sharing permissions are not applied to new files in a shared folder</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm trying to share videos from computer to tablet. I prefer using anonymous access, so I turned off password protected sharing in Network and Sharing center. Then I shared video folder with Everyone and granted them read-only permission. I made sure through
 Security that my user account is the owner of that folder. It worked, I could access my files from the tablet. But then this happens. I set up my bittorrent client to put downloaded files to this shared folder and found out that I can't see those files from
 the tablet. It turned out that that read-only permission wasn't applied to new files in folder. The parent folder itself, all its subfolders, and all files that were present there at the moment I shared it had sharing permission, while files added after that
 didn't have it. More confusing is the fact that when *I* create a new file in the folder, it *gets* sharing permissions, but not those files moved there by utorrent.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>For now the only way to work this around I see is to manually re-apply sharing permissions to every new file in folder every time it appears there, which I find extremely frustrating. So I figured I could use some help.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Sorry for my bad English, I described the problem the best I could. Hope it's at least somewhat clear what I am trying to achieve. I will really appreciate any advice!</div>
                </div>

            Thank you for reply. Fixit didn't help and articles on sharing suggest using a workgroup which I'd rather not use and in general cover only basic usage which I'm familiar with.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I did some research and I think I localized the problem: NTFS permissions of root folder aren't being inherited by these new files. When I "Replaced all child object permissions with inheritable permissions from this object" from Security -&gt; Advanced dialog,
 sharing permissions applied as well as NTFS permissions. But then again, I'm going to have to do it every time manually, which is annoying. So, what could be the cause of it?</div>

    <title>Scroll wheel problems in Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shawn walton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Scroll wheel problems in Windows 7</h2>
                    &nbsp; I have had this problem for a while now and it is driving me insane. My mouse isn't scrolling properly. The problem is sometimes when I start to scroll down, sometimes it will just scroll back up to its original position. Other times it will jump a few
 lines ahead of where it is supposed to be. <br />
<br />
&nbsp; The mouse exhibits odd behavior in any application. In Windows Photo Viewer, Windows Live Photo gallery and Adobe Photoshop. If I use the scroll wheel to zoom in on a picture, it will zoom in and back out really quickly and I will have to fight with it to
 get it to zoom in. If I'm using a web browser, (any web browser) When I move the wheel to scroll down, it will quickly move down and back up again. Sometimes when I'm scrolling a web page, it will suddenly jump down a few lines farther than it should.
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;These scrolling issue happen at random but very frequently. It started with my Logitech M500 mouse. There were no drivers (that I could find), so I left it with the generic drivers. Didn't work.<br />
<br />
I re-installed Windows, didn't work. <br />
I bought a Microsoft Comfort Mouse 4500, didn't work.<br />
Installed the Intellipoint drivers, didn't work.<br />
Borrowed an old Logitech Wheel Mouse from a friend, didn't work<br />
Bought a new Thermaltake Saphira Gaming mouse, didn't work<br />
Used the generic drivers, didn't work.<br />
Installed the Thermatake software, didn't wok.<br />
Updated the firmware in the mouse, didn't work.<br />
<br />
Four different mice. <br />
Various different configuration settings. <br />
Installed/un-installed/re-installed drivers.<br />
Re-installed Windows.<br />
Even tried a different Motherboard with various different BIOS settings.<br />
<br />
The erratic scroll wheel problem remains.<br />

            <p>Hi Shawn Walton,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Did you perform a Format clean installation?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Method 1:</span></p>
<p><span>Step 1:</span></p>
<p><span>You may try booting in safe mode with networking and check if the issue occurs.
</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the articles to boot in safe mode with networking:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Start your computer in safe mode</a><span>&nbsp;

<p><span>Step 2:</span></p>
<p><span>If you are not facing the problem in safe mode with networking, </span><span>you may try performing a clean boot and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p><span>A clean boot helps to verify if any third party application services or startup item is causing this issue.

<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</a></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note: </span></strong><span>Make sure you put the computer back to Normal Startup once you are done with the troubleshooting.</span></p>
<p><span>You may also refer the article and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/303091" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Resolve problems with mouse button or scrolling settings</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Method 2:</span></p>
<p><span>Step 1:</span></p>
<p><span>Run the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Open the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter</a></span></p>
<p><span>Step 2:</span></p>
<p><span>After running the troubleshooter, check for the latest Windows Updates for any optional updates which have the related drivers.</span></p>
<p><span>For further information, refer to the articles:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Install-Windows-updates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Install Windows updates</a></span></p>

            <p>Hi Shawn Walton,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did the problem occur when you boot to the install disc (or recovery partition) to reinstall Windows?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it did, you may check for any USB devices attached to the computer that are not recognized.</p>
<p>You can try unplugging the keyboard and test if the problem still occurs.</p>
<p>Since the screenshot is not accessible, you may try uploading the screenshot by referring to the link:</p>

            I guess the fifth mouse is the charm. I now have a RAZER Imperator and it seems to be working fine. Four mice all with messed up scroll wheels, go figure.

<p><br />
If your platform is x86 or X64 you could install WLMail (from Windows Live Essentials).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I don't think you need to do that just to read .eml files.&nbsp;&nbsp; If nothing else you could rename the extension as&nbsp; .mht&nbsp; and open them in&nbsp; IE.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then in order to avoid the rename you would just change the association of the extension.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, using a cmd window </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>C:\&gt;assoc .eml<br />
.eml=WindowsLiveMail.Email.1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>C:\&gt;assoc .mht<br />
.mht=mhtmlfile<br />
</p>
<p>C:\&gt;assoc .eml=mhtmlfile<br />
.eml=mhtmlfile<br />
</p>
<p>Then go into a Windows Explorer window, find some .eml files, turn on the Preview pane and see what we get...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's sort of working but not very well.&nbsp;&nbsp; Switching it back to the WLMail&nbsp;association is definitely better.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

I've had numerous failures both headsets, day one controller,&nbsp;and 2 Elite Controllers (Left bumper breaking on both).&nbsp; To Microsoft's credit they were able to replace the Day One Controller (under the consoles 1 year warranty) and they replaced 2 Elite Controllers (under the consoles 1 year warranty).&nbsp; When purchasing the Elite controller you're&nbsp;expecting a significant upgrade and between the 2 controllers I don't even get a year use out&nbsp;of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Bumper design is less than desirable.&nbsp; Now to my issue, yesterday I contacted support concerning the Headset that came with Elite Console.

<h2>            Using &#34;.folder.jpg&#34; instead of &#34;folder.jpg&#34; for a Folder Icon on Windows 7</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am attempting to use WHS 2011 in combination with a Linux-based media streaming device. The behavior for hiding files differs between the two systems (Windows: Hidden attribute, Linux: prefix file with a period).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am attempting to hide the album/media art files across both systems such that the same user experience can be established (e.g. click on a folder and play the media as opposed to the artwork).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>On Windows 7, the Folder icon displayed (under Extra Large Icon view in Windows Explorer) is based on the existence of "folder.jpg" file. When this file is prefaced with period - ".folder.jpg" the folder loses the dynamic icon.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How can i configure Windows to utilize either "folder.jpg" or ".folder.jpg" as a means of generating the folder icon?</div>
<div><br />

                    I just realized this issue with my laptop not recognizing my network cable.&nbsp; I have a wireless connection to the same network so I'm still able to connect, however, my computer won't recognize the LAN cable plugged in.&nbsp; The cable is fine and the network
 is fine.&nbsp; Several updates have installed automatically the last few days, but I have no idea which one could've affected it.&nbsp; I only started looking for answers to problems when I noticed&nbsp;I couldn't see the taskbar preview windows.&nbsp; I got that problem fixed
 with the OneCare removal tool.&nbsp; Now I need help with the network cable issue.&nbsp; Ideas?

Thank you Mr. Murphy for your prompt reply. I attempted your suggestion, but ran into some other issues. I was unable to complete a system restore. I attempted several times with every date available going back 7 days. Each time, I got an error message stating
 "unable to complete system restore for an unknown error." Or, something along those lines. I was able to change the settings for future updates. I was also able to remove the updates from this past week. Even after rebooting, my original issue still exists.
 Ideas?

<h2>            stop code&#58; critical process died</h2>
                    I am trying to fix - Stop code: CRITICAL PROCESS DIED.&nbsp; I received this issue after playing Amazing adventures - The Lost Tomb by Pop Cap.&nbsp; The tower was fairly new and this was one of the first games that I had installed; I used a CD rom.&nbsp; It's so new
 that I doesn't have a restore spot.&nbsp; I am running Windows 10.&nbsp; Every fixing process that is within Windows 10 does not work. I have removed the hard drive and can look at it by hooking it up as an external hard drive to another computer.

            Hi Melody, I am Rob, a volunteer and a 10 time and dual award MVP specializing in Windows troubleshooting and Bluescreen analysis. Please remember as volunteers we are not responsible for the development of Windows or the computer hardware and drivers. If you will work with me I will be here to help until the issue is resolved.
<br />
<br />This is what I would do with my own new computer with such a serious error.
<br />
<br />Since the computer is new and still under warranty please contact System Maker's Support and the seller. As OEM they are responsible for the proper operation of both the hardware and Windows. So regardless of the cause it is theirs to resolve. And the unit is under full warranty and may be in need of repairs or replacement. Added that even if you are able to resolve the issue you would want it fully documented just in case there are related problems down the road. Remember the more you do the more they will say it is something you have done. 
<br />
<br />=====
<br />
<br />If you really want to troubleshoot it which I don't recommend on a new computer.
<br />
<br />Here some methods to troubleshoot as well as how to make the DMP files available so I can analyze them.
<br />
<br />We can analyze the minidumps if you make them available from the OneDrive or other file sharing sites (such as MediaFire). If you have problems uploading the minidumps copy them to the Desktop or the Documents folder and upload them from there.

<br />
<br />Have you added any hardware lately? Have you updated any driver just before these started? (Check Control Panel - Windows Updates to see if any drivers were updated there about the time this started) Main likely culprits are Video driver, other major drivers, memory, and antivirus/antispyware/security products could be at fault as well as drive issues.
<br />

<br />
<br />======
<br />
<br />This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : 
<br />
<br />Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their names (and update BIOS and chipset drivers).
<br />
<br />DriverView - Free - utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.
<br /><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</a>
<br />  
<br />For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.  Right Click the Start Button - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.
<br />
<br />Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.
<br />
<br />Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples) (as rollback) and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset, and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)
<br />
<br />Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.
<br />
<br />Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.
<br />
<br />Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at Device Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.
<br />
<br />Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.

<br />
<br />=====
<br />
<br />Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory. So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show a problem.
<br />
<br />To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.  &lt;-- best method

<br />
<br />For the Windows Memory Diagnostic Tool.
<br />
<br />Type in Cortana's search box -&gt;  Windows Memory Diagnostics 
<br />at top of list - click it. in Windows 8/8.1/10 the name is "Windows Memory 
<br />Diagnostic".
<br />
<br />=====
<br />
<br />After doing ALL the updates you can, and if the issue continues, then run 
<br />DriverVerifier. (Remember to use the Windows 10 methods posted at the 
<br />top of the original reply above.)

<h2>            windows 10 making my computer unuseable and your tecks were useless. Your websites were useless</h2>
                    <div><br />
</div>


<p>
</p><p>I uploaded windows 10. Then my password would not work. I get a prompt telling me to go to a website to fix it... hard to do when your computer won't work! So a friend goes to the website that is supposed to help with your password not working&nbsp; and first
 you have to put in a password... it does not work here either!! Then you go to the help desk which is available 24/7 and trying continuously for 2 days only get "not available.....". Now I spend the next 10 days calling your techs, waiting a half hour to talk
 to them to have them refer me to the above websites... &nbsp;You explain to each one that those do not work and they just repeat them like recordings. Finally after 8 days you get sent up to a higher level tech who spends nearly 2 hours taking you through all kinds
 of things none of which work... He tells you he is setting up an appointment with a higher level tech that will call you some time in a 3 hour range 2 days later. They never call and again you are stuck in your house and unable to use your phone waiting for
 the call. So now I realize you have ruined my computer and are not going to fix it and you don't care, so I order a new computer. Then I call my internet carrier to ask about setting up my new computer and in twenty minutes they fix the whole problem.... Nice
 to do business with people who are competent and professional and a company who cares about their customers. How can you put out a product so flawed it makes our equipment useless, then hire people who are completely clueless on how to help us and not have
 any means for us to get help to fix it??? I have never been treated so negligently by any company I have done business with in 62 years. Your whole customer service department is totally useless and only serves to frustrate your customers and make them angry.
 You really need to fix this. I guess when a company gets this big and rich you can afford to make people hate you.</p>

            April, Have same issues with Microsoft. It seems like they have set up this stupid COMMUNITY site in order to avoid accountability and hiring competent people. You get to certain levels and they want to charge you hundreds of dollars to fix their problems
 which I have found solutions to through many frustrating hours myself. Microsoft, your customer service is the WORST in the WORLD. You have put so many pipes in the plumbing its too easy to plug up. maroons.<br />

            <p>They have made their money and so the geniuses have retired and the company has gone down the toilet and customers are just hung out to dry with no one to help. I suggest you all call your State's Attorney Generals Consumer Fraud Department and place a formal
 complaint. If enough people do it they will have to fix it and/or get huge fines!!</p>

            <p>A few more problems with windows-10, you can not delete a comment made on your post on Face Book, you have to repost it and delete the original. When making statements sending messages or commenting on a post the program will lock and stop your ability to
 type any thing. Also on windows 7 there was an icon at the top right of your page for your home page, now you have to go out of the internet and go back in to get to your home page. New aggravating problems found daily, who did this programing and why would
 you put something this flawed out to the public making things so difficult for us? Shows complete disrespect and contempt for your customers. Shame on you Microsoft, shame on you.</p>

            Hi Omgits
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Download and reinstall Minecraft for Windows 10 - Microsoft Store
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/minecraft-for-windows-10/9nblggh2jhxj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/minecraft-for...</a>
<br />
<br />This issue requires contacting support, let them put you through a tier 2 support so they can investigate your Microsoft Account, because that is likely where the issue lies why you can't redeem it.

<br />
<br />Is Minecraft for Windows 10 included with the purchase of Minecraft: Java Edition?
<br />Players who have purchased Minecraft: Java Edition before October 19th, 2018 can get Minecraft for Windows 10 for free by visiting their Mojang account. Log into <a href="http://account.mojang.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://account.mojang.com</a>, and under the “My Games” heading you will find a button to claim your gift code. If you purchased Minecraft: Java Edition after October 19th, 2018, the button will not be there, so if you’re unsure of when you purchased Minecraft: Java Edition, that’s a good way to check. Pressing the button will generate a token and send you to a Microsoft redemption page. 
<br /> 
<br />If you have an older Minecraft account (you still log in with your username), visit this article (<a href="https://help.mojang.com/customer/en/portal/articles/775905-migrating-from-minecraft-to-mojang" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://help.mojang.com/customer/en/portal/arti...</a>) to find out about account migration. Once you’ve migrated your account, you will be able to claim a code for Minecraft for Windows 10.
<br />You must be signed into a Microsoft/Xbox Live account in order to redeem the code. Please note that you cannot move the license once the code has been redeemed. Your code is saved on your Mojang account page for future reference.
<br /> 
<br />Having issues with your Minecraft for Windows 10 code?
<br />If you're having issues with your code that you got from your Mojang account, please contact Mojang Support.
