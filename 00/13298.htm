            <p>I have done that just a few days ago. You should first archive your emails, Outlook will generate a .PST file with all your email items. Copy it to a pen drive and paste it on your new computer. Use the import feature in Outlook 2013 to import all your emails
 again. Here are the steps in more details:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. In order to archive your emails, Open Outlook and click on<strong> Info </strong>
tab at the top and then <strong>Info</strong>.</p>
<p>2. Select <strong>Clean up tools</strong> &gt; <strong>Archive</strong>.</p>
<p>3. From the <strong>archive tool</strong>, select which folder you want to archive (Inbox, Sent items etc..) and click
<strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<p>4. Once the archive is completed, you should find your archived file (.PST) in the following location:</p>
&gt; <strong>Open &amp; Export</strong>.</p>
<p>8. That's all folks! You should now see all your emails in Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a guide with screenshots just in case you get lost: <br />

<h3> jodster  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2016 Grouping Pivot Table by dates &#40;Yr, Mo, Day&#41; does not sort correctly</h2>
                    <p>I posted this on another site and believe this is a bug in Excel.&nbsp; Had the issue in 2013 and continues in 2016.&nbsp; I have a workbook that contains a pivot table, where it's grouped by Year, Month, Day.&nbsp; When I go to update it and sort by Newest, it will not
 sort correctly.&nbsp; It will keep the correct (newest) year on top, and the newest month, but then when it comes down to the day, I do NOT get it in ascending (newest) order.&nbsp; It's all over the place.&nbsp; Something like this:</p>
<p>2016</p>
<p>&nbsp; Jul</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15-Jul</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14-Jul</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6-Jul</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8-Jul</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1-Jul</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17-Jul</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can't figure any rhyme or reason for this weird sort.</p>

            Hi Jodster,<br />
<br />
Based on your description, you have a pivot table which is grouped by Year, Month, Day. However, when you update the workbook, the pivot table cannot be sorted correctly (Only the Day fails to be sorted correctly). We suggest you try manually updating the pivot
 table by following the steps below:<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Change the information in the workbook from which the pivot table is made.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Select the pivot table&gt; Analyze&gt; Data&gt; Refresh&gt; Refresh All. <br />

this article</a> is for your reference.<br />

If the issue persists, could you please provide the information below for better investigation?<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Detailed steps and related screenshots that you created the pivot table.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A screenshot of the change you made in the workbook.<br />

            <p>Yoga Yao - thank you for your assistance.</p>
<p>So that you can see I've formatted the data in the table as a date field.&nbsp; I just updated the pivot table using the Analyze | Refresh All and you can see how it didn't put 18-Jul at the top, but under 11-Jul.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/27cd52c2-f455-470e-b9ea-8b270aa92387" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/27cd52c2-f455-470e-b9ea-8b270aa92387" /></a></p>
<p>Here's how it sorted</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/19d09180-6e35-4a1b-b0b1-fc1f522d029f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/19d09180-6e35-4a1b-b0b1-fc1f522d029f" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And here is the Pivot Table fields</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/65e5fb24-e3a2-41c8-b489-01678122495d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/65e5fb24-e3a2-41c8-b489-01678122495d" /></a></p>
<p>I can manually move the item to the correct place, but if I use the Sort Newest to Oldest, it will not sort properly.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/56a1ad47-f5e2-46bd-9088-5c569fd9b1c3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/56a1ad47-f5e2-46bd-9088-5c569fd9b1c3" /></a></p>

            Didn't know Yao if you saw my pictures , but the one thing I see different from yours and mine is on the Pivot Fields. I see you have Years, then Month, then Day. &nbsp; However I only get Years and Month to show up. In order to get Days to show I have to add
 Hours to the group. If I do that however , then in the report it displays the hour the person took the quiz and I don't want that to display.&nbsp;

            Hi Luigi
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />You may need to go for Skype for Desktop, if you are using Store version of Skype. Use below method to uninstall and install Skype to solve this problem.
<br />
<br />CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to invoke Task Manager &gt; Kill any instance of Skype.exe
<br />
<br />A. If this is UWP (Microsoft Store) Skype app of Windows - Windows Key+i &gt; Apps &gt; Click Skype and Uninstall
<br />Install Skype again from Microsoft Store. You can install from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDNCRFJ364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDN...</a>
<br />
<br />If above doesn't work -
<br />
<br />Choose to install desktop client of Skype from and use Skype for Desktop <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />B. If this is Skype for Desktop client 
<br />Copy the below line and Windows Key+R and paste into Run window by CTRL+V and Enter

<h2>            OneNote print to OneNote not working</h2>
                    We use OneNote in the classroom and one of students is having trouble printing PDF's to OneNote the way we have done all year. We open a PDF and click print and the Send to OneNote is the selected printer and when we click print instead of the Pop-Up menu
 that OneNote normally brings up so that you can select where in OneNote you want to insert the PDF the PDF is auto inserted into a different section in his OneNote. He wasn't even on that page when we went to print. It keeps defaulting to printing to this
 same section. I even tried the Insert &gt; File PrintOut, straight from OneNote and when we tried that we just got a message for over 10 mins that OneNote was trying insert but it never did and we had to cancel the insert.&nbsp;

            <p><span><span>Hello Bruni,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This issue seems to occur because OneNote has stopped asking you/user where to print and simply Prints to one of the sections in the OneNote document. This could have
 happened if the option to always print to this section was selected sometime earlier.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To resolve the issue follow these steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>In OneNote click on <strong>File &gt; Options</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Select option: <strong>Send to OneNote</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Make sure to change the option in the <strong>Print to OneNote</strong> drop-down menu to show
<strong>Always ask where to send.</strong></span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Check if the above steps help.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<h2>            File performance in 64-bit Excel 2016</h2>
                    <p>Hi -</p>
<p>I upgraded from Excel 2007 to Excel 2016, the 64-bit version. I load 200 megabyte files. When they're loaded, the action is fast. The problem is that they take a long time to load and to save, about 20 minutes or even 30 minutes. Not only that, but if I
 leave the file loaded for a long period without activity the file seems stale - entering data into a single cell takes a very long time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I close down almost every other app on my computer then Excel speeds up, but that's not the resolution I want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I downgrade to the 32-bit version, will that be faster? What about an older version of Excel?</p>
<p>

            <p>Are you using a rotating hard drive, or an SSD? (just curious, but I doubt that is your bottleneck)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you watch the performance monitor/task manager during the load, how many CPU cores show heavy load, and do they pin somewhere near 100% for most of the "load" time? Across the same time period, is disk access maxed out (again, I'm guessing not)? What
 is your total RAM and what % is still free during and after your load?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the task manager priority level on your Excel thread(s)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What does your file contain- is it effectively a flat data file, a powerpivot data set, or something else? Does it have much individual cell formatting, charts, formulas, etc?

            <p>Hi Jesrael Bor -</p>
<p>Thanks for the repair suggestion with the supplied link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I performed that repair. Earlier I had tried a quick repair. I don't know that the repairs made the difference that I now observe. I have observed that if I shut down almost everything going on with my desktop - leaving Excel with lots of resources - that
 Excel loads my 200meg files much better. Likewise, the stale quality I observed before, with loaded files taking a very long time to wake up and accept data entry, was present when I had other apps running. Now that I leave little else running, I'm not observing
 that stale quality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The lesson I'm taking from this experience is that upgrading Office 2007 to Office 2016 is not enough, that I also need to upgrade to a computer with more memory. Currently my desktop has 4 Gig of memory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I _do_ wonder if I downgraded from the Excel 2016 64-bit to the 32-bit Excel 2016 would work better for such a low memory desktop. Any ideas about that? That stale quality is quite to be avoided.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the suggestion and I welcome anything else you have to add.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Doug</p>

            <p>Hi KERATL -</p>
<p>I do all my filesaves to a Microsoft OneDrive cloud storage. I've been doing that for years and it's always worked fine. My performance hit corresponds to the upgrade to Office 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where do I find the answers to your questions about the load on the individual cores? Is that the Resource Monitor? I have two cores; the Resource Monitor shows about 100% on each of CPU 0 and CPU 1 while loading one of the larger files. Curiously, if I
 start up the game called FreeCell then CPU 0 and CPU 1 both drop down precipitously.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The files contain columns of data and graphs drawn from them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for taking so long to reply to your helpful response. I'm constantly reviewing the performance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Happy New Year!</p>

            <p>I don't use OneDrive, so hopefully someone on the forum with more experience can chime in on whether there is any potential impact between the two versions you have used (for example, different error correction checking when opening files, etc. )</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just for testing, I would suggest making a local copy of the file, and see if there is a noticeable difference. You may have a phenomenally fast connection- but in the past when I've worked with large files (80+MB) I found that local copies were faster,
 and I would just copy the file up/down from the server when I started and ended working on the file for the day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to clarify- you were already on Win10x64, using Excel 2007 (x32?) and the only software change was moving to Excel 2016 x64. No change in OS, not change in virus checker software, etc.- is that correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are correct, resource monitor is where to look at CPU utilization, RAM utilization, and thread priority (and in win 10, you have to click around to get to more detailed info- my Win10 is at home so I can't give you the specific button or menu items to
 click :) </p>
<p>I'm not enough of an expert to tell you which upgrades will have the biggest impact- you mention that your CPUs are pegged at 100%, but is that due to processing, or because you are out of RAM and it is doing lots of disk swaps? I'm not sure. RAM is generally
 cheaper than a whole-system upgrade, and with a 200B file (which always takes *way* more RAM than the filesize) I'd suggest starting by making sure you have (on an x64 OS) at least 8GB and preferably 16GB RAM, especially for your filesize. If that doesn't
 help, then you may have to consider a system upgrade to 4 (or more) cores.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, you might consider other options, like putting all that data in a database format, and accessing it using a built-in data link (or however Excel has integrated PowerPivot in newer versions, I haven't had to use that in a few years). If you
 separate your data and your analytics/graphs, then you may be able to unload the query processing (SQL queries to the server) or at least speed up how the data is stored in Excel (Powerpivot or equivalent).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry all I have are random thoughts, but hopefully something in here will help you out.</p>

            <p>Hi Keratl -</p>
<p>Sorry for the slow response, but I've been doing something regarding each paragraph that you wrote.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I changed my files to local drives with daily backup to the cloud, instead of writing to the cloud all the time. (I've lost my share of disks over the years.) There's an increase in speed, but it's more a percentage thing. The speed problem I've been having
 with Excel 2016 64-bit is by factors, probably 10x, but each modification is valuable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, the only change was the change from Excel 2007 to Excel 2016 64-bit. The change to Win 10 was in the Spring. The change to Excel 2016 64-bit was in November. No other change, including virus software. I should note that performance in the new version
 for navigation around the screen is far superior. The cursor speeds around nicely. Entering a new cell just after loading is poor though - just press enter and wait.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My main machine went down some months ago and I've been making do with an All-in-One with 4 G of memory and 2 cores. I know I need more memory, but those All-in-ones can be difficult to add memory. I'm waiting for cash flow to get better before getting a
 workhorse machine that would make these issues go away. I am aware that Excel uses multiples of the filesize for memory footprint. When a 215 Meg filesize file is being saved, the Task Manager says Excel uses more than 1 gigabyte.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I loaded the file that is about 215 Meg. After pressing enter to load the file, I read some pages in the browser. Some time later, maybe 10-15 minutes later, I took the attached image of the Resource Monitor. The Excel status showed that the file load
 is still in the early stage - maybe 10% loaded - and the Resource Monitor image shows that cores are at about 30% usage. Then I switched over to Excel having the focus and processing finished quickly, about 1 minute. I expect that the file would not have finished
 in an hour if I had not switched to Excel for the focus. That's the complaint that I'm writing about. The Excel 2007 loaded that same file using in about 2-3 minutes, but the navigation and cell entry was a dog.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Consistent with my other responses to this thread, the other performance win is gained by not having anything else running. Minimum browsers, no music, yada yada. Just Excel. Feels like a waste of time to sit and watch, but that's the only way it works to
 speed up file load.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure where to start with your database suggestion, but appreciate it. Right now money is tight. The Excel 2016 64-bit was my present to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the comprehensive response.</p>

<h2>            N73 Gives Static on Startup.</h2>
                    
<p>Yes. Just like the title says. When i boot up my N73 it just gives me static of al different colours. The thing though is the phone works fine i can ring people and what not. But cant read or see anything. I took some photos for the helping you solve this.</p>
<p>This is the screen where it just shows the word "nokia"</p>

<p><a href="http://i42.tinypic.com/2943rb4.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://i42.tinypic.com/2943rb4.jpg</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;The first time i booted it up it worked flawlessley but i dropped it with the back cover off whilst it was on charge and the battery came out.</p>
<p>From my research over google it has lead me to find that it is a fauly screen and needs to be replaced. I need to know what it is to speed up the repair process. For i bought this second hand off E-bay. This is the quote "<font><span><span><span>
 WARRANTY WILL COVER THE COSTS OF LABOUR &amp; PARTS" I hope everyone can help me because i only got the phone yesterday.</span></span></span></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>Thank you for the reply.I dont really think that it has anything to do with any data because i havnt used any of the phone memory and installed everything to my miniSD. I updated the firmware also. Still gave me the screen. But on a lighter note i sent the
 phone back to the seller today. They claim that their "technician" will have a look at the phone and run a routine check through everything that came with it and if they find a fault, they will repair it for free. Im hoping that this is a genuine guarentee
 because i would be out 40 bucks getting a new screen.</p>

<p>Hi, anyone please.</p>
<p>I have copied 3 movie clips from my PC to my E-71, so when it was completed the memory had counted the copied clips, and this confirmed while browsing it on my PC&nbsp;and it was copied to VIDEO Clips in my E-71. When I was about to play and view the movie in
 my E-71, I can't find it there, though when the memory card counted it, but if I connect the USB reader cable from my e-71 to my PC, it is there, so why I can't find it in my E-71....so what is the problem with this? anyone can help me please?</p>
<p>ASAP, thank you...</p>

<p>Hello privatesa,</p>
<p>As i am not sure not owning one of these phones myself, i think the problem lies within the fact that you dont have the required codec to play that file. You can get around this by adding the videos via Nokia PC Suite where it will convert it to a playable
 format specified for your phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope that helped.</p>

<h2>            moving podcast subscriptions to a new computer</h2>
                    <p>i bought a new computer. I am not concerned about moving content such as MP3, video, photos, and such.&nbsp; But if I want to move music playlists, not recreate them, how do I do this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also subscribe to a number of podcasts.&nbsp; Is there a easy way of moving my subscriptions from one computer to another, keeping track of podcasts that I have already listened to?</p>

            <p>Hi Bruce, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can help you with this!&nbsp; Migrating a playlist is easy to do.&nbsp; Here is the easiest way.</p>
<p>1. Sync the playlist to your device&nbsp;from the old computer.</p>
<p>2. Set up the Zune software on the New Computer, and make sure that&nbsp;all of your music is on the new computer, and is recognized by the Zune software.</p>
<p>3. Connect your device with the playlist to the new computer. In the Zune software, click on the device icon( in the lower left of the screen), to be taken to the sync summary.&nbsp; Then Click on Music, and then on Playlists.&nbsp; Locate the playlist that you want,
<strong>Right click</strong> on it and choose <strong>Copy to My Collection, </strong>
as long as the songs are on the new computer as well, you will have no trouble accessing the playlist, and that way, you don't have to create it all over again!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as your Podcasts are concerned, subscriptions are local to the machine, so you will need to re-subscribe to a podcast on your new computer. Unfortunatley, because of this, your podcast status should not transfer over. As far as moving the podcasts
 themselves is concerned, you could either, sync the podcasts from your Zune into the collection on the new PC, or if you have removable media (flash drive, external drive,etc) you could copy the files over manually.&nbsp; This is good if a podcast episode is no
 longer available. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also simply download podcasts to the new pc, and you willl be all set!&nbsp; I hope that this has helped you!</p>

    <title>Exporting Access Table to Sharepoint and preserving Primary key - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Exporting Access Table to Sharepoint and preserving Primary key references &#40;&#42;Solved with Workaround&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I've an issue which has had me stumped for some time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Access Database which I need to export to Sharepoint - i.e. exporting tables to Sharepoint as Lists. The tables refer to each other within the DB (relationships within queries). For example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>tblCustomers has a Primary Key (Autonumbered) called CustomerID</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is refered to in (for example) tblSales (which has the Primary key SalesID) - which has a column called "customerID"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Likewise, a table tblSalesLines will have a Primary Key called SaleslineID and will refer to tblSales with a column called salesID</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are many relationships between tables; this is just a nice easy example....</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7c78afc1-0235-4adf-a0d9-e46a67474440" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7c78afc1-0235-4adf-a0d9-e46a67474440" height="233" width="458" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is that, since the database has been used; the ID numbers are not sequential - there are "missing" numbers as records have, over time, been deleted. This isn't an issue until you try to move things to Sharepoint.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The export Sharepoint takes the Primary Key / Autonumber and re-indexes it. So, for example, if my first entry before exporting:</p>
<p>
</p><p>customerID = 3</p>
<p>
</p><p>after exporting, customerID = 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you might expect, this is pretty terminal - suddenly anything refering to the customerID will be wrong, orphaning some records - or simply referring to the wrong one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the past, I've got round this by writing a query to update the referring child record with the Old ID. With many tables and thousands of records though; this is now a devastating task. So the question is:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Is it possible to export from Access to a Sharepoint list and preserve the original primary key value?
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Oddly; reversing the process (convert an existing sharepoint list to a local table in access) - the Primary Key values are always preserved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please refer to the article below:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Move-the-tables-in-an-Access-database-to-a-SharePoint-site-and-link-to-them-ff92130c-e33a-494a-b895-e9093cae7a6c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Move the tables in an Access database to a SharePoint site
 and link to them</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you would refer to the limitations of migration, it's written that SharePoint sites do not support referential integrity;</span><span> referential integrity is not enforced in the relationships between data in the lists, which is why when exporting
 to a database, the primary key is re-indexed.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Given the situation,<span>&nbsp; </span>we suggest you submit your idea via <a href="https://sharepoint.uservoice.com/forums/329214-sites-and-collaboration/category/144150-lists" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Hello Karina:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to the forum regarding your issue getting a Windows 7 phone recognized by the Zune software.&nbsp; I just wanted to follow up to see if you had a chance to follow some of 7thSense's suggestions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the computer is recognizing the device by the software is not, this is often a certificate issue.&nbsp; Please try the following steps one more time:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TRUST the ZUNE CERTIFICATE:</p>
<ol>
<li>Close the Zune software and disconnect your phone from your computer.</li><li>Open <b>Certificate Manager</b>. To do this, click <b>Start</b>, type <b>certmgr.msc</b> in the Start search bar, and then press your
<b>Enter</b> key.<br />
<b><br />
Windows 8 users:</b> On the Start screen, type <b>Certificate</b>, tap or click <b>
Settings </b>in the right column, and then tap or click <b>Manage computer certificates</b>.</li><li>In the pop-up window, tap or click the <b>Personal</b> folder in the left column, and then double tap or double click the
<b>Certificates</b> folder in the right column.</li><li>Click the heading that says <b>Issued By</b> to sort the column, and then look for one or more certificates that read "zune-tuner://windowsphone/...".</li><li>Right-click the certificate file and click <b>Copy</b>. If there is more than one file, hold the Ctrl key, click each file, then right-click a file and click
<b>Copy</b>.</li><li>Tap or click the <b>Trusted Root Certification Authorities </b>folder in the left column, right-click the
<b>Certificates </b>folder, and then click <b>Paste</b>.</li><li>Click <b>Yes </b>to install this certificate.</li></ol>
<p>CREATE a NEW CERTIFICATE:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<li>Close the Zune software and disconnect your phone from your computer.</li><li>Open <b>Certificate Manager</b>, if it is not already open. To do this, click
<b>Start</b>, type <b>certmgr.msc</b> in the Start search bar, and then press your
<b>Enter</b> key.<b><br />
Windows 8 users:</b> On the Start screen, type <b>Certificates</b>, tap or click <b>
Settings </b>in the right column, and then tap or click <b>Manage computer certificates</b>.</li><li>In the window, tap or click the <b>Personal</b> folder in the left column, and then double tap or double click the
<b>Certificates</b> folder in the right column.</li><li>Click the heading that says <b>Issued By</b> to sort the column, and then look for one or more certificates that read "zune-tuner://windowsphone/...".</li><li>Right-click each certificate file, click <b>
Delete, </b>and then click <b>Yes</b>.</li><li>Tap or click <b>File </b>in the menu, then
<b>Exit</b>.</li><li>Click <b>Start </b>and in the search box enter
<b>%userprofile%\Application Data\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA</b>, and then press <b>Enter</b>.<b><br />
Windows 8 users:</b> Right-click in the lower left-hand corner of the screen and tap or click
<b>Run</b>, or type <b>Windows Key </b>+ <b>R</b>, and then type the string above.
<br />
<b>Note </b>For some enterprise customers, the string will be <b>%userprofile%</b><b>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Crypto
</b>instead.</li><li>Find the folder that begins with "S-1-5-21-".</li><li>Right-click the folder and then click <b>
Rename</b>. Rename the folder so that it ends in .bak. This means you will likely be adding ".bak" to the end of the number.<br />
<br />
<b>Note </b>If there is more than one folder that begins with "S-1-5-21-", try this procedure with one folder at a time. If it does not work, rename the folder to the original name and try the next folder.</li><li>As soon as you're done, open your Zune software and connect your phone to your computer. This creates a new certificate and folder.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you continue to have trouble with the phone being recognized, please try another PC.&nbsp; There is a chance the issue you are having is related to the phone itself.&nbsp; If you can get the phone detected by another computer
 then it is unlikely to be the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let us know if you have any additional questions or concerns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark W.</p>

 if you can disable the Flight mode. Alternatively, reset your phone by going to <strong>
Settings &gt; about &gt; reset your phone</strong>. If possible, create a backup first to avoid data loss. If the issue persists, we recommend recovering your phone's software using the Windows Phone Recovery Tool:

<h2>            Images in Signature not aligning all the way to the left.</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to make a signature that is comprised of professionally designed images.</p>
<p>There are 2 main JPEGS next to each other containing company logo and contact details.</p>
<p>Below that are 4 separate images that I plan to hyperlink to the relevant social media sites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried copying the whole lot into word and pasting into Outlook but whatever I try there is a gap to the left of the images.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been searching for hours for a solution, can anyone let me know if it's possible and if so how I go about doing it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be eternally grateful, thanks in advance.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Let me help you rectify the issue&nbsp;on&nbsp;how the images on your Email signature are displayed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We need to know more about the issue for us to be able to identify its root cause and help us come up with a resolution to it. Please provide a screenshot of your Email signature, and the exact steps that you had performed in the Private Message tab that
 I have opened for you. We also need the answers to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you encounter the same issue if you try&nbsp;viewing your Email signature on other browsers?</li><li>Does the same issue happen when adding the Email signature on another Microsoft account?</li><li>What happened when trying to add a single image?</li></ul>
<p>We are looking forward for those details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: You need to sign into this website <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
and click the link that states, "You have a private reply to this message..." or click
<strong>Private Messages</strong> across <strong>All Replies</strong> to see the tab.</span></p>

<p>On Table tab, click "Options"</p>
<p>My left (and right) margin was set to 0.19cm, I changed that to 0, then copied over to Outlook again and the gap on the left was gone.</p>

                    <p>Hi, I have a 5 user Office 365 licence, and was recently prompted to upgrade to Office 2016. &nbsp;I did so and all went well on the 1st machine (Win 8.1.) however on the 2nd machine (also Win 8.1.) whilst the Outlook client appears fine, it can not send or receive
 emails. &nbsp;Incoming emails can be seen arriving but are completely blank (no sender, subject or content). &nbsp;they end up at the bottom of my inbox. &nbsp;Outgoing emails simply sit in the Outbox. &nbsp;I have tried reinstalling Office 2016. &nbsp;i have also recreated the email
 accounts. Please advise, thanks.</p>

<h2>            That key can&#39;t be used to activate this edition of Windows</h2>
                    <p>I have successfully installed the&nbsp;Technical Preview for Consumer on a bootable virtual hard drive (created in windows 8.1) which I then added to the UEFI boot manager.<br />
The problem is when I try enter <span style="color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1)">
NKJFK-GPHP7-G8C3J-P6JXR-HQRJR&nbsp;</span>as the product key it says "That key can't be used to activate this edition of windows. Please try a different key."</p>
<p>Because windows is not activated, I cannot check for Preview Builds :(</p>
<p>Is there some other key that can activate windows or do I just have to live with it, or is the issue with it booting from a VHD with windows 8.1 still installed?</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<h2>            Publisher incompatabilities between 2010 and 2016</h2>
                    <p>I am finding a number of Publisher documents I originally created in Publisher 2010 on Windows 7 are spaced differently when I open them in Publisher 365 on Windows 10, and vice versa.&nbsp; This is very problematic when I create a Publisher document in 365 and
 then open it in Publisher 2010 (Windows 7 machine) to print - I am finding that the text that fitted perfectly is now overflowing all the text boxes.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Is this a known problem, and are there any workarounds?&nbsp; If I update Windows 7 to Windows 10 (but leaving Publisher 2010 installed on it) is it likely to fix it?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>

            <p>Publisher 2010 and newer will render some fonts a different size on Win8 and Win10 than it did on Win7 and older. While you could 'solve' the problem by moving to Win10 on both machines I personally cannot recommend that as I won't accept the mandatory updates/upgrades/patches
 in Win10. Until MS changes that and gives back the control over what patches and drivers to download I won't run Win10.</p>

</p><p>If you are comfortable with Win10 then switching from Win7 will fix your problem. However if you want to keep running Win7 then you can identify what fonts are reflecting the text rendering problem and copy over the Win7 font version to the Win10 machine.
 Personally I would rename the Win10 font I want to replace as 'font.tff' to 'font.old' rather than delete it, and then copy over the the Win7 version of that font to the Win10 machine. That way I could always go back if I want to.</p>

</p><p>Here are two of the most recent discussions of this issue:</p>
<p>
</p><div><span>October 2015 - Reference: <span>Fonts in Publisher 2010:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-publish/fonts-in-publisher-2010/9874dea3-4d6f-40f2-8772-2995f0bc6e5a">

 versions of the fonts.</span></span></div>

 limited to Pub 2013 and probably 2010. If you install Pub 2007 or 2003 in Win10, Win8, Win7, WinVista or WinXP then the files still render text the same and are cross OS compatible.</span></p>

    <title>How to unlink my personal and business office accounts&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> frederickzh  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to unlink my personal and business office accounts&#63;</h2>
                    <p>
I'm using OneDrive for iOS and every time I log into my personal account, my two business accounts are also added to the available list (but I have to enter the passwords to use them).</p>
<p>
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fsocial.technet.microsoft.com%2fForums%2fgetfile%2f1224428" /></p>
<p>
This is pretty annoying as I use only one of these university accounts and it's hard to tell the difference between them.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fsocial.technet.microsoft.com%2fForums%2fgetfile%2f1224429" /></p>
<p>
So I cleared the account settings and noticed that:</p>
<ol>
<li>If I log into my personal account, the two business ones are automatically added</li><li>If I log into either of the business accounts, the personal one is automatically added as well</li></ol>
<p>
It seems that my business accounts are somehow "linked" to my personal one although I definitely have not done any "linking" on my own.</p>
<p>
How can I "unlink" them, or, remove one of the business accounts independently? Thanks.</p>

<p>Here's the solution from the official support:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Sign into an office client application with your personal account.</li><li>Under Connected Services, remove anything that you do not want listed.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I used Office Word for Mac to perform this and the unwanted accounts just stopped showing up anymore.</p>

                    We have several teachers using MS Classroom and loving it; however, they each have new students who have come in from a different school and have been added to the class but can't access any of the assignments that had a start date of before they were
 added even if the assignments are still open for submissions. What are we doing wrong?

            <p><span>Hi Andrea,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I’d like to explain the newly added users cannot see assignments which were created before adding them. Those assignments are assigned to existing users in the class. Moreover,
 re-editing the former assignment won’t re-assign it to the newly added students. As a workaround, teacher may recreate the assignment and post it to all students in the class. Let those students who have already finished the assignment ignore it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We understand it will be more convenient if newly added students can see the former assignments or teachers can re-post the assignments to specific students. It is suggested
 you post your feedback via <a href="https://edu.uservoice.com/forums/289447-general/category/165585-microsoft-classroom" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            I'm using OS X Yosemite 10.10.5 and Office 2016. Excel says it is version 15.19.1 (160212) - is that what you need?

            <p>Yes, thank you. Your software and Mac OS are up to date and that is good. Now we can move forward.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A simple troubleshooting step to perform is to do a </span><a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/PH21875?viewlocale=en_US&amp;locale=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 153, 1)">Safe Boot</span></strong></a><span>. It will
 take a long time for your Mac to start up in Safe Mode. When you do a Safe Boot in El Capitan Apple's Disk Utility the font cache is emptied. Only a limited number of fonts are enabled. Applications that run at startup don't run automatically.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Once you reach the desktop in Safe Mode try running Excel. Is the crash still there? If not, then maybe simply performing a Safe Boot fixed the ailment. Or perhaps one of the fonts that wasn't loaded is bad. Or perhaps some other software utility is
 interfering. After testing in Safe Mode, do regular restart. Try Excel again. Is the crash still there?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the crash was gone in Safe Mode but returns during a regular boot then there are more things to try. The first would be to use a font utility to validate ALL your fonts. Mac OS comes with a free font utility called
</span><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201749" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>Font Book</span></strong></a><span>. Get rid of any font that doesn't pass as clean and green, restart your Mac and then empty the trash. If you've gotten
 this far and still have a crash, then there are more things to explore. But if you get this far you've probably gotten rid of the crash. Either way, please reply with your results.</span></p>

<h2>            microsoft access class objects</h2>
                    I'm building an Access database, and I created a Class object in VBA for a form to control what input text boxes are visible depending on the value of another text box on the form.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I want to add another class object for the corresponding table to control the value of corresponding records in VBA. &nbsp;How do I add another object to the Microsoft Access Class folder? &nbsp;The only thing I seem to be able to do is create a new class module.</div>

            A class module is&nbsp;single object, so if you want a new class, then it needs its own class module.&nbsp; You can expand your current class by adding additional procedures but if you want a new class, it goes into its own module, just like a form is a class object,
 a report is a class object.
