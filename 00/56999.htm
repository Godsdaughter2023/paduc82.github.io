<h2>            Xbox live gold not recognized in Destiny 2</h2>
                    <p>Destiny 2 no longer recognizes that I have Xbox live gold. I have the subscription until 12/23/2018. I have done multiple hard resets on my router and console. I have deleted my account from my console and reinstalled. Other gold required services seem to be unaffected. I just downloaded a&nbsp;Games with Gold title without complication. This started a few days ago.</p>

    <title>System performance issue after Windows Updates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jessicarubel  say:</h3>
<h2>            System performance issue after Windows Updates</h2>
                    <p>Since the new Windows 10 update (February 2019), my computer has been gradually slowing to a crawl. I used to be able to run google&nbsp;chrome, Spotify, Discord, and maybe a game at the same time with little to no slowdown. This past week, even running two of
 those programs at the same time leads to constant hanging, freezing, and on one occassion, my entire computer locking up so I had to restart it. I haven't downloaded any new programs and ran several antivirus&nbsp;programs to make sure that wasn't the cause. The
 only thing I could think of that could cause this was the recent Windows update. I ran the windows troubleshooter, and all it did was tell me that my apps were hanging and crashing. Nothing on how to fix that-&nbsp;<em>very</em> helpful (/sarcasm). Even after several
 cleanup&nbsp;programs, the computer is still aggravatingly slow. Any advice on how to fix this is welcome.</p>

<p>Hi RameshGautam1,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for that, in Skype for Business conference meeting, we can't set up the presentation permission you want, if you show some presentation during the meeting, all members can see these presentation, we can't&nbsp;customize who can see and who can't see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a&nbsp;unperfect workaround, you show the presentation to all members firstly, then open another meeting for these&nbsp;specific members and show the presentation for them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, for your&nbsp;precious thought on Skype for Business presentation's permission, we would love to invite you leave this thought on
<strong><em><a href="https://www.skypefeedback.com/forums/299913-generally-available" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Skype for Business UserVoice</a></em></strong>, our related team will be happy to work with you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

                    <p>Windows 10 </p>
<p>SurfaceBook i7</p>
<p>
</p><p>When sketching in Photoshop CC I notice significant delay, inaccuracy and choppiness in my strokes if I'm dragging the side of my hand as a guide vs. only the pen tip touching the surface.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know from a lifetime of sketching that my strokes are more accurate when I drag the edge of my hand. It seems that the double touch (pen &amp; hand) is causing a processing delay. Is there a way to fix this?&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Jolu, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

            To know what exactly is causing the crashes, I need to analyze minidumps generated by crashes with WinDBG. WinDBG is the only tool which can do end to end complete analysis of ..dmp files generated by BSOD (Blue screen of death).
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Minidump 
<br />Zip the contents of the folder corresponding to date and time of your crashes. 
<br />Upload the content to Onedrive or any other file sharing site for me to locate the problem
<br />

<h2>            Tampering, DDOS, Cheating, Hacking</h2>
                    
<p>This post was suggested to me by 2 xbox live/Microsoft support team members to create a post on the MGSV forums in relations to users suspected of tampering, ddosing, cheating, or hacking. If you know anyone who you suspect of these things place their names
 here. Not entirely sure if xbox enforcement teams read this forum but it is helpful to atleast get people to report a user.</p>
<p>Suspect's Username: Rage Quit Girls</p>

<p>Incident(s): while playing FOB this user had attacked my base several times. Anyone who has played FOB knows you can attack users when they are offline. All fair game as it is part of the actual game. However, if you are someone who is supporting you is
 online you are able to defend the base. 28 attempts of me being online to defend against this one user have resulted in me being disconnected from server immediately after enter my FOB and shortly after xbox live disconnection and internet connection as a
 whole. When reported to my ISP these span last from around 5 to 20 minutes beginning when I first came in contact with this person via FOB. Unknown if i have played against this person in MGO. Never messaged, friend requested, or invited this person to party.
 When I attack this user and he/she is online to defend their base I have never been disconnected once which makes me believe this isn't a port issue. FoB is built to give defenders the strong advantage against attackers. This increases even more when a human
 defender is present along with the cpu. This makes me believe this person is attacking my ip address and overloading the ping enough to kick me offline so that he/she may attack my base without the present of a human defender. There isn't a need to kick me
 offline when i attack their base since the attacker is a hige disadvantage as it is.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please, report this player if you come into contact with the user Rage Quit Girls so that she may be investigated for breaking the code of conduct. Please list any users referring to MGSV: TPP that may be cheating so they can be reported and investigated.</p>

<p>Suspect's Username: RedWickedSonic</p>
<p>Incident(s): similar to the previous post this user can attack my base and I am unable to defend it while I can attack their base and they will be present with no connection interference. A slight difference in that session can not even be started once the
 emergency mission signals that said person is attacking my base. I was able to have a supporter support my base once against this defender just to see if this is just for me or just a bad connection. He was able to get in no trouble. Again, I have had to attempt
 to defend my base against this user several times but I am unable to. This person also seems to acquire nukes very easily from other users which suggests that I am not the only one that is being done to.</p>
<p>Please, report this player if you come into contact with user RedWickedSonic so that he/she may be investigated for breaking the code of conduct. Please list any users referring to MGSV:TPP that may be cheating so they can be reported and investigated.</p>
<p>Note: No player is condemned of cheating just suspected base on certain situations in place that make it likely that they are breaking Microsoft's Code of Conduct policy to gain an advantage.

<p>streetdzine....the exact same thing is happening to me with RedWickedSonic - reported, but I doubt it does any good seeing that it's still going on over 2 months later. &nbsp;And it seems the reporting system doesn't even ask for a description of what's happening.
 &nbsp;Even if somebody did actually look into the complaint, what are they going to look for?</p>

<h2>            Asus AI Suite 3 causing issues until uninstall</h2>
                    <p>**Title changed by Community Moderator from "Windows 10 is slow and at times unresponsive following the anniversary update" to reflect the actual issue for those searching web**</p>
<p>
</p><p>Following the windows 10 anniversary update my pc is slow and at times unresponsive and then catches up with itself.</p>
<p>I have tried to see if there are any tasks causing additional workflow but the PC should be at idle.</p>
<p>Before the update, windows zipped around and was&nbsp;a pleasure to use. Now it seems like running the UI is too demanding for it.</p>
<p>Another trait with this unresponsiveness is when you click on the triangle on the task bar which hides active programs. This window pops up blank until you move your cursor over some of the icons. Will this be fixed in an update? I don't think this update
 was ready to be released to everyone. And no I would prefer not to do a fresh install of windows. This was meant to be a simple update which resolved bugs, not created them!</p>
<p>
</p><p>On another note, my external hard drive which was connected via usb 3.0 is now not accessible to view/access which happens to be a huge coincidence following this update (Seagate Backup Plus 4TB using supplied software to map it as a drive letter).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions would be appreciated.</p>

            I have managed to sort out my external hard drive issue by repairing program/registry. It would have been nice to be told to disconnect external hard drives in advance. Just the performance bugs to sort out now.

            <p>It would seem that windows 10 built in apps (Mail, calculator) respond perfectly fine when typing. If I use a program I have installed, e.g. evernote, Microsoft office word, excel, Google chrome then there is a huge delay in text appearing on screen.</p>
<p>At the moment I am typing this response via Edge and it seems to be operating normally.</p>

            Checking the Reliability Monitor shows DipAwayMode.exe stopped working under the Critical events section. Is the performance issues I am experiencing related to this program/service?

            Turns out DipAwayMode.exe is related to Asus and their AI Suite. You can disable it from auto starting in Task Scheduler under the Asus section. Why the Anniversary update has caused this program to crash so frequently I do not know. By disabling it I
 have still experienced slow responses from the system UI.

            <p>My computer is also slow and unresponsive since the WIndows 10 anniversary update.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, switching from a tab to another one in Task manager takes between a few seconds and a few dozen seconds.
</p>
<p>Using Windows + R takes 10-20 seconds.</p>
<p>It sometimes takes 10-20 seconds in the File explorer to do anything, such as select files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And the task manager shows no extreme CPU/Memory or Disk usage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only difference with before was an unknown device in device manager for ROOT\USBKCXTRLER\0000 / ven_1934&amp;devven_1934&amp;dev_1205.</p>
<p>I tried to update the driver but was told the peripheral was driverless.</p>
<p>I uninstalled it to no avail.</p>
<p>I removed all USB peripherals but the keyboard and mouse to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So I uninstalled the update after a day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just reinstalled it, hoping that with almost a month after the launch, the problems would be fixed.</p>
<p>That's unfortunately not the case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to see if there were any updates for the Asus Z97-A motherboard: there were only an update for Intel management interface and Realtek sound card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed both to no improvement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I will soon cross my fingers &amp; try to go back to the pre anniversary update if Microsoft does not come with a solution soon. A simple search for ven_1934&amp;devven_1934&amp;dev_1205 or ROOT\USBKCXTRLER\0000&nbsp;shows many people have trouble since the anniversary
 update. And I see no communication from Microsoft: is it aware of the problem, is it working on a fix, has it identified an internal problem or an incompatibility with HW/SW from partner, etc.</p>

            <p>So I seem to have isolated the problem: Windows 10 anniversary does not like Asus AI Suite 3, which came with my motherboard Asus Z97-A.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Uninstalling it makes the computer fast and responsive again.</p>
<p>Reinstalling it makes the computer slow and unresponsive again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, while I don't need all the features of the software, I do need the automatic management of cooling &amp; fans.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope Microsoft will contact Asus to fix the problem.</p>

            Hi, I was collating all the necessary drivers ready for a fresh install and see that Asus has the following suite released on 16/08/2016&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">AI_Suite_III_V1_01_46_For_9_Series.
 I am not with my computer to try it out at thr moment. What is weird is that after several hours of the PC being on, it sometimes regains performance. I will try the uninstall and new suite when i return home.</span>

            <p>True, but I'm getting tired of reinstalling Windows 10 and btw my Win 10 install is no more than a month all after a full reinstall following Insider builds. This is at a minimum a 1 day endeavour with many applications to reinstall and reconfigure, and
 some nasty ones for whom I have to ask the software editor everytime to delete my computer from their authorization&nbsp;database, so that I can re-register them again: at a minimum another day or two lost, since they never implemented a do it yourself licence
 management with register/unregister.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, this isn't an OS version update and the new way Windows 10 updates, should make a full clean reinstall an artifact of the past.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding your integrity checklist, I've always had inconsistent and underwhelming experience with sfc and dism. On a brand new full clean full new disk formatting/partitioning Win 10 install then fully patched, sfc will, or used to before anniversary, complain.</p>

            <p>The anniversary upgrade seems to destroy or corrupt some files.</p>
<p>I've seen that in effect, the configuration of the Asus AI&nbsp;Suite 3 was destroyed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I've rerun the configuration manager, aka '5 way optimization' 2 times in a row and now things seem to work normally - most of the time. There still are periods of unresponsiveness here and there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows PIN login did not work after the anniversary update, so I hope there aren't too many undiscovered nasty data corruption yet to be found.</p>

<p>Hi Kingswood11,</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Windows Forum.</p>
<p>I will need some more information to assist you better.<br />
a)&nbsp;Are you referring the Parental control within Operating System or Windows Live Parental Control?</p>
<p>I you are referring Parental control within operating system, you may configure the Windows 7 Parental Control following the steps mentioned below:</p>
<p>Parental controls help you manage how you want others to use the computer. For example, you can set limits on the hours that your children can use the computer, the types of games they can play, and the programs they can run.</p>
<p>When Parental Controls blocks access to a game or program, a notification is displayed that the program has been blocked. Your child can click a link in the notification to request permission for access to that game or program. You can allow access by entering
 your account information.</p>
<p>Note: To Set up Parental Controls for any user, you'll need your own administrator user account. Before you get started, make sure each user/person that you want to set up Parental Controls for has a standard user account. Parental Controls can be applied
 only to standard user accounts.</p>
<p>Steps to Apply Parental Controls:</p>
<p>1. Click the Start button to view the Start Menu and then choose the Control Panel option.<br />
2. The Control Panel window opens up. Click on the All Control Panel Items.<br />
3. Window shows all control panel items. Click on Parental Controls.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation. Window opens up.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the standard user account that you want to set Parental Controls for. Eg. Click on Child account.<br />
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under Parental Controls, click On, enforce current settings.<br />
6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you've turned on Parental Controls for your child's standard user account, you can adjust the following individual settings that you want to control:<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Time limits. Click Time Limits. You can set time limits to control when children are allowed to log on to the computer. Time limits prevent children from logging on during the specified hours. You can set different logon hours for every day of the
 week. If they're logged on when their allotted time ends, they'll be automatically logged off. Click Ok.<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Games. Click on Games. You can control access to games, choose an age-rating level, choose the types of content you want to block, and decide whether you want to allow or block unrated or specific games.<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specify which games children can play. Click on Set game ratings, the window opens up.<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Block or allow specific games.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allow or block specific programs. You can prevent children from running programs that you don't want them to run.<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Choose the option Child can only use the programs I allow and check the programs from the list you want to allow and click Ok.<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Ok to apply Parental Controls to the account Child.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            After having spent an obscene amount of time researching this stupid Bluetooth nonsense this week, I have finally settled on a solution.
<div><br />
<div><u><b>This is How to Resolve the "Bluetooth Peripheral Device Doesn't Have a Driver:"</b></u></div>
<div><br />
<div>I am using the following hardware in a dozen different tests:</div>
<div>-- &nbsp;Only Broadcom-based USB dongles from Belkin and Targus</div>
<div>-- &nbsp;Windows 7 Professional 64-bit on four different computers</div>
<div>-- &nbsp;4 different Bluetooth headsets: One Plantronics, one Matrix and two Motorolas</div>
<div>-- &nbsp;Bluetooth file transfer was not of interest, but I did test with two different phones</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>This guide will be most useful for those with similar hardware configurations... and for those who have tried all the other nonsense to no avail. &nbsp;Especially that oft-repeated "Just install Windows Mobile Device Manager."</b></div>
<div><br />
<div>-- -- --</div>
<div><br />
<div>Step 1: Ignore 99% of what you think you've learned about this problem.</div>
<div><b>It will *most likely* boil down to a missing COM port.</b></div>
<div><br />
<div>Step 2: <b>Definitely</b> ignore the bit about installing the Windows Mobile Device Center</div>
<div>(Unless you have a Windows Mobile-based phone and/or have some other use for a Windows 7 flavor of Activesync.)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Step 3: Stop looking for a driver for something named a "Bluetooth Peripheral Device."&nbsp;</div>
<div><b>There ain't no such thing.</b> If you watch the Bluetooth installation unfold, you'll notice that all the components of Bluetooth start out as "Bluetooth Peripheral Device," and then once Windows IDs each item, the appropriate driver is installed and
 the name changes from "Bluetooth Peripheral Device" to something like "Bluetooth Hands-free Audio" or "Bluetooth Remote Control" etc.</div>
<div><br />
<div>-- -- --</div>
<div><br />
<div>Unfortunately, most people reading this will have attempted one or more of the following:</div>
<div>1.) Installing that stupid Windows Mobile Device Center</div>
<div>2.) Installing any number of who-knows-what Bluetooth drivers from who-knows-where</div>
<div>3.) Running all sorts of third-party driver utilities</div>
<div>4.) Forcing various driver installations to run in Vista, XP, or Win98 mode</div>
<div>5.) Sacrificing countless animals</div>
<div><br />
<div>The end result is a plethora of totally unnecessary software and/or driver installations and/or updates... and a few dead animals.</div>
<div><br />
<div>-- -- --</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>Instead, here's the solution.</b> &nbsp;I've tested it with three different USB Dongles (2 Belkin and 1 Targus) and on four different machines: HP, Sony, Toshiba and another HP. Two were newly un-boxed with Windows 7 64-bit Professional and two were upgraded
 from Vista to the same OS.</div>
<div><br />
<div>With each machine I connected the following headsets: a Plantronics Voyager Legend, Motorola S9, Motorola S805 and Matrix AF62 as well as one Samsung S3 and one HTC Android.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So I suppose it's fair to say that this is a solution for one of these dongles... but in reality, the majority of Broadcomm-based USB dongles will be affected. I ran through these steps on four different boxes after verifying that the stupid "<u>Bluetooth
 Peripheral Device Doesn't Have a Driver"</u></div>
<div>surfaced during installation.</div>
<div><br />
<div>1.) If you have done any of the fruitless steps mentioned above, get into control panel and delete everything you installed. &nbsp;Kill any Broadcomm or Widcomm bluetooth entries. Delete any 3rd-party driver maintenance apps.
<b>Reboot to a clean machine.</b></div>
<div><br />
<div>2.) Locate and install either Broadcomm Driver 6.0.1.6300 OR 6.2.1.500. &nbsp;Either one works, but the latter (more recent) has far better Bluetooth device management tools. &nbsp;I tested the installation of both separately and also starting with 6.0.1.6300 and
 then upgrading to 6.2.1.500.</div>
<div>(Ignore the stupid Broadcomm Driver Updater that they are pushing at their website -- it is useless for the majority of us out there.)</div>
<div><br />
<div>3.) As you install one of the above drivers, you'll see a notification regarding the installation of the various components. &nbsp;Click on that pop-up and watch the progression. &nbsp;You'll see that each "Bluetooth Peripheral Device" gets a new name as the related
 driver is installed. &nbsp;In my dozen+ tests, each &amp; every item at this stage got the green checkmark of success.</div>
<div><br />
<div>4.) NOW attempt to pair the device of your choosing. &nbsp;IF that manufacturer provides separate drivers, do not install them yet, regardless of their instructions. &nbsp;See how far Windows gets on its own.</div>
<div><br />
<div>5.) As soon as the pairing begins, you'll see more notifications regarding the individual driver components. &nbsp;Click on one of these and watch a similar progression... EXCEPT that you will have one "<u>Bluetooth Peripheral Device"</u>&nbsp;with the dreaded Red
 X and the complaint that no driver was found.</div>
<div><br />
<div>6.) Do not despair! This will happen the first time you pair any new Bluetooth device.</div>
<div><br />
<div>7.) Wait for the installation to complete. &nbsp;Despite the dialog showing the list of Bluetooth components with the one red X, you probably have another window saying that the Bluetooth device paired perfectly. &nbsp;But you and I know it didn't. Confidently click
 to close that dialog.</div>
<div><br />
<div>8.) Go to Device Manager (through Control Panel, Computer properties) and you'll spot that cursed&nbsp;<u>Bluetooth Peripheral Device</u>&nbsp;that is sitting there in the middle under "Other Devices."</div>
<div><br />
<div>9.) Right-click on the&nbsp;<u>Bluetooth Peripheral Device</u>&nbsp;with the yellow exclamation under "Other Devices" and choose "Update Driver" -- then:</div>
<div>&nbsp; Click on:</div>
<div>&nbsp; a.) Browse my computer for driver Software</div>
<div>&nbsp; b.) Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer</div>
<div>&nbsp; c.) In the list of Common hardware types, choose:</div>
<div><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ---&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &nbsp; Ports (COM &amp; LPT) &nbsp;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;---</b></div>
<div>&nbsp; d.) Under Manufacturer, choose Microsoft</div>
<div>&nbsp; e.) Under Model, choose "Standard Serial over Bluetooth Link" &amp; click 'Next'</div>
<div>&nbsp; f.) &nbsp;When prompted with the Update Driver Warning, click 'Yes'</div>
<div>&nbsp; g.) Joyfully read the message that "Windows has successfully updated your driver software"</div>
<div>&nbsp; h.) Read it again for the fun of it and click 'Close'</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;i.) To confirm that this mess is really fixed (assuming compatible hardware, etc.) Right-click on the Bluetooth device and choose "Troubleshoot" -- there should be no problems reported.</div>
<div><br />
<div>10.) You should not have to reboot, but you <u>MIGHT</u> need to cycle the power of your Bluetooth device Off &amp; Back on to let it reconnect again (NOT re-Pair... just re-Connect). Out of a dozen tests, I only had to do this once, and that was with a 3-year-old-Bluetooth
 headset.</div>
<div><br />
<div>-- -- --</div>
<div><br />
<div>I backed my way into the solution by installing on a Vista machine where everything worked perfectly. &nbsp;After installing the various devices under Vista, I spotted the COM Port in the Device Manager -- that was the only item that didn't appear in the Windows
 7 installation... but instead was left as the dreaded "Bluetooth Peripheral Device."</div>
<div><br />
<div>The Windows Mobile thingy only worked <u>for some people</u>&nbsp;because it was basically tackling a bunch of different hardware possibilities... but for those who didn't have success it was because the Windows Mobile Kitchen Sink approach did not include
 the COM Port driver.</div>
<div><br />
<div>-- -- --</div>
<div><br />
<div>I purposefully did not include any links to drivers as a.) links change, and b.) I don't want to be responsible for some knucklehead site packaging a trojan in with the zip file. &nbsp;Let Google be your friend and your instinct be your guide.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I will say that I used a 6.0.1.6300 directly from Belkin's site and a 6.2.1.500 directly from Gateway's site.</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>I hope this saves people a whole lot of frustration.</b></div>
<div><br />
<div><br />

<h2>            Standard vs. Administrator accounts in Windows 10, and relationship to Microsoft accounts</h2>
                    <p>Under Windows 10:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp;Is it still best to do most work using a standard account, instead of an administrator account? &nbsp;</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Or, with UAC active, would you be protected (as long as you don't click "install" at the UAC prompt) from drive-by downloads, spear phishing, etc., that a standard account protects you from?</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;If it is still best to use a standard account, how does this relate to my Microsoft Account (MSA), which is an administrator account? 4. Is it possible to attach my MSA to more than one account on one computer, so that I can attach it to a standard account,
 as well as the default MSA administrator account? &nbsp;If so, how? &nbsp;I would like to be able to use OneDrive with my standard account, but right now it only works with the MSA admin account.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The standard account can help protect your computer by preventing users from making changes that effect everyone who uses the computer, such as deleting files that are required for the computer to work. We recommend creating a standard account for each user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can do almost anything that you can do with Administrator account, but if you want to do something that effects other users of the computer, such as installing software or changing securities settings, Windows might ask you to provide a password for
 an administrator account.</p>

            <p>I was disappointed by the answers provided by this thread.&nbsp; I had the same types of questions and was looking for real answers.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I have not found useful answers here. Setting up admin accounts and a correct password policy is essential for
 security so Microsoft should make more of an effort to suggest practical policies for people to follow.
<br />
<br />
In addition to the questions asked by GTD123, I would have liked:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>an explanation of exactly what rights an Admin account has versus a standard account and how to do administrative work while logged on as a standard user.&nbsp;
</li><li>Furthermore, instead of just saying that we should all be happy with the MS account, the post should have at least recommended the creation of a PIN</li><li>There is also a very serious issue with the MS account approach since it is an account logon visible on the public internet and should therefore have a sophisticated, hard-to-type password.&nbsp; Having such a password is a pain since it needs to be typed so
 often (e.g. to get out of the screen-saver).&nbsp; What is the MS proposal for handling this?</li><li>The MS account password should be changed frequently since it&nbsp;is accessed from&nbsp;the public internet.&nbsp; The need to regularly change the passwords should have been mentioned as well as providing an explanation of the process for changing passwords impacting
 multiple sites</li><li>Because people still need to work off-line, it would have been good to explain&nbsp;limitations caused by being off-line.
<br />
</li></ol>
<p>I would encourage MS to provide a detailed recommendation for setting up accounts and passwords in the new Windows 10 environment.&nbsp;

            <p>I understand there are limitation and characteristic that could be affecting security online etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a&nbsp;pro-user sharing one of the many&nbsp;strategies available within the current configuration of&nbsp;Windows 10. - Please feel free to comment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Accounts Administrator</strong></p>
<p>I recommend using a local administrator account (and a backup local account which you will elevate to&nbsp;local administrator account just in case more specifically if you intend carry on task over the internet with your&nbsp;primary AA which most do to update latest
 drivers etc. ) NB Backup solution is still further required (I recommend backup separately each accounts config)</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Microsoft Accounts</strong></p>
<p>To sync&nbsp;all your tech gadgets together you can "add" your Microsoft designated&nbsp;accounts to your local PC Note that the MS account is set as a User account and not Administrator.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The management of your Microsoft account settings is done online in other words you only roam from computer to computer, device to device&nbsp;which you will enable locally on each device you allow the interaction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you decide to you can&nbsp;further&nbsp;enable&nbsp;via your MS account manageable options via&nbsp;family and work/school accounts&nbsp;either to personalize,&nbsp;pinpoint, circle and&nbsp;to&nbsp;adaptive security solutions.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Caution! Pin vs Password within Microsoft Accounts</strong></p>
<p>MS account management is carried by you online&nbsp;but if you&nbsp;enable a pin "on your computer latent system the best way I can describe is it creates a&nbsp;big black hole. It is my&nbsp;humble view&nbsp;that&nbsp;anyone serious about saving work credits should carry "specific"
 &amp; "core password".</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is important to know that a pin vs psswrd can make your life a bit easier when signing into your Windows 10&nbsp;account&nbsp;by adding a PIN but this method is inherently less secure so caution when enlisting this method.
</p>
<p>Even when you have a enable a PIN the moment you&nbsp;access with till you log off&nbsp;and although you have a setup password previous to setting a Pin it does not count as eminent treat to your system would not require that backup password to carry through an online
 attack.&nbsp; Not only will I urge not to set a PIN if you have return to regular password or use a picture or finger printing locks are much better alternative solution as less hack and more specific to the account holder.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope you find this helpful. </p>

<p>To use Mailmerge you need either an email client or an email client and a Word processor.</p>
<p>Windows 7 on it's own has neither of those so you need to install one or both before you can use mailmerge functions.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Questions for Unactivated OS.</h2>
                    <p>Greetings!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to ask for how long I can use the Windows 10 OS with it being unactivated?&nbsp;I&nbsp;own a small&nbsp;business,&nbsp;an internet café.&nbsp;5 of my&nbsp;computers were all pre-installed with a free Windows 7 Ultimate in the package, but the ones they gave to me is a pirated
 OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last year, a friend of mine shared me a news that I can upgrade to Windows 10 for free, I didn't expect my copy to be genuine as for reasons stated above. I'm planning to buy a genuine copy Windows 10 in the next few months, but can&nbsp;it be&nbsp;installed&nbsp;for 5
 PCs with just one copy, or do I have to buy&nbsp;multiple&nbsp;copies of it for each and every PCs that I have?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not asking much of a service considering my current state, but is it normal to only have less than&nbsp;4 security updates installed?</p>
<p>The updates I have is: Malicious Software Removal Tool Update, Internet Explorer Flash Update, Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Service Pack 1 Update.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have this copy installed for almost a month, and these are the only security updates I have so far. Is it safe for me and for the customers to use this OS&nbsp;being unactivated&nbsp;for the mean time? It may take like 5 months for me have enough budget to buy a
 genuine copy of this.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for posting your query to Microsoft forum. I will certainly help you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is your older version of Windows not activated? </p>
<p>
</p><p>You cannot upgrade to Windows 10 until your current version of Windows is activated. The free upgrade to
<span>Windows&nbsp;10</span> is only available to you if you're running genuine Windows on an eligible device. You may upgrade to Windows 10 as many computers as you want, however that should use different product keys. So for 5 computers you should have 5 either
 Windows 7 or Windows 10 product keys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a product key for your current version of Windows, but it doesn't work when you try to use it, go to the
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=270074" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>You can install the latest Windows&nbsp;updates, it is always provided to improve the services and performance of your Windows.</p>

<h2>            &#39;RoboForm&#39; Toolbar Unable to Save Data&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I use the RoboForm Toolbar. Everything was working fine, but now it is unable to save data in 'AppData\LocalLow\Siber Systems\UserData.' I own the last two folders. I have Full Access to both folders. The attribute setting for the existing files is set to
 'N'. The 'Read Only' box for both folders has a blue dot in it. I am unable to remove this blue dot.</p>
<p>The 'Advanced Network Sharing' settings are set as follows: Network Discovery is ON, File and Printer Sharing is ON, Public Folder Sharing is OFF.</p>
<p>I am not on a network. I share a DSL line with two other individuals.</p>
<p>I am completely out of ideas. None of my other programs are giving me problems.</p>
<p>RoboForm can be downloaded for FREE at: <a href="http://www.RoboForm.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.RoboForm.com</a>. Why is it suddenly unable to save data? What can I do to correct this problem? RoboForm has no problem reading its existing data.</p>
<p>Thank you, in advance, for any suggestions.</p>

<p>I am currently in the process of reinstalling all of my software. I purchased my $2,500.00 computer in January, and in June the Boot Manager on my hard drive went missing. When the Boot Manager goes&nbsp;missing your hard drive turns into a doorstop. Fortunately
 the three-year warranty covered the hard drive, and the manufacturer replaced the hard drive on-site. I then spent one hour installing Windows 7 Professional 64! I took advantage of the situation and -- after consulting with the computer manufacturer of how
 to prevent invalidating my warranty -- replaced the crappy video card with one which is more 'upscale'.</p>
<p>Getting back on track, I had created a 25 GB partition on my hard drive. This partition served as my back-up. This technique has served me well over the years, as I have a habit of reinstalling Windows due to its superb architecture and stability. Well,
 my back-up died with my hard drive. I assume that you are wondering why I do not have a second hard drive. I used to have one but it stopped functioning when the hard drive on my 10-year-old computer crashed last October.</p>
<p>Having learned my lesson that an external hard drive is no guarranty that your back-ups will rescue you when your primary drive fails I had used my SkyDrive as my second back-up. Fortunately my SkyDrive had not crashed. So I was able to recover ALL of my
 20+ GB of data.</p>
<p>During all of this time I considered how best to solve my RoboForm problem. I had experimented with a program called the 'User Access Control Tool' (<a href="http://www.ITKnowledge24.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ITKnowledge24.com</a>). This program handles all of Windows
 7 security issues for you. This is quite convenient not only for the user, but also for the hacker who would like to run software on your computer over the internet. (I access my clients' computers over the internet. Often they have no idea I am in their computer.)</p>
<p>Your technique sounds too cumbersome to me. I have decided to elevate the programs in RoboForm's program folder. Once they have been elevated I shall no longer need to worry about them (as far as I know).</p>
<p>Speaking of hackers, I suggest that if you are not on a network you turn off Network Sharing. I have no idea if Network Sharing affects internet access but until I know for sure I refuse to take any chances. Network Sharing is turned on by default.</p>

<h2>            Splosion Man save corrupted&#47;save not updating &#40;possible major 360 emulation bug on Xbox One&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I've been playing Splosion Man lately on my Xbox One, and today the game decided it does not want to update the save anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what happens is if I quit the game and restart it, it keeps loading up the same older, earlier save. It doesn't matter if I make more progress and select save and continue (even seeing the 'saving...' icon in the corner). This includes beating the game.
 Beating the final boss kicks me to the title screen, and when I press start, its back at the old save. I want to be able to play hardcore mode and complete this game, but this bug won't let me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This game has no tangible save. The save is tied to the player profile data so I can't scrap the save and start over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything I can do to fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried playing on a different console, a 360 system, clearing the system cache (on both 360 and One), deleting and redownloading the game, redownloading my profile, everything. The save for this game is stuck at the same place no matter what I do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also get a message when I start the game on the 360 that the game was played on a different console and its loading that save.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What seemed to cause this to happen was I had the game running, and I went to the Xbox One's Home menu. I was distracted by a phone call, and apparently I was away long enough that the game timed out or crashed. I don't know which, but it was no longer running
 when I came back. From that moment forward, the save became stuck and I can't save my progress.</p>

<p>If a save game gets corrupted (specially in a backward compatibility game) there isn't much you can do but delete the corrupted save file and start over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My suggestion is to save often as things like these tend to happen with old game emulators</p>

            <p>Hi Kabale,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems like there are issues with compatibility with the current drivers. You will need to check with the support team for latest drivers for your device. Try installing those and check if it works.

            Many thanks, this is very helpful. But it's all bad news. Sony say they will not be providing driver upgrades for computers sold with W7 (only W8). My laptop may be a bit old but it is pro standard and works well. I think I'll have to revert back to W7
 unless there is a work around. What do you think?<br />

            <p>Hi. I tried to revert back to W7 but this failed. I posted a new enquiry as follows:-</p>
<p><em>Question</em></p>
<p><em>Can't revert from W10 to W7</em></p>
<p><em>Detail</em></p>
<div>
<p><em>Hi. Sony don't have any updated drivers for Windows 10 on my laptop (bought with Windows 7 installed) nor do they intend to provide any. I've been on their website and they don't list my laptop never mind about drivers for it (Vaio VPCS11X9E running
 W7 Professional) </em></p>
<p><em>My problem is that in W10 my screen is very dark and difficult to work with. This is why I want to revert back to Windows 7. I understood that I could do this within a month but when I go to the 'revert' screen I get the message
</em></p>
<p><em>'We're sorry but you can't go back. The files we need to take you back to a previous version of Windows were removed from this PC'</em></p>
<p><em>All I've done so far is follow the instructions! Help!</em></p>
<p><em>Will I have to do a clean rebuild? If so how do I get hold of a W7 system disc? I'm no geek and getting very worried...</em></p>
<p>I had an initial reply which didn't help, the above is my response and I'm still waiting for an answer.</p>
<p>I am in real trouble here and would really appreciate your advice</p>

<h2>            Shutdown&#47;Restart Shortcuts</h2>
                    <p>Hello Microsoft Community,</p>
<p>I had seen online that you could add shortcuts to your desktop to quickly shut down or restart your PC. How can I do this but add a time interval (30 seconds, for example) before the computer shuts down or restarts? And is it possible to create a shortcut
 with the "shutdown -a" command in case I accidentally press the shut down or restart button?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help will be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to C:\Windows\System32\shutdown and create a shortcut...</p>
<p>Select "Properties" of the shortcut and add the delay to the end of the shutdown.exe...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It should look like this for a STANDARD Shutdown... NOT using the Fast Startup Feature...</p>
<p>C:\Windows\System32\shutdown.exe -s -t 0</p>
<p>
</p><p>The -s is for the shutdown... the -t is for the delay time..., and the 0 is for the time... you could use a 30 for 30 seconds for instance...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem with this is that most all machines use a Fast Startup feature that needs a different command... C:\Windows\System32\shutdown.exe -s -hybrid -t 0...</p>
<p>
</p><p>For a Restart shortcut again create a shortcut to C:\Windows\System32\shutdown and change to this...&nbsp; C:\Windows\System32\shutdown.exe -r -t 0</p>
<p>
</p><p>The -r is for the Restart instead of Shutdown... The rest is the same..</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also click on your Desktop, then press Alt+F4... This will bring up the Windows 7 style shutdown\restart\sleep\hibernate menu...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a programmable button on my mouse that is set for "Close"... This "Close" generates a "Alt+F4" command on any window you click on before hitting the button, and closes it...</p>
<p>
</p><p>This also brings up the Windows 7 style shutdown\restart menu...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I personally prefer to use the Windows 7 style menu for a Shutdown, and my custom Restart shortcut to restart.. This guarantees that the Fast Startup feature will work properly...</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT... Corrected the Restart command..</p>

                    <p>I can use internet, and see some media centers but cannot see the bulk of the network,&nbsp; Like the NAS drives and other computers.&nbsp; This surface unit originally had problems connection at all, but a reload of the drivers seemed to fix that bit.&nbsp; I am getting

<h2>            Getting 0x80073CF9 when trying to install update of Microsoft Solitaire Collection.</h2>
                    <p>Weird problem with this app Microsoft Solitaire Collection. When it tries to update it I can see in the Store App the error code 0x80073CF9.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried deleting the folder and files inside C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download and trie to install it again but. I only see that the store download only 0.8 mb and then try to install the app to&nbsp;finally end up with the&nbsp;error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't uninstall it since I no longer see&nbsp;the app inside the Start menu. The app trouble shooter doesn't find any troubles and I can download and install other apps no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a cached file of the app somewhere that I can delete to force a full download?</p>

            <p>Hi Sayan,</p>
<p>Thanks for the follow up. &nbsp;I posted on the Acronis community page and have not received any replies or answer to solve the issue. &nbsp;Over the New Years holiday I will be replacing my hard drive with the one I cloned to see if anything has been lost during
 the cloning process. &nbsp;I have a laptop with win 7 and it does not give me the same error messages I receive with my win 10 computers.</p>
<p>Have a great New Year.</p>
        </p>

                    I can't find a did slot on my&nbsp;Alienware Aurora R7. Does it even have one? And yes, I tried looking it up many times before. (There was no category so I chose windows)<br />
