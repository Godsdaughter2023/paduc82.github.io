            Hello Emily, I'm Sam, an Independent Adviser. Glad to assist and help with your question.
<br />Try to uninstall and reinstall the Teredo adapter:
<br />- Go to the Start to right click on the Start icon, then select Command Prompt (Admin)
<br />- Run the following command using the Admin command prompt:
<br />netsh interface Teredo set state disable
<br />- Right-click the Start icon
<br />- Select Device Manager
<br />- Click on View
<br />- Show Hidden Devices
<br />- Select Network Adapters
<br />- Find the adapters that contain "Teredo," such as Teredo Tunneling Pseudo-Interface or Microsoft Teredo Tunneling Adapter
<br />- Right-click the adapter name and then click on Uninstall
<br />- Restart the computer
<br />After that try to re-enable the Teredo adapter:
<br />- Go to the Start to right click on the Start icon and select Command Prompt (Admin).
<br />- Run the following command using the Admin command prompt:
<br />netsh interface Teredo set state type=default
<br />Note: The Microsoft Teredo Tunneling Adapter will reinstall automatically. Don’t install the Teredo Tunneling Pseudo-Interface adapter manually in Device Manager, as this may cause issues with Teredo functionality.
<br />
<br />If the above method doesn’t help, I recommend that you try uninstalling the Xbox app and then reinstall it using the Store. It will help to install the required drivers.
<br />- Go to the Start menu to right click it (Windows logo) and choose Windows PowerShell (Admin).
<br />- Copy and paste the command:
<br /> Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.XboxApp | Remove-AppxPackage and press the Enter key.
<br />Restart the computer
<br />Then reinstall the Xbox app from the Store and check if the Microsoft Teredo Tunneling Adapter gets installed.

            Have you contacted the device manufacturer to obtain the TPM update?
<br />I had the same message within Windows Defender concerning TPM &amp; had to do this. Now the message has disappeared.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.

            There’s several places the manufacter’s tag may be seen, one is on the startup screen - as soon as the PC starts there’s often a manufacturer’s logo onscreen. It can also be on a sticker somewhere on the device. 
<br />The best choice though is to click on the search icon/Cortana in the task bar &amp; enter system information, this will tell you everything about your PC.

    <title>Windows 10 portrait mode mouse problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> doronkanar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 portrait mode mouse problem</h2>
                    Ever since I upgraded from windows 8.1 to windows 10, whenever put my monitor into portrait mode (which is absolutely necessary for my needs), the mouse's axis is completely wrong. In other words, if you using my laptop monitor in portrait mode, the mouse
 should typically go right if I dragged down on the trackpad. However, now since on windows 10, the mouse just goes down when dragged down as it would when in landscape. Hope somebody can help me with this very frustrating issue.

<h2>            Infinite Startup Repair Loop Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>Hi, Yesterday my computer was running normally. Then when I tried to boot into windows (starting windows), startup repair came, and it did not fix problems, I tired every single method on the web, like; running chkdsk in command prompt, rebuilding, fixing,
 the&nbsp;boot manager, trying to run safe mode (all 3 options), debugging mode, disable automatic restart&nbsp;on system failure, last known good configuration, repair my computer,&nbsp;and system restore. Everything that the web offers about this conflict, and I am still
 stuck in this infinite loop, got no more options left (exulting re-install, which worked but still went back to the same conflict), Someone out there please help.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although designed to address updates, the following article addressess the error code you are getting and may help resolve the problem:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/947821?p=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/947821?p=1</a>.</p>
<p><span>This is an EXCELLENT article on the Backup and Restore Process in Vista
</span><span><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2007.09.backup.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2007.09.backup.aspx</a><span>&nbsp;but
 it doesn't go into great detail about the restore process - almost considering so easy it's self-evident.&nbsp; But it does teach you a lot about what is possible and how to do it.<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doen't resolve the problem, we'll need to do some general troubleshooting techniques to try to identify and resolve the problem:</span></span></p>
<span><span>
<div>
<p><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time
<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure: </span>
<span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</a><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work (the procedures may vary slightly with the disk but if you follow the prompts and with the above information you should be able to get through it
 just fine).<br />
<br />
If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp; To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make
 the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work, and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted,
 push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
<a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</a><span>&nbsp;along with burning software like:
</span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</a><span>&nbsp;and, of course, a blank CD.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
If using the disk, cd to C:\Windows\System32.<span>&nbsp; </span>Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption
 post back here or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s) using </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</a><span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It may want to schedule itself to start at the next startup.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Agree and then reboot so the program can run. It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive and mostly remove that as a potential cause.&nbsp; At this point you sshould try to do a backup again (if you haven't tried after every
 step).</span></span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning backup (Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools /
 Event Viewer – or typing eventvwr from the command prompt).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:
</span><span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></a><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may be infected with malware.&nbsp;
<span>
Try to run anti-malware programs (in safe mode with networking if <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
necessary</span>).&nbsp;To fix this problem (if it is a problem) download,&nbsp;install, and run the following two programs:
</span><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></a><span>&nbsp;and
</span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp; You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span><a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/</span></a><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download,
 install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried
 it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials
</span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html</span></a>
<span>(with the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time).
<span>&nbsp;</span>You may also want to try the free Avira at: </span><a href="http://www.free-av.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.free-av.com/</span></a><span> and Avast at:
</span><a href="http://www.avast.com/index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.avast.com/index</span></a><span>.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Reboot after completing all the scans.<span>&nbsp; </span>
You may also want to try the free OneCare at </span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></a><span> and let it run all the options (except
 the registry cleaner) because that’s good maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).</span></span>&nbsp;I know that' a lot of different programs, but I've read this problem can be caused by malware and we need to make SURE
 your system is clean and no one or two pruducts can catch everything.&nbsp; If nothing else, you'll be sure to have a clean machine (and you may even find a program you prefer to whatever you are now using).&nbsp; Once again try to do a backup and see if it works.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp; Although this will not affect your data,
 settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. If the other procedures don't work, THIS one is almost certain to work.&nbsp; You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had
 to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></a><span>..</span></span></p>
<span><span>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, then I'm afraid the only option is a clean install.&nbsp; You can use Knoppix
</span><span><a href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html</span></a><span>&nbsp;with
 a good ISO copier like: </span><a href="http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm</span></a><span>&nbsp;along with a blank CD.&nbsp; This should give you enough
 access to the system (if you can't get in any other way - which isn't a problem in your case ) to backup your important data (using copy/paste instead of backup if backup isn't working..&nbsp; Once done, you can do a clean install either using the genuine Windows
 Vista Installation Disk or the Recovery Disk or the Recovery Partition (whatever process is dictated by your computer manufacturer – you may need to contact them for the procedure and perhaps to get recovery disks).&nbsp; To do a clean install proceed as follows:
</span><a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/winvista_install_03.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/winvista_install_03.asp</span></a><span>&nbsp;(adapted as necessary by the procedures of your computer
 manufacturer).&nbsp; Then you will need to re-install all your programs, reset all your preferences, reconfigure your network and email settings, restore your backed up data, run Windows Update with possibly nearly 100 updates pending,...</span></span><br />
<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve your problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hacking is illegal in most countries and it is in Australia</p>
<p><strong>Contact your local Law Enforcement Agency (local Police Station) or contact your local State or Federal&nbsp;Member of Parliament for help.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You&nbsp;should reinstall the operating system but wait until you have contacted the authorities as they may want to do a forensic examination of your machine.</p>

</p><p>Cheers.</p>

<p>Dear Bill</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for taking the time to respond to me.,&nbsp; I am desperate.&nbsp; Even domestic violence counsellors tell me I have left no stone unturned.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cancelled all my bank accounts and credit cards and got new account numbers.&nbsp; I had the banking institutions and most of the other organisations I deal with frequently, insert a special password for me that I requested they ask me.&nbsp; That way they know
 they are really talking to me.&nbsp; This extra level of security is great.&nbsp; I have explained to banks about ex hacking.&nbsp; He stole about $25,000 through my bank accounts and credit cards. I found 2 pieces of paper where he wrote all my card details down and he
 has been booking accommodation, internet sales and cash withdrawals etc from the bank. I don't understand that my name is Leanne and I am a girl but they are giving cash to a man with my card details!!!&nbsp; His deviousness astonishes me as I am still finding
 his deceits years later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been to the Police too as you suggested Bill.&nbsp; I have reported this computer hacking matter on multiple occasions but Police did nothing - not even taking a report and did not give me an incident report number.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also caught him sexually assaulting my grandson aged about 5 at the time.&nbsp; I have reported that to 25+ Police and it is not even registered on the Police computer.&nbsp; No one believes me.&nbsp; Fortunately, I have approximately 200 file notes on 98% of organisations
 incl. Police I spoke to.&nbsp; (People who used to work in law make file notes!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Police had initially&nbsp;been called to my home 2 years earlier when I asked them to remove him from MY HOME, as I became disabled and he was committing "disabled abuse" upon me. Police told me nonsense that was not legally sound, about how he had lived
 at my home longer than 6 months so he could stay. I worked in law, and there is nothing in law that states that. I even checked this with a Barrister with 34 years of domestic violence experience and&nbsp;he agreed with me.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spoke with the Queensland Member of Parliament for domestic violence and children's safety and told her Police were ignoring me, and consequently enabling this man to do worse to me.&nbsp; I took my&nbsp;folder to the Police Inspector allocated to look into my matters.
 The Inspector looked through my allegations and the proof I had and said he was a "conman."&nbsp; I made 30ish allegations against him, some multiple occurrences.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Police were going to charge him in 2017 with assault (as he had punched me in face with closed fist in 2010).&nbsp; When I told the Police I was going to the government body, "Crime and Conduct Commission" (like a Senate Enquiry but at a state level - I lived
 in USA previously), they wrote me they did not have enough evidence to charge him.&nbsp; Obviously, they are angry with me&nbsp;complaining about&nbsp;him.&nbsp; I am currently writing to CCC about the breaches Police saw and failed to charge him with etc.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2 Police did come to my home and agreed that my computer and my mobile phone were being hacked as the GPS locator was tracking me and they could see that.&nbsp; They did nothing about it.&nbsp; Stalking is a very serious offence in Australia, even if it is on computer.&nbsp;
 They could see he was remote accessing my computer.&nbsp; No, I have never given him my password and change it about 6 times a year with the internet cable unplugged. &nbsp;Hours of work I have done, has gone. I did purchase a 1 TB external storage to store my info
 in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">will happen with this matter </span>
as I intend to take it further and Police will be held to account for leaving a disabled woman vulnerable to the deceits and violence of this ex. I&nbsp; foolishly thought when I had to sell my house, that would get rid of him for good but he sent someone to follow
 me to my home and now knows where I live. I have to move house again.&nbsp; He is terrifying.&nbsp; He used to break in to my previous home and stand at the end of the bed watching me sleep x 3. Police did nothing saying I had no witnesses. Even when I have witnesses
 they say I did not.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I got a Court Order so he could not come near me but I found out he drinks and drugs and has blackouts so he is the most dangerous type.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had computer tech look at it.&nbsp; I had ISP provider "fix it"&nbsp; but he just made another password.&nbsp; This computer hacking business needs expert and as you say, Bill, Police intervention.&nbsp; But I cant get help.&nbsp;He seems to be besotted by me or hell bent on causing
 me mental illness.&nbsp; This&nbsp;has been going on for 9 YEARS NOW.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I lost my house due to him forging my signature, my daughter as she sides with him as he lies and is a skilful manipulator and now I cant see my darling grandson as she took him away from me to punish me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this email goes some way to explain where I am at.&nbsp; I worked in law before car hit me and specialised in Domestic Violence so I know what I am doing, but he is a slippery character and I don't believe he has been interviewed by Police except for once
 and then he was not removed from my home.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bill, I am putting all my faith in God, humanity and the Universe to fix up this mess caused by his deceits and pray (not to be spiteful) he is held to account for his demonic acts and that he goes to gaol/jail for his criminal activities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your care Bill.&nbsp; God bless you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Warmest Regards</p>
<p>

<h2>            Moving a live tile to another computer</h2>
                    <p>There's a live tile that works perfectly on my old Windows 10 laptop -- an app that &nbsp;gives real-time schedules for nearby buses. It was free in the Microsoft store but it is no longer sold. (It's only available asa a phone app now.) How to do I port this
 tile to my new laptop? I see that there are numerous files/folders related to the program in my Users/Appdata/Local/Microsoft folders including a ni.exe file, but I'm not sure how exactly to proceed to actually install it on the new machine. Thanks to anyone
 who can help.&nbsp;</p>

            Hello LyndsyVan, <br />
<br />
We hope that the Community can provide ideas that can help you meet the concern.<br />
<br />
Regarding this, we recommend contacting the app's developer to check for a more established workaround since software itself is no longer available for PC. You may request the developers to provide an alternative application that will suit your needs.<br />
<br />
Hope this information helps.<br />
<br />
Regards.<br />

            I did write them already, and they (or their bot) just responded that they no longer support a desktop version. The thing is, of course, that it works fine on the desktop of my old computer. What I need is someone who is more sophisticated than I at what
 happens when you install a live tile -- what folders are opened, whether there's a registry change, how the tile is accessed, etc. Since I have everything I need on the old machine, it seems logical that I could replicate on my new.&nbsp;

            Hi Lindsy,<br />
<br />
<br />
We would like to assist you with this concern, however, this issue is beyond the scope of this forum. The live tile of the application may still work on your old computer since you were able to install it during the time that the application supports desktop
 version. Since the application stops supporting desktop version, then it may not be compatible with the newer release versions of computers, causing it to be not available for download in Windows Store. You may consider posting a feedback on the app's developer
 website so they may come up with a resolution to this issue.<br />
<br />
Regards.

            What I think I need is someone who understands the architecture of live tile installation. The fact that the software makers no longer sell a desktop version was, I assume, an economic decision. Since their product works on another Windows 10 machine,
 I'm assuming I can copy all the appdata folder onto my new machine and it may work. My question, though, is what Else I need to do, or look out for. In other words when ANY live tile is installed, what happens, and where?&nbsp;

            Once the application no longer supports desktop version, you cannot make more copies of the application or even transfer the application to another device.<br />

<h2>            Xbox 360 Wireless Controller with the Gaming Receiver for PC and the &#38;quot&#59;Play and Charge Kit&#38;quot&#59; does not work together</h2>
                    
<p><span><br />
I have a Microsoft Wireless Receiver and the kit Play &amp; Charge (original).&nbsp;</span><span>If I put the kit, the wireless communication stops immediately (and controller). And then, I have to synchronize again. Is that right? I've tried all possible drivers. I
 have Windows 7 on a high-end computer.</span></p>
<div>Note:&nbsp;</div>
<div>I read it here:</div>

 because it would be using&nbsp;too much power, while wireless,&nbsp;at the same time it is trying to replace it. Which could eventually short out the controller causing it to be unable to be used anymore."</div>

<p>You are correct, the wireless receiver and the play &amp; charge kit USB cable do not work together. The USB cable is only useful insofar as providing power to charge the battery for the controller, but it does not provide a data connection.</p>
<p>If you are encountering issues with connectivity after re-synching with the wireless device, try the steps in the following Microsoft support article:

<p>"The USB cable is only useful insofar as providing power to charge the battery for the controller, but it does not provide a data connection."</p>
<p>Ok. I know that. I do not want data connection via USB cable. I want through the Xbox 360 Wireless Gaming Receiver for Windows (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Xbox-360-Wireless-Gaming-Receiver-Windows/dp/B000HZFCT2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.amazon.com/.../B000HZFCT2</a>)
 that I bought to connect to PC via usb . And the name of the kit is called "Play &amp; Charge". That's a lie from Microsoft? The player has to stop playing and charge your control? This also happens on Xbox?</p>

<p>Essentially, the "Play &amp; Charge" kit components are one (1) wireless Xbox 360 controller and one (1) USB cable to be used for the purpose of charging the controller's lithium ion battery. All input transmitted from the controller to the PC or the Xbox 360
 console via the controller from the "Play &amp; Charge" kit must be received wirelessly. Again, if you are having continual issues with synching the wireless receiver with the controller, refer to the steps in the Microsoft Knowledge Base support article at
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/906347" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.microsoft.com/.../906347</a></p>

<p>2 - I bought the Xbox 360 Wireless Gaming Receiver for Windows (I want to play wirelessly on my PC);</p>
<p>3 - Wireless Receiver on my PC + Xbox Wireles Controller = OK. Works very well. Play Batman Arkham City =)</p>
<p>4 - Battery Empty!! Ohh and now? Who can help me? tan-daaannnn.... The Kit Play &amp; Charge!!!</p>
<p>5 - I put the charge cable in PC, and then in controller. The 4 lights flash;</p>
<p>6 - Appears "Xbox 360 Wireless Controller via Play &amp; Charge Kit" in Device Manager;</p>
<p>7 - Wireless connection stops working;</p>
<p>8 - Oh! No! Kit sucks. Stop play (Joker liked). Charge. Green light. Unplug. No synchronization. &nbsp;I have to reconnect my controller.</p>

<p>Yes, now that we have narrowed down the source of the issues you have reported, we can proceed with fixing them. The driver signing for the connection that your PC is detecting requires an alternate approach for resolution since it is detecting two (2) distinct
 device driver profiles. In order to resolve this particular issue, you will need to contact Games for Windows LIVE Support at 877-274-4349.</p>

                    I disabled UAC so I wouldn't get asked about permissions but in Win 10 this apparently doesn't work. How do I turn off the message that asks to provide Admin permission? Thanks

<p>Hi Julien,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows has previously released the latest Windows 10's newest version - 1803. Have you tried updating your computer to this version? If you haven't yet, then you may check the link&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028685/windows-10-get-the-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Get
 the Windows 10 April 2018 Update</a> for information on how to obtain the update.<br />
</p>
<p>I've also searched about this problem and found a thread that tackled a related concern. It says on the thread that this behavior is by design. That if Ethernet or Wi-Fi is connected, access to Cellular network is blocked. However, they have shared a workaround
 in the registry that would allow Cellular traffic even if Ethernet or Wi-Fi is connected.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>HKLM\Software\Microsoft\WcmSvc</strong><br />
<strong>IgnoreNonRoutableEthernet (REG_DWORD) set to 1</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Note: The method to fix the issue will have Registry modification. Before you modify the Registry, make sure to back it up and understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. Please refer to this link: How to back up and restore the registry
 in Windows.</em></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately I can't update to the latest version, it's a company laptop and major updates are rolled out by our IT departement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nonetheless I can do virtually anything beside updating my OS (I am also admin on this computer) I can proceed to roll back etc, but the fact is that within few weeks we will be forced to stay on 1703 for around 6-9 months.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently on a business trip but I will give a try to your trick asap.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently the problem must be known as I found hundreds of posts treating the same topic.</p>

<p>Hi Janet,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We appreciate all the steps you've tried to resolve the issue.&nbsp; Since it still persists, we suggest that you use the
<strong>Deployment Image Servicing and Management</strong> (<strong>DISM</strong>) tool which will check and correct system file corruptions that may be causing the issue. Refer to this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/947821/fix-windows-update-errors-by-using-the-dism-or-system-update-readiness-tool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link
</a></strong>for the steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you are on the support page, skip Step 1.&nbsp; Proceed directly on Step 2 until Step 4.&nbsp; If you are still experiencing the same issue after using the DISM tool, we recommend that you proceed with
<strong>System Update Readiness</strong> tool.&nbsp; The steps are also listed on the same support article.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it went for you.</p>

<h2>            Window 10 upgrade download has a virus&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I was trying to upgrade from windows 8 to 10. When I hit the upgrade for free button my computers virus protection stated it has a high threat virus and refuses to continue. Anyone else have this problem?</p>
<p>I have another laptop that had windows 7 and that one upgraded just fine but now I'm worried that one may have a virus too.... since the virus protection on that one wasn't as good as the this laptop.
</p>
<p>ANY SUGGESTIONS??</p>

<p>Hi, I am experiencing exactly the same issue. Tried everything in terms of soft, hard and factory resets, sometimes I get an hour or so usage before it crashes again, even if Fortnite is the only game installed!Console is only 3 months old so the store (Smyths
 Toys) won't exchange, MS support say send it to them for repair but that can take 2 to 4 weeks - telling the kids the won't have the console for the rest of the Summer holidays won't go well!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft, is this a hardware problem or software related, if it is software can we have a patch to fix rather than lose the console for an unnecessary repair? Very disappointing for a £450 console.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t log in to one of my Windows Live Mail Accounts - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can&#39;t log in to one of my Windows Live Mail Accounts</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've been using my 4 linked accounts in Windows Live Mail on my laptop&nbsp;for ages.&nbsp; When I log in it usually prompts me for a password for each of the email accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few days ago I noticed that it had stopped prompting me to login with a password on 3 of the accounts --&nbsp;it would just let me straight in when I logged in to one of the accounts. This morning I set about trying to fix that.&nbsp; I went into Accounts and made
 sure that under Server that I had set it to NOT remember passwords and tried again -- that didn't work. It kept jut prompting only for one password.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then tried to login into Microsoft live account using the email address that I usually use (one of those that I was no longer prompted for the password when logging into Windows Live Mail) and it wouldn't recognise the password.&nbsp; I tried logging in again
 it Windows Live Mail and this time it did prompt me for the passwords on all the email accounts that it had previously stopped prompting except the one I had tried to login to Microsoft Live with.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then tried to reset me password for that by following the prompts -- I had to setup verification using text.&nbsp; Once I got in it let me reset the password for the email account.&nbsp; I logged out of Microsoft Live and then tried Windows Live Mail again using
 the same email address and it would not&nbsp;recognise the new password I'd just setup for that account.&nbsp; I tried over and over using this same procedure (getting a new verification code, resetting the password and logging again with new password in Windows Live
 Mail but it doesn't recognise the password each time I reset it even though it works during the reset procedure.&nbsp; I can get in to do a reset but that password doesn't work once I log out from resetting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can still login to Windows Live and access the other three accounts and I can see the 4th account but every time I try and do anything in that account like send an email I'm prompted for a password and it won't accept anything I put in there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm so very frustrated as this has now taken me several hours to et this far.&nbsp; I've tried searching for similar problems in the Community Help but they are kind of confusing and I seem to taking the steps suggested but nothing works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can reset my password for both Microsoft Live and Windows Live Mail on this particular account that is not working and having it recognise the password so I can use my account again?.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Thank you so much for putting here for us to see, the solution! I have turned off two step verification, as as soon as i read what you said, it clicked, ah yes, i did the same thing and stopped being able to log my WLM in or send/receive messages from

    <title>Buzz in audio playback, WIndows 10, problem found - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Buzz in audio playback, WIndows 10, problem found</h2>
                    <p>The April/May 2018 Windows 10 Update screwed up the sound in my lap top (Dell 6500) and every 7 seconds I'll get a BRAP! noise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It turns out that the latest update messed with the audio driver and this model is not meant for Windows 10 and Dell does not make a sound card for WIndows 10 for this model as it's too old.&nbsp; They said this computer is meant for Windows 7 only and it's now
 too late to revert back to Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The previous versions of Window 10 worked just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps the people at MicroSoft can address this issue on their next update?</p>
<p />

            Hi Steve.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />
<br />You can roll back Version 1803  in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:   <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also obtain media for older versions here:  <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>
<br />Burn to DVD  or create bootable 8+gb flash stick installer using this tool installed to Windows:  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56485" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/detail...</a>
<br />
<br />Then follow this Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />You can even go back to Windows 7 if you want as you're entitled to either OS on that PC for it's life as long as it's not both at once.  Just make sure you still have the Product Key on the COA sticker affixed to PC or in it's retail folder.
<br />
<br />The follow this Clean Install which includes the media and everything else needed:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_7-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-7/0ae269fd-167e-423b-94ef-26133f89e10c">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Just in case you haven't tried it yet you can install the latest Sound driver in Compatibility Mode here:  <a href="https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/set-compatibility-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/set-compatib...</a>

<p>Thank you, I'll give it a shot tomorrow after work.</p>
<p>That BRAP! noise is driving me crazy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I picked up a Behringer UCA202 which reduced the noise to sounding like listening to a very warped record!</p>

            Hi Steve, please try this:
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App
<br />
<br />Go to Update &amp; Security - Troubleshoot - Playing Audio
<br />
<br />Run that troubleshooter to see if it resolves this issue . . .
<br />
<br />If the issue is not resolved:
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager
<br />
<br />Expand out the Sound and video device section
<br />
<br />What Audio device is listed there?

<p>Troubleshooting doesn't do anything.</p>
<p>Here's what I get:</p>

<p>
</p><p>but it won't let me finish the installation because this computer is meant for Windows 7.</p>
<p>It won't let me revert back, either, and because I already did a complete Windows 10 reinstall I can't go back to when things worked.</p>
<p>

            Hi Steve, that device string evaluates to Intel(R) High Definition Audio HDMI driver
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager
<br />Right click your Audio device in the SOund and Video Controllers section and choose Update Driver
<br />
<br />Click 'Browse my Computer for driver software'
<br />
<br />Then click 'Let me pick from a list of available drivers on my PC'
<br />
<br />Uncheck 'Show Compatible Hardware'
<br />
<br />In the resulting list, on the left click Microsoft
<br />
<br />In the right list, choose High Definition Audio Device . . .
<br />
<br />Apply that driver, restart your PC and see if your sound is ant better . . .

            <p>Link does not provide any help. Not sure why Microsoft forces users to exclude previous password.</p>
<p>Operating system not flexible to allow user to make own choices. Definitely not a good customer experience.</p>
<p>It seems it is all about Microsoft and not about the customer.</p>
<p>Windows 10 installation has messed up my password, and there is no way to go back.</p>
