<h2>            where is a description for about&#58;flags &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>if I search for e.g. "Use full stacking context for fixed position elements"&nbsp;AND "Independent composition of preserve-3d content"</p>
<p>Bing and Google show me a very few russian and japanese websites.</p>
<p>Apart from that I don't understand this languages, it seems to me this sites contain a list of this Settings, but no descriptions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, is there somewhere any ohter&nbsp;descripton for about:flags?</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I supposed there is somewhere a website with a list, like:</p>
<p>"Use full stacking context for fixed position Elements" =&gt; explanation<br />
"Independent composition of preserve-3d Content" =&gt; explanation</p>
<p>and all other settings on the about:flags page,</p>
<p>or a site about&nbsp;about:flags&nbsp;and for each setting a single site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because of this I searched for the complete phrase, with quotation marks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if I search for the phrase e.g. "Use full stacking context for fixed position Elements" I find no relevant entries. So I assume there is no description for this somewhere on a MS site?</p>

    <title>Setting up IMAP email on iPhone 6 with latest iOS software - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jay512  say:</h3>
<h2>            Setting up IMAP email on iPhone 6 with latest iOS software</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to add my Road Runner (TWC) e-mail address to the MS Outlook app on my iPhone 6. &nbsp;I have deleted the app, made sure I have the latest version of both it and the operating system before beginning this posting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When trying to add my IMAP mail to the Outlook application, I get an error. I have communicated with both Time Warner and Microsoft, but have not been able to get this resolved. I am using mail.twc.com as the incoming and outgoing as TWC suggests. I found
 a post that said you needed to add the ports to both as well so per the instructions I added it to both incoming and outgoing servers. Incoming mail.twc.com:143 and Outgoing mail.twc.com:587.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can receive email on my iPhone via the normal delivered email app, I can receive my e-mail on my laptop via Outlook 365 (2016) and have logged into my web mail making sure to type in the password vs. having it autofill just to make sure I have everything
 correct. It appears that the only problem lies in adding this mail account to the IMAP in the Outlook app. I added my Outlook.com account just to make sure it worked, so it appears to be a problem with the IMAP functionality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The support page for MS&nbsp;https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Set-up-email-on-iPhone-iPad-or-iPod-Touch-b2de2161-cc1d-49ef-9ef9-81acd1c8e234#BKMK_IMAPorPOP screen shots does not match the screens I am seeing on the map. Specifically the SSL which is nowhere
 to be found in the app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot go to setting on the application, because I can never get past the "add an account" piece. &nbsp;I would assume I am not the first person to try this, so I was hoping someone at either TWC, MS or the User Community would be able to help me figure this
 out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.......Jay</p>

            It would like me to flip the SSL switch, which is not an available option in the setup process. &nbsp;TWC points to MS as the problem and the error from MS says to contact the provider. &nbsp;Bit of a "he said" "she said" conversation.

            <p>Hi Jay,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having the same issue as described by Jay. Apparently the iOS Outlook app does not allow SSL to be selected which is required by RoadRunner (TWC). I have included the screen shots of the setup page and the error that I get after attempting to sign in.
 Please note that I have removed the personal information on the setup page for security reasons.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assistance would be greatly appreciated,</p>

            <p>Thank you Jay. I am having the exact same problem with my TWC account. It continues to ask me to login but never seems to connect. It works just fine with the built in iOS mail app on my iPhone 6. I have two other IMAP accounts working on the Outlook app
 so it seems to only be a problem with the TWC account. Likewise, I also do not have an SSL switch. They (Microsoft) needs to fix this and to also add a place to put in the port numbers instead of having to add them on to the end of the address by using a ":".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if you come up with a solution.&nbsp;</p>

            Windows Media Player probably can't find the right codec to play the wav file.&nbsp; I have heard TCPMP (http://tcpmp.en.softonic.com/pocket) is a good alternative that supports various codecs.<br />

            That might be a good solution. If you associate the "incorrect" wav file to a system event, it still won't work. You can play it with TCPMP.

<p>I tried to install the TCPMP player. In fact, I re installed it because my phone said it was already installed. It did not correct the "invalid media type is specified" problem on my TMobile Dash phone. I have some
 wave files that work fine on my laptop, but will not play on my smartphone. Any other reason that could cause this?</p>

    <title>Couple of queries from new Windows Phone User- Lumia 710 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Couple of queries from new Windows Phone User-  Lumia 710</h2>
                    
<p>I had Nokia phones for years then got an Android LG phone for Christmas, after months of problems O2 gave me the choice of another phone, I picked the nokia lumia 710 with windows s I use my skydrive all the time for business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I find it a lot better than the Android, except the battery but I can live with that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a couple of questions about some items that I am not sure if it is just me not working the phone correctly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. When I plug the phone into my laptop with the USB connector/charger the pc only recognises it as a media player and I can't check what is stored on the phone through windows explorer. Through Zune I have noticed&nbsp; that the memory on the phone has more
 stuff stored on it but can't find what it is either through the phone or pc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Is there anyway you can check if applications are still running in the background when you hae had them open and then go back to home screen (and switch them off)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. I know I can attach photos and office files to an email but how can I attach other files from my skydrive to an email i.e pdf or Sage backup.&nbsp; I do have Adobe Reader on my phone.</p>

<p>1. You cannot access the memory of a WP handset in "mass memory" mode which would allow you to see what exactly is on it. That's an OS restriction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. I believe you can long-press the back key to see that. [EDITED thanks to Psychomania].</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. AFAIK you can only include in email links to the files on Skydrive, you cannot attach the actual files.</p>

<p>It's a long press on the back key that shows what apps are running, a long press on the home key (the windows logo) activates "Tellme" with is for voice activated features.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Background tasks can be checked in settings &gt; applications &gt; background tasks. Quite often it's a background task associated to a live tile that can cause faster than normal battery draining.</p>

I can attach office files ie spreadsheets but is there no way to attach pdfs?

                    my Win7 computer doesn't have any installed&nbsp; ie (neither under Program Files nor Program Files (x86) and it is not listed under view installed updates nor Windows features), but when i try to install IE10-Windows6.1-en-us.exe (ie10 was installed at one
 time but was removed, I don't remember how or when) it tells me that I have a newer version already installed. What can I do to install ie10?

<p>Thanks for your response, see my answers below.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Did you installed anything before problem happen? No<br />
</p>
<p>If you open start and search for Internet Explorer what is the result? The only applications that mention ie are:<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ConfigureIEOptionalComponenets.exe</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ie4uinit.exe</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IE10-Windows6.1-en-us.exe<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iecleanup.exe</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IECONTENTSERVICE.EXE</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iediagcmd.exe</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ieinstal.exe</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ielowutil.exe</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ieUnatt.exe</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iexplore.exe</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iexpress.exe</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RegisterIEPKEYs.exe</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SetIEInstalledDate.exe<br />
</p>
<p>Run Windows Update and install all updates.&nbsp; I am on auto-update and am current<br />
</p>
<p>In start search for <strong>cmd</strong>&nbsp; and right click on command prompt and run as admin and type:</p>
<p><strong>sfc /scannow </strong></p>
<p>And press enter and let us know about the result. Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them. Details are included in the CBS.Log windir\Logs\CBS\CBS.log</p>
<p>Looking at the log, the items WRP could not fix are as follows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; calibrili.ttf</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sspicli.dll</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; msado28.tlb</p>

<h2>            SWAY file management</h2>
                    <p>I have looked at SWAY for two weeks now, read the communities comments, and considered the Microsoft feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am in healthcare, and all of the security and access that goes along with that.&nbsp; I most appreciated the questions that focused on where the 'file' is stored.&nbsp; I'm going to assume there is some file, somewhere, in some format.&nbsp; I too need 'control' over
 the content and the work product.&nbsp; If someone needs to ask what I mean by 'control', then step aside and find someone else to reply.&nbsp; My desires; 1. Use SWAY just like every other Office product meaning I install the app&nbsp;(or 365), tinker for a while, and create
 a file.&nbsp; 2. A file I store, where I want to.&nbsp; 3. A file just like .xlsx .docx .pptx .vsdx.&nbsp; 4. I will never ever use this application if these three things are not met.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I own my content, period.</p>

            <p>Hi Steven,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your point of view. I suspect I will not change your mind with a forum reply such as this, but I would like to lay out some of our thinking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, it&nbsp;is worth noting that Sway is not a replacement for PowerPoint, nor is it intended to be. We designed Sway to be used for presentations, digital stories, documents, school projects, etc. The fact that you can give a great presentation using Sway
 does not mean that PowerPoint is unneeded - it is&nbsp;more suited than Sway to many use cases.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for files, it is not the case that Sway has a "file" in the cloud, the way PowerPoint or Word have files in the cloud when you put them in OneDrive or elsewhere. There are no Sway files, just collections of content, links and relationships in the secure
 Azure cloud database. That doesn't mean we couldn't find&nbsp;some way to export a blob of data that contained these items to your hard disk&nbsp;- it just wouldn't be as useful. There are reasons we chose the approach we did, and they have to do with expectations of
 modern tools.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Allow me to first address a few common misconceptions about cloud-based data.</p>
<p>1. "It isn't available offline". When data is based in the cloud, that simply means the "master copy" of the data is in the cloud. Modern apps using cloud storage such as Sway (or OneNote) are able to take that data offline (to view or present without a
 network) even though there is no file. "No file" does not equal "no offline". Edits can be made on this cached data offline too (in OneNote, not yet in Sway), and synced back to the cloud.</p>
<p>2. "It isn't secure". Office365 is built around securing cloud based data. With the current Sway service you can secure content to your organization. The ability to apply more granular security is coming. Some governments and many reputable businesses large
 and small store their financial information in Office365 - we wouldn't be building it right if they couldn't. But we also know that some businesses cannot do so&nbsp;for regulatory reasons (those regulations are slowly modernizing), and some people just aren't
 comfortable yet with the notion. That's fine - *no one* was comfortable with it just five years ago - attitudes are changing rapidly.</p>
<p>3. "I can't control my data". As the owner of the data, you have control over it in the cloud as well. You can delete it, limit access to it, share it, copy it etc. These things are done differently from how a file-based system works, but the capabilities
 are there. Sway abides by the <a href="https://products.office.com/en-US/business/office-365-trust-center-cloud-computing-security" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office 365 trust center</a>, which includes user’s rights to their content and data. It is worth looking at this
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Frequently-asked-questions-about-Sway-–-Admin-Help-446380fa-25bf-47b2-996c-e12cb2f9d075" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
FAQ</a>&nbsp;for answers to specific questions you may have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may be curious as to why we decided to make Sways cloud based. Here are several reasons (and we keep finding new ones):</p>
<p>1. Your data is always accessible from any device.</p>
<p>2. They are far easier to share. Just send the link (vs attach to email, or share a USB drive). This is a big deal because the total data size in a Sway can be large without impacting your device&nbsp;storage, or exceeding limits in various systems (such as email
 attachment size)</p>
<p>3. It is trivial to enable people to co-author and work together. Files need to be moved to the cloud to enable this, which is tricky for many people. Most people&nbsp;therefore&nbsp;send email attachments which forks the file and causes a versioning nightmare.</p>
<p>4. We can adapt the amount of data served to viewers on different devices - so phones don't have to get the same size of images or videos as desktops.</p>
<p>5. Documents that contain media to the degree Sways do can become *very* large if all that data had to be packed into a file. It is far more efficient to reference that data on the cloud than attempt to bring a copy of it&nbsp;it into a file</p>
<p>6. We are able to offer a web based editor to edit from any machine - no app install required.</p>
<p>7. Unlike with file attachments, if someone overshares your sway, you can just revoke access to it.</p>
<p>8. We have the capability to offer information on who has accessed your Sway, when, how much they read, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Different people have different needs. We receive a lot of praise from people who are happy to have their data accessible from any device, and happy that we also take care of ensuring they are always working on the up to date copy. These people love that
 sharing and co-editing&nbsp;a sway is easy, and working with media is lightweight and not dependent on having&nbsp;a high powered computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said, we know this approach is not for everyone right now. That's why Office365 gives you options - work the classic way, or use classic tools in a new way, or new tools in a new way. With Sway we&nbsp;have chosen to not build a new tool that works the classic
 way, because the benefits of the new approach are so significant that we would rather use our resources to make the tool more powerful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have specific questions beyond what I've addressed in this response, I am happy to take them.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your message here is a great answer to the question. It moves our thinking so far forward! The concept is, at first, difficult to grasp if stuck in the old world of files and folders (as most of us will be) but slowly I'm coming around to realising just
 how powerful this approach is... it's going to take some adjustment on my part but I'm sure I'm going to like it!

            <p><span>Hi Chris,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for providing a detailed explanation of the SWAY concept and its options for sharing. Whilst I initially found this to be a very exciting product, there are still a great many of us who
 live, work or need access to information in places without an internet connection of any kind. Without some sort of file creation tool to overcome this problem, I’m afraid that the appeal of SWAY will be lost to many of us.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really enjoy Sway, and I am in love with the concept. Unfortunately, I must adhere to government regulations, and as you mentioned before, I cannot use Sway "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">for regulatory reasons." My organization
 uses Microsoft products, and we have been using them for the duration of my career. The ease-of-use and dumbing-down of presenting information would help to turn around the "death-by-powerpoint"&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">culture
 we are unfortunately in today. I believe that Sway is a very intuitive way to just get the information you need on the presentation rather than copying and pasting everything from a word document, and it encourages actual presentation (a lost art). I could
 be wrong, and I may just be tired of sitting through briefs and classes with 400-slide PowerPoint presentations, but Sway is very refreshing to use and follow along with.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I highly encourage the Sway development team to engineer a way to allow users to pick how they want to manage the Sway information: either by sharing with a cloud, or by allowing the user to save the
 information for strictly offline use (which would help users conform to government regulations). The notion that "</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">those regulations are slowly modernizing" is simply not true; government regulations
 when it comes to security classifications and sensitive information is set in stone. Those regulations are not going to change because we want to use Sway. The regulations were written to safeguard and protect information.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The bottom line is: Sway is a great presentation tool. There is a big market that you are targeting but missing due to government regulations. Give the users the power to choose between uploading to your
 cloud or keeping their information off cloud-based services. Otherwise Sway will never have practical use outside of blogging and story-telling.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Regards,</span></p>

            I have just prepared a presentation in ignorance of the need for a cloud connection. There are many places in the UK where that connection is still not possible, either wired or over mobile networks. I can quite happily live with an offline editing capability
 like One Note. Just how soon will this off line tweak take to be offered to the end user?

            One of the features of the Sway Win10 app (not the web app) is that you can cache your sways for offline presentation. All you need to do is view the Sway once in the Win10 app (I recommend you practice once using the Win10 app in the format and screen
 size you will use to present). Later you can view that Sway offline for your presentation. There is as yet, no offline edit capability. No timeline for that to share either, sorry.

            <p>I hear your feedback Steve, as does the whole Sway team. And thanks for the compliments about Sway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's separate this into two things:</p>
<p>1. offline use</p>
<p>2. user addressable 'files' (which, implicitly, do not need to ever live in the Microsoft cloud)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The former is already possible in a limited way using the&nbsp;Win10 Sway app (for presentation). Editing will come someday (no specific timeline). This will eventually be similar to how OneNote allows full offline use (even if the document/notebook is cloud-homed)</p>
<p>
</p><p>People often link 'offline' and 'files' in their minds, as though the latter are required for the former. As OneNote shows, and the Sway Win10 app, that is not true. Apps can still use a cloud-homed data source and enable offline including editing, even
 multi-user editing through cached data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the second, that is an implementation choice (a familiar user experience) to enable certain capabilities. And as I discussed above, it also (re)introduces a whole set of problems that not having files (and being able to count on cloud-homing) solves.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes people have workflow that assumes that files will be attached to messages. Generally, any workflow that is about sharing and collaborating is better done with a cloud-homed version vs forking copies and trying to reconcile changes and comments
 from many users. So for these scenarios, Sway has chosen its path.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still others have tools that expect data to be in files (backup, scanners, etc). For these, we (Microsoft, not specifically Sway) are working with tool vendors to enable scanning of cloud services and other solutions to accommodate cloud services. This is
 the long term</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some customers cannot host data outside their own networks, and not in Microsoft data centers. Many of those customers are OK once Microsoft shows how they can extend their security/auditing bubble over the MS data centers (this is a core tenet of Office365).
 This approach encompasses far more than Sway -&nbsp;it goes to the heart of cloud computing and the trend is definitely toward change to accommodate this approach.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Others customers (a shrinking minority but one that admittedly will never be zero given govt, military, etc) simply require the data to be on their physical machines in their data centers. For those people the long term solution will be private cloud hosting.
 We're not there yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why not also allow files? It's a good question to ask. We have lived in that space before, and it is not pretty. Having files that users manage generates a lot of complexity in the user experience, and requires a lot of user training to help them understand
 how to enable things such as coauthoring. It breaks all the advantages I described earlier. And it's work, which means we can't improve something else. So even though that decision shuts out some people in the short term and a few people for the long term,
 we have decided not to go that way. There is always Word and PowerPoint for the folks who can't adopt this new way.</p>

    <title>Outlook 365 How to see emails older than 2 weeks - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lewis art gallery  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 365 How to see emails older than 2 weeks</h2>
                    <p>We've just started using Office 365.&nbsp; (We used to use Outlook Express, then Windows Live Mail).&nbsp; I'm finding the interface very confusing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In particular, in my inbox I see "Today", "Last Week", and "Two Weeks Ago", and NOTHING after that.&nbsp; What happens to everything older than two weeks?</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE:<br />
I found some of my older emails in the "Deleted Items" folder.&nbsp; Is it possible they're being deleted automatically?</p>

<p>Hi Lewis,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you started to use Outlook recently, you may not have emails older than 2 weeks. In fact, the tab will show automatically and you can also change the view. For your reference:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dfd5b05e-87d1-43fa-89ba-346f1a4f836e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dfd5b05e-87d1-43fa-89ba-346f1a4f836e" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>About your second question, Outlook won’t delete your emails automatically unless you have created rules. And if you accept a meeting, the drafts and the meeting request email will be deleted automatically.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there is any misunderstanding, please correct me and provide more details for a better assistance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Carlos&nbsp;</p>

<p>thanks.&nbsp; the company has been using Outlook 365 for several months.&nbsp; I just recently returned from retirement for a few hours a month, so I've had no training in Outlook (I sure miss Outlook Express - it was so intuitive).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of the staff here shares a single email address.&nbsp; I now suspect someone has just been deleting everything over 2 weeks old.&nbsp; It's all still here, in the Deleted Items folder.<br />
<br />
The entire Office interface is confusing to me (I've been happily using Office XP for 15 years :)&nbsp; - it's hard for an old dog to learn new tricks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I apologize for my griping.&nbsp; I'll get used to it.&nbsp; Thanks for your help.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Problem is it turns itself off after 1 hour of stanby time.The screen goes totally blank.</p>

            Thank you.&nbsp; I did figure this out and then downloaded oggsync to sync my axim with my laptop/outlook which then syncs with the googlecalendar my new employer uses for everyone.&nbsp; Somehow, something happened after everything synced and I was trying to clean
 up appointments and EVERYTHING was deleted off my axim but is still in the outlook calendar and google calendar.&nbsp; I tried unistalling the oggsync and cleared out all appts on the outlook calendar so I could start over, but now can't get my axim/laptop partnership
 going again.&nbsp; I keep getting an error message with the activesync that it can't establish a partnership.&nbsp; any suggestions?

            I've had this problem numerous times trying to Sync between computers on my x51. A soft Reset on the Axim (push button on back of unit just once) usually solves it but be sure to restart the PC before you retry. Also, plug the USB plug into a different
 slot when you do this and make sure you temporarily disable any firewalls/virus/spyware protection during the process.

    <title>Activation Wizzard Popping Up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> churchuser  say:</h3>
<h2>            Activation Wizzard Popping Up</h2>
                    <p>My office purchased Office 365 a few months ago.&nbsp; Everything was fine until about 2 weeks ago.&nbsp; Only on my computer (a dell running windows 10) an "activation wizard" keeps popping up saying I need to activate product.&nbsp; I'm very dependent on Microsoft/Word
 and don't have full access.&nbsp; I've been on tech/chat support 6 times now and no one can figure it out.&nbsp; I think I might be the only one running windows 10.....which may be the problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried deleting and reloading the program, etc, etc.&nbsp; Does anyone have any suggestions?</p>

<p>I sent a word document to my colleagues which i recieved through e-mail. When I open the document, it is not showing me the embedded bitmap images. When I double click the text that is on the place of Image, Image opens up in paint. The same is going with

<p>"...being a good little program, did what it was supposed to do and deleted everything on your PC."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I agree that it did what it was supposed to do, but I disagree in the sense that there is NO program that should automatically and IRREVERSIBLY delete data that just may be what the developer told it to do, but not what the owner wants it to
 do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PLEASE tell me that there will be an update that incorporates a confirmation dialogue before permanently deleting my contacts, email, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just got totally %^*#ed because after a fresh install of Vista (after system crash), Win Mobile Device Center just deleted all the contacts off my 5 month old, previously flawless TMobile Wing... and my faith in Microsoft has been put to the
 test again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please, I'm a MS fanboy. Tell me you're making the "replace on device" and "replace on desktop" options human-proof... and in the same menu as "change content sync settings" instead of all on its own in "manage a partnership."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and please merge "sync center" and "mobile device center." Why the two are separate is incomprehensible...</p>

<h2>            Nokia 6500 Slide PC Suite</h2>
                    Hi there, my partner and I have just bought ourselves the 6500 slide and are both having problems getting the PC Suite to work. Tried uninstalling it, downloaded latest version, swapped handsets and still does not work. Occasionally when clicking on the
 icons it will open, until you click on the Contacts and then it just freezes and locks up the PC Suite altogether? Sometimes it won't even recognise the phone is connected! Has anyone any ideas please that could fix this?

            You don't give much info to go on, so here are some general tips:<br />
<br />
You should deactivate your antivirus and firewall software during the installation of PC Suite, as they can interfere with correct installation.<br />
<br />
Current versions of PC Suite support only Windows 2000, XP and Vista. If you have Vista, ignore the CD that came with the phone and download the latest version 6.85 from the Nokia web site, this is the first with official support for Windows Vista.<br />

Are you using a cable connection to your PC or Bluetooth? If using Bluetooth, it is best to use the standard Windows Bluetooth drivers as opposed to drivers provided by manufacturers of Bluetooth dongles.

            Hi,<br />
I've just downloaded the latest PC suite for the Nokia 6500 slide.<br />
When I try to import a plain and simple .csv file containing all my contacts, following the procedure in the help files, I get a message saying "can't import this file. Please check the file format." I know the format is OK, as the file imports faultlessly
 into other phone software suites on the same computer. Tried several times with different files.<br />
Any ideas?<br />
Thanks<br />
Peter<br />
Running Vista on an Intel Mac &gt; No problems with other phone software.

<p>I've been trying to connect to wireless network in my university campus but I couldn't make it with E63.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IT Department released a configuration handbook. I easily set it on windows xp,vista,7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I try this config. on E63:</p>
<p>Data bearer : Wireless LAN</p>
<p>WLAN Network Name : yildiz-net</p>
<p>WLAN Security Mode : 802.1X</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WLAN Security Settings:</p>
<p>WPA/WPA2 : EAP</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; EAP Plug-in settings:</p>
<p>EAP-PEAP : Enabled</p>
<p>The rest of the list : Disabled</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; EAP-PEAP Settings:</p>
<p>Personal Certificate : Not defined</p>
<p>Authority Certificate: Not defined</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; EAPs Tag:</p>
<p>EAP-MSCHAPv2 : Enabled</p>
<p>User Name : l5406018</p>
<p>Prompt Password : Yes</p>
<p>Password : xxxxxxxxx</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I try to connect, I get an authorization error.</p>
<p>Do you think non-defined certificates may cause this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We don't use any certificates when setting on windows. How am I going to connect without certificates?</p>

<h2>            Outlook 365 keeps prompting me to re-enter email account passwords when doing a Send&#47;Receive</h2>
                    <p>I have a current subscription to Office 365 Home and today, several times when I did a manual "Send/Receive" Outlook would prompt me to re-enter the passwords for one or more of the email accounts that I have setup in Outlook.&nbsp; Even after re-entering the
 password and checking the box that says "remember this password" I would do another "Send/Receive" and received the prompt to re-enter the password for the same email account or another email account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Outlook configured to only do a Send/Receive when I manually click on the button in the ribbon.&nbsp; I do not have Outlook configured to do an auto send/receive on a time interval.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had this issue occasionally in the past but today, it happened multiple times.&nbsp; I have 13 email accounts setup in Outlook and have not added or removed any of these account for many months. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I stop this annoying issue?</p>

            Excel uses default Number formatting based on the settings in your <b>OS X System Preferences</b> for
<b>Language &amp; Text</b>. What you have set for <b>Formats</b> there is what Excel will offer when you next launch the program.<br />
<br />
If you want to use formatting that deviates from what you want as the default in System Preferences you'll need to use/create a Custom Format in Excel:
<b>Format&gt; Cells&gt; Number - <i>Custom</i></b>.<br />

            Unfortunately, because different operating systems handle memory differently, 512 MB may mean a lot to one OS, but much less to another. So you're comparing apples with oranges.

                    <p>I get the spinning beachball all the time, usually while context switching to Outlook but often while using it. &nbsp;The hangs last 3-10 seconds and are more frequent when I'm working with the calendar. &nbsp;I took a process sample during one such pause and it's
 1.3MB, not sure if that's normal. &nbsp;I'm trying to submit it through the Contact Support, but that's just sitting there spinning as well. &nbsp;</p>

            This appears to have solved the problem. &nbsp;I deleted a bunch of old events from my second calendar, exported the ones I wanted to keep, then deleted that calendar. &nbsp;I have since re-imported those events I wanted to keep and the performance problems have
 not returned so far. &nbsp;I'm willing to call this solved. &nbsp;

    <title>Issues with Windows 10 Technical Preview on Macbook Pro - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jukan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issues with Windows 10 Technical Preview on Macbook Pro</h2>
                    <p>I've installed the windows 10 technical preview on my Macbook Pro 8,1 (13 inch, late 2011) and I did not use bootcamp since I wanted (and possibly windows 10 requires) an EFI setup. Unfortunately this means that the sound card does not work for some reason
 (as detailed in another post on this forum). However I am having a bunch of other issues with the tech preview still.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, I'm stuck on build 9879 and the update software insists that their are no updates. This may be due to the internet I'm using since it is not a personal internet configuration (I'm at school right now so they use eduroam compus-wide). I have tried
 using wifi and ethernet and neither yield a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next issue, many of the fullscreen apps such as the feedback to do not work. When I try to open them they freeze and then must be closed. It's not all of them (eg. the pc settings app does work).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, Internet Explorer is completely unresponsive on startup and I have never been able to use it. I was forced to download the windows compy of Google Chrome on another computer and compy it over so that I could have access to the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunatly there are still problems with that. When trying to download files through chrome (or firefox) the file will download completely and then never "finish". If I cancel the download at this point, the complete file will be on my computer and I can
 use it but if I do not cancel the download from chrome/firefox then is will always say "downloading, 0 MB left - o kb/s" or something to that effect. I have tried troubleshooting the network connection and windows can't find anything wrong with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of these problems (except the sound card thing) may be caused by some issue in the network because it seems like only internet connect apps are having issues. For example, I have both the desktop and fullscreen versions of skype installed and the desktop
 version works perfectly fine while the fullscreen version fails to start (just closes after showing "skype" cloud for ~5 seconds".</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
My questions is, does anyone have an idea on how I can update to a later build? I think the old build I am on may be the root of at least some of these problems.</p>

<h2>            Images and object fill transparency in Publisher 2010 is not working</h2>
                    <p>When attempting to set the transparency of an object&nbsp;in Publisher 2010,&nbsp;the slider bar is 'greyed out' and unavailable.&nbsp; This goes for pictures, text boxes, shapes...you name it.&nbsp; My work around for now is to copy and paste what I need from PowerPoint where
 it is working fine.&nbsp; I am printing in RGB.&nbsp; Any ideas?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

            Maybe a little late but a copy and paste method is the only one that worked for the issue here.<br />
<br />
A coworker was using a template and couldn't use the transparency feature, even when the template was saved as a new publisher document.<br />
<br />
The next step we took was to make the shape with the transparency in a new document. we then copied it and pasted it into the template document. The transparency on the shape disappeared.<br />
<br />
The final solution for us was to goto the template document, hit Ctrl-A, then Ctrl-C. I then opened the blank Publisher document and hit Ctrl-V. In this new, visually identical document we could insert an object and use the transparency feature.<br />
<br />
Fun stuff!<br />
