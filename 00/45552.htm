    <title>LIVE Dashboard not loading - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> atryeu  say:</h3>
<h2>            LIVE Dashboard not loading</h2>
                    <p>Has anybody else had this issue for Xbox 360?&nbsp; Either upon starting my Xbox up or exiting a game to the Dashboard, most of the time a message pops up stating some services are down/having problems and gives the error code&nbsp; 8007274d&nbsp; (which the error code lookup tells me is something with profiles and not the issue I'm having).&nbsp; The Dashboard comes up, however it looks like it does if you are offline (no ads and all that). But, pressing the Xbox button on the controller shows I am logged into LIVE, the Dashboard just won't show it.</p><p><br /></p><p>This has been going on for days now. Sometimes it loads correctly but most of the time it gives me that error. Anybody else having this problem and anybody know what is going on, or is it just LIVE having issues?</p><p><br /></p><p>Thanks<br /></p>

The Dashboard didn't come up about 1am last night for me, but now (almost 1pm) it came up just fine. It can't make up it's mind. Anyway, no problems with Live when I've been on, just with that Dashboard :(<br /></p>

 </blockquote> <p>I don't know if your still around watching this topic, but have you noticed a pattern when it does it? For me, the Dashboard is loading 99% or so of the time when I first time the Xbox on. After I play a game and exit or tell it to go back to the Dashboard, that's where the error comes up for me every single time. If I've been playing a game and leave it, the Dashboard always gives the error and loads as if it's offline. :(<br /></p>

 </blockquote> <p>Thanks for the reply, I was hoping it was not just me still :( Part of me was wondering if clearing the cache would help, since it seems to only happen coming out of a game for me and not when I'm turning the Xbox on, but it took forever to get my Borderlands 2 in working order and last time clearing the cache messed up my DLCs and it took forever to get them working again (it did fix my other issues though in the game lol). I was afraid to try it until I finish the game completely though. I don't want to try and fix the DLC again. <br /></p>

<h2>            Emails from April 2012 are showing under Unread in Quick View in Windows Live Mail.</h2>
                    <p>My Quick View is showing 120 emails that I'm unable to delete, move, even open. Even if I mark them read and come back to Quick View later, they will have gone back to being Unread. These are all emails I recognize as being emails I would have deleted from
 my 2 Hotmail accounts without reading over A YEAR AGO! They’re all dated 2 to 12 April 2012! I already tried closing WLM and repairing Quick View by running regedit and deleting "searchfolderversion" under WLM menu. I also tried repairing Live Mail from Control
 Panel. And of course I tried rebooting as well. Nothing worked. Please help!</p>

<div><br />
<div>I have already tried deleting all email via webmail, thanks!</div>
<div><br />
<div>I kind of guessed an uninstall/install was the only solution. I was trying to avoid that because I just didn't want to deal with backing up emails and contacts.</div>

            Hi again Carissa,
<div><br />
<div>Well, here's what happened. I backed up WLM mail and contacts, uninstalled it, rebooted the computer, then re-installed it through&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-live/essentials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-live/essentials</a>.
 and then rebooted again.</div>
<div><br />
<div>As I was getting ready to import mail into WLM, I realized it had come back with my old messages, and the old problem. What to do now?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks.</div>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your cooperation and patience to resolve the issue. Sorry to hear that the steps provided didn't work for you. Let's see what we can do.
It is most likely that this is due to&nbsp;Windows Live Mail related files that became corrupted. As additional troubleshooting step, please perform a clean install of the program. Clean Install is different from manually removing then reinstalling the program.
 This process has steps that would permanently remove all&nbsp;Windows Live Mail&nbsp;related files on the system giving you a fresh new state to work on. Please follow the procedure below</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">:</span></p>

<h2>            BSOD crash due to ntoskrnl.exe and mfencbdc.sys every 5 minutes.</h2>
                    <p>Hi.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I am currently facing an issue with Blue Screen of Death appearing every 5 minutes with the message : System Service Exception (mfencbdc.sys) or the message Driver Verifier detected violation which i later analyzed to be realted to (ntoskrnl.exe).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The issue started 2 days back when windows update ran the following update : Intel Dynamic Platform and Thermal Framework Client Driver. The system crashed during the update and got stuck into a BSOD loop with the message PnP detected fatal error. I went into
 the safe mode and did all the hardware checks. I have done disk checks and ram tests showing that they are absolutely fine.The system is perfectly stable in Safe Mode.&nbsp;<br />
I finally reinstalled the previous stable version of the above mentioned Intel Driver and was finally atleast able to boot to desktop. Current status is that the system crashes every 5 minutes as mentioned. And the time is definitely NOT RANDOM. It crashes
 every time, without fail, at about the same time.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same issue occurred with the same Intel Update last to last week. I was lucky enough to be able to restore it. This time around the system has failed to restore and says that the restore files were damaged during the process.<br />
<br />
Any help is appreciated. The customer tech support at Windows refuse to acknowledge this issue and have asked me to do reinstall windows. I do not want to lose all the installed applications. I am providing a link to my dump files. Many thanks. &nbsp;<br />

            <p>ntoskrnl is one of the core windows processes, it almost never is the cause.&nbsp; Sometimes verifier&nbsp; mis identifies the cause which is why we have other tools to correctly ID the underlying issue.</p>

            Thank you ZigZag. You've been a huge help. A complete install of windows would've come at a great cost.<br />
<br />
Update : The system is running fine as of now. There haven't been any crashes. I will wait for 2 days, ensure everything is running fine and then post here if all is well.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Also if you could be kind enough to guide me with this : I have a 3 year subscription to McAfee (with almost 3 years remaning). Would you recommend that I reinstall McAfee and see if things work out ? If no, then, will the windows Defender suffice ?<br />
<br />
Also, I am quite frankly a bit scared of running the windows updates now. Should I ?

            <p>No zigzag, i spoke too soon. There have been a couple of BSOD crashes. They are pretty random as opposed to the ones i was facing earlier. I am uploading all the dump files again, coz i am unable to narrow down to the new ones. Please have a look. Let me
 know if a windows refresh is the only solution. :/<br />
</p>
<p>And a new problem. I cannot connect to the internet in my normal mode. In safe mode it runs fine but there are issues with the normal windows. The internet runs reallyyy really slow and after a while just stops.&nbsp;<br />
Thanks again.&nbsp;<br />

            <p>No zigzag i didn't. I never had Kaspersky installed. I had McAfee preinstalled which i removed right after you asked me to. I currently have windows defender turned on. Right after this the 5 min BSODs stopped and the laptop seemed to work fine.
<strong>But then there were BSODs due to rtwlane.sys</strong> . I think you are looking at the previous dump files when mcafee was installed. Let me try and reattach the files i feel are new.
<br />
I am sorry as i am unable to open the files and confirm that these are the very files i want you to have a look at. My apologies for any misunderstanding that my replies might have caused, but i never mentioned having Kaspersky.<br />
Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Logitech Quickcam Pro drivers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> amit_982  say:</h3>
<h2>            Logitech Quickcam Pro drivers</h2>
                    
<p>I just installed Windows 7 RC (64-bit edition), and everything seems fine, except the Webcam drivers. I have a Logitech Quickcam Pro for Notebooks, and here's the procedure I tried out to get it working:</p>
<p>1. Tried to install the drivers from the disc supplied with my webcam. No go - it says the operating system isn't supported. I then tried to run the setup.exe file in compatibility mode (right-click and select). I tried out different options - Windows XP
 (Home, the OS I was running prior to the Windows 7 RC installation - it worked fine here), Windows XP SP2, Windows Vista, Windows Vista SP2. But in each case I'm not able to install the drivers.</p>
<p>2. I then went to the Logitech webpage and downloaded the 64-bit Logitech Quickcam Pro (v11.8) drivers for Windows Vista. Further to the problem mentioned in (1), I thought that the problem was that the drivers on disc were for the 32-bit version, and the
 64-bit version should do the trick. But on running the setup file, I get the same message - software is not for this OS. I tried the compatibility troubleshoot (selecting Vista/Vista-SP2), but doesn't work.
<br />
Any help, anyone?</p>
<p>I'm running Windows 7 RC (64-bit edition) on an AMD X2 - Tureon processor. My webcam is Logitech Quickcam Pro for notebooks and the installation disc has software v11.5 (XP, Vista capable). The webcam was running just fine in windows XP Home (SP3).</p>
<p>Can the virtual PC mode be of help here? I don't think so, since I guess the Virtual PC mode would take care only of software and not (?) driver compatibility (?).</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
something I am wondering about you do not mention in the post:<br />
<br />
Why are you installing the drivers?<br />
<br />
In my experience, Windows 7 has "grown up" and contains lots of default drivers now.<br />
<br />
Can you remember the status of the Webcam in Device manager before loading <em>any
</em>driver? Maybe it was already recognized from the beginning, and there may even not be a reason to install another one.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ciao,<br />
Sabine

<p>You really don't&nbsp; --&nbsp; at best you delay it.&nbsp; You can grab Windows 10 1703 and create media and install using it and wait until 1709 is offered and
<a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3232632/microsoft-windows/how-to-block-windows-10-fall-creators-update-from-installing.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
HIDE it...&nbsp; (Detailed below, linked to here</a> - scroll to the last part of the article and follow the directions I will also post below...)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to run Windows 10 and get patches for security and such, you want to be running at least one of the last two released builds (1703 or 1709 right now, soon to be 1709 and MAYBE 1811) or, sooner rather than later, you get no more security patches.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you had the option of getting the LTSC version, that could stick you at build 1607 without Cortana/Edge for a decade.&nbsp; (Unlikely.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, you would need to run Windows 8.1 or 7 if you don't want to be part of this ~18 month cycle Microsoft has going on now.&nbsp; Windows 7 - good on updates thru January 2020.&nbsp; Windows 8.1 - good on updates thru January 2023.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Out of curiosity - what is the make &amp; model of the computer in question and - in particular - the make / model of your video card and network card?&nbsp; Also - is your motherboard/system BIOS fully updated?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Often a CLEAN installation of Windows 10 (post-current-driver installation) works better than upgrade...&nbsp; And sometimes, especially with the Fall Creators Update, a BIOS update is NECESSARY for stability - not suggested.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>** From the <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3232632/microsoft-windows/how-to-block-windows-10-fall-creators-update-from-installing.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
linked to article</a>...</p>
<p>
</p><p>To prevent any nasty surprises, you should run wushowhide before you switch off any of the 1709-blocking techniques mentioned in this feature. If 1709 is being offered on your machine, wushowhide lets you “hide” the patch
 while you use Windows Update to get your other patches brought up to date.<br />
</p>
<p>Here’s how to run wushowhide:</p>
<p><span><br />
Step 1</span>. Go to&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">KB 3073930</a>&nbsp;and download Microsoft's Wushowhide tool. (Click the link marked "Download the 'Show or hide updates' troubleshooter package now.")
 Drag the downloaded file, Wushowhide.diagcab, to any convenient location.</p>
<p><span><br />
Step 2.</span>&nbsp;Double-click on Wushowhide.diagcab to run it.</p>
<p><span><br />
Step 3.&nbsp;<em>This part’s important.</em></span>&nbsp;Click the link marked Advanced. Uncheck the box marked "Apply repairs automatically." Click Next.</p>
<p><span><br />
Step 4.</span>&nbsp;Wushowhide will run for a long, long time. When it comes back up for air, click the link to Hide Updates. If you see a checkbox marked "Feature update to Windows 10, version 1709," as in the screenshot, check the box next to the item and click
 Next. (If you don't see "Feature update to Windows 10, version 1709," the upgrade isn't being sent to your box yet. “X” out of wushowhide and check again tomorrow.)</p>
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fimages.idgesg.net%2fimages%2farticle%2f2017%2f10%2fwushowhide-100738555-large.jpg" height="539" width="620" />&nbsp;
<p><br />
Wushowhide is an odd bird. If it successfully hid the upgrade/update/patch, you’ll see a "Troubleshooting has completed" dialog with your 1709 patch marked as a “Problems found.” You did everything right.</p>
<p><span><br />
Step 5.</span>&nbsp;Click Close. You're done.</p>
<p><br />
If you don't trust Microsoft's wushowhide tool, you can verify for yourself that it hid the Fall Creators Update. Go back to Windows Update (Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for Updates) your machine should show "Your device is up to date."
 The Fall Creators Update didn't get installed.</p>
<p><br />
When you're ready to install the Fall Creators Update – you probably will, at some point – the reverse procedure's just as easy. Here’s how to unhide the update:</p>
<p><span><br />
Step 1.</span>&nbsp;Double-click on Wushowhide.diagcab to run it.&nbsp;<em>This part’s important.</em>&nbsp;Click the link marked Advanced. Uncheck the box marked "Apply repairs automatically." Click Next.</p>
<p><span><br />
Step 2.</span>&nbsp;Wushowhide will run for a long time. When it comes back up, click the link to Show hidden updates.</p>
<p><span><br />
Step 3.</span>&nbsp;Check the box next to "Feature update to Windows 10, version 1709," click Next, and click Next again.</p>
<p>Wushowhide will dutifully tell you it is "Resolving problems." When it's done, you see a "Troubleshooting has completed" dialog.</p>
<p><span><br />
Step 4.&nbsp;</span>Click Close.<br />
</p>
<p>The Fall Creators Update will then get queued up again and the next time Windows Update runs (you can check for updates manually, or let it run by itself, likely overnight), your machine will reboot into Windows 10 Redstone
 3, version 1709, Fall Creators Update, build 16299.</p>

            Thank you! will attempt this tomorrow, even though i went in and delayed it till next Wednesday, it installed anyway. Then no sound again till i uninstalled 1709. HP Pavilion as was last p.c. A friend had a problem signing into Xbox after his update. They
 should allow you to choose an install.

    <title>How to connect my Surface Pro to a WPA2-Enterprise Network with PEAP - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xxtom997xx  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to connect my Surface Pro to a WPA2-Enterprise Network with PEAP authentication</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am trying to connect my Surface Pro to a WPA2-Enterprise Network with PEAP authentication at my work.&nbsp; The company I work for has a separate wireless network for employees to connect personal devices to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not a network admin, I have no access or knowledge of the how the wireless network is setup or the equipment/company that the network is setup on&nbsp;(i.e. I have seen Cisco listed in other posts as being problematic, I don't know if we use a Cisco network
 or not).&nbsp; I haven't gotten our IT guys involved because it is clearly stated that our IT group doesn't fully support this network and we are on our own in getting assistance in connecting devices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't believe there is any issue on the network side that would be causing me any problems as I have been able to connect an android smartphone (running ICS) without issue.&nbsp; I don't know of anyone else having problems either, although I don't know of anyone
 else connecting with a Window 8 device, let alone a Surface.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried the instructions on another post on this site (the instructions are quoted below) about manually configuring the network and that didn't work for me.&nbsp; Changing the WPA2 Enterprise from AES to TKIP caused error message saying that my settings
 didn't match the network requirements. Using the AES option allowed me to hit "Connect" but it just sat there and eventually timed out before connecting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not very knowledgeable about network connectivity or any of the settings/options, so specificity in the insturctions of any solution would be&nbsp;better.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any help on this would be greatly appreciated. Thank you</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div>Figured out a work-around. &nbsp;It might be local to the wacky network configuration here, but might prove to be helpful for anyone else having the problem. &nbsp;Here's how I fixed it:
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1) Removed the &lt;ssid&gt; from my list of known networks</div>
<div>2) Went to the "Network and Sharing Center" in the Win 8 desktop</div>
<div>3) Manually configure a wireless network</div>
<div>4) Enter the &lt;ssid&gt; of the LEAP network&nbsp;</div>
<div>5) Select WPA/WPA2 - Enterprise with TKIP&nbsp;</div>
<div>6) Select PEAP as the Authenication Method</div>
<div>7)Goto Settings for the Authentication Method</div>
<div>a) Uncheck "Verify server's identity..."</div>
<div>b) Set Authentication Method to "Secured Password (EAP-MSCHAP v2)"</div>
<div>c) Click "OK"</div>
<div>7) Go to advanced settings</div>
<div>a) Specify Authentction mode = User Authentication</div>
<div>b)&nbsp;Set the user credentials (i.e., AD domain username/password)</div>
<div>8) Click "OK"</div>
<div>9) Connect to &lt;ssid&gt;"</div>
</div>
</div>
                </div>

            Thank you. I could not connect and this has worked.<br />
<br />
For anyone else having this problem I could not configure access manually because the network profile was configured on my RT although it was not displayed in the GUI.&nbsp; I had to delete it and then configure manually using the above instructions.<br />
<br />
To delete manually:<br />
<ol>
<li>Windows Key + X</li><li>Open the command prompt (Admin)</li><li>Type: <span>netsh wlan delete profile name="ProfileName"<br />
(see http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/manage-wireless-network-profiles)<br />
</span></li><li><span>Then follow the instructions above</span></li></ol>
<p>HTH :)<br />

            If the IT guys at your workplace have set up this network with this level of authentication, then I cannot understand them not offering some level of support. The only thing I could say is that possibly they are using a different Authentication Method
 (Step 7b). You could try the other options to see if one of them sticks during the network setup wizard.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, it would be best to involve the IT guys there as they will have the most knowledge of the network as well as view their logs to see where the authentication might be failing. If the Surface Pro is not joined to the domain and that is a requirement
 for connecting, that may be an issue too.<br />
<br />
Best to speak to them if at all possible.<br />
<br />
<b>**Poster states that entering his credentials after the wizard when prompted by the network and using AES instead of TKIP worked for him**</b><br />

<h2>            Windows 7 Install Fails - Missing NDIS.SYS</h2>
                    
<p>I have a brand new Pentium Core I3 machine with 4gb of Ram and an Asrock H55M-LE Motherboard.</p>
<p>I installed W7 a couple of weeks ago, and it was running pretty well. Activated OK&nbsp;- Windows Updates had run OK &amp; I was running Microsoft Security Essentials and Windows default firewall as&nbsp;virus protection.</p>
<p>However it did have the occasional BSOD which I suspected were due to mobo driver problems.</p>
<p>I tried to install the drivers from the Asrock mobo Install disk, but things seemed to get worse, with BSODs &amp;&nbsp;machine freezes.</p>
<p>It would run OK in safe mode but kept failing in normal boot mode, so eventually I figured "Lets cut my losses and start again from a clean machine".</p>
<p>I managed to do a clean install of W7 and in the process removed/reformated&nbsp;the existing partitions on the drive. W7 would run after a fashion, and has&nbsp;been activated again, but seemed to have become very unstable, so I tried to rerun the fresh install from
 the DVD again.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I now can't even reinstall W7&nbsp;from disk!!!!</p>
<p>It runs through the "windows is loading files..."&nbsp; screen, starts the Loading Windows splash screen then fails at "Windows Boot Manager" Windows failed to start and says to do this</p>
<p>1)insert the installation disk 2)Chose langauge&lt;next&gt; 3)Click "Repair computer"</p>
<p>File NDIS.SYS Status: 0x0000221 Info: Windows failed to looad because a required file is missing, or corrupt</p>
<p>I'm running from the installation disk when I get&nbsp;this message, so can never get to the "Repair Computer" dialog, as it happens each time I&nbsp;restart from the install&nbsp;disk, not from&nbsp;the existing&nbsp;W7!!!!</p>
<p>I've even reinstalled XP - done a full format of the drive and Xp has loaded&nbsp;OK, but if I then try to do an upgrade to W7 from the disk&nbsp;I just get the "windows is loading files..."&nbsp; and can't get beyond the "restart &amp; repair computer message!!!</p>
<p>It's all a bit Catch-22 now..... I've wasted a whole day &amp; now have a system far worse than when I started, which has a working copy of XP but can't be upgraded to W7</p>
<p>Please.... can anyone help???</p>
<div>
<div>Oh BTW&nbsp;- the install disk is a boxed retail version of Windows7 home premium, and I'm using the 32bit install disk.</div>

                    <p class="contentStandard">It has been 51 days since Big Bang when this monster of an error first appeared and we have been hearing the same story over and over again, wait for 24 to 48 hours, activation servers busy, hardware ID issues blah blah blah...</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">I am creating this thread so all of us who have this issue can ask the question in a single unified thread. Hopefully, this way the complete gravity of the issue would be apparent. Please share your activation issue and any contact
 you might have had with MS service execs etc ...</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard"><em><strong>***************************My Experience with the Win 10 Upgrade and Activation Issues</strong></em><em><strong>**************************</strong></em><br />
</p>
<p class="contentStandard">I have been an insider ever since the program opened up last year. I was automatically upgraded from Build 10240 to Windows 10 PRO and it was activated. Some driver issues forced me to perform a clean install. I used the windows
 Media Creation tool and created a bootable USB of Windows 10 PRO 64 Bit edition. I am well aware of how this needs to be performed as I have been doing it well over an year so no issues in the new version of the windows I downloaded from the website.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Post Clean install, I get the error&nbsp;0xc004c003. Sometimes the description is that the server determined the key is blocked and or the copy is not genuine. I find that bizzare as the Keys were provided by MS to begin with. Other
 times I get the same error code but this time with the description that I should connect to the internet to activate which once again is ludicrous as I am anyways connected to the internet.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><ul>
<li>Running an automated script of "slmgr /ato" has not activated my copy of windows</li><li>Resetting windows from within WIN 10 has not activated it either</li><li>Contacted MS support multiple times and each time I am either told to wait 24 - 48 hours or put in queue for Level 2 Tech support which never answers and I have to hang up after waiting for over 2 to 3 hours</li></ul>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">*******************************************************************************************************************************</p>
<p class="contentStandard">Is MS going to officially acknowledge this issue with one consolidated opinion and release a fix for all us day 0 early adopters (and yes, others too) or are you going to leave us hanging as always?</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><em><strong>P.S. If you do not have a solution for this issue, please do not misguide the folks by replying to this thread giving suggestions and hacks or&nbsp;tweaks&nbsp;to activate a clean install or suggest reset PC etc as a substitute
 for clean install. Please understand that is a very tech savvy group of people so do not insult our intelligence by misdirecting the issue. We are trying to unite everyone who has an issue with activation of Windows 10 clean install after upgrading and activating,
 please respect our desire to do so.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><strong>****************More Clarification for the MVPs &amp; Windows Insiders who performed a clean install ****************</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><em><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">I am fully aware that the Free Upgrade offer is for windows 7 and windows 8.1 users only. The Insider Preview participants who did not have an underlying legitimate OS (Win7 or
 Win8.1) do not get a free upgrade of Windows 10.</span></strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">However, If the Insider Preview was installed on a Legitimate version of Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 and then upgraded to Windows 10 RTM, it should be activated just like it is activated for upgrades directly from Windows 7 or Windows
 8.1 and has been clearly mentioned in the <a href="http://blogs.windows.com/bloggingwindows/2015/06/19/upcoming-changes-to-windows-10-insider-preview-builds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Insider Blog Post</a></p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">I will not question the Flip-flop Microsoft has done regarding giving Windows Insiders a Free copy of RTM but here is my Upgrade path ...</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Windows 8.1 PRO (WMC Version) --&gt; Windows 10 Insider Preview (all builds upto 10240) --&gt; Windows 10 PRO Activated --&gt; Clean Install --&gt; Activation Error Code&nbsp;0xc004c003</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Any other flaw you would like to point out in the upgrade procedure? Maybe we need to have consulted an Oracle for the exact time for an upgrade or perhaps it is a Google Conspiracy to under-clock the activation of MS Servers or
 maybe, just maybe the activation has been redirected towards a cupertino firm instead of the MS servers in Somalia?</p>

            <p>I see that it was not your intention to Free Upgrade from Technical Preview which is becoming an Insider preview channel.&nbsp; Thank you for clarifying that you weren't attempting free Upgrade which is only available for Window 7 or 8.1.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case I'd suggest contacting the Insider program for Support because several hundred million consumers are trying to get the free Upgrade right now and MS Support is completely swamped.&nbsp; I doubt whether they can Support Insider previewers at this
 time.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the latest on how the Insider program is going to continue after Windows 10 release, and how to activate your latest build:&nbsp;

            <p>Same problem. Upgraded win 7 to 10. Saw that I was activated. Did a clean install and skipped all the product key prompts. I think I am suppose to just be automatically activated but so far all I'm getting is error code 0xC004C003. I've been told to wait
 many times over the last week so I'm still waiting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it's true that Microsoft is offering windows 10 free for even pirated copies of windows 7 &amp; 8, then why not just activate everyone? And why is it so hard for genuine copies to upgrade and get activated?</p>

            <p>Even I had the same exact issue. I have been the insider since day one. I upgraded from insider to released version via upgrade. It says activated. As there was too much dump in the system because of so many builds I decided to clean install. But since then
 the same error. I tried all the ways mention above but no help. This is really frutrating.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is how MS is paying the insiders who helped the windows 10 to come upto this stage. This is bltant cheating if in case its not activated.</p>

            <p>Upgraded from a valid/legal Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 Tech preview, to&nbsp; Windows 10 RTM.&nbsp; After RTM (which was properly activated), I did a clean install of Windows 10 (booting the install&nbsp;from a USB stick).&nbsp;&nbsp; The clean install will not active.&nbsp; I have tried
 both the product key from the original Windows 8 and the product key from the Windows 10 RTM upgrade (which was different).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The microsoft phone activation tech support people claim that it's a server overload issue, but that is clearly not the case.&nbsp; It's a usage scenario that their activation algorithms do not properly handle.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I see it, there are two options for people in this boat:</p>
<p>1) Just wait, and see if they fix the activation server algorithms.&nbsp; Hopefully someone at MSFT knows there is an issue.</p>
<p>2) Re-install the original OS and perform an upgrade to Windows 10.&nbsp; Perhaps a clean install from the original OS would also work. This is obviously a lot of work (the OS we love to hate), or impossible if you have a computer with no installation media (very
 common these days).</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>System Restore does not alter Data files. System Restore points retain your Computer Settings and&nbsp;are used to put your Computer Settings back to an earlier date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is how to use System Restore.</p>
<p><span><a href="http://bertk.mvps.org/html/restoresysv.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://bertk.mvps.org/html/restoresysv.html</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>And if you have any problems using it, please read this.</span></p>
<span>
<p>1. If you are using Norton, you will&nbsp;have to disable Norton's Tamperproof Protection before using System Restore.</p>
<p><a href="http://service1.symantec.com/support/sharedtech.nsf/pfdocs/2005113009323013" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://service1.symantec.com/support/sharedtech.nsf/pfdocs/2005113009323013</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Try using System Restore in Safe Mode.</p>
<p><a href="http://bertk.mvps.org/html/restoresysv.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://bertk.mvps.org/html/restoresysv.html</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Malware will stop System Restore.</p>
<p>Download, install,&nbsp;update and scan your System with the free version of&nbsp;Malwarebytes AntiMalware, if necessary&nbsp;in Safe Mode with Networking:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And here is how to get into Safe Mode options; choose Safe Mode with Networking from the list of options:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</a></p>

<p>Cheers.</p>

    <title>PS3 to Xbox one switchover disappointing. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cryptvicious  say:</h3>
<h2>            PS3 to Xbox one switchover disappointing. </h2>
                    
<p>Hello all. I just recently made the switchover from PS3 to xbox one right around the time Titanfall came out and for the reason that to me Titanfall looked like the best game available on consoles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After unboxing and d'loading the console and the game, I quickly found that my LT button wasn't working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I could have went across town and had it replaced for free where I purchased &nbsp;my new system but I wanted to play the game I just spent $800 plus on!! I was excited. Let's get it on!!</p>
<p>I opted for the nearest retailer which was minutes away. After a few days that controller went down. It just stopped working. I went out and bought another without returning it and now A month or so later, this one isn't charging anymore and I can't use
 my expensive headset I purchased with the system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>About a week ago my girlfriend bought 3 xbox gold live cards for me (valued at $25 each) but they were supposed to be just the normal xbox cards you can buy games and movies with online. The retailer refused to exchange them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just moved away to a small town a few days ago to take care of my Father who is sick and this is when the controller stopped working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I caved and finally spoke to a xbox rep via chat and explained my situation just hoping something could be done about anything, you know, given the whole sitchyation</p>
<p>The best they could do they said was if I drove the 4 hours south to the retailer and somehow got them on the phone with the xbox rep, MAYBE they could do something.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ummm...no Microsoft. No. Thanks for making my switch from PS3 to Xbox one a smooth and painless one though. You guys are all heart. They need to take a page from Apple's customer service book.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ok I'm done. Nobody listening anyway.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As for the controller, you can only blame yourself for not taking it back to the place you purchased it from to get a replacement.</p>
<p>As for the Live cards.... unfortunately, this would be your girlfriend's fault for buying the wrong thing. &nbsp;I can understand (kind of) why a retail store wouldn't offer refunds on these as it is just a code. &nbsp;</p>
<p>So, yea, I can't really fault MS in any of this. &nbsp;Why/How did you spend $800?</p>

    <title>Windows XP task manager does not show process image names - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows XP task manager does not show process image names</h2>
                    I'm running Windows XP with SP3. In Task Manager, the process image names are not shown and in the column chooser the process image name, though ticked, is greyed out. I only have the PID numbers. So, I can't tell what processes are running. There are
 57 processes running, which seems like too many.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have tried running "tasklist&nbsp; &gt;&nbsp; tasklist.txt"<b>
</b>from the command prompt, but it just flashes and nothing happens. Does this mean I have a trojan? What can I do about it?&nbsp;

            That looks pretty good to me - now we know your XP version and Service pack, system make and model, BIOS version, amount of RAM installed, the size of your paging file and according to NEC, you system has SATA drives and few other things.<br />
<br />
47 Processes may be okay depending on what else you have installed and running on your system.<br />
<br />
Looking at my notes, I see I told myself some time ago that the tasklist.exe program does not come with XP but there is a copy on my SkyDrive for you to download.<br />
<br />
Here's how:<br />
<br />
Here is the link to my SkyDrive and you can look for the file you need there:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=6a7e789cab1d6f39&amp;id=6A7E789CAB1D6F39!311" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=6a7e789cab1d6f39&amp;id=6A7E789CAB1D6F39!311</a><br />
<br />
You can download it and when you do, put a copy of the file in these folders (assuming Windows is installed on your C drive):<br />
<br />
<b>c:\windows\system32</b><br />
<br />
When you see the files available for download, you may not see the file extension (.exe, .dll, .cpl, .sys, .zip, etc.), but when you download them they will have the correct extension.<br />
<br />
When you download the file (especially if you use Internet Explorer), when you get a chance to save the file, your browser may not save the file with an extension (like .exe, .dll, .cpl, .sys, .zip, etc.) so you will have to manually add the proper extension
 to the file when you download the file before you save it.<br />
<br />
You can download the file with no extension and then rename the file to add the proper extension.&nbsp; You don't want to try to use a file called
<b>tasklist </b>when the file name really needs to be called <b>tasklist.exe</b> (if the downloaded file has no extension you will have to change the name of the file to add the proper extension to get it to work.<br />
<br />
Then when you run tasklist &gt; tasklist.txt you should end up with a tasklist.txt file that you can open with a text editor.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you even <i>think </i>yous system might be afflicted with malicious software, it never hurts to run these free scans before troubleshooting:<br />
<br />
No matter what else you are using for malicious software protection, do this:<br />
<br />
Download, install, update and do a quick scan with these free malware detection programs (not at the same time) and remove any threats:<br />
<br />
Malwarebytes (MBAM):&nbsp; <a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free</a><br />
SUPERAntiSpyware: (SAS):&nbsp; <a href="http://www.superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.superantispyware.com/</a><br />
<br />
SAS will probably report a bunch of tracking cookies and you can just let it delete them.<br />
<br />
They can be uninstalled later if desired.<br />
<br />
When the scans run clean, reboot and then troubleshoot any remaining issues.<br />

<p>
</p><p>I am getting&nbsp;0Xc1900101 - 0x30017 error when I am trying to upgrade HP Stream 7 to windows 10. I used the MediaCreationTool to Upgrade to win 10. It downloaded the updates &amp; processed everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then the booting and actual upgrade started. it went for a while and on first restart got hung. I waited to 2 hours and then forcefully shut it down. On restart it tried to re initiate the update but it also failed and then the message came "restoring your
 previous version of windows". </p>
<p>
</p><p>Once the restore finished, I got the error message. The error says "the installation failed in the first boot phase with an error during Boot operation".</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have attached any secondary drives or any other external devices, I would suggest you to disconnect them all except for mouse and keyboard. I would also suggest you to choose the option to create a installation media and then choose the ISO option.
 Once you have the ISO file, open it in File Explorer and click on the 'Setup.exe' file to initiate the upgrade. Make sure that you don't boot from the installation media and perform a clean install as this will require a product key.<br />

            A basic question is do you have enough storage space?&nbsp; The Stream 7 comes with 32GB and that probably won't be enough free.&nbsp; You may need to add a micro SD card as a D drive to store the backup 5.5 GB.&nbsp; I got a C1900101 error by interrupting the incredibly
 slow update.&nbsp; I had to let the update run overnight with power cord attached. (I ran Windows update&nbsp;after the download and did not use the ISO process)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>1. Yes, and it's free to download (the version for online play, the offline version costs money) but you must have an
<a href="https://www.xbox.com/live/gold" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox Live Gold membership</a> to play online multiplayer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. You only need a controller and maybe a headset to talk to others (optional).</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Technically it should be better on the Xbox One S, due to it's improved performance over the first Xbox One.</p>

            The headsets are pretty standard these days, You don't need a crazy expensive one but you do want to factor in sound quality, &nbsp;comfort, etc. The game Fortnite itself is free, The Save The World Addition is not, That one gives additional game modes and
 bonus content in game.&nbsp;

            What is the make and model of your computer?
<br />
<br />First, run the Playing audio troubleshoot - open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down, select Playing audio
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart your computer then check if audio is working again.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Sound, video and game controllers
<br />
<br />Right click your audio adapter
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Driver tab
<br />
<br />Is there an option rollback?
<br />If so, click it.
<br />
<br />Also, check to make sure the audio driver is fully updated. This is often the problem when you upgrade to a new version of Windows 10. Sometimes reinstalling the latest available driver from the manufacturers website helps.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: change sound card
<br />Select the Playback
<br />Right click your Speakers
<br />Click Set as Default Device if it isn't already
<br />
<br />Select your speakers
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Levels tab
<br />Use the slider to adjust level 
<br />
<br />1. Play a youtube video with the soundcard speaker jack unplugged and let it play through the laptop's inbuilt speakers.
<br />2. While it is playing, plug in the audio jack and see if it starts playing.

            Hi Lee, I am Rob, a volunteer and a 10 time and dual award MVP specializing in Windows troubleshooting and Bluescreen analysis. Please remember as volunteers we are not responsible for the development of Windows or the computer hardware and drivers. 
<br /> 
<br />Here is my audio troubleshooter however you should skip down and update or re-install the latest drivers. If needed come back to the top.
<br />
<br />Check with your System Maker's Support (Motherboard Maker for custom systems) their online documentation and drivers, and ask in their forums about any known issues.  Or with the actual audio/sound device makers if a separate card/device.
<br />
<br />=====
<br />
<br />Fix common sound problems &lt;-- read this link
<br /><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/fix-sound-problems#v1h=tab01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/f...</a> 
<br />
<br />
<br />No sound in Windows - Use the troubleshooters - Start - Settings - Update and Security - Troubleshoot --&gt; "Playing Audio" &amp; "Hardware &amp; Devices"&amp; "Recording Audio".
<br />
<br />-----
<br />
<br />Check to see if you have the latest available driver. Download and install the latest driver. If you have the latest driver re-install the same one.
<br />
<br />How to manually install drivers.
<br />
<br />Check with System Maker (Motherboard Maker for custom systems) for updates to the BIOS, low-level chipset drivers, and the major onboard and separate device drivers. Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without 
<br /> Dump in their name.
<br />
<br />DriverView - Free - utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.
<br /><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</a>
<br />
<br />For Drivers check System Maker, as fallbacks, and the Device Maker's for which are the most current. Right Click the Start Button - Device Manager - Sound - write down the make and complete model of your sound adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.
<br />
<br />Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Display Adapters, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.
<br />
<br />Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples) (as rollback) and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset, and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)
<br />
<br />Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.
<br />
<br />Always check in Right Click Start Button - Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check in Device Manager to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.
<br />
<br />Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at Device Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.
<br />
<br />Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.

            Thanks for the quick response.&nbsp; After further digging and looking at all system devices I discovered a warning (!) on my NVIDIA graphics card.&nbsp; Went to the NVIDIA site and downloaded latest drivers for my NVIDIA 635 card and that seems to have fixed the
 problem.

<p>As far as I'm aware of an exclusive Achievement is unlocked if you pre ordered the Xbox One through the dashboard only but pre ordering from the website will not give you the achievement.</p>
<p>If you pre ordered the day one edition then a code to redeem will be supplied in-box. However this is a seperate achievement from the one you seem to be referring to.</p>

<p>According to the Microsoft Store (I ordered mine at a physical location and asked) you get the achievement when you sign on to a Day One Edition console. You should get the achievement when you actually get the console later.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
The achievement you get when you pre-order from the Xbox 360 console is a separate achievement than what you'll get when you first un-box your Xbox One.<br />
<br />
<strong><a href="https://twitter.com/MicrosoftStore/status/346752921964265472" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Source</a></strong>.<br />
<br />
If you'd like the pre-order achievement, you'll need to cancel your preorder from the Microsoft Store website and instead preorder directly from the Xbox 360 Dashboard. The order will still be through the Microsoft Store.. Doesn't make much sense but hey, I
 guess that's how it works. Looks like you get 2 achievements total for pre-ordering through the dashboard (dashboard and the one you get when you get the console), and only 1 when you just preorder any sort of Day One Edition console, through the Microsoft
 Store or through another retailer.</p>

<p>Not from what I was told from xbox support over the phone...hopefully an official will see this with in a day or so and fix my issue...plus if I was to try and pre order again I don't think I could since they are not accepting any more orders.</p>

<p>Not sure where you're seeing that they aren't taking orders anymore, but the Dashboard still shows an icon to reserve a Day One edition console, as does the Microsoft Store website.<br />
<br />
You can actually cancel your order and then reserve on the console, but if you'd like to wait until an official representative sees this even after looking through the sources then feel free.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yeah this started because I'm on a family plan with my buddy and 2 others to save money on gold. Not knowing the limitations of not being the primary. After the first year it started to become a little more frustrating and caused me to remove my self from
 the plan today. So I am goin to reserve on now that I'm off of it and knowing that I still can.</p>

            Hi there Douglas, thanks for your quick reply ! Yeah, that external page helped me greatly actually - looks like i just need to enable the 'document review' function . have yet to jump into this so will let you know how i go. I am not a developer but I'm
 super keen on learning stuff - I actually even downloaded the SDK for speech recognition - and in that package is a huge 2000 page text on developing the speech recognition ...way over my head but an interesting read !

<p>I actually want to Control what documents microsofts actually 'reviews' with regard to this service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do i go about this. I want to set up a folder with texts specifically FOR the program if you see what i mean. Surely a microsoft developer can furnish me with a solution here. ! : ) ? thanks@</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I will leave the legal part for the experts.</p>
<p>The only way a cloned hard disk can work in a new computer is when both pieces of hardware (new and old pc) are identical, specially the motherboard.</p>
<p>Trying to move one disk to another PC will render Windows 7 unusable unless the motherboard, and other pieces of hardware, are identical.</p>

<p>What if I&nbsp;transfered&nbsp;the cloned Windows 7 hard drive to another computer of the same model.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;motherboards&nbsp;are the same kind so would that work?</p>

            It might not always work.&nbsp; Sometimes the motherboards can have a different "revision" number.

<p>Not enough information for a good answer, but in short I cannot think of a reasonable set of circumstances where this would be legal.</p>

<p>Yes cloning the disk&nbsp;is probably legal (you may say&nbsp;you did&nbsp;an image&nbsp;backup, or the orignal PC got broken :) - but hacking Win7 to work around activation is not for sure.</p>

<p>If you only have 1 license for 1 PC, it is legal to clone, use it in another PC but you&nbsp;are not supposed&nbsp;use it anymore on the first PC.</p>

            <p>probably no because as you connect to a network it goes to microsoft.com and registers it, it would have already registerd the produck key/iso image and then a alert would be sent to microsoft and then to fbi would track your ip adress from your isp(internet
 service provider) and track you down and arrest you</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>that is why there are iso cd sold for $40-190</p>

            I want to just say, by cloning, do you mean installing on multiple computers? If so, Totally, within 30 days. A product key can only occupy 1 computer at a time so you can install W&amp; on as many computers at a time, but only 1 will work well infinity. After
 30 days, I found that there is an annoying black background, update is disabled, certain Microsoft programs will not start, and performance slows, but windows still boots!
