<h2>            I cannot install Outlook 2013.</h2>
                    <p>I tried to install Outlook 2013. It comes up with the orange message box and starts showing the % ready. Gets to about 50% then disappears.</p>
<p>I have Office 2010 installed (excl. Outlook) and previously had a 2013 trial installed... both uninstalled now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think the problems started when I did a Windows update.</p>

<p>Yes, you have to do something - build an app for the HoloLens to contribute to the community. Microsoft is promising good documentation and tutorials, so shouldn't be too difficult. Have fun while you're at it and tell us what you build!</p>

<br />No contacts are being transferred.   Can you help?
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />Hello Dan
<br />
<br />#1 - The first thing to eliminate is the possibility of the CSV file being corrupt just to get that out of the way. 
<br />- can you open the CSV file in Excel without any issues? To ask this another way, when you open the CSV file - do you get any questions as part of opening the file? (if this is a valid CSV file, it should open directly with no UI interactions)
<br />
<br />#2 - If the answer is yes to item #1 - re-save the opened worksheet as a CSV file with a new file name and try to import that newly saved file - does the issue remain?
<br />
<br />#3 - Are you (manually) explicitly mapping the fields in the csv file to the Outlook field by clicking on the &lt;Map Custom Fields&gt; button when presented during the import process?
<br />
<br />#4 - If yes, in what type (POP3, Imap, Exchange) of email account is the contact folder located? If POP3, first thing I'd suggest is to repair the PST file associated with the POP3 account to eliminate the possibility of a corrupt PST file. (You may need to run ScanPST several times to eliminate all possible errors (if any exist).
<br />
<br />#5 - Can you successfully import this CSV file on any other computer? If yes, would suggest doing an &lt;online repair&gt; of the Office 2013 installation to eliminate any possible program issues.

<p>Hello Karl.</p>
<p>#1 - No issues when opening CSV File.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2&nbsp; - I did re-save a new copy of this contact list as CSV file again and before saving it asked me&nbsp; the following - "Some features in your workbook might be lost if you save it as a CSV (Comma Delimited).&nbsp; &nbsp;Do you want to keep using that format?&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes,
 No or Help.&nbsp; &nbsp; If I click Yes, it just lets me save another copy as CSV and that opens fine also.&nbsp; &nbsp;I tried to import the new file with the same result as I had with the first file.&nbsp; Outlook just shuts down about 2 seconds after I click finish.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>#3 - No</p>
<p>
</p><p>#4 - n/a</p>
<p>
</p><p>#5 -&nbsp; Have not tried this yet since I don't want to add those contacts to mine or another's list of contacts.&nbsp; &nbsp;I may try it on the old computer to see if issues doing that but that would be importing it back to Outlook 2010.&nbsp; &nbsp;How would I do an online repair
 to Outlook 2013 installation?&nbsp; Is there a link?&nbsp; &nbsp;Would that mess up any of the many folders w/ emails saved she already has on her current version?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<br />
<br />Re: #4 - The type of account dictates the type of data file involved and if the data file is corrupt, could certainly have an impact so would deal with this potential issue before anything else.
<br />
<br />Re: #5 - On-line repair is done by either going to Control Panel &lt;Programs&gt; -&gt; click on Office 2013 --&gt; &lt;Change&gt; --&gt; &lt;Online Repair&gt;
<br />
<br />It would definitely would not have an impact on anything contained in the data file if configured as a POP3 account but would take care if it is configured as an IMAP account and there are issues with the OST file associated with the account. If it's an IMAP account and Outlook creates a new OST file for any reason then the email folders would be sync'd with the server so nothing would be lost however, if there are folders with the words "This Computer Only" in the folder description (i.e. contact/calendar) then those should be backed up (exported) to a PST file as a precaution before doing the repair.

    <title>Multi Factor Authentication with ADFS and Certificates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mario i  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multi Factor Authentication with ADFS and Certificates</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are currently using ADFS to authentication our users in Office 365 and dirsync.</p>
<p>As a second Level of security we would like to add MFA on our on premise ADFS Server with "Certificates".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Goal is the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Enable MFA via ADFS only for users who are connecting via our ADFS Proxy.(External ADFS Entry Point)</li><li>Do not use MFA if the Authentication requests are coming from Clients inside our Network.(internal ADFS entry Point)</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We have Modern Authentication enable so it should not cause any issues for our users which are using OWA or OUtlook but:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>How is MFA with Certificates and ADFS working for example for Exchange Online MAilboxes when you have a System accessing a Mailbox?</li><li>We have some applications running which are connecting to a Mailbox we call them "System Mailbox".</li><li>How is MFA behaving for Mobile Phones? We are using the OUtlook APP but i guess this will also not work because certificate is not installed on Mobile Phones?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>What is the difference between running ADFS MFA internally or Using MFA with Azure? Just that with Azure you can use sms,email etc as second authentication method?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume if we are implementing ADFS MFA we Need to have an Option to "exclude" some identities for MFA like System mailboxes, generic account etc, where no individual is behind and "active authentication" is used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            <p>Hi Mario,<br />
<br />
It all depends on your requirement. If you want the second authentication to processed on your on-premises, you can
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn758113%28v=ws.11%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Configure Additional Authentication Methods for ADFS</a>. To use certificate authentication as the second authentication, you need an on-premises ADFS server.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to more authentication features on Azure, you can use Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (included in Azure AD Premium). The supported authentication features in Azure MFA can be found here: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/multi-factor-authentication-how-it-works/#feature-comparison-of-versions.
 If you have on-premises applications that needs Azure MFA, you need to install the Azure MFA server.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<h2>            Away from office, can&#39;t start Outlook, PST file inaccessible</h2>
                    <p>This is driving me nuts.&nbsp; I'm suppose to be spending this sunny long weekend closing out a project, but instead, I'm bleeding away the afternoon on what seems to be a architectural feature of Outlook.&nbsp; I have a material in a PST file that I'm trying to access,
 but Outlook is not starting because a number of other PST files on network drives and the exchange server account that it *was* accessing are not available away from the office:</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 30px"><br />
Cannot start Microsoft Outlook.&nbsp; Cannot open the the Outlook window.&nbsp; The set of folders cannot be opened.&nbsp; The information store could not be opened.</p>
<p><br />
Opting to work offline doesn't help.&nbsp; Rebooting doesn't help.&nbsp; Opening in safe mode doesn't help.</p>
<p><br />
I tried creating a 2nd profile without specifying a server account, but when selecting that profile upon starting Outlook, it insists on obtaining a server account specification.&nbsp; I also tried modifying the original profile by removing the PST files that it
 was connected to, but I still get the same error message, even when specifying that I will work offline.&nbsp; Please tell me that the architects didn't decide to hold Outlook hostage by tethering it to its prior set up.</p>
<p><br />
Is there any other way to get at my local PST file?&nbsp; This is not a personal machine, and users do not have access to the registry.</p>

            <p>I ran the repair tool repeatedly until there were no more errors.&nbsp; I still get the same errors.&nbsp; I'm really not so sure that Outlook is complaining about corrupt PSTs.&nbsp; If I had to bet on it, I would say that it is balking at not connecting to a server.&nbsp;
 It might also be balking at the unavailable PST files, even though I mentioned that I modified to profile to remove those file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm so disappointed at this obvious pathology in the design.&nbsp; It's a reality that people work away from the office, and we implicity place a lot of reliance on Outlook by maintaining critical information in PST files.&nbsp; This experience simply says that it
 is foolish to do so.&nbsp; Unfortunately, there is not much option.</p>

<p>
</p><p>So aside from the fact the PST files are not supported on network drives which can cause PST file corruption (in this case - seriously doubt that this has anything to with it) - your primary issue is authorization to connect to your servers from the machine
 that you're using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have the PST file on the hard drive, create a&nbsp;new Outlook profile that doesn't require connecting to your servers and&nbsp;just open the PST file. It the PST file is not on your local machine and you can't connect to the network location to simply copy
 it over - then you're pretty much out of luck but that has absolutely nothing to do with Outlook.</p>

            <p>You're right, the issue with nonsupport of PST files on network drives is unrelated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure I follow your description of lack of authority to connect to a server.&nbsp; Off-site,t here simply is no conduit to connect to the servers.&nbsp; As I mentioned in my original post, it is a local PST file that is of interest, and I tried creating a profile
 without specifying a server, but am still prompted for one when I start Outlook with that profile.&nbsp; I don't provide one, but I still get the error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To me, it seems to be entirely due to Outlook.&nbsp; At first, I thought it was the very design that was flawed because of the necessity to have a server account.&nbsp; (Yes, it's a matter of perspective, I realize, but other email clients don't require this, and
 it seems to be a design feature asking for trouble).&nbsp; But then I ran across the idea of creating a different profile from web searching, but it seems to be running up against the need to supply a server.</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Operative words in your description are "<strong>with that profile</strong>" and which means one of two things in reference to&nbsp;the suggestion of "<strong>create a&nbsp;new Outlook profile
</strong>that doesn't require connecting to your servers and&nbsp;just open the PST file"</p>
<p>
</p><p>#1 - You copied a profile when creating a new one which means that the email account is still associated with it as opposed to creating a new profile from scratch which would have prompted you to add an email account. If you're adding a &lt;NEW&gt; profile and&nbsp;don't
 want to add an email account then click &lt;cancel&gt; on the first screen at which point you'll be presented with the following screen:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/76029ef7-22e4-4779-b09c-f56b232ffefa" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>once the profile is created - simply add the local PST file to it </p>
<p>
</p><p>OR</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2 - You did not set the new profile as the new default for the next time Outlook is opened which means you would still be using the original profile.&nbsp;Outlook doesn't add references to email accounts on its own.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Now that I'm back on site, Outlook seems to launch fine with the original profile.&nbsp; The new profile still requires a server specification, according to the prompt. So the problem seems to be that Outlook is designed to operate only with a server.&nbsp; I find

<p>
</p><p>So just to confirm:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Your new profile has no email account configured - that correct? (your original requirement was just to access the PST file)</p>
<p>2) Any data file added is located on a local drive only - that correct?</p>
<p>3) Based on your description - you're saying that with &lt;yes&gt; answers to the above 2 questions - you're being asked to connect to a server? Which server? (This also presumes that&nbsp;you also have no 3rd party addins installed that can be triggering whatever
 it is you're encountering)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Purely from a logical perspective - how would a generic installation of Outlook for millions of people somehow determine that it needs to access a server -&nbsp;unless by "server" you mean the initial questions Outlook asks about adding an email account as per
 the following 3 screenshots and you didn't complete the process<br />

            <p>I'll respond to each question as best as I can.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Q1: Answer: I *want* the new profile to be not associated with a server account, and I did not specify a server when prompted.</p>
<p>Q2: I didn't even get to the point of adding a data file, but yes, it is a local file that I want to access.</p>
<p>Q3: Good question re. which server is being prompted for.&nbsp; None is what I would want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your&nbsp;images, I think I know where part of the problem lies.&nbsp; I don't get the 1st of the pictures you posted, I only get the error message.&nbsp; So to create a new profile, I launched Mail from the Control Panel.&nbsp; There, I can "Add..." a profile, but
 I don't get the same options as your 2nd &amp; 3rd pictures.&nbsp; I only have the option of "Email Account", "Test Messaging", or "Manually configure server settings".&nbsp; The closest thing that came to not specifying any email acount was to chose the last one and leave
 out the server setting.&nbsp; From that point on, I'm guessing, all was lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I'm finding now is that if I left the default option selected ("Email Account") and press Cancel, only *then* do I get prompted "If you want to create a profile with no email accounts, click OK".&nbsp; That is in fact what I want.&nbsp; If I start Outlook with
 such a new profile I get the 3 screens that you show.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Karl, I have to thank you for showing me that there was actually another pathway in the Outlook configuration process than the only one that seemed to be remotely what I wanted (as obviously non-ideal as it was).&nbsp; However, I would have to say that the special
 combination of "Email&nbsp; Account" and Cancel is requires astounding psychic abilities to divine. In my view, if it is that well hidden, it might as well not exist for the purposes of the person who needs the access immediately.&nbsp; (Now that I know the secret,
 however, I don't want it to disappear.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that this little detail helps the next person who slams up against this design feature and saves them from burning the lantern into the night in order to make up for lost time.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Certainly not going to dispute the "intuitiveness" of the process (or lack thereof). I also got sidetracked with the reference to&nbsp;"servers"&nbsp;based on&nbsp;the initial inclusion of "PST files on a network share" so mistakenly got hung up thinking this involved
 "domain permissions" etc instead of "servers" as it related to email accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the end of the day - suspect that the number of people using Outlook without an email account are few and far between these days relative to the total number of Outlook users - hence making it something that doesn't come up often and "less than obvious"
 to those who do want that functionality.</p>

            <p>It is a mistake to have PSTs on network shares. It is not supported and can lead to PST damage. Plus, you wind up in the situation you are seeing. Outlook is trying to open files on a network that isn't available and it must wait for the network connection
 request to time out. If the default data store is a PST on a network share, there will be no way to use Outlook when it's not on the network.</p>

    <title>Is there a .pptx file size limitation&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> frankvideo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is there a .pptx file size limitation&#63;</h2>
                    I am trying to include eight (8) movies into my .pptx presentation. They are all Quicktime .mov files and vary in size from 582MB to 2.85GB. As I add these movies one at a time (by doing a Movie insertion) and do a Save, it appears that when I reach a
 .pptx file size greater than 2.8GB that I encounter a problem. Here's the sequence of steps that I do:
<div>1. I inserted a new movie of 1.9B file size - this works and the movie played just fine</div>
<div>2. I performed a Save of the presentation - this works and the .pptx file size is shown at 4.7GB</div>
<div>3. I performed a Save As of the presentation with a new file name - this doesn't work.&nbsp;I get a message that says "PowerPoint found an error that it can't correct. You should save presentation, quit, and then restart PowerPoint"</div>
<div>4. I clicked "OK" (the only choice)</div>
<div>5. I closed the presentation and Quit PowerPoint application</div>
<div>6. I double-clicked the saved presentation of step 2 above - this doesn't work. I get a message "PowerPoint found a problem with content in the file Family History Video Presentation.pptx. PowerPoint can attempt to repair the file. If you trust the source
 of this file, click Repair."</div>
<div>7. If I select Repair, the resulting presentation has all my slides wiped-out.</div>
<div>8. If I select Cancel, I get a message "PowerPoint cannot open the file /Users/frank/Desktop/Family History Video Presentation.pptx. The file may be damaged, or it may have been created in a pre-release version of PowerPoint."</div>
<div>9. I clicked "OK" (the only choice)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried an experiment and instead of inserting a new movie of 1.9GB, I used a 500MB movie.</div>
<div>1. The movie inserted and played correctly.</div>
<div>2. I performed a Save of the presentation - this works, but the&nbsp;file size had not changed from 2.8 GB. Thought it should have at least been 3.3GB.</div>
<div>3. I inserted another 500MB movie, and it played correctly.</div>
<div>4. I performed a Save of the presentation - this works, but the file size had&nbsp;still not changed from 2.8GB. Thought it should have now been at least 3.8GB.</div>
<div>This may be a clue that there is a file size limit, and it's 3GB?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So there you have it, when I have a .pptx file size that is over 4GB (maybe it's 3GB) everything goes bonkers. Any idea what the problem could be?</div>

            It sounds like you made a hyperlink to the movie file.<br />
<br />
Try this instead:<br />
<br />
On the Home tab of the Ribbon, on the Insert group of buttons click the Media button.<br />
Choose Movie from File from the pop-up menu<br />
In the Choose a Movie dialog click the Link to File button (lower-left corner of the dialog)<br />
Then choose the movie file you want to play<br />
<br />
You can apply the Start animation to the movie and choose the normal Start Timing options (on click, with previous, after previous).<br />

<p>This will happen if you leave copies of messages on the server and create a new mail profile.&nbsp; Did you?</p>
<p>You have a couple of choices.&nbsp; One is to log into your Comcast mailbox using Comcast's web interface, create a new server-side folder, and move the old messages to that folder.&nbsp; If they're not in Inbox, Outlook can't see them and won't download them again.&nbsp;
 Another option is to allow Outlook to download them again, then get a duplicate remover program and have it delete the duplicates.&nbsp; Some can be found here:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.slipstick.com/addins/mail_duplicates.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.slipstick.com/addins/mail_duplicates.asp</a>.&nbsp;

            I contacted my system admin and the steps above nor his suggestion to uninstall and reinstall office 2016 were successful. However, I decided to reboot my wifi and my Skype is finally working now...

<h2>            Search BROKEN in Outlook after 2016 upgrade - How to fix&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used my 365 subscription for almost 2 years with relative few problems - great productivity tool!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, I upgraded to 2016 and suddenly Outlook Search no longer functions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Spent about 30 hours going over every forum discussion and trying to apply half baked remedies... can't find anyone who knows how to solve this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surely there's a solution out there? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is everyone on 2016 SOL? &nbsp;I've not found a post where anyone has indicated that Search works at all in 2016 Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hoping MS will provide a solution for this...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or, provide a means to uninstall... and re-install the previous version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,<br />
Stephen</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>more details:</p>
<p>University 365</p>
<p>Windows 7 64 bit Home Premium</p>
<p>In Outlook select a folder to search (one that previously worked fine for search). &nbsp;Enter a name, such as "John" - returns no results.... even though every email in the folder has John multiple times in the email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have tried perhaps as many as 100 links to articles that MS Support posted as response to previous people asking similar questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS Support - please don't post links that are not relevant. &nbsp;Please post answer here - none of the existing posts have a solution - I've checked them all already. &nbsp;Thank you for not wasting my time, your time, and the time of 1000s of others who may read
 this post... by posting links that won't help.</p>

            <p>thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately it did not resolve the situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to restore my entire system from a previous backup and get back to a working version of Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seemed the next step would be to stop the automatic upgrade to 2016. &nbsp;The Updates does not have a clear way to turn off major upgrades verses regular security and bug fix updates...</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I contacted MS Support who asked to log into my computer remotely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It took 2 hours... they uninstalled my 2013 version then, upgraded me back to 2016 then uninstalled that, then installed 2013 retail version....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll wait until the Search problem is fixed before going to 2016 again.</p>

            <p>Our company is having the same problem too.</p>
<p>This is really a shame on Microsoft.Instant search is an important feature to corporate and they got this wrong.<br />
Previously in Outlook 2013, they got the Calendar To-Do bar wrong. It could only see 1 day in advance for appointments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every outlook upgrade is always fill with surprises with getting all the wrong things on the most common features.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, we have to uninstall 2016 and reinstall 2013.</p>

            <p>After a Windows 10 and Office 2016 upgrade, I have the same problem (as Peacesong) in Outlook. On searching for something that I know is there, I get a screen which has 'place-holders' for the View that I have chosen, but no data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After creating a new View, the problem remains, so (I guess) it's about the indexing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have over 2,000 contacts (People) and this is a real nuisance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done the Outlook File&gt;Options&gt;Search&gt;Indexing Options (which shows <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
two "Microsoft Outlook" entries </span>... is that normal?) I've 'excluded' the indexes (you can do this... and immediately restore them) and the search (as expected) fails. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I cancel the search I get the normal display. My data is there, but the search display results functionality is not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help ... anyone?</p>

            <p>I'm still battling with this problem. Since excluding one index and re-indexing everything the behaviour of the bug has changed (which may give a clue as to its cause) ... but it still isn't working.</p>

            here is what I just found at groovypost and used and it does work for me:<br />
<p style="color: rgba(85, 85, 85, 1)">
I definitely found a fix for this, (I have Win10 and Outlook 2016.) I opened Outlook 2016, clicked on Files, clicked on Options, clicked on Search, clicked on Indexing Options. I clicked on Advanced and unchecked Outlook, then I clicked on Modify, went to Files
 tab, unchecked pst file type. And WOW….it instantly started to work when I did a search in Outlook emails, contacts and calendar.<br />
Basically Indexing in Windows doesn’t work in Outlook 2016 with Win10. The response with my method is just as fast as it used to be with Indexing.</p>

            <p>Still struggling ... what I'm getting now (whether on not .pst files are included in the indexing) is a search that seems to find the right number of instances ... and then starts adding 'empty' records in front of the correct ones. Eventually the page fills
 with 'hits' and appears blank.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS please help ... this is a problem that is causing people to revert to earlier versions of Outlook.</p>

    <title>Mail merge&#47;tent cards with lots of graphics - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> meredithschizer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mail merge&#47;tent cards with lots of graphics</h2>
                    <p>I'm making tent cards (place cards) for an event using Avery Tent Cards 5302.</p>
<p>The design I have is a background over the entire card and a white rectangle over it with the names inside the rectangle, but I'm having trouble getting the mail merge to work properly with this design. If I lay out all the graphic elements first
 and then start the mail merge process, it deletes all the graphics. But if I start the mail merge from a blank document and then add the graphics, it only populated one tent card per page (the first one/top left) and left the others blank.</p>
<p>In addition, as I was trying to put the art in place, it wouldn't "let" me place the art boxes exactly where I wanted them and I had trouble getting the dialog boxes up to allow me to move the backgrounds into place. So if you can help me figure
 out how to find the dialog box which will allow me to move picture boxes and indicate how text wraps, that would be very helpful. It seems like luck of the draw whether I can get that to show up! Very frustrating!!!</p>

<em>and</em>&nbsp;I can't figure out how to get it to prompt for a new password.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is Skype for Business, not plain vanilla Skype, which seems to be the only app discussed on the dozens of Google hits, and nothing on those matches what I see -- there's no place to "sign out" (only Exit) and I've told it to delete my sign-in info but
 it dosen't seem to do that. Help?</p>

                    <p>The basic emoticons :) :( etc. no longer translate in Outlook, Word etc. I followed instructions on line to replace in AutoCorrect but it will not allow me tor replace the existing entry. (When I enter the short cut in the app it always returns a Box. When
 I select the icon to copy into AutoCorrect, the replace column in AutoCorrect is expanded and won't let me type of copy into it.)</p>

<p>Hi Dave,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It could be that a component in Office is outdated or may have been corrupted or damaged, or that the format is incorrectly configured within the apps, etc. For us to isolate the issue in using emoticons in Office, kindly respond to the questions below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Which version of Office are you using?</li><li>Have you checked if Office is updated?</li><li>Did the issue occur recently? If possible, when did it exactly start?</li><li>Before replacing the text in AutoCorrect, have you made any changes in Office or to your device prior to the issue?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>

            Are they using the same characters to type the emoticon, like this :) or like this :-)? Outlook may not recognized the characters or the emoticon if they were typed or entered differently.

    <title>Outlook 2016 AND 2013 crashes PST file upon closing out and reopening - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brentgrab  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 AND 2013 crashes PST file upon closing out and reopening program</h2>
                    <p>I've had enough of this. I believe the madness happened within 2 weeks after doing the free upgrade from Windows 8.1 Pro to Windows 10 Pro. Everything worked fine for over a year with Office 2013 and then when I upgraded to Windows 10 my PST file would constantly
 break upon closing out of Outlook and restarting it. I use Google Apps Sync Tool to sync my calendar, contacts and mail. It worked flawlessly until Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then paid to get Outlook 2016 365 Home thinking maybe Outlook 2013 was not compatible with Windows 10, but the same BS happened. When then Google Apps sync too begins syncing the account it takes HOURS. Granted it is about 26 GB of info, but still in the
 past it would take 6 hours or so, not it takes 36+ hours (if it even makes it to sync completely before crashing - not responding and then crashes and then says PST file is broken, I can successfully repair it but then it won't open after that). So I repeated
 the cycle of uninstalling Office 2016 three different times, as well as trying Office 2013 again, and no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even wiped my damn computer clean and that didn't resolve anything. It's definitely a MICROSOFT issue. I spent over 15 hours on phone and email with Google troubleshooting and they tried everything and came to conclusion there is something buggy with Windows
 or Office 365 or the combination of the two working with GASMO (Google Apps Sync &amp; Migration Tool). What's ridiculous is that it worked flawlessly up until Windows 10 updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've deleted, created and recreated mail profiles for Outlook about 14 times this week. They all start syncing and usually crash before it finishes syncing and every time it crashes upon closing out of Outlook and restarting the program, no matter if it
 was finished syncing or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another issue is when changing mailbox sync size from 1GB to 4GB to Unlimited, it seems to crash immediately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I beyond pissed right now and Microsoft tech support has been absolutely USELESS via phone and chat. They are clueless at their jobs. I thought actual users might be more helpful with a solution. I would just go sell my Dell Latitude and use the MacBook
 Air instead, however Microsoft/Google does not allow you to sync anything more than CONTACTS in Office 2016 for Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I HATE Microsoft and would be thrown off my chair if someone actually helped me for once. So far it's been one frustration and waste of hours of my life after another attempting to communicate with the bot/scripted/useless/incompetent Microsoft techs.</p>

<p>Realizing your upset, let me state something preemptively to avoid a common response I get to replies in cases like this which is</p>
<p>
</p><p>"What follows in this post is not a defense of MS but some facts and plausible explanations". First fact is that I don't know the cause of the problem and not going to try and provide a possible explanation but reality also is that at this point, there is
 no concrete evidence that Outlook or Win10 is the issue. The "symptom" is that you are encountering the problem after upgrading to W10 but the "cause" is unknown. (I also don't work for or speak on behalf of MS). That said,</p>
<p>
</p><p>#1 - The question asked by &lt;Vardhaman Shetti&gt; was in reference to the build number which would something similar to 16.0.6568.2036 (hence the reason that "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">going to FILE&gt;Office Account
 and check under Office Update" was included in the question)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>#2 - MAPI is the protocol used by GASMO - something that is controlled by GASMO and not Outlook</p>
<p>
</p><p>#3 - <strong>Outlook plays no role in any sync process governed by &lt;any&gt; 3rd party sync process</strong> - that's something
<strong>totally under the control of the 3rd party addin which utilizes Outlook data</strong>. From your description, there is a problem being encountered during the GASMO sync causing your PST file to get corrupted and if it's happening every time GASMO runs
 so it's up to Google to figure out why it's failing or determine if this is something unique to your particular machine as opposed to an issue with the combination W10/OL/GASMO. First thing to check is to see if things run properly on another machine (if Google
 says they're not getting similar reports from other customers). So with that said,</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) Is it an exclusive Win10 issue or is it a GASMO issue running on W10? Is it related to the size of the PST file in additiion to something on W10? (there are countless questions like that can be asked) but that's something only Google and MS can
 hash out. Not the first time that Google has said there was a problem with Outlook or they didn't support something until they figured out how to update their software. If it's something in Win10 that's faulty, still up to them to work with MS to isolate and
 resolve the failure points. It can just as easily be something that needs to change in their sync software to conform with W10 and provide customers with an update. It's a pretty safe bet that the first line of Google tech support are not the ones writing
 the code or investigating possible code issues so if this is something new, they may not even be aware that a problem exists on their end</p>
<p>
</p><p>b) in cases like this, if you want MS Tech Support, you'll need to open up a support case with them for a more detailed investigation and quite possibly remote into your machine but keep something in mind, based on your description, Outlook only
 encounters a problem when GASMO runs at which point the data file gets corrupted. This is a community based peer-to-peer support forum - not MS Tech Support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a large number of people who seem to think that any problem encountered using 3rd party programs, it suddenly becomes a Microsoft issue to prove that it's not their program that is having the issue which is totally unrealistic on so many
 different levels.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So is this monologue going to resolve your issue or make you feel better? Not in the slightest - just offered as a perspective to consider with one very important thing to keep in mind - it is GASMO that isn't working on your particular machine
 for whatever reason(s), Outlook without GASMO works - MS doesn't sell or support GASMO.</p>

            The crash does NOT happen only during syncing. As I explained, the items can all be synced up fine and then as soon as I close out of Outlook and attempt to reopen it, it crashes. Microsoft has buggy software and no one wants to be accountable for it and
 help me resolve this. All the Indians in the chat and phone support for Microsoft are pretty much useless. I find more help from Googling the answer every time. Well this one I cannot find.&nbsp;

            It is NOT a POP Account. It is indeed MAPI. It has worked flawlessly for years with Windows 7, Windows 8.1, and now Windows 10 it does not work properly.

</p><blockquote>As I explained, the items can all be synced up fine and then as soon as I close out of Outlook and attempt to reopen it, it crashes.&nbsp;</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>With absolutely no desire to belabor this - while it "may" an Outlook or W10 issue, it equally cannot be said that it is NOT a GASMO issue. GASMO is a 3rd party product running inside of Outlook which accesses the PST file associated with the account and
 if it is not behaving properly (which may not in any way be visible to you) - anything can occur. It can also be a conflict with another addin your have installed or it may be ..................................(any number of things). Or it may be an MS issue
 and if it is - it would still be incumbant on Google to deal with MS OR as I've said before, you need to open an MS Support ticket so they can access your system and investigate it - really hard to fix something that can't be replicated at will.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That fact that you can't find anything on the issue is also a red flag by itself. Either hardly anyone is using GASMO on a Win10 system OR there is something going on that's unique to your system. Find it really interesting how so many people believe and
 accept that everything is "automatically" an MS issue simply because the vendor can't determine the cause of the problem. And FWIW - my comments are based on being an ISV in my own right so it's not exactly like trouble-shooting is something that's foreign.
 Quickest way to waste a whole lot of time is a "rush to judgment" as to what the "cause" of any problem is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyhow, will leave it at and not beat this to death any further. There are those who believe that everything is Microsoft's problem no matter what so nothing that I or anyone else say is going to change their minds or make a difference - apparently I didn't
 get the memo that every software vendor who integrates with an MS product must be perfect so any problem just has to be an MS issue (which is also not to downplay that MS has had more than its fair share of high profile problems of late).</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Believe me, I tried that with 3 different "Answer techs, and each one was a complete waste of time. Their 'support' is moving there mouse around randomly om the screen appearing to do work, but
 they do nothing. They then go restart your system so the connection is lost and they can bow out and on to the next support scam. The idiots even have the audacity to give themselves 5 starts rating for the support session as soon as they take control of the
 mouse and then turn off the native chat app and force you into another one. They do not ask permission for rebooting your device. They do not allow you to type instructions in the box to ask them to stop acting haphazardly. It's the most amateur/unprofessional
 support I've ever encountered.</span></p>

            <p>I get similar results. It claims that I do not have DirectX 12 and USB 3.0. I definitely have USB 3.0 and my graphics adapter is listed by Nvidia as a Supported GPU for&nbsp;the DirectX 12 API&nbsp;and DxDiag also shows Direct3D DDI Version&nbsp;12.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They must be detecting some specific missing feature, or their detection is simply inaccurate at this point.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to properly isolate this case, we would like to know if the Windows Holographic app has previously detected the USB 3 ports. If so, did the issue only appear after installing Windows Insider Preview 14986?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your Device Manager, try checking the Universal Serial Bus Controller and see if the USB host controller is displayed. If it is, try updating its drivers. Follow this

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>By default, you should be able to use cut, insert and delete options when you right click on any cell in Excel. To better assist you, we'd like to ask the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Which Office version are you using?</li><li>Is the first time you encountered the issue?</li><li>Have you made changes on your device prior to issue? </li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, if the options that you need are grayed out and you see this picture below, we suggest that you click
<strong>Enable Editing </strong>and check if it gives you commands that you need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance.</p>

<p>In this case, we suggest that you open Excel in safe mode to isolate if an add-in or any extension is causing the issue. To do this, follow the steps below:
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Find the shortcut icon for your Office application.</li><li>Press and hold the <strong>CTRL</strong> key and double-click the application shortcut.</li><li>Click <strong>Yes</strong> when a window appears asking if you want to start the application in Safe Mode.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue doesn't persist in safe mode, it's possible that an add-in may be causing the issue. Let's try to manually remove the add-ins that may be causing the issue by following the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>With the Office app still in Safe Mode, click <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>
Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Add-Ins</strong>.</li><li>Check the <strong>Manage</strong> list for Add-ins options, such as Word Add-ins or Excel Add-ins, and then click
<strong>Go</strong>. If you can't find an Add-ins option specific to the Office app in the
<strong>Manage</strong> list, choose <strong>COM Add-ins</strong> instead.</li><li>Uncheck one of the add-ins in the list and click <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Restart the application (not in Safe Mode this time).</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persist, we suggest that you repair Excel as this resolves issues as such. See
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Repair an Office Application</a></strong> for steps to repair your office application.</p>

    <title>Composite Key with fields in two tables&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> garth033  say:</h3>
<h2>            Composite Key with fields in two tables&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've found myself in a bit of a confusing state... I have the following relation setup:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/06c3d980-9d35-4c27-a3dc-6da90d8137ab?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/06c3d980-9d35-4c27-a3dc-6da90d8137ab?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a setup I've only been recently shown (by someone here on this form) and cant quite wrap my head around how to apply an integrity rule to this table (if at all possible in just the DB structure).</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I want to do is ensure that any given parent does not have children with the same name. Ideally I would create a composite key using Parent_ID and LineItem_Name, thus adhering to my desired rule. But seeing as the needed columns are in separate tables
 (and I only want to enforce this rule on the sub-type anyway) I cannot wrap my head around doing this in the database itself... can this be done? or do I need to rearrange my structure?&nbsp;</p>
                </div>

<p>You can't enforce RI in this way: a composite key refers to fields in one record, not to the same field in two different records. I'd suggest enforcing this data rule using the BEFORE_UPDATE event of whatever form is used to enter the names.</p>

            Assuming that LineItem_Name is a candidate key of Line_Items then I think you just need a table-level ValidationRule in WBS_LineItems of:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [LineItem_ID] &lt;&gt; [Parent_ID]<br />
<br />
i.e. no row can reference itself.

<p>That is a rule I will have to abide by as well, but it is not quite what I am talking about here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I want is to restrict sibling names to be unique in that generation for a specific parent. I.E. a child's direct sibling needs a unique name from each direct sibling.</p>

            Perhaps I'm missing something, but still assuming that LineItem_Name is a candidate key of Line_Items, and consequently a determinant of both LineItem_ID and Parent_ID,&nbsp; I cannot see how that constraint could be violated in the current model.&nbsp; Can you
 provide some sample rows from WBS_LineItems which would violate the constraint?

<p>Mayhaps it is I that does not understand what you are saying....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you please define Candidate Key for me? Is it similar to a Composite Key in nature?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as my understanding of my setup goes there is nothing stopping LineItems from having duplicate names (And this needs to be supported as there are many duplicated names at varying generations). But, I do not want Siblings of the same parent to share
 a Name...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Concrete example from a temp table creating the generations of WBS_LineItems:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8eee3b25-0c2b-4e9b-9b02-9b4b59e640fb?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8eee3b25-0c2b-4e9b-9b02-9b4b59e640fb?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>As you can see, the Names "Data" and "Training" are repeated at separate generations. I want to restrict these names from repeating within the same generation under the same parent.</p>

            A candidate key is a column or non-trivial combination of columns whose values must be distinct in a table.&nbsp; Consequently LineItem_Name (never use Name as a column name – it is a reserved keyword!) is not a candidate key.&nbsp; I think you should be able to
 enforce the constraint as a CHECK CONSTRAINT, however.&nbsp; In essence a CHECK CONSTRAINT is an SQL statement which must always evaluate to TRUE.&nbsp; It can consequently encompass a number of related tables.&nbsp; It is implemented as an ALTER TABLE statement, but unlike
 a normal ALTER TABLE statement to amend a table definition, in Access this cannot be done in SQL view, so has to be done in code, usually in the Immediate window.&nbsp; The same is true to DROP a CONSTRAINT.<br />
<br />
I would really need some data from both tables with which to test the constraint before I can give you the necessary code.&nbsp; I have a rough idea in my head what form the SQL statement will take, but will need to test it.&nbsp; You can supply the data, which does
 not have to be extensive, merely representative, in one of two ways:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; You can post rows from each table here as comma or tab delimited text, with the column names as the first line, terminating each line with a carriage return, which can be copied and imported into a table.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; You can post an Access file to a site such as Microsoft's OneDrive and post a link to it in a reply here, so that it can be downloaded.<br />
<br />
I can't promise you a quick reply due to the current constraints on my time due to the daily medical treatment I'm receiving, but I'll attend to it as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
BTW, on the basis of your screenshot, WBS_Num does appear to be a candidate key.&nbsp; If so it must be indexed uniquely (no duplicates) to designate it as such.<br />

            I think this is what you need:<br />
<br />
CurrentProject.Connection.Execute "ALTER TABLE WBS_LineItems ADD CONSTRAINT DistinctSiblings CHECK((SELECT LineItems.LineItem_Name FROM (LineItems INNER JOIN WBS_LineItems ON LineItems.LineItem_ID = WBS_LineItems.LineItem_ID) INNER JOIN LineItems AS LineItems_1
 ON WBS_LineItems.Parent_ID = LineItems_1.LineItem_ID GROUP BY LineItems.LineItem_Name, LineItems_1.LineItem_Name HAVING COUNT(*) &gt;1) IS NULL)"<br />
<br />
Execute the code as a single line either in the Immediate window or in a temporary procedure in a standard module.&nbsp; If you ever need to drop the constraint execute the following:<br />
<br />
CurrentProject.Connection.Execute "ALTER TABLE WBS_LineItems DROP CONSTRAINT DistinctSiblings"<br />
<br />
You can of course name the constraint whatever you wish rather than 'DistinctSiblings'<br />
<br />

            Any CHECK CONSTRAINTS applied to a table are listed by name as properties of the table in the built in Table Documenter.&nbsp; Their DDL statements are not, however.<br />
<br />
I include the DDL statements for both the creation and dropping of the constraints in Long Text (aka Memo) columns in a table in the database, which also includes columns for the table name and a description of the purpose of the constraint.&nbsp; A report based
 on this table is included in the database's written documentation. <br />

<h2>            Emails not being shown in inbox.</h2>
                    Hi, I have a problem that is troubling me. My emails happen to be not showing up in my inbox but instead in another folder which has my email account name on it. How can I change this to having all my emails being shown in my inbox, thank you.

            <p>You set up a new email account and had it default to a new mail folder. If you want to delete this folder and have your new email account mail deposited in your regular INBOX then,click on the cog at the upper right corner&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a9d7711c-9e96-4c89-9a2f-63272e5df390" />.
 From the dropdown list, select <strong>More email settings</strong>. In the "Managing Account" list, click on
<strong>Your email accounts</strong>. In the "Accounts you've added" box, click <strong>
Details </strong>and then<strong> Edit.&nbsp;</strong>Don't change any settings if you don't have to, but at the bottom of the page hit
<strong>SAVE.&nbsp;</strong>You will see 2 options, one to save your emails to a new folder, or one to save to an existing folder. Select the "existing folder" radio button. Click on the down arrow at the end of the "existing folder" and select Inbox. Then,
<strong>Save</strong>. This may take up to 30 seconds to save.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can then go back to your "Inbox" and right-click on the folder you don't want your emails going to and "Delete" it.</p>

    <title>is there a way to sync outlook 2010 contacts and calendar on two - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nutmix  say:</h3>
<h2>            is there a way to sync outlook 2010 contacts and calendar on two computers without going through a gmail account&#63;</h2>
                    <p>In the old days life was simple, I had a desktop and notebook, each with outlook, and a windows 6 phone and active sync. I used to sync the phone with one computer, then sync with the other, and my two computers and phone had the same contacts and calendars.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I switch to android phone, it became impossible to sync my contacts and calendars between desktop and laptop, until I found gocontactsyncmod and googlecalendarsync, and using a gmail account as a middleman.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now google is stopping support for this, so will soon be stuck. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using outlook for 10 years or so, in this time Microsoft MUST have come up with a non hacky way free to sync contacts and calendars on two machines?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read probably 50 articles on how to do this, most of which are complicated, not recommended, or involve spending £30+ on a utility which does 10x more than I need.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>On outlook, i have 5 IMAP email accounts, all gmail. I have a hotmail account, but this has no support for outlook, so I just forward my hotmail messages to a gmail account, which does have IMAP, and get them into outlook this way (but cant reply from it).
 I tried using an outlook.com account, but this also doesn't support IMAP. I tried the outlook.com connector plugin for outlook, but from the day this was installed, indexing stopped stopped finding new mails, and there was no fix except to uninstall the connector
 (which instantly fixed the issue) I also have a work exchange account setup on both computers, so this syncs my work calendar (not my local private exchange one) to my two outlook computers (not managed to get it to sync with my android phone though).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So am I still left with the only option to go through gmail, and purchase some 3rd party app? Or has MS come up with a free way to sync outlook between your laptop and desktop, i.e. without having to purchase an exchange account, or go through the pain of
 trying to manually copy pst export files using dropbox or similar? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for any advice, and apologies for posting yet another plea on this topic.</p>

            <p>What do you mean by Hotmail has no Outlook support?</p>
<p>outlook.com is the new name for Hotmail and requires use of the Hotmail Connector in Outlook 2010</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS provides no sync tools, as you have found only third party paid for utilities are available</p>
