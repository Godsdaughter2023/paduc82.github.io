    <title>Windows update group policy not applying to Windows 8 workstations - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> snoboy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows update group policy not applying to Windows 8 workstations</h2>
                    <p>The GP settings for Windows Update configuration on my domain don't ever apply to Windows 8 workstations in the domain. Opening GP Edit on an on a Windows 8 administrative workstation shows the policies that I want to see on Windows 8, but when I open a
 local GP Edit on the same Windows 8 workstation, the settings aren't applied. I have tried forcing gpupdate and get no error related to it, yet it never applies. Correct me if I am wrong, but the WindowsUpdate.admx file on the workstation should be referenced
 while using the GP editor from that workstation, so it doen't appear to be a problem with the admx file being used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The settings are all in Computer Configuration, Administrative Templates, Windows Components, Windows Update. They are appearing on Windows 7 workstations. I have my WSUS server set there, etc., but the workstations are not getting the updates from WSUS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What do I neded to do to get the Windows 8 settings to work as expected?</p>

<p>creio não ser renovação pois a renovação automática só ocorre quando a Live Gold expira. Pelo valor pago ele assinou de 1 ano, ou seja, uma nova cobrança somente 1 ano depois e não 1 mes depois como ele citou. Creio que foi erro!!! A Live ta meio bugada,
 vai saber.</p>

<h2>            Error Code 80242007 installing Update KB2748583</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I am looking for some help. My Surface RT wants to install "Update for Microsoft Office Home &amp; Student 2013 RT Preview (KB2748583)." But when it tries the Surface just hangs up and sits on the "Installing update 1 of 1" perpetually.&nbsp; The Error code
 is 80242077. Not sure what to do with it.</p>
<p>I have in the past few months restored the Surface due to other performance issues so I'd rather not do a system restore again if I don't have to. Any thoughts?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<h3> nurbles  say:</h3>
<h2>            Intellipoint 7.0 on Win7 x64 - Wheel button reassignment not working</h2>
                    
<p>I just installed Windows 7 Pro x64 on a brand new drive on a machine that has been running Vista x64 for the past year or so. &nbsp;The Intellipoint 6.31 x64 I downloaded for Vista worked great -- my reassignment of the wheel button to double-click worked perfectly.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, while everything else seems to be working great, the wheel button reassignment isn't working (I've tried several different settings to verify). I'm posting a question here because Microsoft doesn't appear to have any way for customers to report
 bugs, other than these forums. &nbsp;Hopefully, someone here can help.</p>
<p>The Intellipoint file I downloaded and installed today was named IPx64_1033_7.00.260.0.exe. &nbsp;System Information shows this about my system:</p>

            For anyone who stumbles over this thread...
<div><br />
<div>I realized that my Intellimouse Optical was connected to my system using the USB-to-PS/2 adapter and tried connecting it directly into a USB port instead. &nbsp;Now the Intellipoint software is working correctly because it now believes me when I tell it that
 I have an Intellipoint Optical.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Apparently, since the software cannot detect the mouse type (not correctly, at least) when connected via the PS/2 mouse port, it was ignoring my selection of the Intellimouse Optical that I made during software installation and treating the mouse as something
 else.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Not believing (and/or trusting) the user to know what hardware they have attached is a BUG and should be fixed. &nbsp;Sadly, Microsoft is probably more interested in placating the hordes of morans out there that cannot read the name of their mouse
<em>directly off the mouse itself</em>&nbsp;and are relying only on what their software can discover. &nbsp;The question asked during the install is to make the user feel like they contributed, but is otherwise ignored.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Anyway, I suspect that if you just happen to have your mouse connected via the PS/2 port, and it is the specific mouse that Intellipoint guesses when it cannot identify it, then you're lucky. &nbsp;Otherwise, you'll probably have problems like I (and many others
 (if you search the internet)) had with parts of Intellipoint not working correctly because it will either not allow you to specify the correct mouse, or will ignore you when you do.</div>

                    <p>I have few questions to ask:</p>
<p>1. As per the documentation Microsoft.Graph.Communications.Calls.Media SDK&nbsp; can be used to access the live streams coming from any calls or meetings in Microsoft Team. But do we have any documentation for how to use this SDK. I am looking at the available
 samples, but that doesn't help me to understand whats going on.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">2. Next, also it is mentioned that it has to be hosted either in Azure Service or Windows Server. I am asking that what if I host it in my local to debug and test. Do we have any documentation available to perform that.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">We have a use case, to get the live data that is streaming from any call (one to one) or in a meeting, This&nbsp; live stream data is needed to be sent to our servers as soon as we get it. So if there is anything that can be helpful.
 Let me know<br />

            <p>Two points:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. There is no way to upgrade from XP to 10. You would have to do a clean installation of 10, not an upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Even if you do a clean installation, trying to run Windows 10 on an XP-era computer typically has a host of programs:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. The computer may not be compatible with Windows 10, and you would need to upgrade several pieces of hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>b. Even if it's compatible, you may need Windows 10 drivers for some of its hardware, and the needed drivers may not be available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>c. Even if a and b above are not issues, the XP-era performance of the computer may be very poor if you run Windows 10 on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if you want to run Windows 10, it's likely better, and maybe even less expensive, to just buy a new computer that comes with Windows 10.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 crackling sound while playing music and doing ANYTHING that - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tonyb4u2c  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 crackling sound while playing music and doing ANYTHING that chews up the CPU. </h2>
                    
<p>The Problem:</p>
<p>OK, the problem is that when playing ANY audio I experience a crackling sound if ANY operation is performed which requires CPU usage, no matter how small. For example, when using Media Player or MediaMonkey if I so much as scroll through my 10,000 songs
 while playing a song the music begins to crackle terribly and only gets worse if I do something that requires even more juice such as opening a program or even Firefox. Also, when watching videos online, YouTube for example, I get the crackling sound unless
 I maximize the video to full screen. Even if doing nothing while watching the video it will not play clearly without being maximized to full screen.</p>
<p>Fixes already tried:</p>
<p>Of course the first thing I did was uninstall and reinstall the drivers. Then ensure they were most current and Win7 compatible. Then, I tried disabling all processes except those run by Microsoft. Next, I tried disabling the network card. Then, I downloaded
 a latency checker and ran it. It spikes whenever I do ANYTHING that uses the CPU so this basically just confirmed what I already knew which was that it's some sort of issue with memory or CPU usage during audio playback. Finally, I purchased a new Creative
 Live sound card that is Win7 compatible and ditched the on-board Realtek. Still have the exact same problem.</p>
<p>My Specs:</p>
<p>Windows 7 Ultimate 7600 build 32-bit</p>
<p>Creative SoundBlaster Live 24-bit sound card</p>
<p>2GB Ram</p>
<p>Pentium Dual Core 2.2ghz processor</p>
<p>I know my system is not too far above the minimum requirements but everything worked perfect with Vista and it handles everything including fairly major gaming such as WOW and C&amp;C with no problem whatsoever, including sound issues. As I said, there is only
 a problem when listening to audio and trying to do ANYTHING else. Tried everything. Will be eternally grateful for any help!</p>

<p>PROBLEM SOLVED!!!</p>
<p>After months of trying to get this issue resolved I finally figured it out today. I found a YouTube video regarding hardware acceleration that got me to thinking this may not be an audio issue at all; and it wasn't. The problem was that my graphics card
 is not good enough to keep up with the high demands of Win7 Aero. Although the GeForce 7300 LE I use will run the Aero settings and allow me to play current games requiring directx 9 or higher, either the card or my PC (or a combination of the two) does not
 have enough umph to run Aero themes and still provide smooth audio playback while using other functions that require system resources. This also fixed my problems with YouTube and other online videos playing choppy while not in full screen mode! So, thank
 you everyone for the helpful suggestions which finally led me to the right source of my problem!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>

<p>Hi! I just bought Battlefield 4 Limited Edition for my Xbox 360 (Slim 4gb), but when I tried to install it, it said that it needs an Internal HDD to install the HD textures! I didn't knew that it was a mandatory to run this game! And here, we don't have
 any shops which sell official Microsoft HDD for Xbox Slim. I have to order it online and it will take 3-4 days to get delivered! So, can I use a third party HDD for my Xbox 360 Slim? A Hitachi or Seagate's 2.5" Laptop HDD? And, will I be able to play Battlefield
 4 with that? Can I play online and most importantly&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">would I get banned for that?</span> I don't want to flash the Hard drive!&nbsp;Please help me out! It's very urgent!</p>

<p>TIA!</p>

<h2>            Mapping Network Drives Through Command Prompt for Another User</h2>
                    <p>Right now I am trying to set up a batch file which will map network drives for other user accounts. Currently I can only map drives for the logged in account and no others. Is there a way to do this through the command prompt, or will I have to use powershell.
 I would really prefer that it be done through the command prompt as I already have all of the script done except for this part.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>EDIT: After further review I have determined that there is no way possible to do this. It is simply not included in any commands that I could find. If anybody finds it, then great, but if not, the way I did it is as follows:</p>
<p>Check the user credentials against a master list which also has passwords.</p>
<p>Once a match happens, use that username and corresponding password.</p>
<p>Run this upon login using Group Policy Editor.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>You can map drives either with Group Policy or using a startup script (=batch file) that contains one or more of the following commands:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>net use&nbsp; /persistent:no<br />
net&nbsp; use&nbsp; Q: \\ServerName\ShareName&nbsp; /User:David&nbsp; SomePassword</em></p>
<p><em>net&nbsp; use&nbsp; Q: \\ServerName\ShareName&nbsp; /User:David&nbsp; *</em></p>
<p>
Note that embedding passwords in a batch file is a severe security risk which is why the second command is preferable.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problems working with files and folders in Windows can be caused by permissions issues, corrupted user accounts or even corrupted files. These issues often occur after upgrading to another version of Windows, connecting to other computers over a network
 or even just connecting an external hard drive into your computer. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The reasons could be as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The folder ownership may have changed</li><li>You do not have the proper permissions</li><li>The file may be encrypted</li><li>The file may be corrupt</li><li>The user profile may be corrupt </li></ul>
<li>
<p>I would suggest you to refer to the link and follow the methods suggested&nbsp;to try and fix the issue:</p>

 uninstalled game/reinstalled changed my mac address and a few other options. The unique problem with my situation is the cloud saves on all my other games are working, my only problem is with killer instinct. &nbsp;Does anybody have and methods that fixed this

    <title>Can&#39;t Reinstall Windows on Surface Pro 5th Gen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rjhart  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t Reinstall Windows on Surface Pro 5th Gen</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">I have a Surface Pro 5th Gen that I have to fix. Originally, the Surface would not boot into anything other than the recovery menu. From the recovery menu, selecting any recovery options would do nothing except make make the Surface
 reboot into the recovery menu again. The computer did this even when I selected "boot from USB" with a bootable (FAT32) recovery drive plugged in. The only recovery option that worked was to boot into the UEFI settings. From the UEFI settings, I set the Surface
 to only boot from USB devices. That allowed me to boot to my recovery drive, and attempting to reinstall windows worked well until the installation got towards the end and hit me with the following vague message. "Windows could not be installed. No changed
 have been made." I thought that this could have been due to the fact that I had set the UEFI to only allow boot from USB devices, so changed the boot settings back and tried again. Changing the boot settings back did not get me back into my endless loop of
 ending up in the recovery menu, but it did not allow me to reinstall windows. I got the same vague error. I decided to make a (FAT32) Windows install drive and use it instead of a Surface recovery drive, and that also seemed to work until the last minute.
 I got hit with this error message: <strong>Windows could not update the computer’s boot configuration, Installation cannot proceed</strong>. Following the failed installation, the Surface booted into a windows error message saying something about boot files
 being missing. Additionally, the boot lock screen had an image of an unlocked lock at the top of the screen. Not expecting much, I booted to my recovery drive and ran bootrec tools from the command prompt. Then, I tried reinstalling Windows again from my recovery
 drive. No dice. Now the Surface boots to the UEFI menu instead of a windows error message.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">I am trying to figure out what the next steps are. I feel like this has just become a loop. However, I have only tried the 1703 image for recovery; I have yet to try 1709 or 1803. Also, the drive I have been using this entire time
 is a 16GB USB 3 drive. Is it possible that it needs to be USB 2? Anybody have suggestions?<br />

<h2>            Downloading Gears of War 4 Need to pause and Resume to resume downloading</h2>
                    I am currently downloading Gears of War 4 for Windows 10. I'm at 56.61 out of 73.33 GB. It was going good until i paused the download, downloaded Microsoft Mahjong (don't ask) and resumed download on Gears of War 4. When I resumed it was stuck at like
 54 GB and wouldn't continue. The only way I was able to resume it was by pausing the download and resuming it again, but it only continued for like .04 GB then stopped again. Had to keep pausing and resuming to continue the download to actually have the counter
 continue. I don't even know if it works but it's something. I was hoping somebody would have a way so I don't have to re-download it again. Also I tried the wsreset and the windows app troubleshoot, neither worked.

<br />Downloading the ISO file
<br />
<br />An ISO file is a digital or virtual replica of a physical disc. In order to use an ISO you must burn it to a optical disc. In the case of Windows 10, a blank Dual Layer DVD or an empty USB thumb drive. If you are using Windows 7, you can create the .ISO then burn it using the built in Disc Image utility. If you are running Windows XP or Windows Vista, you can using a third party burning tool such as ImgBurn or Roxio/Nero.

<br />
<br />For the purposes of this exercise, we are gonna use the .ISO option. 
<br />
<br />Select ISO file, then click Save, Select your location then click Save. 
<br />
<br />Wait while the .ISO image is created. 
<br />
<br />Create a bootable copy from the ISO:

<h2>            No option&#58; Add a wireless Display, Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have a wireless TV connected on my WiFi network. I can screen cast videos, music, etc to the same device.<br />
IDK since when but after hitting Win + P, in the charm there isn't any option as "Add a wireless Display".<br />
Freshly installed windows 8.1 had the option, but now it isn't. It wasn't there before the upgrade too.<br />
<br />
Configuration:<br />

</p><p>I'm also able to select the options for second screen even if there isn't any second screen attached.<br />
I also searched a lot on internet. No luck found.</p>

<br />
Windows 7, 32 bit, home<br />
Brother printer, PTouch QL-500<br />
Software and driver from brother the most current<br />
Have updated to MSXML 4.0 SP 3<br />
(see http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_programs/msxml-error/d07e4ce0-0880-4a78-9406-3619f22a9a79)<br />
<br />
I understand from prior posts and searches on the net that this is specifically a MS problem. However, the updated MSXML dll's did not fix my problem and I continue to get MSXML errors and not able to save my files.<br />

Has anyone been able to solve this problem?<br />

<p>+1 for me </p>
<p>i have 10 years of live tenure always renewed a month before old one runs out via card purchased in store
</p>
<p>this year decided to get a amazon digi download and it wont accept it </p>
<p>it acknowledges its a 12m code but when i go to redeem it says something went wrong please try again
</p>
<p>i spent an hour trying to get the *** code to work and nothing </p>
<p>spent 2 hours on chat support and his final answer was i have to wait now for my current live to run out before using this code
</p>
<p>gave the code to a friend whos live was due to expire in the next day or so and it worked fine
</p>
<p>the only thing that has changed for me this year is i have managed to delete an old credit card that expired in the 2008 and think that may have been my problem but i am nipping out today to purchase a live code from tesco/asda and see how that goes later

<p>Yeah I am having a similar issue. &nbsp;I tried to renew my gold account yesterday on the xbox one. &nbsp;When I selected confirm purchase it gave me the "something went wrong please try again later" error. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The weird thing was right when I backed back out to the home page menu it was acting as if I had xbox live gold again and everything was working fine so I figured the error was wrong and it actually did confirm purchase.</p>
<p>Problem was hours later when I tried playing online again it was back to me not having a gold account. &nbsp;I then went to check my transaction history and it shows that I bought 12 months of xbox live gold only now its not working. &nbsp;I dunno what the heck is
 going on. &nbsp;Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>It's kind of a relief to see at least I'm not the only one being affected. I was thinking that I received two defective codes from 2 different people who both purchased them at different places, and the odds of that are probably slim to none.</p>

<p>They say you can only have 3 years stacked on your account, my current gold membership will expire in April so adding a year should work fine, I have stacked a couple of years in the past.</p>

<p>I know this is not about Xbox live renewal but I'm having the same problem when redeeming a code for FIFA 15 full game download. It keeps coming up with that exact same message you lot are having. Obviously the code seems fine it just seems to a problem
 on Microsofts side I'm guessing with what's happened recently. I hope it can be sorted ASAP to be honest as it's annoying.

            <p>Hey guys!</p>
<p>There could be various reasons why Xbox Live is not redeeming, sometimes it can be an account issue or a service alert issue. I recommend trying to redeem the codes on both the Xbox One console as well as our <a href="https://account.xbox.compaymentandbilling/RedeemCode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Code Redemption</span></a>&nbsp;page.&nbsp;If the issue persists after trying both, which a few already have mentioned trying both,&nbsp;I recommend contacting<span>&nbsp;our chat or phone support agents through our&nbsp;</span><a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Contact Us</span></a><span>&nbsp;page so they can take a look at those codes! :)</span></p>

<h2>            web pages slow to open or broken - Samsung Series 9 laptop</h2>
                    I have a brand new Samsung 9 Series laptop with Windows 8. &nbsp;Since I first got it, I have had problems with browsing which is slow, times out, pages have to be refreshed constantly, etc. &nbsp;This would appear to be fairly common with Samsung users and I am
 trying to find a resolve. &nbsp;I called Samsung but their only suggestion is to run Recovery which currently isn't an option as I am fairly sure it won't fix it since its been like this since the outset. &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Are there any resolves for this issue? &nbsp;There have been many suggestions on forums but there doesn't appear to be a permanent resolution for this?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please can you assist?</div>
<div><br />
