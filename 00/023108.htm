<h2>            Excel formatting lost in 2003 compatibility mode.</h2>
                    
<p>I recently upgraded from Office 2003 to 2007.&nbsp; I have clients still using 2003.&nbsp; When I produce Excel spreadsheets and save them in 2003 compatibility mode when they are reopened by clients or me the formatting is lost.&nbsp; For a while it worked fine but not
 anymore.&nbsp; Can someone help me figure out what's going on?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

<p><span>The possible reason for this issue is there some formatting in excel 2007 which are not supported by Excel 2003.</span></p>
<p><span>You may open a workbook that was created in an earlier version of Excel and work in Compatibility Mode so that the workbook remains in a file format
 that can easily be opened again in the earlier version.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the link to use Office Excel 2007 with earlier versions of Excel:</span></p>

                    Office 2010 - to get an accent on a vowel I usually press ctrl, alt and the letter.&nbsp; This still works except for the letter E in Outlook and Word - I now get the € sign although this is still also on the number 4 key.&nbsp; Strangely it still works fine in
 Excel and on this forum!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anybody know where it is or how to fix the E??

                    I'm a diehard IE fan but obviously I've had to only use EDGE on my Nokia Lumia 950. It would be nice if the FAVs stayed in sync. Am I asking for too much?<br />
Let me save anyone some time if they might want to give me some difficult, multi-step process where I'd need to take some steps on a regular schedule. I'm not that desperate.

<p>That's bogus. I'm no IT guy but I do know enough about writing computer programs to know that they could easily add something to both IE and EDGE to keep their FAVs in sync. They shouldn't put the burden on us Users and make us do it manually on a regular
 schedule.</p>
<p>The problem is with the EDGE &gt; Import Favs from IE deal is that then your list of FAVs that's in IE doesn't ever get anything new that I add into the FAVs on my phone and I need to remember to always email the site URLs to myself and Open them in IE on my
 Dell at home and Save To Favs in the correct folder.</p>
<p>I'm a Favaholic. You should see my batch. I guess this all happened to me since I grew up in the era before Bing &amp; Google knew the internet "like I&nbsp; know the back of my hand".</p>
<p>Not to mention how by Importing the IE FAVs into EDGE, it just dumps them into their own little folder instead of truly syncing them.</p>

            someone would need to write an app or bot that converts all of the old IE Fav's to Edge Fav's. That would help everyone...…...for those that are cool with using Edge on your laptop/desktop in addition to your mobile windows device. The only other option
 it so convert to mac or google chrome for all your Favs.

<p>Thanks but I'm really just hoping to find a solution to do exactly what I asked about. I wish these newer Windows phones could also use Internet Explorer but it seems as if Microsoft is really trying to put IE in its grave since you have to really dig it
 out from underground if you want to use it on a PC with Windows 10.</p>
<p>I don't like Macs or Google stuff.</p>

    <title>Remove SkyDrive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andrewgg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Remove SkyDrive</h2>
                    <p><span>I am going to pose two questions here, there are endless threads dedicated to these issues and all of them are absolutely circular and none of them contain an answer. My two questions are as follows.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. I want to remove SkyDrive Integration from Windows 8 and also 8.1 I have no use for these security breeching 'services.'</span></p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp;I also want to strip the SkyDrive 'functionality' out of Office 2013.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>My Rationale</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I am a private contractor and I work with a number of clients on security related issues. I have read through almost all of the circular logic and faulty reasoning offered up as 'solutions' to the above two questions on this
 forum and none of them are satisfactory. I want to be clear that what I am seeking is the absolute removal of these functions from the software my computer uses because they are little more than active spyware services.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Before I hear yet another 'use a policy' response, I have to say what if you aren't a company and do not have a domain controller to enforce that policy? What if you happen to be a home user managing sensitive corporate data
 that doesn't belong anywhere but on my encrypted drive? As such I am looking for a straightforward answer so that ordinary users can follow it too.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>How is a normal average Joe expected to know how to apply or generate a security policy for your products? The answer is that Microsoft (which is acting as an extension of the US government) is hoping that users will remain ignorant
 of all other options and go with the default. Synching up to SkyDrive which happily back-ends into the NSA. I want you to understand that by storing data that belongs to a company or may contain the private information of other people on SkyDrive you are in
 fact potentially breeching any data protection law in force in your country. Since you are transferring the data sovereignty from your country of residence to the United States instead of retaining&nbsp;the data&nbsp;on your personal computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I am frankly sick off dealing with issues created by Microsoft because it seems to have forgotten what the 'Personal' in 'Personal Computer' means. My computer is not an extension of Microsoft's network, my file system is not
 Microsoft's personal Web Server my data belongs to no one but me and those whom I am contractually obligated to protect. So is Microsoft even remotely capable of helping me maintain and meet my business requirements?&nbsp;Do I finally have to&nbsp;move to Linux? After
 all I have plenty of Virtual Machines that I have been toying with and I am satisfied not simply with the options Linux offers, but the control that is absent from Microsoft's dodgy products and insecure services.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I await an answer to both questions.</span></p>

            <p>Thank you for the response Anula,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I appreciate you taking the time to look at and reply to my query. Though I thought I had been very clear with respect to SkyDrive and my desire for its removal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I own Office 2013 Professional. But to be quite frank that is almost irrelevant. The question is simply not about disabling where Office saves it's documents to, or disabling it via group policy. I simply don't want any of SkyDrive's features installed on
 my computer period. I want all of its components removed I have no desire for the integrated SkyDrive&nbsp;features to be even present as options within my installation Office 2013. Or anywhere else on my computer for any purpose at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite uninstalling the SkyDrive App/Client from Windows 8 there is still a great deal of integrated linkage between it and the Microsoft products installed on my machine. This is not acceptable.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So let me answer your questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Office 2013 Pro</p>
<p>2. SkyDrive</p>
<p>3. All of it. The whole lot, all the integrated SkyDrive functions the SkyDrive connectivity and any and all associated privacy invading services.</p>

            <p>So ultimately the solution is to migrate to Linux. No problem for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At least I can obtain Linux versions for key security applications I require like PGP Whole Disk Encryption and e-mail integration. I can also obtain a Linux version of VMware for working with secured Virtual Machines. Until Microsoft Learns that it does
 not own the data stored on my computer the only viable option is Linux.</p>

<br />
Done. I am now using Ubuntu 13 and will continue to do so until Microsoft grows up and understands that it does not own my data, or the data of the corporations I am obligated to protect. As I have said before Microsoft needs to re-learn what the word 'Personal'
 in Personal Computer means. 'Personal' does not imply Microsoft's corporate ownership over the contents of any computer.
<br />
<br />
In the interim I will be watching this forum and this thread for answers that actually are solutions, for indications that Microsoft may adopt a more contractor/corporate/enterprise friendly stance. because as of right now I will be pressing my clients to migrate
 their products and I have no shortage of clients.<br />

            You have found the "best" solution.<br />
<br />
You are not the first person to ask for this "fix", but there isn't a good one, or even a good collection of steps to make a process.<br />
<br />
MS has baked skydrive deep into Windows 8 and Office 2013 functionally and marketing wise. Just like they did with IE a while back.<br />
<br />
And just like then, I'm sure that a dedicated hacker (of course who does not live in the US, DMCIA ,or whatever that STUPID law is) can find a way to extract the functionality. But, MS is not going to do it. They have too much projected income expectations
 "invested" in selling the cloud and skydrive.&nbsp; Just look at how hard they are making it to get Office 2013 local install.&nbsp;

<br />
Linux is hardly a solution, but as far as it goes as an alternative to a product that is functionally broken, it will do.
<br />
<br />
You are quite right when you say that they baked the functionality deep into Windows 8 (and 8.1 which I have been BETA testing) and Office 2013. I have currently 15 rules set on my firewall to block various IP address ranges to which d.docs.live.net points
 to, I will keep working on that until I have a reasonably complete map of the service. It is easy for me to move to Linux since in my small company I have the most familiarity with it, my business partner however, has little experience with it. No doubt that
 will present an excellent opportunity to continue to map out Microsoft's SkyDrive infrastructure, but his client computer is no longer trusted to access sensitive data. I will permit him to open a Virtual Machine version of Linux on his Windows computer so
 that he can continue to work and that the client data remains secure. I'll disable any functionality that permits him to mount devices within the VM to prevent data leaving secured areas of our network.
<br />
<br />
The basic issue from my perspective however is legal compliance. Some of the information I deal with is protected under the UK's Official Secret's Act. Some of the data falls under ITAR rules. Given Microsoft and it's ties to US government agencies it would
 be negligent of me to house the data I am contractually obligated to protect anywhere but on an encrypted device under my control; to transfer sovereignty to a foreign power. Since I am completely liable and since the penalties for breaching protections afforded
 information under those rules goes beyond the simple destruction of reputation, I have to take care of the data.<br />
<br />
These 'services' are little more than spyware baked into the OS. I have no control over what application calls them or utilises them therefore I implicitly distrust those features. Until they can be brought under control I will be aiding my clients in re-evaluating
 where they stand on Open Source alternatives because they aren't going to be able to sit on Windows 7 and Office 2010 forever, they will need an alternative to go to until Microsoft gets it's act together. Because Windows 8.1 is worse from a corporate/enterprise/security
 perspective.<br />

            Yup.&nbsp; Even paranoids are have enemies sometimes.<br />
<br />
I am surprised at the number of announcements of governments and BIG corps jumping on the cloud bandwagon.&nbsp; I suspect it is a case of high level salesmen selling to high level executives. But the high level execs are so high that they don't get to hear (let
 alone ignore) low level techies trying to raise exactly the points you are making.
<br />
<br />
Personally I expect that some time in the next year or three a bunch of companies / government departments around the world are going to get nailed for privacy/secrecy violations that will be traced back to improperly secured cloud file storage.&nbsp; Only then
 will MS consider doing anything about making cloud security easier for small companies as well as large one.
<br />
<br />
Just to goose your paranoia, have you read any of the blogs and article opinions that have said that any data stored in the cloud by cloud storage companies who are owned in full or part (ie MS Skydrive) by US companies are susceptible to the US "Patriot" act
 being used to extract foreign corporate data, without notice. It was all the buzz about a year ago.<br />

Interestingly enough, I have a reasonable understanding of the USA PATRIOT Act, under which a US company can be compelled to transfer/hand over any data about any individual/business/entity the 'authorities' wish to investigate. The legislation basically implies
 that if a US company is hosting your data they can be instructed to hand over that data irrespective of whether it is physically held outside the US, even if it contravenes the host country's data protection laws.<br />
<br />
As I understand it an American company compelled to act under this legislation has an indemnity protecting it against lawsuit's. This means that the buck stops with the people who engage these services and not with the service providers themselves. When the
 lawsuits start the institutions and organisations who use cloud services based in the US are going to find that they are the ones who are liable. Since I would also be one of those organisations I too would be liable if I didn't take these matters as seriously
 as I do.<br />
<br />
You are quite right when you say that these issues have not been properly or legally explored. Until then it is anyone's guess what the consequences will be but I will say this. if you are (for example) a British company using cloud services provided by a US
 company you have probably already broken the Data Protection Act and the Official Secrets Act depending on the data stored. 'Data Sovereignty' is the issue in this example and by trusting it to a company based in a different country you are effectively handing
 that data to that country where it will be subject to their compliance laws and legislation. Those legal battles will be interesting.<br />
<br />
It is with sadness however I note that Groklaw closed it's doors as a result of it's dependency on e-mail and inability to keep its contributors secure.<br />

            Yes, you do have a better understanding of the the laws involved.&nbsp; Two tweaks I've gleaned is that it is not just limited to explicitly US owned cloud storage companies, it includes cloud storage companies that are even partly US owned (given the web of
 corporate ownership interrelations that exist that could be almost everyone).&nbsp; Even fully foreign owned cloud companies who even temporarily store the data physically in the US, say on a backup site, could be impacted.&nbsp; Which could be basically ANYONE unless
 they have explicit plans to avoid using US backup sites. The first time I'd heard of the issue was back around 95-96 when the British Columbia (Canada) provincial government cancelled an outsourcing contract because personal Health information was going to
 be stored in the US. That started my interest in the topic.<br />
<br />
I had not yet heard about Groklaw closing (I googled it in reply to your comment). I was aware of the name and vaguely what it did.&nbsp; Yes it is a shame that it is the third company providing valuable services to explicitly shut down due to American spying.&nbsp;
 Interestingly, the Wiki entry on Groklaw has already been updated to include it's current closing less than 2 days ago.&nbsp; (Conspiracy theorists are free to place their interpretation on this &lt;grin&gt; )<br />

<p>
</p><p>In existing documents, select the text, then pick <em><strong>English(UK)</strong></em> from

<p>
</p><p>If it's a matter of new documents you create being in US rather than UK English:</p>
<ol>
<li>In a new document go to <strong>Tools&gt; Language</strong></li><li>Select <strong>English (UK)</strong></li><li>Make sure the <em>Do not check...</em> checkbox is cleared</li><li>Click the <strong>Default</strong> button</li><li>Confirm <strong>Yes</strong> to updating your Normal template.</li></ol>

    <title>HyperLinks in Outlook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            HyperLinks in Outlook</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 and Outlook 2010.</p>
<p>I get the "This operation has been cancelled due to restrictions in effect on this computer" message when clicking on a hyperlink in Outlook. Have tried all the fixes in other threads. I am not an experienced PC tech, and am worried about editing the registry
 without further advice.</p>
<p>When I go to :</p>
<p>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\software\classes\.html and .htm</p>
<p>there is a sub-folder called OpenWithProgids. This has two values - the first is (default) and below it is AppX4hxtad77fbk3jkkeerkrm0ze94wjf3s9</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run virus check, malware check etc. Also set all defaults in the control panel for .htm &amp; .html files to Internet Explorer and MS Edge but has no effect.</p>
<p>Any ideas please. Thanks.</p>

</p><p>Hi David,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook 2010 was designed to use IE as the default webpage link opener in Emails since .... on Windows 10,&nbsp; MS Edge is the default web browser and 'opener' app for links in Emails..</p>
<p>
</p><p>To fix your problem you need to change Windows 10 settings, to make IE11 your default web browser and the default web browser for opening web links that are emails....</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. click the Search icon in the Windows tasks bar and search for 'Default Programs' (no quotes)</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>Start&gt;Default Programs</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. scroll down the list and find the entry for 'Web browser'.... you probably will see that 'MS Edge' is your default web browser...</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/91650930-529a-4a77-90ba-a40b0d77576e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/91650930-529a-4a77-90ba-a40b0d77576e" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>3. click on the item to change your default web browser to Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Open Outlook 2012 and give it a go....</p>
<p>
</p><p>be careful of clicking email links.... only click links from trusted and known sources... hover your mouse over the email link first, to display the ACTUAL web address that the link links to.... the bad guys will use a false caption on their links that actually
 hides/deceives you the real web address.... pointing you to their malicious/fake website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Consider using Outlook.com as your mail client instead..... go to <a href="https://outlook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://outlook.com</a> or click the links to Mail on bing.com or msn.com.... enter your windows credentials... and you should see the same accounts and emails that you have in your desktop mail program (Outlook 2012)</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>In the Windows Search dropdown... type Mail to display a listing of desktop and online mail applications that are available to you on Windows 10.</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>You can use the 'Default Programs' app (above) to set your default Email program or app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Generally, avoid making changes to your windows registry..... if you are using a work computer, seek the assistance of your company's IT department or Help Desk first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            <p>Hi Rob.</p>
<p>Thanks for that but it doesn't work.</p>
<p>Before posting here, I tried just about every solution I could find for this common problem including changing and/or resetting all defaults and also making sure that I didn't have the problem that some have had with Google Chrome.</p>
<p>I read through : <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/kb/310049" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/kb/310049</a>&nbsp;which suggests changing the registry key, but my registry key is very different from the one in kb310049 which I why I am reluctant
 to start making changes.</p>
<p>I am careful about opening links etc., I have virus and malware protection, and this is a home computer which is not connected to a corporate or business network.</p>
<p>This only happened when I "upgraded" to Windows 10.</p>
<p>I am happy with Outlook 2010 and don't really want to start making lots of changes if not absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still think there's something wrong with my registry key -&nbsp; this doesn't look right !!</p>

            <p>Thank You Don but that's not my problem.</p>
<p>The slipstick solution is for where you are asked which program / app to use to open browser. My problem is this &nbsp;"This operation has been cancelled due to restrictions in effect on this computer"&nbsp; message when I click on a link.</p>
<p>But - I ran the slipstick program just in case (backed up registry key first) - but no difference.</p>
<p>However, what is very strange is that there are two users on this PC, myself and my wife and we're both logged in as Administrators. I can click on email html links - no problem. My wife can't - just gets this operation cancelled message.</p>
<p>I have trawled through every setting, tick-box, radio button and default program setting I can find for both accounts and as far as I can see, they are identical.

<h2>            Cant gain acsess to my hotmail account</h2>
                    Some years back I had a f.b. Account.&nbsp; With hotmail address one day I went to go get access to my Facebook account and everything and changed even the backup email address I did not recognize none of it talk to customer support they walked me through it
 of course that didn't work because it asks you questions of what was your last password you remember that's been 6 years ago I have no clue so I put one in that I thought it might have been and she said nope I'm sorry she said we can't do anything for you
 how about an email did you send an email to your like workplace I said no we don't send emails or have computers we can't help you then because everything has to go through the automated system and it won't recognize you! I said yes ma'am I understand that
 but I can't remember 7 years ago ... I just can't remember and I don't send emails I is there any other questions? no sir I'm sorry that's all we got I'm not computer literate that much I can get around on one but sounds like Microsoft says you either send
 emails or remember password or you will not gain access my email accounts today are so similar you have to look twice at him but the lady said I'm sorry we can't go by that we can't go by your picture we can't go by your social security number we can't go
 buy anything but the password well if I had the password if I knew the password I wouldn't be in this problem that I can't access Microsoft Hotmail account I really need to get back onto the Spacebook account and I'm having a hard time and they won't allow
 me to open another Facebook account they keep saying you have to verify Who You Are yes I understand that but it won't allow me to do that so now I got another Facebook account there and I can't access it is there anyone out there in Microsoft world that can
 plow me into that email address so that I can open the Facebook Paige and get my life back on track I live out in the middle of Timbuktu no computer I have a cell phone I guess with a computer app on it I apologize that I forgot my passwords from years ago
 and now I got a book started to where it's going to be a hundred years old that's going to have a million passwords in it the lady said there is no one that can access the domain and change anything no one the system will not allow it that is absolutely crazy
 I guess I have to show Microsoft that that's good deal I can't even get into my own account it's so good security that's that's great though that's what we need I added I just wish that they would be different questions then if you send your last email and
 how many words it was because I don't really send emails I apologize for that all start if that's what it means to gain knowledge on a backup but please in the meantime I beg Microsoft to allow me access back to my Hotmail account so that I can get back into
 my Facebook account thank you God I beg Microsoft to allow me access back to my Hotmail account so that I can get back into my Facebook account thank you God bless I'm just dumb farmer up here and and I don't really know much at all about a computer please
 help I guess I was hacked or something someone has changed my password because I've used the same password since I've started time and now it's kicking me out of there anidentI don't know how that works I don't know what happened<br />

<h2>            Upgrading from Office 2007 Trial Version to Full Version</h2>
                    I have been using Office 2007 that was pre-installed on a new lap-top and have bought a licence for the full version.&nbsp; When I do the upgrade it accepts my product key and appears to go through the registration process but the applications still say Trial
 Version and have severely restricted facilities i.e. can't even send an email in Outlook.&nbsp; I have tried three times with the same results.&nbsp; Any suggestions?

    <title>Word not saving to iPad reliably or exporting to PDF - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hivis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word not saving to iPad reliably or exporting to PDF</h2>
                    <p>Word for iPad Pro is not saving consistently. I have tried turning off auto save momentarily and doing a manual save before I exit the document, but when I go to open the document again, the most recent content is not there. This problem is not consistent,
 but happens multiple times, at least once per week. I am saving locally to my iPad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, “Export to PDF” has stopped working from the file menu (although I can still do it through “send a copy” with significantly reduced quality). I receive an error message saying “Can’t export file. This file can’t be converted into a printable format”
 and a corrupted PDF is saved.</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;Hivis,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>For initial troubleshooting, install the update for Word. If the same issue persists, I advice uninstalling and reinstalling Word app to address the issue. But before doing so, it will best to back up and save your Word documents. You can save your files
 in OneDrive or in any cloud-based storage.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Respond to this thread to let me know how the issue progresses.</p>

<p>Hi Darleen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your suggestions. I uninstalled and re-installed the Word app, logged out and back in again, and neither of the problems has resolved. Documents sometimes save but it is inconsistent.</p>

<p>I’ve saved to local iPad files, a file storage app and iCloud. It’s not saving properly in the file storage app. Not sure yet about the other options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Exporting to PDF from Word still doesn’t work no matter where the file is opened from, or where I try to save a PDF to.</p>

<p>Thank you Darleen for sharing that link. Unfortunately the quality is too poor when I use that method to convert to PDF, and the images are blurry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue with saving continues. I look forward to hearing the outcome of Microsoft’s investigation into the issue.</p>

            Thank you Darleen. The issue with converting to PDF has resolved. The issue with saving documents has not, however I have noticed that it is also happening with Excel so I am following up with the developer of the file manager app I am using.

<p>What you're looking to change is the "grid interval." To access this setting, go to

    <title>Scanning emails to automate tasks based on keywords - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aarnii  say:</h3>
<h2>            Scanning emails to automate tasks based on keywords</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know if there is an add-in (for Outlook 2013) or an third-party software that would automate some tasks when we receive new incoming emails (we received several hundred of emails every day) based on their contents and attachements.</p>
<p>For instance, I would have a list of key words with company names (say Facebook, Google, Amazon, etc.) and if one of these keywords is present in the body of the mail, then the mail is moved to the corresponding Outlook folder (e.g. Inbox\Google) and also
 saved in the corresponding folder in the hard disk (eg.&nbsp; C:\Mails\Google). Also, if there is an attachement,&nbsp; I would like the attachement (usually pdf or Excel files) to be scanned for keywords and this attachement to be saved to the corresponding folder
 (C:\Attachements\Google).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some emails may refer to several firms (Amazon, Google, Facebook), therefore it would be necessary to duplicate and save the email and attachements (if any) to all the corresponding folders (eg. we will have the email containing keywords Google and Facebook
 on both C:\Mails\Google and C:\Mails\Facebook folder...or if the attachement have the keywords Amazon and Google, then the attachement is saved to C:\Attachements\Amazon and to C:\Attachements\Google).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It should be easy to update the keywords list so that we can add or remove new company name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any too that exists that would suit my needs?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot in advance,</p>
<p>Aarnii</p>

            <p>Hi Aarnii,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, you can actually receive emails based on their contents and attachments. All you need to do is create rules in Outlook 2013. By using rules, you can reduce manual and repetitive actions needed to manage your email messages. When you turn on rules, they
 run continuously and automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please check this link on how to <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/manage-email-messages-by-using-rules-c24f5dea-9465-4df4-ad17-a50704d66c59" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Thank you Acelyn for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know how to use Outlook rules but I am not sure whether this is the best way for me to do what I want. From what I can understand, I would have to create as many rules as I have keywords, and since I may have 200+ keywords, it can be excessively time-consuming
 to create that many rules.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead, I would prefer having one single Excel file for instance with all my keywords and that Outlook reads this keyword list for every incoming email and execute the corresponding tasks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I don't think standard Outlook rules can read an attachment to search for keywords?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Sébastien</p>

</p><p>We&nbsp;understand. However, creating rules is the only option that we have in taking your tasks based on their contents and keywords. Also, when it comes to having one single Excel file for instance with all your keywords, it has something to do with programming.</p>

</p><p>thank you again for your answer.</p>
<p>I was expecting such a tool would already exist in Outlook, or an add-in/third party software. I have come accross softwares like "Save a message" by Ornic but not sure if they do exactly what I need. Do you know this software?</p>
<p>Otherwise, indeed, I will have to do some code myself. Thank you for the useful link you provided.</p>

            <p>I don't know of any off the shelf add-in that will do this (which is not to say that there will not be one), but what you ask could be created as a macro in Outlook VBA .
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With a list of 200+ keywords and you want to check for multiple occurrences in the body of the messages - even more so if the message is a reply to a message that includes the previous correspondence, there is likely to be a lot of duplication of e-mail
 messages across the folders (both Outlook and disc), but that part is relatively simple to achieve, using a list of keywords stored either in a text file (or better still an Excel worksheet).</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is less straightforward is the attachments. In order to process the attachments they must be saved to the hard drive, then processed using the appropriate application, which must be amenable to VBA processing, so it is essential to know what the attachments
 are that you want to save.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Opening all the attachments in a variety of applications in order to check them against your list in order to determine whether to keep the attachments on file is going to slow down the receipt of e-mail quite markedly.</p>

            <p>Thank Acelyn and Graham for your help on that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will very likely have to create a macro to do this as I don't really find an add-in that does exactly what I want.</p>
<p>And indeed, managing and opening the attachments will be quite complicated...instead I will probably just scan for the attachements' name instead of their whole content.</p>

In Word 2000, there was a command called "Keep lines together" (in Font, I believe, or in Paragraph). Does it still exist in Word 2010?<br />

            Yes, it does, in the Paragraph dialog. Right-click the text and click Paragraph in the menu. In the dialog, click the Line and Page Breaks tab. "Keep lines together" is the third option in that tab.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Build 10240 broke network card &#40;Realtek RTL8192DE&#41;</h2>
                    The Windows 10 Build 10240 broke my network card in my Lenovo B570. I have tried disabling and reenabling the device, updating the driver (Windows says the most updated driver is being used) and both hardwiring and using the device wireless. The card works
 fine (it worked correctly in previous builds and prior to installing Build 10240 and is working fine using a Ubuntu Live USB key now). I'm not sure how to proceed. The specific driver that Windows is picking up is the Realtek RTL8192DE.
