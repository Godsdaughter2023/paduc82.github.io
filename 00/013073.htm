<h2>            Hotmail only displays first page of emails</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the the last 3 days I can not access emails after the first page.</p>
<p>The count of emails in the left hand pane says that emails exist but only the first page of emails can be displayed.</p>
<p>The vertical scroll bar can only display within the first page.</p>
<p>The last displayed email is at the bottom of the browser page so there are not any page number links to click for access to later pages of emails.</p>
<p>The filter has always been set to 'All'.</p>
<p>I set filter to 'Unread' and back to 'All' hoping that might some some effect - but it didn't.</p>
<p>I can delete some emails from the first page and more emails appear at the end so my emails still exist but just can't be accessed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help please!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>After I posted the above I wondered what would happen if I used a different browser so I tried IE8 which I don't use anymore but is still installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IE8 displayed emails with scroll bar able to scroll all emails and page number links.</p>
<p>Logged off then logged into Firefox which I upgraded to 47.0.1 just over a month ago and have had no problems using with Hotmail.</p>
<p>Surprisingly I could then access all my emails.</p>
<p>Logged off and logged in again to Firefox - now can only access emails on the first page!</p>
<p>Multiple logins to Firefox could still only access first page emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Login with IE8 once again to see all emails.</p>
<p>Firefox could then access all emails for the first login only!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had no problems using Firefox with Hotmail for several years until now and no problems using Hotmail with 47.0.1 until now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has Microsoft changed Hotmail in the last 3 or 4 days so that something (cookie?) prevents Firefox from accessing all emails?</p>
<p>What does IE8 do (perhaps sets cookie?) that allows Firefox to access all emails just for first login?</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>
</p><p>We suggest that you reset your Internet Explorer settings back to default. You can follow the steps on this

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reset IE8 to default settings.</p>
<p>As before IE8 correctly allows me to access all emails.</p>
<p>Firefox still only displays one page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried moving emails to new Hotmail folders.</p>
<p>That process also has problems - sometimes the Move works other times it doesn't.</p>
<p>The displayed count on each of the Hotmail folders is also incorrect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not updated the version of Firefox for over a month and the problem only started about 3 days before I posted this topic here.</p>
<p>Perhaps Hotmail introduced some changes which are incompatible with Firefox.</p>
<p>Hotmail staff should be able to determine if Hotmail was updated around that time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will purchase a computer that can support Windows 10 to see if upgrading hardware/software resolves the problem.</p>
<p>

</p><p>It seems that the account is fine when using Internet Explorer. To isolate your concern, we'll need some information:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you tried to clear cache, cookies and history in Firefox?</li><li>Have you tried to uninstall and reinstall Firefox? if you haven't yet, kindly do so.

<h2>            In-Document Hyperlinks jumping to TOC instead of Actual Heading</h2>
                    I'm creating a document using headings and a table of contents. I'd like to link from one section to another using hyperlinks to in-document headings. When I set it up and click on the link, the screen jumps to that heading in the TOC instead of the header
 in the document.&nbsp;

Hi Webbrewers3,</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
To clarify the issue, please confirm the following.</p>
<p>
1. When did the issue occur? </p>
<p>
2. Does it happen when you access any sites in SharePoint Online or a specific site in SharePoint Online?</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, I suggest you change a browser or wait some time to access the affected sites to see and let us know the outcome.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Thanks,</p>
<p>
Cliff</p>

<p>NO CHANGE --&nbsp;</p>
<p>(1) I still cannot access "Sign-in options" in normal mode. I can access these options in Safe mode, but Security services needed cannot be started in Safe mode.</p>
<p>(2) Deleting NGC folder contents had no effect.</p>
<p>(3) Have tried repeatedly (after each new update) to "Sign in with a local account instead," which resets the account correctly but hangs on Signoff. &nbsp;Attempting to Restart also hangs and I have been forced to revert to a Restore Point each time.</p>

<h3> nishant panda 92  say:</h3>
<h2>            MOVING CORTANA TO OTHER PLATFORMS, HOW IS THE FUTURE FOR WINDOWS PHONE &#63;</h2>
                    <p>recent news of expanding cortana to android and ios devices has made a quite a blow. As a windows phone user since a long time. i have been using windows phone since windows phone 7 and now using the windows phone 8.1 denim. The very best thing about the
 windows phone experience was its unique UI that not only stands out from an ios and android device but also the different and simple and quick functionality the UI offers. Addition of a personal assistant on wp was a nice touch and this thing was supposed
 to be a windows phone experience. what is the point of buying a windows phone when Microsoft is pushing the best services to other interfaces ?&nbsp;<br />
MS office is available on android as well and ios platforms.</p>
<p>skype is available on ios and android with a much richer experience, on the other hand when windows phone has a skype app &nbsp;and on comparing it seems dull compared to the other two. windows phone skype app has just static skype opening app page whereas on
 android the skype's cloud has some animation put into it.</p>
<p>outlook has been integrated well with android. the new app for outlook just makes it simple to triage mail quickly but windows phone is still lacking on that front.</p>
<p>&nbsp;my point here is why should windows phone exclusive experience be pushed to other devices that stand as a rival and definitely at a ruling position in the market?<br />
look what google does. google didnt make a youtube app for wp. bummer ! no google services are available on wp. if google takes advantage, why shouldnt MS?</p>
<p>After google accquired waze app it announced that no further updates will be available for windows phone app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>why doesnt MS use its services to do that same ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>or atleast if MS &nbsp;does have services on other platforms, it should make windows phone a better experience of the services but better than other platforms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;the repercussions could be catastrophic for windows phone user.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><br />
Microsoft listen to me here---&gt; "AT THE USER END WE ARE UNHAPPY WITH THE MOVE OF CORTANA TO OTHER DEVICES. KEEP THE WINDOWS PHONE EXPERIENCE JUST FOR WINDOWS PHONE"<br />
<br />
please post if anyone knows in this regard how this move will affect WP and Android and ioS and in particular wp users.</p>

            Could not agree with you more. I have been reading the blogs on WinPhone 10 and from what most are saying, WinPhone 10 will be more similar to the others rather than staying unique. I too feel that MS is porting out its advantages by putting its key sw
 on the other os. While I like the lumia icon that I use, there is not much of a reason to stay with on windows phone with everything being ported over to Android. I used Android for several years and you can even now download launchers to make your phone look
 and act like windows phone 7 or 8 and get the luxury of a vast number of apps. Once I had a phone with good hardware I had almost zero problems with feature or operation. Sad to see WinPhone disappearing.&nbsp; I hold hope that Windows 10 will work well enough
 to make some difference.&nbsp;

            I have Microsoft Word 2010. The error message says, "File Conversion" and asks to select the text encoding to make the document readable. I have tried the default and MS-DOS options but it will not let me select them. I have also selected the other encoding:
 option and couldn't use English but I tried&nbsp;another language; but it was still encoded gibberish. It only does this when I try to open a file someone has sent me, from a website, and from the cloud. Word works fine when I create a new document.

<p>That's probably just a leftover entry from a program that's been uninstalled. Of course, it's also possible it could be a leftover entry from something malicious.<br />
<br />
You could install CCleaner, which is a very useful maintenance app and has lots of features. In the Tools section, you can choose to delete that.
<strong>Note</strong>: it's not recommended to use the registry cleaner included.</p>

            I'm not sure that they are published for Outlook.com but it is safe to say if you are wanting to do mass e-mailing, Outlook.com isn't the place. A 3rd party e-mail service that specializes in that would be a much better choice.

            <p>Had the same problem. Found this: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/contacts-message-backup/9nblgggz57gm</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looks like it is a Microsoft app that can be installed. Why it wasn't in the first place I don't know! BUT once installed it does not show up in the system menu like it says in the app. So I just went to the store, found the app, and used the 'open' button.
 Feedback on the store isn't that positive, but I used it as I have to send the phone away for screen pixel issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best of luck.</p>

                    <p>Lately, whenever I&nbsp;try to download a file using Internet Explorer 10, I get this error message: "Your current security settings do not allow this file to be downloaded." After trying different security settings, I finally was able to download some files

            <p>I believe the problem has been fixed. Somehow the setting in Tools/Internet Options/Security/Custom level/Downloads/File download had been changed to 'Disable'. I changed it back to 'Enable' and was then able to download files again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This must have been changed by the last Windows Update, but it doesn't make sense that Microsoft would change my internet options. Hope this is helpful to others who had this happen.</p>

    <title>requery combobox in datasheet view - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> billy_p  say:</h3>
<h2>            requery combobox in datasheet view</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I have a subform that will display records in datasheet view. Theres are 2 comboboxes: category and subcategory. The contents of subcategory depend on the value of category. Both fields are bound and the row source for subcategory comes from a query that returns
 2 columns: ID and subcategory_name. I store the value of the ID in the table but display the name in the form (this is where my problem lies)<br />
<br />
I do subcategory.requery in the after update event of category and i get the correct values in subcategory. I also do subcategory.requery in the sub-form's on current event. This is when i have issues as the requery action messes up all the other subcategories
 previously entered <b>if </b>the category changes. They all become blank onscreen but the data is not changed in the table. This is because, as i mentioned previously, i'm storing the ID in the table and displaying the name of the subcategory. If i move to
 a different row, all the rows that have the same category display the subcategory properly but the ones that don't become blank.<br />
<br />
Data in the table is always fine but this will surely confuse end users. This is my subcategory rowSource query:<br />
<br />
SELECT subcategories.name, subcategories.ID <br />
FROM subcategories <br />
WHERE subcategories.category_ID = <b>[categoryCombo].[value]</b>; <br />
<br />
Can i make this something like&nbsp;<u>CurrentRow</u>.[categoryCombo].[value] so that requerying doesn't hide the values for different categories that the one i'm working on?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />
<br />
Billy<br />
<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            One further point.&nbsp; You should also set the subcategory combo box to Null in the AfterUpdate event procedure of the category combo box.&nbsp; If a user changes their mind after selecting a subcategory, and goes back and selects a different category in the first
 combo box the subcategory combo box will appear to have no value.&nbsp; However, its real value will be the hidden subcategoryID value originally selected.&nbsp; Consequently, if the user does not select a subcategory the underlying table will contain conflicting values
 in the two columns.<br />
<br />
This raises another issue.&nbsp; By having columns for both the category and subcategory in the table it is not normalized to Third Normal Form (3NF)&nbsp; because subcategory determines category, so the latter is transitively functionally dependant on the key of the
 table.&nbsp; All non-key columns should be determined solely by the whole of the key for the table to be normalized to 3NF.&nbsp; A table not in 3NF allows the possibility of the sort of update anomalies which I've described above.<br />
<br />
You might be prepared to live with this degree of non-normalization - many people are.&nbsp; If not, you'll find examples of how to deal with this sort of thing in the context of a normalized table in the file ComboDemo.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
This little file illustrates a number of approaches, including the use of hybrid controls to allow the top-down selection of hierarchical values by means of correlated combo boxes.&nbsp; This does of course require the use of continuous forms view, not datasheet
 view.<br />

            Thanks for your reply Bob. Sadly, it didn't work. I get the exact same behavior than with my original query: subcategories that don't belong to the category in the current row get hidden. They all show up when i 'm about to enter a new row. Just standing
 in that new row makes all the subcategories show up. <br />
<br />
I tried doing a form.requery instead of requerying just the combobox to no avail.<br />
<br />
What happens when i'm about to enter a new row that makes all subcategories show up?<br />

            Thanks for the tips Ken. I will have to look further into your code. I did however take your advise and made the subcategories combobox null after updating the categories one.<br />
<br />
Thanks again<br />

<h2>            Outlook 2010&#58; &#34;An encrypted connection is not available&#34;</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I'm trying to sync my Hotmail email accounts with Outlook 2010. I got one sync successfully, it was very straight forward. However when I tried to add more accounts, I keep getting the "An encrypted connection is not available" error message. I also tried setting
 up the accounts manually and it still doesn't work.<br />
<br />
I think the problem is the one account that I sync successfully is a TRUE Hotmail account, while the others are email accounts that I setup with domains.live.com because I have two website domains. Before switching to Outlook 2010, I was using Windows Live
 Mail and all the accounts are synced without any issues. With Outlook 2010, is there any other settings I need to put in to make these account sync properly?
<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<h2>            sheet too large tabs disappear</h2>
                    Hi, Just signed up for office365 for my Mac - office 2011 - When i use excel a lot of the time the spreadsheets all of a sudden become too large for the screen so i can't see the tabs at the bottom. If i make it fit the screen i can see the tabs. My problem
 is that i often work on 2 spreadsheets at a time so in order to do that i keep having to switch between the two formats to change tabs - crazy, help, what am i missing??

<h2>            Windows Defender Security Center Comments &#40;For Winows 10 Insiders&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Dear Windows 10&nbsp;Insider Program Users,</p>
<p>
</p><p>How is the Windows Defender Security Center working for you?&nbsp; I am not in the Windows 10 Insider program, but have followed with interest about the Creators Update.&nbsp; Some You Tube Videos have offered suggestions that there have been issues with Drivers and
 Devices showing as being out of date in WDSC when that is not the case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe that the most important security features are Antivirus and Firewall settings.&nbsp; Do you think that the other settings will confuse or help customers?&nbsp; Or is it too early to tell?&nbsp; I think the old Windows Defender had a simpler interface.&nbsp; I think
 a good discussion is that outside of Anti Virus and Firewall, how much do the new consolidated settings in the new WDSC relate to security?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this ready for the presumed April 2017 launch?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jack </p>

I get "Sorry it looks like there was an error. Please try again." with the blue and white Outlook screen. The only options given are "OK" which repeats the error message and to sign out and sign in, which do nothing.<br />

Please advise. This is beyond frustrating, and I would like to know why Microsoft does not advise customers of the problems they will encounter due to "upgrades" in advance. I need access to email via phone for work, and this is causing me another headache.<br />

Attention, moderators: can I get some help, please? I would like my issue to be escalated for support. I have an LG phone with a built-in Hotmail ap. I have not had any problems accessing my e-mails until today. I have tried signing out, signing in, deleting
 the shortcut to Hotmail, even went to the MSN.com web site and tried to sign in there, and am getting the same Error Message&nbsp; indicated in my original post.<br />
<br />
I really need some help and a solution, Please!<br />

Thanks for your reply, but first of all, I DID NOT CHANGE MY ACCOUNT NAME. to @Outlook.com, as you mentioned. As I understand it, after the upgrade, Hotmail users retained their same e-mail addresses. Therefore, I am not sure what you have advised applies is
 my case.<br />
<br />
Also, as i said, after the "upgrade"/switch to Outlook, which in my case, occurred several weeks ago, I had no problem accessing my Outlook/Houtmail e-mail account on my mobile phone. Again, I did not change the name/email address, anything.&nbsp; It is only now
 that I am experiencing a problem. <br />
<br />
Please take this information into account and advise of a solution or how I can get some help. If necessary, I will call Microsoft Headquarters, the Global Escalation team, the Customer Advocacy team, even the Office of Microsoft's CEO if that is what is necessary,
 because this problem is affecting my work.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your attention to the above, and I trust that someone will be able to help and provide a solution to this problem.

P.S. If I have to reset my phone to factory settings (which I may not be able to do due to the security settings on my particular phone--I never entered a security code when I got the phone--and now it won't allow any changes without it---if I understand that
 all my personal data will be erased, then it would mean my contacts, text messages, etc. will be gone. If that is what you are asking me to do, I cannot do that. I need the information for work and my personal life! I cannot understand the way Microsoft does
 business by "upgrading"/inconveniencing customers in this way. It is simply beyond belief and my comprehension.<br />

            No thanks to tech support here, but just so you know, with the help of my mobile phone service provider tech support, (AT&amp;T) I am able to access my e-mail account via www.ive. com. This is NOT a solution to the fact that the built-in ap linked to Hotmail
 that used to work with my phone no longer works. However, it is a far better solution than the one proposed by the mods here--which was to restore my phone to factory settings. That would effectively wipe out my data; in addition, it is not even sure that
 it would work!<br />
<br />
Just thought you should know that AT&amp;T tech support was able to help me find a solution. Really sad that Microsoft does not consider the effect on users' ability to access email when it decides to upgrade and make changes.

<h2>            Can We Talk About What We Like For A Change&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When the announcement of the next version of Windows came I was elated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Finally!" I thought, "People will finally be able to look past the start menu and understand what a brilliant step forward Windows 8 really was"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Boy was I wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a cursory browse of the official forums all I saw was a trash pile of ill-informed complaints and general.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really believe that some people have this knee-jerk compulsion to hate anything new or innovative.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They gave you what you wanted! The old start menu is back!</p>
<p>
</p><p>But no.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"The UI is too different from 7"</p>
<p>
</p><p>"There are bugs!"</p>
<p>
</p><p>"I don't like these features that I will never use. Remove them! I don't care if anybody else likes them."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I'm no Microsoft fanboy; I have my major beefs with this company. But one thing I've loved about them since the beta of Windows 7 is their operating systems. I dunno, I guess I was just gifted with a superpower that lets me see past the odd annoyance
 and appreciate everything good that is brought to the table.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just talking about windows 8: Native ISO mounting? Check. A better task manager? Check. Better multi-monitor support? Check. Speed and stability improvements? I could go on and on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So please, I'm begging you, for just one little thread can we stop and just talk about what we're loving about this UNFINISHED operating system that we're testing?</p>

 8) But still old fashion like 7 so I can work in Peace. I like that it is New - better is relatively.</p>

<p>Hmmm.... Lemme get back to you on that one. Although, straight off the top of my head:</p>
<p>&nbsp;- I too like Windows 7</p>
<p>&nbsp;- I like that I can still use Classic Start Menu in Windows 10</p>
<p>&nbsp;- (Can't keep myself from mentioning this, sorry): I don't like that there's poor support for dark color schemes in Windows 10 (worse than there was in Windows 7, where you could still customize the colors of every UI elements), and I'm not talking about
 the stupid "High Contrast" themes... I'll make it up to you by saying that I do like that Firefox still works in Windows 10... that ok with you? :)
<br />
&nbsp;- Oh, and I'm also happy that my D3D11 project still works in Widnows 10 too. Same for a DeskBand I wrote, which uses Direct2D - it doesn't really do/show anything, but I have big plans for it - it still works, anyway.</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Uhm, we had (or could implement with a bit of effort) completely flicker-free &amp; glitch-free window resizing in Windows XP (not happy that this is still a problem in Windows 10) - no big deal, though - just a grudge. To make up for this one: ...thinking....
 nothing yet... Cortana? No, that's not in there yet... still thinking&amp;looking... oh yeah: the Command Prompt experimental features make sense... sort'of (I'm not keen on the virtual desktops).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hey, I know: Why don't you tell us what you like about Windows 10? I mean... just in case there's something we missed that really deserves to be lauded. But please, only mention things that haven't been mentioned already in the other threads... I'm curious
 what's so great about Windows 10 that makes it worthwhile.</p>

            <p>Okay, fair enough. You've asked a question in a *fairly* reasonable way so I'll answer you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I like about Windows 10? Honestly, I like that it's Windows 8.1 but with the added benefit of giving my ears (eyes) peace from hearing people cry about the god damn start screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I like that everything I use still works and in most cases performs better than in Windows 8, which in turn performed better than in Windows 7. The benchmarks don't lie.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have one major stipulation when it comes to my OS and it is this: Does it run my games better? And on that score Microsoft has delivered every single time, without fail, ever since the inception of Windows 7.<br />
<br />
People act like Windows 8 was some sort of Vista-like catastrophe. It wasn't. It had one major feature that a lot of people just couldn't gel with, and in most cases it was because they never tried. They just looked at it and condemned it instantly. I even
 had one guy claim to have used Windows 8 extensively and then proceed to tell me that the start screen was full of "unremovable ads like the Xbox" Which everybody who has spent 10 minutes with the thing knows is false.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That start screen was a wonder to me. It was SUCH a useful organizational tool. The old '95 - 7 start menu didn't do that for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently started work in the IT department at a company where my computer has Windows 7 on it after using Windows 8 exclusively since beta. Good lord it's like stepping back in time. So many useful things are missing. The right-click-on-start menu being
 a major loss in my books.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 has a ways to go yet, I agree, but the major point I tried to make in this thread is that people are never satisfied. They're expecting a polished product in an ALPHA build and are already condemning the operating system before it properly even
 exists.</p>

<p>You are mostly talking about Window 8 here. I was curious to know what Windows 10 has brought to the table that's worth mentioning, since this whole forum is about that... was your OP only about Widnows 8 as well? The Start Menu has not impressed me either,
 but that's just because it's too different from Windows 7's (at least we can agree(ish) on something). Hm, I guess it really the way mass-media already presents it (when they're not kissing MS's ****): people who already like Win8 or Win7 have no incentive
 to move on to 10.</p>

            To me, Windows 8 was good enough as a step forward.&nbsp; I had no problem switching to it right away.&nbsp; The start menu is all there.&nbsp; Just no menu desktop interface but everything is accessible from Windows Explorer.&nbsp; Of course, for novices and those who do
 not use Windows professionally it was not obvious.&nbsp; Now the start menu is there and still a ton of complaints.&nbsp; It is enough to just search the internet to see all those constant bombardments and bashing of Microsoft.&nbsp; It becomes a culture.&nbsp; Amazing.&nbsp; Why
 Microsoft?&nbsp; Why not Apple or Google.&nbsp; Sometimes I am disgusted reading all that trash that is filling the internet.

            <p>I hope you understand: The popularity of Microsoft operating systems and applications is what allows them to be offered at the extremely low prices you mention.</p>

            <p>There are a great many thing to like about the operating system being previewed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of what is to be lauded is "under the hood" in a much improved code base. Discussion of these things will come in later "developer" previews though. Leaving that as your "Speed and stability improvements" seems to be enough for this discussion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the discussion of the UI, it would seem telling that the interface from 8.1 was chosen as the starting point. The "pieces of paper" metaphor is one of the greatest aids to usability. The ability to navigate the system "easily" from the keyboard has seen
 some great evolutionary advances. Being able to press the Windows key and a character or two to launch anything is a wonderful advancement in speed and ergonomics. The addition of web sources to the resulting menu, not only adds greatly to the available information,
 but, should aid those who consider themselves "content creators" by pointing out that their current "creation" has already been done - possibly hundreds of times already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does amaze me that many have not understood that the contextual menus provided in the Win 8 interface provide a much more comprehensive and useable group of selections than the "Start" menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disambiguation of terms has aided greatly in navigating the system and seems to be getting, continually better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The inclusion and enhancements of the Windows Store apps continues to bring what was only available as web services and applications "closer to home" on desktop PCs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The enhanced portability of data has grown to rid us of reliance on, and the cost of, printing devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are just a few items, we can add more as the discussion develops.</p>

            <p>I came from Windows 7 right to Windows 10 and It has been a learning experience for me.</p>
<p>Windows 10 has been stable for me since day 1 (Oct 3)</p>
<p>through all three builds with just minor problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 has given new life to older Computers that are still useful.</p>
<p>I am running it on a old Dell XPS 410 with a Q6600 processor and limited to 4gigs of Ram</p>
<p>and its running fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been looking at the new HOME Folder options and I might just like that because i
</p>
<p>never really liked the folder structure of windows Vista or 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I like the way Windows 10 installs all new hardware during Bootup and does it fast.</p>
<p>I have never been a fan of IE but the current special version of IE 11 seems to be as fast as Chrome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have become a fan of windows 10!!!!</p>

                    <p>I have unlimited subscription in Hungary and registered caller ID number. For the last couple of years everything was OK and correct number was displayed during the call. But not any more. The cellphone providers don't displaying my caller ID since monday
 (apr. 23). Each time random foreign number is displayed on cell phones as caller ID. Otherwise, there aren't any problems on landlines.
<br />
<br />
I using the skype personal mode on 3 devices: 2 cell phones, 1 PC. The problem is same on all devices. All skype client are newest version.<br />
<br />
My telecommunication provider's response: they do not have the problem. I read that my problem is not the only one: https://goo.gl/RVCmnz</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I deleted my caller ID and subscription on friday. When this problem will be repairing, I'll be back again and paid subscription, set up my caller ID)</p>

 any password. I thought it had something to do with my norton security, so I disabled my firewalls and all norton systems, but am, still having this problem. I have a second computer here at my business that is replicating the same problem. That second computer
 runs good for about a week. I have contacted go daddy as I purchased microsoft 365 from them and they host my email, but they said its a microsoft issue. I have tried to gain access to microsoft online chat to no avail. I keep getting directed to useless articles
 or circled back to their helpless virtual assistant. The virtual assistant offers to connect me with a chat person, when i click to chat (it says 0 in line) the virtual assistant box dissapears and i have to start over! I have a business to run and can not

    <title>E51 Dropped Bluetooth Connection&#47;Calls SOLUTION for BMW - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bmwe51fix  say:</h3>
<h2>            E51 Dropped Bluetooth Connection&#47;Calls SOLUTION for BMW</h2>
                    After several months of pure frustration and getting no where with Nokia or BMW (both blaming the other) trying to fix my dropped bluetooth connection every 2mins during calls in my 2007 BMW 335i, I came to these forums for help. Unfortunately I haven't
 really come across a thread that seemed to offer a clear cut solution but there was a reference in one of the myriad of "contact transfer" threads that helped me figure out a solution that worked.<br />
<br />
Problem: my E51's Bluetooth connection will establish but disconnect/drop every 2mins, as other have stated, making calls virtually impossible.<br />
<br />
Solution: The problems seems to be that that phone is attempting to unsuccessfully transfer contact information to the car (though there is no sign or message stating that it is trying to do this). It seems to drop the connection after the failed attempts...for
 my E51, this usually was close to 2mins.<br />
<br />
Another forum member mentioned that this might be the problem and to "unsynch" your contacts, and that seemed to work for them.<br />
<br />
I did this in "PC Suite" and voila! the damn thing actually stayed connected indefinitely!! Amazing...details of my phone/ PC Suite setup are below: THIS SOLUTION WILL NOT ALLOW ANY CONTACT TRANSFER TO OCCUR TO THE CAR, ONLY ALLOW BLUETOOTH CONNECTION FOR MAKING
 AND RECEIVING CALLS<br />
<br />
Some of these steps may be redundant, but i'm not changing a damn thing since this has worked without a dropped call in over a month!<br />
<br />
PC SUITE: access from menu, then "Tools" folder<br />
then click the "Sync" icon<br />
--you will then see PC Suite, click options and "edit sync profile"<br />
--click "Applications" and click the first setting "Contacts"<br />
-- change "include in sync" to "no"<br />
(the other two settings: remote database is set as "contacts" and synch type "both ways", but this is not relevant since you are removing the ability to synch your contacts)<br />
-- now go back to main PC Suite page and click the "connection settings" (don't know if you need to change these, but i'll tell you what mine are)<br />
Server Version : 1.1<br />
Data Bearer: Bluetooth<br />
Host Address: PC Suite<br />
User name: none<br />
psswd:**** (whatever you have selected)<br />
Allow sync requests: NO<br />
<br />
HOPE THIS WORKS FOR YOU<br />
<br />
Again this is only a solution for dropped connection problems, I have not been able to successfully transfer a single contact to my car (though my wife's motorola and my old nokia 6131 did so without issue). I've tried the contact download manager and mutliple
 steps/suggestions on the forums to no avail. Nokia has blamed BMW and BMW dealer says it's a Nokia problem. Personally I believe it's a Nokia problem since other nokia phones work and this phone will connect and stay connected if you "unsync" your contacts.<br />
<br />
At this point, since i love the phone, I'm happy with just using the hands free connection in my car without any issues. I'm not a business person, so the speed dials work for me for calling. Hope this helps.<br />
<br />
I probably won't check back on this forum much, just felt obliged to help those who are having the same frustrating problem as I am. If you have any questions, just contact me.<br />

            Hi Alias,<br />
<br />
You can try using <strong><em>Set xlApp = CreateObject("Excel.Application")</em></strong> and see if it will work.
<br />
<br />
If the issue persists, please provide the following information:<br />
<br />
1. A screenshot about “ActiveX Component can't create object”.<br />
<br />
2. The detailed steps about how you performed to reproduce this issue.<br />
<br />
3. The version of your installed Office applications. To check it, open Excel, click File &gt; Account, and check the version under Office Updates. It should be like Version 1609 (Build xxxx.xxxx)<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />
Spike
